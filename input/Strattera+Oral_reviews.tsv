Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	khays, 35-44 Male  (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male	35-44	9/2/2012 9:19:20 PM	I am 43 years old and I began taking 80mg/day of Strattera for 7 years.  The primary difficulty of ADD I had trouble with was recalling facts when needed and concentrating while at work.  The begin the regimen 7 years ago with one 40mg for 3 days and then two 40mg from then on per day.  I have had many experiences with this drug and it requires very specific timing to avoid nearly all of the negative symptoms of taking it.  The primary issue is centered around eating prior taking it.  You must eat    a sufficient quantity of fat containing food immediately prior to dosage(2 Dunkin donuts work fine).  The worst issue with normal dosage is the trouble with urination which is alleviate by food intake.  During one instance where I accidentally took two daily dosages (160mg) about 30 minutes apart, the reaction was sudden and severe and lasted for aprox. 1.5 hours.  Severe heart pounding sometimes non-rhythmic which caused pain in the chest.  This effect was never again seen with normal dosage.  Until I realized the food intake issue, I took the 40mg dosage twice a day, now I take both at the same time.  I receive yearly full physicals and have no damaged organs so far; everything is normal...slightly elevated cholesterol from the donuts. About 12 hours after the dose, there always elevated sexual arousal, it works better than the the other stuff. :)  There is a somewhat pronounced effect if a day is skipped. This is a sudden minor depression that takes hold about 48 hours after the last dose.  May just me however, unknown if it might be treating a depression I don't know I have.  The specifics in time and strong effects would definitely keep me from allowing its use for my children if they were diagnosed.  It too easy to mess it up which I have done many times.  Other than that I would not be able to function at work without it.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Ya-ya, 7-12 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	4	3	4	Male	7-12	9/2/2012 1:05:48 PM	Our little boy has been taking Strattera for about 2 years, and is at the max dose for his age.  It has worked well for him, although he has never been a good eater, this has reduced his appetite.  He is only 52 pounds. He is small for his age though, also having mosiac DownSyndrome.  He will need to switch to another medication soon or add one, as he is having symptoms again of impulsivity and hyperactivity that is out of control, sort of like a ping pong ball in a full of cats and rocking chairs. I hope the next medication works as well as this one has....

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Deanna O,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	3	Male		7/31/2012 7:42:10 PM	My 11 year old son was diagnosed with ADD, I was completely against stimulant medication, after a lot of research on my part I asked the doctor if my son could try Strattera. Of course our insurance wouldnt cover it because they wanted us to try a stimulant first and I was upset at how expensive this medication is...but we tried it anyway.  My son had great results, his attention was 100 percent better.. his teachers noticed a difference his grades went up his reading (he is dyslexic) got better I was very happy, except he started losing weight over 6 monthes he lost @14 pounds and had no appetite! The doctor lowered the dose but he was still losing. He started at 92 lbs and by 78 we decided enough was enough and stopped the medication. it has taken him a month to start gaining weight and have a normal appetite.

This medication also makes me feel very zoned out. I've also felt tingles down my left leg and arm. I've stopped it now and hope the hives go away. I didn't even have the chance to see if it would work.

I am a 30-year old female with a history of alcoholism.  Ritalin, Concerta and Adderall were all prescribed to me as a teen and young adult.  This were, I would say &quot;successful&quot; medications for me.  Most clinicians I have encountered since I have undergone repeated treatments for alcohol addiction, however, are quite reluctant to treat my ADHD with these drugs (stimulants.)  Thus began the &quot;Strattera-Saga&quot; from hell.  In terms of help with ADHD, this medication was only marginally effective.  Most notable issue I had with it, however, was that this medication made me pee all the time.  Not only all the time, but without warning.  I couldn't go to the grocery store without abandoning my cart two or three times to go to the rest room.  I couldn't interact with people without having to dash off mid-conversation.  I was pissing my pants right and left.  No joke.  I brought this concern to my doctor(s) and was informed it was unrelated and that I should instead look into my diet, etc.  I adjusted my diet and liquid consumption.  Nothing changed.  I saw a urologist.  I had tests done.  Nothing.  I decided to go with what my gut was telling me and I quit this medication.  PISSING PROBLEM GONE!!!!!!!

Well I found out it was great for my arthritis pain!Now that I've stopped it I am in pain in all my joints.The Dr's say it shouldn&quot;t have anything  to with arthritis pain . ??  It does and that's why I continued to take it for four years. Now I have to stop because I am soooo hot all the time.

I had been on Riddalin since I was in 3rd grade (11-12 yrs), but the stimulants had adverse side affects as I got older.  I started Strattera one month ago and I was a little nervous after reading the other review by males between my ages.  I have thankfully not had any sexual side effects so far, with overall drive or ability to achieve an erection.  As for the effectiveness of the drug, I am better focused at work.  What I like to most about this drug though is that it doesn't make me feel like two different people.  I take it in the morning before work and I am able to be myself all through the day, whereas when I was on Riddalin, I was a whole different person (unsocial, nervous, anxious, uncomfortable).  As for making you urinate a lot, I do that a lot on my own (I drink lots of water) so that doesn't really bug me.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	ttusam, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	6/20/2012 9:26:14 AM	I started the medicine my junior year of High School and took it up until the end of my sophomore year of college. I started at 10mg and by the end, I worked my way up to 100mg. At first, the medication worked great. My grades rapidly increased, and I became a more organized person. Also, my family saw me as being more tollerant since I did not have the urge to speak out as much. However, after being on the meds for 3 years, it stopped working. Not only did they not help as much, I constantly felt terrible and unlike myself. I have always been known for being an &quot;up beat&quot; person, and before I knew it, I was &quot;down in the dumps.&quot; I soon stoped taking the medicine on my own. Since then, I have had to switch to a stimulant, which I have found is working much better. I did loose a LOT of weight while taking this medicine. In my opinion, this is a good short term aide. In my situation, my body quit responding the same way and a switch was very much needed. 
Other	J, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	6/19/2012 8:37:31 AM	I have been on this medication since it first hit the market with a large amount of success. I am 28 years old with Asperger's and it helps me with the concentration, focus, irritability, and several other factors associated with Asperger's. During the first 2-3 weeks, I did have a lack of appetite and little upset stomach, but I worked through it because the benefits in the first week out-weighed the risks that were happening. After the first 2-3 weeks, the side effects went away and I was basically back to normal with my appetite. Unlike many others, I have not experienced any sexual side effects. I also take Zoloft in conjunction with this in order to help control the depression since this can worsen it. When it comes to focusing in college, there is a definite change since I am able to hold my attention much longer than previously.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	5/10/2012 8:27:27 AM	My teen daughter started out on 10mg and worked her way up to 60mg and stayed on it for about a year.  Her concentration now is nonexsistent, she is depressed and unable to eat much during the whole day.  At first it was great but it wore off and maid it difficult for everyone at home to live with her.  Now that she's been off it for 2 weeks she is starting to eat again and her moods are better.  We still need help with sleeping and concentrating. Hopefully there is something else that can help her.

Started on Vyvance but my doctor decided that it raised my Bloop Pressure to much. then was switched to Welbutrin but that was no good and put me into a state of slight depression. Since starting Strattera I have noticed that my sexual drive is almost completely gone and when ever I work out I get horrible nausea and dizziness. seeing as I'm in school for fire fighting this is not good.

I've had ADHD all my life at 29 finally decided to get it treated.  So far  I have experienced insomnia if taken at night so i switched to days. I do get really tired around 2-3 in the afternoon. I have had a few hot flashes, chills, headache itchy eyes, and a foggy feeling. However- i am much calmer- mostly due that i am tired and in a fog. My doc wants to keep me on 40 mg for 1 month to give my body a chance to adjust. i will tell him to only increase it to 60mg- usually it's 80. I have a marathon on sunday- depending on how this medication effects my performance will be an indication if I continue...... however my impulsiveness is GONE! Really nice. My 5 year old also has ADHD, after playing with meds we tried strattera, i think i want to try intuniv first- i heard it was amazing for bad behaviors..... we can work on the attention ourselves.! Good luck!.

No side effects yet, started 18mg, currently 25 mg, then moving to 40mg, then finally 60 mg maximum. Needed improved concentration on reading and distractability so some improvement noticed already. Got off Wellbutrin since only side effect was chronic constipation which stopped after stopping Wellbutrin. Feel calm on Strattera and started on organizing my home in small chunks of time. Also on Celexa 20mg and Lamictal 300mg for bipolar mood swings. Will watch out for side effects but overall feel great so far and love that it's a non-stimulant which is important if you have bipolar disorder, just my experience but everyone is different, listen to your body.

She was recently taken off Abilify. It didn't seem to be doing much. I thought the anger outbursts were from coming off the Abilify.Seeing the other comments makes me feel this isn't the right drug for her either.

I stoped taking Strattera the second week because the side effects were not worth it. I called my dr. and told him so he is switching my medication. I had extreme light headedness, fatigue, head aches and restlessness. I will never take this again.

I came home last night and tried strattera sampler pack for the first time 18mg. At the same time i was extremely aroused to see my wife and had a great erection. I got up to get a glass of water and within the hour I took the stratter my erection was gone, and sexual desire was lost. Some sexual desire was lost, I had a painful ejaculation while my penis was limp. Stay away from this drug if you want a sex life.

It is NOT like Adderall where the effects are almost immediate.  My 15 yr old son has been on it 3 weeks since coming off Adderall XR 25 mg daily.  So far he says he feels ok and their are no shakey feeling or appetite loss.  Will watch for aggressiveness - but so far - so good.

The side effects more than outweigh the benefits. I'm 27 and in great physical shape. A month ago I could have sex 4-5 times in a row in one night. Now, having been on Strattera for 2 weeks, I can't even get an erection! I don't even care about the dizziness, shortness of breath, dehydration, or cottonmouth all day long. However, I won't give up my manhood! I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone; except maybe an enemy or someone that was trying to sleep with my girlfriend. This drug would make that impossible, unless that person fashioned some sort of device such as a splint or prosthetic tool, etc. Anyhow, if you feel like you want to try it and not use ANY of your equipment for a while, the remainder of my perscription will be in my trashcan out on the curb in the morning. Help yourself, good luck, and I offer my condolences to your significant other.

It starts from 25mg and goes to 80mg. My body weight is heaver than 147 lbs so I don't know if this medication will ever be effective.I get headaches, increased aggression and constipation. I am hoping this subsides as sometimes they do. My doctor says it takes a full month before seeing effectiveness so I'll update if anything changes. So far, the Vyvanse I am accustomed to taking should be increased since I already know it WORKS

When he take Straterra at bedtime, a couple of hours later he will get excruciating abdominal cramps. He took it recently the night before boarding a plane and the next morning, on the plane was practically doubled over with cramps. With each breath the pain was accentuated. He has been told to stop taking it until he can see his doctor. He has only been on Straterra one month.

Up til this spring all was well. Then I had a few incidents of sudden reaction and anger toward others. This week I saw a new doctor who said he has never prescribed strattera for adults( or any add med). And he added it can cause agitation as well as other symptoms I also experienced. However I notice others have has great success. I'm looking forward to visits with two other psyche doctors to look for other options.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	ck, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	4	3	Male	13-18	5/25/2011 2:25:54 AM	Mixed experiences:  My son started taking this medicine for ADD.  He started at 25 mg and was raised to 40 mg after a week.  Within 3 days, he started getting irritable within 1-2 hours of taking the med.  He was also on Depakote at the time due for depression/mood.  We quickly changed it back to 25 mg.  He was on that dose for 5 months and weened from the Depakote.  He did great for the 4 months on only 25 mg Strattera but lacked focus and motivation.  We tried again to increase the Strattera.   This time, the increase to 40 mg was great -- some improved concentration, no irritability, happy.  After 2 weeks, we increased to 60 mg to increase his motivation/focus. Within 30 minutes, he became extremely angry.  Because we educate him, he knew it was the new dose. He could not control his anger.  He could have become violent if he didn't force himself to remain alone and try to sleep.  By the next morning, he was fine again.  We discontinued Strattera and are now trying Intuniv.  If that doesn't work, we'll go back to a low dose of Strattera. While the low does didn't help his motivation or focus, it did help his frustration levels and impulsivity.  He doesn't react well to stimulants so not many options...

I am not satisfied with this medication at all. I'm taking 25 mg each morning, and no matter how much or what I eat, I feel terrible the entire rest of the day and it has yet to help my focus at all. I took one adderall at one point (unperscribed) and it helped me tremendously with no side effects besides a slightly supressed apetite, but my doc doesnt want me to be perscribed adderall because it's a controlled substance and all that jazz. I feel that maybe if I raise my dose of Strattera, it MIGHT work, but it will end up making me even more sick. I am not happy with this drug at all.

CAUTION: When I stopped taking, had SUICIDAL ideation.  Minimal physical side effects.  When taking Stratrera, I felt less joyful; more in control and more effective, but less able to relish life.  
Other	zippyslipdisk, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	5/7/2011 8:36:07 PM	I have taken many medications in my life. Without a doubt this is the worst drug I've ever taken. I only took 3 pills (1 a day) and I felt side effects for months afterward. I never thought that would be possible. I literally felt like I was insane when I was on this. The worst for me were the strong sadness feeling even when I wasn't really sad at all. It's like Strattera pushes emotional buttons in your brain. Other side effects include random goosebumps coming over me with cold and hot sensations over my body, and going back and forth from feeling hyper to exhausted. I feel sorry for the kids who get put on this stuff who don't know how to describe to their parents or doctors how horrible it is. Just because your child is behaving better in class or isn't talking back like he used to doesn't mean it's doing a good thing. You're only seeing 1 half of it, without taking into consideration what the person is actually feeling. Take it from me, it's hell, and I could only last 3 days of it. This medication is a failed experiment, and it's my opinion that it should be taken off the market.

I have noticed major anger outburts that he never had before, he constantly complains of a belly ache and has next to NO appetite at all.  Not to mention the medication doesn't work at all, he is still getting N's in reading and struggling with his behavior on a daily basis at school.  Time to switch!!! Gonna try Daytrana next!

Prior to that had taken 3 different stimulants.  It has been very effective in treating his symptoms with no noticeable side effects.  He is now 16 and we are going to try taking him off the meds to see how things go.  Overall - Strattera was a life saver!  Stimulants had too many bad side effects, this medication worked wonders for our son!

Starting out working very well for first six weeks then created severe anger and aggression in son.  Through some trial and error with meds, 90% certain Strattera was cause, only releif came when we discontinued meds.  Now trying Intuniv before moving to stimulants.  Hope it works for your child, didn't for ours after a promising start.  Be aware of the possibility that in 2nd or 3rd month it may cause severe anger problems.

I have been experiencing increased sweating, constipation, and an unusal number of headaches, (unsure if the headaches are related). But I do feel strongly that this medication has improved my ability to concentrate. It has not thankfully effected my mental illness in anyway. That I have noticed. I have been irratiable but that is somewhat common in my overall experience with my mental health. I think this is a great choice for me due to the lack of dependency this medication provides.

It Just gave me a little more energy. Then my therapist prescribed Strattera, as well. I still haven't  noticed anything different. I am wondering if I should go off both the drugs. I forgot to take them for 3 days once and I was so exhausted. The withdrawals of fatigue were terrible. I am still no more motivated or organized than I was before. I don't know what to take for my ADD/Depression that is a non-stimulant. I just want my mood to improve and I want to have more focus and energy, so that I can manage my home and family. Any suggestions?

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male		11/9/2010 7:09:44 PM	What a worthless adhd drug.  The doctor was too intimidated to refill my 1 month prescription of Ritalin because it was a stimulant so he prescribed this &quot;sugar pill&quot;. What a waste, this seems more like an adhd potentiator; made me more tired depressed un-motivated and bad dreams.  Just get Ritalin or its derivatives or Vyvanse if your doctor will actually do his job and prescribe it.

She started having hallucinations, anger issues, crying etc.  spoke to the doctor was told it was not the drug.  then she started having raynauds symptoms, which they now have started saying on the warnings that could be a side effect.  from that she is now under investigation for lupus, low white blood cell, positive AnA etc. along with other side effects that I have managed to find on other web sites that the doctors don't know about or don't tell you.  she is now in grade 9.  all of the other effects were just discovered in the last year and a half.  ironically the doctor that prescribed it also had another case with the same symptoms while on straterra.  My daughter is scheduled to go back to Sick Kids next month.  The doctor that prescribed it stated&quot; We only go by what the drug rep tells us, I guess I should check this out a little more before I continue handing theis out.  Be very careful when using this drug and whatever you see or your child tells you how they feel, check it out and check again

Other	jr, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	9/28/2010 4:39:04 PM	I was diagnosed with ADD at 63.  Wonderful to now know what was wrong with me all those years.  Also depression which is suspected to be secondary effect of unresolved ADD.  Have been taking SSRI's for many years but not having consistent results so Strattera was added about 30 days ago.  Have been ramping up the dosage to current 80mg per day.  Initially, some GI upset which could be mitigaged with food.  Also, some tingling in extremeties, especially hands but that seems to have passed.  Mood swings have been an issue as well and occasionally will have &quot;one of those days&quot; where it does not seem like any of the medications are working.  Trying to do some Mindfulness training as well to combat the worst of the ruminating.  If this combo does not work I will be disappointed.  Tired of being a sorry ass old man. Some concern about liver abnormalities but will continue with yearly checkup to monitor.  My daughter (17) takes Focalin which seems to work for her.

I had to cut back on the dosage as I get waves of nausea after taking it and was also suffering from severe constipation.  Now I take a combination of meds to treat my ADD.

Anger issues were always a problem before, but Strattera increased the explosive behavior in ways that were atypical for him. When I talked with the prescribing doctor about the symptoms, she insisted the meds would never cause this... even though it was listed as a possible side effect in many credible articles. And she was very condescending about my concern. After taking him off the meds and switching to another doctor (who had actually been part of Strattera's medical eval group), we learned that yes, this was possible, as the meds can possibly interfere with control and inhibitions for some patients. Very thankful we pursued credible help.

I have also been taking wellbutrin 300xl. My mood seems a little better but I don't feel like it has helped with my focus and attention. I still zone out in conversations and I still interrupt people because I loose interest in the conversation. Sometimes I am not even aware I do this til its too late. I haven't had many side effects, I have been waking a lot in the middle of the night. I am going to try to stagger the pills, one in the morning and one late in the afternoon. See if this helps. Unfortunately it hasn't effected my appetite in a good way. Actually it has made me crave sweets even more. I haven't lost any weight or suppressed my appetite like other people have said. How long do I wait til it kicks in?
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Struggling in college with $80k in loans, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	19-24	7/29/2010 9:04:08 PM	I used this drug in 2003, at 40mg then 60mg. My grades in the summer time went from c's and d's to all A's. However I was extremely cold in the winter time, I would avoid leaving the house if I could. My hands, feet, arms, legs would be terribly cold outside. While on it I preferred very warm weather. Also trying to urinate while on this drug was like trying to squeeze a watermelon through a straw. It took an embarrasingly long time just to pee. The sexual side effects were terrible as well. During intercourse I could not get any blood flow down there regardless of how hard I tried. I did get alot of attention from girls, I worked out 3 times a day and ate very healthy. I was a monster of concious decision. But when it came to sex, or urinating I was left high and dry. Once I drank 18 beers without using the bathroom once. I was not a big drinker before that and I did not black out either. I was extremely confused as to how I managed not to pee the entire night. I went off the drug in 2004 because of the sexual side effects. I went back on the drug in 2006 only this time I was aware that I was wetting the bed, and still could not empty my bladder or get an erection while on the drug. It was extremly frustrating, however it did cure my ADD and made me feel very good. Sorry Eli Lilly I liked Strattera, but I need my wiener to work when I want it to.

After a week on this drug, he started having mood swings and anger management problems. By the end of the month he had a full blown episode. I discontinued the drug and presto, no more issues.  After discussing ADD with another mother, I discovered her son also had major anger issues while on this medication - that also resolved upon cessation. Monitor carefully.

The first time at age 10 - 11, she complained that the medicine was making her vomit and she felt terrible for the rest of the day. There was no difference noticed by either the teachers or her family. The second time at age 12, we had to deal with a child that would scream, throw things and become violent. We were pulling our hair out dealing with her and most of the time someone would get hurt, usually the adults trying to restrain her. I have had bruises on my arms and my legs because of her extreme mood swings,it was like a light switch. She then started to tell us she hated herself and wanted to die. She went so far as to threaten other members of the family. This is a child that is loving, caring not what we have dealt with for 3 months now. We even spent 8 hours in the ER because of suicidal thoughts. We began to notice that the days that she refused to take it, we didn't have such an angry child. We decided that she will no longer take Strattera. The doctor will have to find something else. As for her grades, she is now failing before she was making As and Bs,

I am 47 today and have been sturggling to figure out my &quot;problem&quot; since high school. Depression and anxiety ensued which combined with the ADD symptoms greatly effected productivity and my relationship with my wife and kids. I had heard of Strattera severla years ago but didn't want to take drugs to offset what was maybe &quot;just the way I am.&quot; But, I was getting desperate to find an answer, and get rid of the &quot;fog.&quot; So, I started Strattera in March and saw instant positive results. I have read 6 books in 8 weeks with excellent comprehension. I think before I speak and listen better when in a conversation. Most of all I feel hopeful about the future. I am no longer depressed on so worried about things. I have had some minor side effects but they seem to come and go. My biggest concern is sleep. I was having trouble sleeping anyway, so I don't know if I can blame Strattera for this. I am very tired this week, but am still able to get things done. I do not want ot back on Lunesta, so I am trying to improve sleep naturally. Any suggestions would be appreciated! I also would say I have not been dramatically for productive yet at work. I think that part is up to me... overcoming bad habits from yeasr of compensating.Don't give up on finding an answer... I know this stuff doesn't work for everyone but it can't hurt to try it. You can quit cold turkey with no effects if you don't like it. I wish I had taken this in 05'.Good Luck!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/12/2010 9:40:50 AM	I would not recommend this drug to anyone. Ever. My doctor prescribed it because of the non stimulant/non addictive &quot;benefit&quot;. I was on this for one week. I could feel side effects after one day..I felt sad, tired and so unmotivated. My muscles hurt and I was cold all the time like I had the flu. I thought this would all go away eventually. By day 6 all I wanted to do was lay in bed and cry. I cried all day about everything. I hated myself, thought everyone was against me and saw and heard things that weren't there. By day 7 I wanted to die..literally die. If my boyfriend was not around to talk some sense into me who knows what would have happened? It was the worst week of my life and I have never been a depressed person..quite the opposite!! I called my doctor the next day and said take me off of this!! I am 29 years old and she had me on 40mg..I have now started adderall 5mg and besides a little nausea it is working great!! Please don't ever consider this drug..it makes you manic and wanting to die..

The stomach upset was bad enough, but the mood swings really got me. I don't see the point of making myself feel this way; I would rather misplace things and leave tasks unfinished than feel the way this drug made me feel. Everything was sooo upsetting!

Her doctor recommended Strattera for ADD and we tried it.  She started showing signs of staring episodes after 2 weeks of taking the medication.  We stopped giving it to her after 3 weeks and the day after she completely stopped taking it, she started having clinical seizures.  We have increased her anti-seizure medication to its maximum dose and she is still experiencing seizures.  Please be careful if your doctor recommends Strattera if you have epilepsy or a history of seizures.

After about an hour, I get extremely drowsy and can't stop yawning, and I almost feel like I am in a fog. I like that it is non-addictive because I am a recovering drug addict, but the side affects are starting to outweigh the benefits. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/13/2010 6:54:58 PM	I was diagnosed with ADD in my early 20s (I had no hyperactivity however; daily tasks like listening to lectures in college, watching movies, etc. were no longer enough to hold my attention. I always needed to be &quot;multi-tasking&quot; like watching a movie and doing a cross word). Since starting Strattera I have had great improvement in my ability to focus and take care of the tasks at hand.  I no longer procrastinate or get lost in my train of thought.  I did find that I need to take the pill either right before bed, or take it with a full meal.  In these two situation I experience no side-effects like nausea or dizziness. When I moved out of state my new physician had me try to manage my ADD with diet and various focussing techniques but neither worked for me.  After 2 years I got back on Strattera and have been so thankful for this drug.  I can honestly say it has changed my life for the better.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/12/2010 4:44:28 PM	This medication had done a grest thing for me.  I have noticed, after 5 yrs of taking this medication, I am extreamely irtritable when I take this medication.  I only take it when Im working, so I noticed this on the days I dont take it.  Also, on the days I dont take this med; all the ADHD symtoms are right back, unti I take the medication again.  I get bad nausea, still, even after over 5yrs.  I have to take it with my heaviest meal, in order to avoid this.  weight loss, was good to me...I was morbidly obiese...and it helped to control my appitite, alot. after I take this medication, i am full for hours....i had to remember to eat!  I have to take this medication after I wake up, it dose make me very tired, but only for about 4 hrs, then im wide awake and focused! It dose its job, and im happy. 
Other	nj mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	4/8/2010 9:53:16 PM	My 9 year old daughter had been on Strattera for almost 2 years for ADHD. Strattera was chosen because she in not hyperactive and falling asleep is nearly impossible for her to do. We started on 25mg at first and we noticed some improvement in school and sleeping was a little better. She has behavior and anger problems at home so after 8 or so months later we upped the dose to 28mg. She became very subdued and actually slept too much. It was hard for her to get up in the morning for school and on the weekends she slept until 10am which was unheard of. I knew the dose was too strong. We went back down to 25mg and she returned to her &quot;normal&quot; sleep habits. Recently she has been extremely aggressive and was sleeping less and less. Who wouldn't go crazy from the exhaustion? Because she has grown normally and gained weight since the last dosage we decided to up the dose to 30mg. That was 2 months ago and she is sleeping better and haven't had to give her a supplement of Melatonin to get her to sleep in over a month. She still has behavior problems and I will be contacting the schools counselor to get some insight on that. Nothing I say seems to sink in. Maybe a therapist will help. My kid's asleep- how about yours?
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	MeganB, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	4/8/2010 10:43:27 AM	As soon as i swallowed the pill(25 ml), i felt myself more focused and able to concentrate and just better overall. Within an hour, i felt mood swings, chills, agitated,loaded, shortness of breath,violent thoughts, i guess it just depends on you and your reaction. Very unsure if this is a good adhd medicine.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	mommanelly, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	3-6	4/8/2010 9:21:24 AM	My 5 year old son has been on this for a little over a year.  It does have a the side affect of aggression.  We actually split my son's dose and give it to him twice a day instead of a large dose all at once.  This has helped that side affect dramatically.  He is no longer as aggressive and doesn't seem to want to wrestle his brother down as much.  He also doesn't get as angry and have as many mood swings.  Strattera is not for everyone, but has been working wonders for him.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	shortcomings, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	35-44	4/7/2010 8:03:09 PM	My new doctor prescribed Straterra because it was a non-controlled substance. He started me on 80 MG and I'm still at that dose two months later. I became very aggressive and angry the first few days and then that eased off. This medication helps me focus a little, but delays my thought processes (i.e. can't think of a word, slow to remember certain simple things, etc). It does not work as well as when I was on 60 MG of Focalin a few years ago. That medication helped tremendously. My prescription expired and my doctor moved away, and have had a more than difficult time being prescribed Focalin again. I went to talk to my doctor about the physical side-effects of Straterra (Slow thought processes, inability to urinate, semen in the urine, etc). He told me I needed to see a psychiatrist as he implied I was making up the side effect stories. Needless to say, I fired him and am without a doctor. For me, Focalin does a much better job helping me focus and the side effects are non-existent. 
Other	momof2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/5/2010 1:26:12 PM	My 12 yr old son was diagnosed with ADD (no hyper) and has been taking Strattera for 10 mos, started with 10mg building up to 60mg. It took a 1 full week after building to the 60mg to see the affects.  He went from almost failing 5th grade to being on the honor roll ever trimester in middle school.  This has been a wonder drug for our family, he is starting to build his confidence up.  Recently his Dr. added 10mg of Celexa, to help with the depression/axienty related to ADD - this has also helped.  I was very opposed to using drugs for treatment, but I realized that i was being selfish and my son wanted to try something - anything to help him - he felt different.  I am so glad I opened my mind.  We are very lucky, no side effects.  Someone mentioned the hot ears, but my son has had those for many years, maybe they come on a a side effect of ADD? No one has ever been able to explain that to us either and I've tried researching the internet as well.  I would recommend this drug for ADD, but as with anything trust your instincts and don't setlle.  If it's not right for you, speak up!  
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	TD, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	19-24	3/31/2010 10:50:20 PM	I am 21 years old and was diagnosed with add about one month ago. I have areal hard time staying focused, geting things done, and concentrating. I am also restless all of the time, and have been my whole life. My docter perscribed me 80mg of strattera. It made me feel sick, tired, and extremely drugged. I thought that the side effects would go away after about 3 weeks, insted I only seemed to feel tired all the time, and seemed to feel bad about myself, and sad. I have never felt like that before and stopped taking the medicine. My doc said he wanted me to try this because I made it through life this far without stimulants. I am very dissatisfied with this drug and would never recomend it to anyone. I have another appointment coming up next week, and look forward to trying something else. I wonder if anyone else has had these problems please reply.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	KB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	3/15/2010 2:53:55 PM	I started off with a 40 mg dose and found it to be helpful and felt things could be better so they prescribed 60mg. While I was on 40mg I had no appetite and was in a better mood on. While on 60 mg I wanted to eat everything in sight and still was in a rather good mood. When they put me on 80mg and again I lost my appetite and I was easily irritated. I felt it did help me but I felt like it wasn't doing enough for me. What was the most surprising to me was how long it takes to go off of the medicine. They cut my dose in half and I became very emotional but that subsided within a week. All together it will take about 6 weeks to get completely off the medication.

After being told by my pharmacist that I had strep throat and my primary MD that I had a virus, also... add on many other symptoms; I looked it up on webmd and found I had over half of the side affects this drug offered. I have been so sick for almost a month and only had hopes that this was going to work for me, being diagnosed so late in life, I wanted to believe. I would like to know how many time we are started on scary drugs according to the insurance we have to hit or miss, because who cares if a month of our lives plus the however many days or weeks it takes to get it out of our systems. Am I the only one on State funded medical that feels that way? Is this a bottom of the line drug?
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	1/26/2010 12:48:13 AM	22 Year old male, had bad grades through grade school and through the first part of college. I was not organized, slurred, and stuttered my speech, blow things out of portion. Then one day i was in a college class and i was having so munch trouble in the class that i felt like i was going to hit the teacher and that is when i realized that i need to see my doctor and get something done. Well i went and saw him and he told me he would get me going on Strattera starting out small just 20mg no bout 2 years later i am up to 60mg. Within 2 weeks i notice a difference i was getting everything done, i could organized things, and the greatest thing was that my grades went from D and F'S to C's and B's. So i have had a huge improvement, the only side effect that i have is that if  get off of it for a while then get back on i get a headache and thats it.

I immediately started having severe abdominal pain - so severe I had to go to the hospital. I lowered both drugs and the pain decreased but was still prevalent. Further, my desire for sex was almost non-existent with this drug. Not something I'm okay with. I would get dizzy if I got up too quickly and my blood pressure increased drastically. Side effects aside, the drug worked very well in controlling my ADHD symptoms but at the end of the day, the side effects outweighed the benefits.

I notice a difference in my focusing ability and attention. That's much better. I do have to put up with headaches, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. I am not diagnosed as having ADHD, but I have very similar symptoms, and my doctor decided to try me on it. I want to change medications, though, because I had to pay $75 out of pocket for it for a one month supply. That's WITH insurance!! A little too expensive for me. Overall, I'm satisfied with how it works but would like the cost to go down and side effects dissipate.

BUT it gave me blurred vision, crawly scalp, brain fog, my hands, back and feet broke out in pin-point like bumps under my skin-weird? I woke up every morning sick at my stomach.  I started this med at 30mg for 1 week and went to 60mg.  I quit taking it after 2 weeks and my doctor recommended I give it another try at 40mg.  I just could not take this med and feel good physically.  Wished it would have worked for me.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	photogirl123, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	1/4/2010 10:00:34 AM	I am a 45 year old female, recently diagnosed with ADHD, which I knew I had my whole life.  I have often felt paralyzed and overwhelmed with so many things to do and can't stay on one task.  I am opening a photography studio soon and am fearing failure due to my lack of organization.  Strattera is the third med I have tried.  Although it has calmed we way down, I feel I am too tired and not ambitous at all!  I have quit working out (which I have always loved) and am falling asleep hours earlier.  Not exactly the &quot;get it all done&quot; med I was looking for.  Strange chills and headaches also.  But more importantly, what the heck are you parents thinking putting your young children on these extremely altering drugs??!!! I'll bet the majority of you haven't tried them yourself for weeks at a time.  It's down right abuse.  I promise you this.  My son did not start on ADHD med until age 21. It was his choice.  He is doing much better in College now, but the thought of putting my child on meds in grade school is stomach turning.  I watched my nephew fall out of chairs he was so drugged by his mother.  Drug after drug he was forced to take from age 5 till 18 when he went to college and said no more!  He has told his parents he hates them for ruining his life.  He was never allowed to be the child he was created by God to be. He will never forgive them for this.  Please find other ways to help your children do better in school!!  These drugs are mind altering..I get it now!  Remember that very few children were drugged when we were growing up,  the hyper ones were the funny one's, and have grown into very successful adults.  These are the creative genious'!  the great writers, painters, photographers, and inventors.  DO YOUR RESEARCH..and pop all the pills yourself and ask yourself if this is how you want your 8 year old to feel. Thank you for spending time reading this review.  If I can save even one child from this horror it was worth my time to share it.

I have been diagnoised since I was 5, back in 1983.  At that time the doctor I was seeing wasn't that well know, when he retired about 15 years later, he was nationally know with appearances on Oprah.I am not sure about Strattera, it's OK, but nothing like a basic 10 MG pill of Ritilan.  Harder to sleep on Strattera, than Ritilan, and if you work two jobs that can be an issue, or if you have kids.Either way, this stuff is one of those types where you need time.Time isn't always available for some, as described above...I find myself getting maybe 3 hours of sleep in a 48 hr time frame when taking this stuff...I'll keep trying and see if there is any blood level changes or kidney changes before calling it a day and switching back to what works for me.

I become constipated, didn't sleep for 8 days in a row and found no joy in anything.  Now I am taking nothing but will be trying vyvanse next.  I found no increaded cognitive skills, attention or motivation (acttually experienced less).  It was also very expensive and I had no insurance ($175/month) so my Dr. gave me samples.

Used to take dexedrine as a child (never as an adult).  Not sure what it is doing for my inattention and hyperfocus, but I do notice that I am not as emotional as I was in the past.  I can tell the difference in impulsivity when I miss a couple of doses (it isn't a cheap drug), but really nothing else.  I'm halfway through the 30 days of the highest dose and I feel different, a little better but not at the point where I want to be.  I tried other non drug ways to help with my ADHD, and I still do those along with the strattera.  I think that is important.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	19-24	11/23/2009 6:16:12 PM	I was prescribed Strattera by my doctor for ADD and I feel as though this drug helped me in a lot of ways, being more on top of things and not losing my train of thought. I also noticed that it seemed to make me hyperactive. I am a very mellow person with a mild case of ADD and Strattera made me go a 100mph. I sort of felt like a caffeine rush for 5 days straight. Another strange side effect that I found was a lack of desire for sex, and difficulty in achieving an erection. I am going to try some other medications and see if the same symptoms occur. Has anyone else had these issues?

I had a problem focusing once menopause went into high gear. I can now focus very well on a 40 mg dose. I have been on paroxetine since peri menopause began for anxiety. The two drugs seem to work well in the doses I consume; however, the sleep deprivation is annoying when it's at it's peak. Not on Strattera and/or the paroxetine, I bounce off the walls and cry a lot.  It's worth it to me to be consistent. Strattera did not curb my appetite as it does for some people.

I have been on Strattera for about one year now and have had great results on a half dose (60mg).  I found that 80mg+ made me sick (vomiting, dizzy, etc) but the lower dose was just enough to help me get control and focus.  I definitely recommend this medication.  You have to learn your personal reactions such as when and how much to eat when taking your dosage.  Once you get that down, the rest is much easier.  Routine is key.My work performance went from Very Poor (no focus, bad follow-through) to Excellent (always reliable, good project management) and I attribute this 100% to being on Strattera.  It helped me gain back control of my mental capabilities and perform at my best.  All I needed was a little help focusing.Very satisfied with the product, aside from the occasional side effects(due to interruption of routine).

Strattera also had the pleasant side-effect of helping me to lose wait by curbing my appetite and helping me to resist snacking!

I have only been on this medication for 1 month, but I want to know - is this what life is like for other people?  Can life truly be this effortless?  Gone are the constant extraneous thoughts.  I can listen to people all the way through a whole sentence, and feel much more connected to the world.  As far as side effects go, the first couple of days I had a headache,  and I can't seem to sleep longer than six hours, but who cares!!!  Life awaits!

Took Strattera for the 1st time last night; one 25mg cap. @ 10pm.  2 hrs later had trouble urinating - the flow wouldn't start or I'd get a reluctant trickle despite a full bladder.  Went back to sleep at 12am; awoke at 3am w/ a hot flash and chills, plus more peeing trouble. At 7am, woke up with all of the above plus dizziness.  Now it is 9pm (almost 24 hours later) and all symptoms remain.  Won't be taking another!

His doctor recommended Strattera because it is a &quot;milder&quot; medication.  On his first day he felt very, very sleepy to the point where his teacher had to let him sleep for an hour.  He was silly and not following rules.  
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	13-18	9/3/2009 12:54:34 AM	I'm a senior in high school and I've been taking strattera for about 5 years now. There were times when I experienced some of the side effects listed on the bottle, but really they didn't hinder my daily activities. I started with 40 mg and now I'm taking 80 mg a day so you have to keep track of the dosage if you take it for more than... at least a year. And now, I CANNOT go anywhere without it, I absolutely love strattera. I get my work done, I'm focused, and, above all, I can be me and still function as a normal human being. I strongly recommend strattera for those who've struggled with adhd as I have, the first few months takes some getting used to but you'll adapt in no time.

She has recently tried ritalin and dexmetamphetamine the stimulant drugs. She had bad side effects on both but none on strattera. She Started on 25mg for 1 week then 50mg 2nd week. Now 60mg 3 weeks later. She is focusing better now.It agrees with my daughter and  she only takes one tablet in the morning with food. Fantastic.

This seemed to help some with the ADD, but I noticed that I was short of breath and my heart was racing. The doctor did an EKG test and said my heart was fine, so I switched to Ritalin which is working much better. This also tastes HORRIBLE if you happen to break open the capsul in your mouth.

I am using this for people researching the idea of trying this med. Be aware that without insurance, a 25mg (starter dose, 30 day supply) costs $185 in TN.  The 40mg dose increases in cost.  The cost alone is my deciding factor to not use this medication.

After 2 months on Strattera he became depressed, angry, emotional fits, said he wished he had never been born!  Grades improved but it wasn't worth it to see him like this. Stopped the drug at the end of the school year.  Guess we'll live with the bad grades!

I have 2 small kids and I can't stand the way I'm feeling towards them over the simplest things. I've read that some others feel this way too. I'm thinking it has to be the strattera, because I don't normally feel this angry all the time. I even get unusually upset with my husband and really just anyone who crosses my path. Anyone else having this extreme reaction within first 2 wks?

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	19-24	6/19/2009 2:32:40 PM	I began taking this drug for adult ADD. I've found that I never feel tired and my heart is racing when I lay down at night.  Despite this I've managed to sleep 12-13 hours per night and need a 3 hr. nap in the afternoon because I don't feel like doing anything. After a few weeks I began having some ED problems, and hoped they'd decrease but given more time the sexual problems become worse. Being a 21 yr. male this is an unacceptable side effect.I'm not sure if it helped me focus at all or it was just a placebo effect.  I'm calling my Dr. to change medications.  I was very hopeful that this would work since I also have bipolar disorder and stimulant based medications are more likely to cause problems related to that.

Doctor started me out of the gate at 40 mg.   I've had some fatigue and the oddest sensations like shivers on occasion.  I don't have headaches or stomach aches.   I def. already have increased focus but sometimes I find I'm &quot;over focused&quot; and I zone completely and just stare.  I have hope this will get better as I adjust over time.   It's already helped me not be so fidgety and nervous around others as my mind used to race a million miles a minute while someone was speaking to me.  It also appears to help with the impulse eating I used to do when the task I was working on became complicated.

It heightened my ability to concentrate, began to stabalize my thoughts as in they weren't running together as fast, but did cause a bit of grogginess until my body got used to the dosage.

But the lasting side effects were extreme tiredness and MAYJOR irritability. it turned me into a raging sycho and a blubbering baby. it's supposed to help with concentration, but not for me. it did the absolute opposite of what i was expecting. this is only after 3 days of taking this. i called the doc and she told me to stay on it to give it time to react. but i couldn't. i was ready to commit myself to a psyc ward. the day i stopped the meds i started feeling better. it took a few days for the meds to exit my system, but i'm back to my old self again. the only problem now is that i still have concentration problems and still feel like a pinball machine. hopefully the doc will find something that DOES work cuz this crap didn't

I was always satisfied with my mediocre performance in school.  However my professional life was really starting to suffer. The meds seemed to have me in a concentration zone.  I was able to work without any distracting thoughts.  However the side effects were horrible.  The first day I started the meds I noticed I had difficulty fully evacuating my bladder.  I then begain to have pain in my testicles.  The odd symptoms went away immediatly after stopping the meds.  I tried them again a year later and the same thing happens.  The doc. says they will subside after my body gets used to taking the meds.  That's easy for him to say.  I am done.  I'll try something else.

I took it for a while, and had some improvement in concentration, but I may as well have taken a sugar pill and expect the same thing.On the plus side, I did not experience any side effects, but I can't see how this competes with stimulants because it just didn't work with me.

For the last 3 weeks I feel like my throught is closing up. it comes and goes but seems to be more frequent now. I googled, clinical trials for strattera, and side affects. I read that &quot;angioneurotic edema&quot; is one. I looked that up and it says can cause death.It sounds like some of my syptoms. I don't know if I am over reacting. I also have a rash...

Other	Momof3kidzz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/31/2009 1:50:25 PM	I submitted a post in February.  Shortly after that, within a 2 week period, my son had 3 seizure like &quot;episodes&quot; where something very small would set him off into a rage.  He would find anything hard to hit himself, a chair - anything.  One happened at home; the other two at school.  His eyes would roll all around; they would be glazed; he wouldn't speak to me.  Afterwards, he would get up as if nothing happened.  I almost called the squad it got so bad.  His teachers and students at school were terrified both times it happened there.  I tried calling our family doctor after it happened the first time.  His nurse blew me off and told me he was booked for 6 weeks.  I gave it time but after it happened 2 more times within a couple of days, I tried calling his office again.  Again, the nurse gave me the same song and dance.  I tried paging him later that evening.  No return call.  The very next morning I called a pediatrician my brother uses.  They got my son right in.  This doctor does not support the use of this medication for children - period.  This medication caused my son's temper to be 1,000 times worse.  His ears would also get hot and red; that has also stopped.  The problem is; these doctors don't know what the side effects are.  Our children are way too precious to put them through this.  We only had him on 25 mg per day.  I feel horrible for having him on it all.  We know our children better than anyone.  I urge anyone who is considering this medication NOT to use it.  I understand that there are children that really do need help out there.  But, for the kids that just won't sit still - come on.  The teachers need to do their jobs, too.  They need to realize all kids aren't cookie cutter kids.  They need to be challenged so they will pay attention and stay focused and on task.  I urge parents not to use this medication.

He took it for 2 weeks and then the insurance company refused to cover the cost for this drug.  The doctor then put him on Vyvanse.  After 2 days on Vyvanse he got a severe allergic reacton (rash on backside) and was told to stop taking by doctor.  However, over the next few days my grandson is having &quot;bad&quot; thoughts and saying things about how he wants to hurt himself.  The doctor says the drugs only stay in his system for 12 hours.  I totally disagree, and believe these drugs, especially the Strattera, are causing these symptoms.  I want to find out how long these drugs actually stay in the body.We have decided not to put him on any medication and am taking him to a behavorial therapist instead.

He was long ago diagnosed w/ADD, no hyperactivity.  I tried everything to stay away from medications, but now at 13 he is not excelling at school, he is more argumentative at home, poor self esteem from a lack of success in school, and generally hard to deal with.  We have started at 25 mg for one week, now on 40mg with the ultimate doseage per doctor stopping at 60mg.  So far no changes, but I know you need to be on the drug for 4 weeks.  Side effect according to my son is he feels like he is having a hard time getting his words out, stuttering? Not all the time, but sometimes.  I worry that maybe we should stop at 40 and see what results we get from that.  Any feedback on the doseage and/or that specific side effect? I hate medication, but I feel like he deserves an opportunity to experience success in life, and won't achieve w/out.

I couldn't afford to constantly go to my Applied Kinesiologist to get my adrenal glands &quot;fixed&quot; and keep buying the nutritional supplements to feed my adrenal glands (which worked, but were expensive and weren't covered by insurance).So, I tried Strattera. After the medication had the opportunity to build-up in my metabolism (about 6-8 weeks vs. an instant reaction with stimulant-based drugs), Strattera worked perfectly and better than ANYTHING else! No &quot;type A&quot; personality traits caused by the stimulant-based drugs.But, it enlarged my prostate and caused all night erections. If you've seen any of those erectile disfunction disorder commercials, you'll know that having an erection for longer than 4 hours is some sort of medical emergency. So... I had to stop taking it. We tried other non-stimulant drugs (like certain anti-depressants known to have an effect on ADD symptoms), but they didn't work nearly as well as the stimulants.

My body was still always in motion so I was put on Strattra with my 60mg of Cymbaltia.  Strattra- Started out on25mg in am for 1wk. 40mg for 1wk. and then 60mg.  Half way through that week I hated everything and everybody! Very irritable, hostile, and angry. I called my Dr. right away and went down to 25mg.I have the following side effects but they are lessening everyday. Decreased appetite but gaining weight, dry mouth, urinating less, and my head itches. It has slowed me down, I seem more relaxed but not sure about being more focused. I am going to keep going and hope to become more focused.  I did noticed in review I read that it doesn't continue to work for very. BUMMER.

He takes it in the morning before school at about 7am, has breakfast. by 8:30 he starts to feel a little sick- nauseau/tummy ache and then it wears off. Sometimes the tummy ache gets really bad and I have to take him home. According to his teachers he is able to focus a lot better. He has become very aggressive especially at school. He crys and gets very emotionally. This is a step up from the way he was before. He had a very bad urinary infection 2 months ago. His pediatrician was very concerned about his kidney but it was fine. They don't believe its because of the strattera. By the time he gets home from school he is out cold. So exhausting.

I fought teachers for years and finally gave in this year.  It has helped a little bit.  The main side effect we have noticed is that his ears get very hot in the evenings.  Sometimes; just one ear; sometimes both ears.  Just the outside of them.  This medicine has actually helped his headaches; which he used to get quite frequently.  I think this has helped his headaches more than anything else.  He also doesn't like to swallow pills so I have to open the pill and put it in pudding every night.  He takes 25 mg per day.  I am worried when I read other reviews; especially about keeping him on this a long time.  I was wondering if anyone that reads this has had problems with the hot ears; my doctor said this is not a side effect.

I basically feel like I was robbed out of 1 1/2 of my life but I kept taking it because my doc wouldn't change it to another med. When I was taking it I had a rash, my skin felt like it was crawling, I was severely nauseous(all of the time) and had horrible side effects coming off of it. Not to mention I feel like it made me crazy and I would cry a lot. I do not recommend this drug for anyone.

The only negative is that I decided to try life without it and had withdrawl-type symptoms that were not expected.  (stomach pain, anxiety, sweating)  These symptoms ended within 45 minutes of taking the medication.

She is on 60mg and what a HUGE difference! Her moods, her grades, her concentration, ability to take multiple pieces of information without feeling overwhelmed, no anxiety or depression, first time on honor roll in years!  Although her heart rate is higher than what they're comfortable with.  They tried lowering it to 40mg but it was very ineffective.  Her moods came back, anxiety, overwhelmed, teachers and others noticed.  She is since back on 60mg but we are eliminating other stimulants with caffeine (pop, tea, chocolate, etc.). Her cardiologist wants it lowered, her doctor wants it at 60mg.  Torn with what to do.  I think we will just continue to monitor the heartrate for a while.  All tests, including ECHO show the heart is in great shape, just beating higher during the day than what is normal.  Even she wanted to be on the higher dose because of the difficulty at 40mg.  What to do??  Strattera has been wonderful for her.  I have my daughter back again!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Parent,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male		2/21/2009 1:39:35 PM	My 10 yr old son has been on and off various medications the last couple of yrs to treat ADD,the last being Metadate,a stimulant,worked for a while until he deveoped severe tics.He started Strattera about a month ago and developed a very severe and unusual cough with vomitting.His doctors don't really believe it's the drug because this is not a listed side effect.This cough is unlike any I've ever seen or heard going on 2 months and we have stopped my son from using it now and we are reporting this to the F.D.A.My advice to parents,use extreme caution.All these meds are trial and error.We know the pain you are going through.You know your child better than anyone.Observe ALL side effects.They may not be listed ! and good luck.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Henry4, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	2/20/2009 12:52:10 AM	Ok, I have been reading these comments and I am very saddened by the boy who is obviously very angry, I too pray you have  someone in your life with whom you can really talk too. I have 2 children both diagnosed with adhd. One is inattentive and is on a stimulant, but my 10 year old is hyperactive and on Strattera 36mg a day (2 18mg pills in the morning) and he has been on this drug for 2.5 years now. We first tried Adderall, what a nigtmare!!!! the Adderall gave him horrible ticks that developed immediately, we turned to Strattera which I have to say has VERY EFFECTIVELY handled his adhd. Especially his hyperactivity, We have had no real side effects to speak of. He is a B student in school and is doing very well on this medication. He still has some days where he has issues with his impulsivity but as he is getting older I have seen him be better able to cope and learn stratigies for the impulsivity. He also did experience slight anger issues. We kept a very close eye on him,and spoke with his doctor as we do every 3 months and the DR. suggested Krill Oil supplement which has worked and is just in essence fish oil. but it did the trick. There is almost never any emotional outbursts or anger issues now. There are many different drugs out there, one is right for you and just like us,... you just have to try, and maybe try again, but you will find one that works. I do not want to keep either of my children on these medications to long and we work on stratigies for them to help them cope. We talk openly about them taking their medication and I listen to their reservations. We talk about it and work thru it together so they can get off this medication. I definately cannot complain they (the medicatios) have been a godsend!!I have read all about Strattera, and still have to say it was the best &quot;decision&quot; for us.

I am an avid user of webmd to check medications out before I take them. I want to make sure I know what to expect before I take a drug. I have to admit that I am horribly scared that this will not help my problem with focusing and give me some bad side effects. These reviews have helped me with the decision not to take the drug and call my doctor tomorrow to let him know.

Please email me and let me know how you are:  masterianda@yahoo.com I really care.  The review was from:  Drug Reviewer: yoyoyo, 13-18 Male on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) I am a mother of a child under 10.  I would not ever make my child take something they did not want to take.  It seemed to change my child's life for the better in less than 24 hours!  We were stunned.  I'm in the Medical Profession and trying medicine was our last resort.  My child had headaches for one week and they subsided.  One odd thing, only on the medicine for 3 weeks, my child got the flu.  After that, my child has been very emotional - crying or angry at everything.  It got better after one week, but we are CLOSELY monitoring this.  My child is only on 18mg. Day 2 of the medicine my child plays great with siblings and reported feeling &quot;calm&quot;.  I pray for all with ADD/ADHD and their families.  God does allow some of us to need medicine, but always remember, &quot;The Lord will fight for you, you need only to be still.&quot;  Exodus 14:14 and look up Jeremiah 33:3 also.  God Bless you all!

I'm super sensitive to medications so within the hour of taking the first 60mg pill i was sick to my stomache, dizzy, and feeling faint.  For the rest of the week I continued to be naeseated, constipated (to where i had to take a laxative every night), and I wasn't sleeping well.  Also, I have chronic migraines and this seemed to make them worse and more frequent.  I didn't notice that it helped with my concentration at all, and the side affects alone were enough for me to stop taking it.

Now I hate to do with out it. However; although most of the side effects ended after a few weeks. one side effect has remained and will probably force me to stop taking it. The problem is pain with my prostate. Other sites I have found mention this problem much more frequently than does this one. I would like to know if this will also go away or whether it will be permanent.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity		1	4	1			12/30/2008 2:38:06 AM	Her doctor believed that the stimulants in the Concerta my daughter had been taking were causing tics, so they took her off it and switched her to non-stimulant Strattera when she was 12.  She quickly began to lose weight and her teachers we constantly calling me during the day with concerns that she was anorexic.  Her tics also did not go away and dizzyness, vomitting and fatigue became huge issues, leading them to then consider bulemia.  She claimed that everyday around the same time in the morning she would leave class and go to the bathroom and throw up then feel very dizzy and light headed for a few hours before she felt better.  Myself and her doctor found this strange and somewhat hard to believe so it was signed off as a lie and ignored for some time.  Still on the medication at age 15, now at a different school, the nurse called me saying that she was vomitting and had collapsed, something that apparently had happened before.  Her weight was also dangerously low.  This medication did nothing more than cause more problems for my daughter physically and academically.  I have heard praises regarding it, but we have none to offer whatsoever.

It followed with several trips back to the doctor for different prescriptions ranging from toprol for my heart acting up and my unusually high pulse rate (caused by the medication) to cymbalta and abilify for bi-polar disorder along with a diagnosis of anorexia.  Miraculously, after i stopped taking strattera all of my other symptoms subsided. Im 18 now, and the only memory of the medication and its side effects are the problems with my circulation and heart beat. I understand that every medication is different for every person but i still would not suggest this medication for anyone. I also understand that my particular problems may have been caused by poor doctor-patient follow up, but if i had known what this medication could have caused, i wouldnt have allowed myself to be put on it.

It makes me tired.  I also take Zoloft, which I started to take a few months ago.  It makes me tired too, but, since starting the Strattera 1-1/2 weeks ago with the Zoloft, all I want to do is sleep.  Maybe it's the combination of the two????

Yes, I know it is rare to get that far and school and it not be diagnosed yet but sometimes ADD is confused with other disorders. I began with 10 mg and slowly worked up to 80. I loved that this medicine could be taken at night and not affect your sleep. Strattera helped me concentrate and focus in school. I went from a 3.0 to a 4.0 within a month. I also wait tables at a local restaurant and it helped me to stay on task.After about a month on the drug I started having trouble sleeping. I would lay awake at night until 2 in the morning thinking about all the different ways I could kill myself and why I should do so. It made me very aggressive. I even went as far as to punch someone. This was not normal behavior for me. This medicine is very effective in helping you focus, but be warned it CAN GIVE YOU SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. Needless to say I am on a new medicine now.

The Dr. put me on 10mg -25mg then 40mg. I have had some dizzyness, blurred vision, hot flashes, difficulty urinating and a &quot;wide awake in 3 hours&quot; sleep pattern.  The worst side effect though...  Having always been quite virile and after meeting the woman of my dreams and finally having a sex life that would make a teenager blush -it goes limp in the middle of crazy mad passionate sessions. Grrr!  Otherwise it would be like comparing a convenience store coffee to starbucks!  It is close but still lacks -something.  I have read other posts about the limpness.  The manufacturer calls it &quot;erctile disturbance&quot; I'll say!! Very disturbing! I feel your frustration and you are not alone. I dont want to take another (blue)pill to counter the side effect.  I am going to talk to the Dr. about switching meds.

I started taking this drug when I was in highschool and before that had never experienced symptoms of depression.  This drug made it horrible for me to feel motivated.  I was extremely depressed and had racing thoughts.  It also  made me extremely hyper-focused and when I would run out of things to do I would start to panic and cry.  It got to the point where I was counting the specks of plaster on the wall to have something for my mind to do.  I am also a naturally artistic person and I had lost all of my ability to paint and draw.  I quickly got off this medication and switched to Amphetamine salts which helped much more.

Both gave her horrible migraines and made her sick to her stomach.  An acquaintance suggested Strattera since it is not an amphetamine.  My daughter is able to tolerate this medicine much better.  The only side effect is sleepiness, so I give it to her at bedtime.  My only complaint is that I don't think that it's effective enough.

Lab tests were done. Im a young Fit guy, with nothing else wrong. On further reveiw of Strattera, by a pharmasist it was found to be a rare side effect. No warnings of this were present anywhere on the box, or users guide in the box. Quite dissapointed because prostatitis is probably the worst thing to happen to a young male.

I was prescribed Ritalin which triggers some kind of weird reaction leaving me with Tourrette Syndrome. After years of trial and error with medications I have settled with Strattera 60mg and Wellbutrin XL 150 mg.  They both help with ADHD.  The Wellbutrin helps with depression and helps balance the irritability I get from strattera, however it does make me more anxious, which is hard to live with.  The Strattera lets me concentrate and my grades are decent in my third year college. With any drug there are side affects but after six years the Strattera is still working. And the weight management is just a bonus.

For 18 months I felt like it was just a vitamin that made me clear and focused; I was in control and could be proactive instead of reactive with no side effects.  Then my blood pressure jumped to dangerous levels.  My Dr. advised me to stop taking it and put me back on ritalin...  BP went back to normal and I once again live with the good and bad of ritalin.

I typically take it in the school year and am off it during summer break. When I get back on it, I usually have about 11 days of fatigue, nausea, chills, aches and sleeplessness that fade by the end of two weeks. I feel that it has a great effect on my concentration and motivation to work. My stress also is greatly reduced. I just hate how long it takes for my body to become accustomed to the medication.

Tried every drug out there for ADD. This drug did help me to feel more relaxed but i didn't notice that it help me focus. I had the chills a lot, though when i decreased from 80 to 60mg that subsided somewhat. A big plus my decrease in appetite which helped me to lose the remaining 12 lbs i had put on over 4 years. I would take the drug mid day around 1pm with a meal to avoid nausea , but then around 7-8pm i would be sooooo sleepy that i couldn't stay up past 9pm. I am currently on day 4 without it as i noticed i was using it more for weight control than anything else. I also experienced  a twitch around my mouth for a day or two which went away. No sexual side effects. No problem according to my dr with going off cold turkey-last time i did though, i noticed i became more emotional. The drug did make me feel a little void of emotion. Hope this review is helpful.

I was given a 7mg, 25mg,or 40 mg dose twice a day (ramping up dose each couple of days combined with 10 mg lexapro). I've read every single review and I'm aware that it takes about 3 weeks for the &quot;focus and concentration&quot; to magically kick in but so far I've had dry mouth (which makes my breath mucky and less likely to interact with others, especially the LADIES), nausea, decreased appetite, that strange &quot;brain transformation&quot; buzz feelings, and most importantly........ the sexual side effects. A 21 year old college student should not go limp while in the middle of hot passionate sex. Also I get a strange pain in my testes and the weirdest ejaculations that feel like I have to urinate. I work out everyday and eat a high protein diet and the meds give me the foggiest afternoon/evening fatigue I've ever experienced. It will be a crapshoot to see if this crap actually pans out to any actual benefit.

I have had wonderful results with Strattera in regards to being able to focus and complete a task without going in a million directions. It's been 3 years and in the past year a most annoying side effect has developed that no one else seems to be having. Lately I am having a problem with words for similar things ie: I might come up with napkin for hankerchief, or oven for dryer or lamp for traffic signal. I don't feel as if this is a dementia problem, all of my other cognitive abilities are fully operational. Sure wish someone could address this in regards to the Strattera. My doctor hasn't found anything yet. Other than that, this medicine is fantastic!

My scalp had started to itch about a year ago and go so bad that I would have scabs all over. I thought it was the shampoo I was using or I had an allergy to something. Nothing would releive the itch. I went off straterra for the summer to see how and I did without out and after about a month the itch stopped, but I didn't think anything about it. When school started back, i began taking the medicine again and the itch came back slowly. I finally realized the coralation between the two. So my doctor took me off of strattera and put me on adderall. I've been itch free for a month and I have never felt better.

I had excruciating groin pain and became sterile. It is related to a completely inneffective family of mood medications that all have bad to diasterous side effects(Zyprexa, zoloft, paxil, prozac). BE AWARE THAT THE FCC NOW REQUIRES ONLY 18 MONTHS OF TESTING FOR NEW DRUGS AND THIER SIDE EFFECTS RATHER THAN 13 YEARS, AS OF A FEW YEARS AGO- THIS IS A TRAVESTY; VIEW ALL NEW MEDS WITH SUSPICION. I take Concerta, which is more effective than a higher doage of Ritalin- the main ingredient of both (methylphenidate),  is not new; what noone seems to know is that ithas a different 12 hour delivery system unlike typical &quot;XR&quot; ones, and it works well.

I can honestly say that it has been incredibly effective. I've been able to get the tasks that I'm working on completed without any distraction. My moods have improved.

He is back to the annoying child that we are to tired at the end of the day and other children do not want anything to do with him.  Onto another drug.

In Jan after Strattera came out, my dr suggested to try strattera, because it was 24 hr time release and not a stimulant. Due to no &quot;down&quot; time in between the stimulants and strattera we had an IMMEDIATE change in my son's behavior within the first week.  I will caution you to understand this med takes a while to fully build up.  it is not like the &quot;typical&quot; add drugs.  my son was off this med for 10 days once and it took 4 weeks to get back to the level we needed.  I love strattera because it gave me back my sweet little boy.  He is now almost 12 years old and we have disagreements MAYBE twice a month, he is learning almost at his grade level and making friends.  I too have done many behavior modifications over the years and firmly believe you need a complete plan not just drugs.  I hope Lilly will do some trials with more children with Autism!

It seems to do ok, he seem tired sometimes and says he don't like the way it makes him feel.  I did try at the end of last school year to take him off cause I wasn't sure if it was even working. I didn't tell his teacher and thought I'll call after a week and see how he was doing and by Thur or Friday I got a call from his teacher wanting to know if everything was ok cause he'd had a bad week.  I don't know if this is a good decision but it does seem to help him focus.

It would work great and then slowly seem to lose effectiveness.  Increased to 40 mg.  Finally feeling focused consistently.  Insurance would not cover, had to try adderall.  Terrible-felt very confused and depressed.  Was able to go back on strattera 40 mg. again.  Been taking for 2 months, feel good. More focused and being told by people at work that I am more organized and room is not filled with scattered projects.  Wish it was the same at home.  Side affects are dry mouth, nausea, some sleeplessness, and more flat personality (maybe just focused more), but all are manageable.  Feel awake most everyday instead of just one day a month.  Hope it continues.

He was failing 3rd grade, was angry all the time, seemed depressed, backtalked alot, then in October of 07, we tried strattera, 50 mg in the morning right after breakfast.  From October to May, even his teachers noticed a huge difference.  He didn't get out of his seat anymore, no more back talking, showed his mannerism with others, he started to respect others, overall, he wasn't a hateful, angry, mean, depressed child anymore.  He passed the 3rd grade, had a wonderful summer and is now enjoying 4th grade.  You can't just take the medicine and expect it to fix the problem. Their are things in your life that have to be modified and accommodated to.  I use behavior modification at home and he has a reward program set up at home for allowances. I made a visual chart for him and put on his wall in his room where he has to see it everyday.  He knows what his chores are and he see's them written on his board when he wakes up.  He's doing great.  My son was never into sports, but counsler's thought with his disorder, sports may be good for him.  He took an interest in football over the summer and I signed him up for a youth league.  this worked out to my advantage as well, because not only did he fall in love with actually playing the game, I have leveridge in using behavior modification for teaching responsibilities at home and schoolwork.  It works for me, it works for him.  The only side effect he complained about was heartburn.  So he takes 2 chewable tums before each meal and does well.  He is happy and doing very well in school now. He is definitely more sociable with other kids, where before he wouldn't talk or play with other kids.

He seems afraid of everything and sad. I do not know if it is helping him or not but as of today and ready all these other reviews he is coming off of it and I will have to start all over. By the way he is on this for ADD w/out the hyper part. But I would like for him to go back to one of his other meds he tried. Specially were school starts in 2wks. The only thing he is getting out of this is that his appetite has come back somewhat. So I do not know where to go from hear. But to everyone that has written a review &quot;Thank You&quot; so very, very much..The doctors do not tell you everything I guess...

I am dissappointed that it's greatly increased my blood pressure. I'm a 44 yr old African Americam male who is already in a high risk zone with blood pressure. Unfortunately I may have to find another solution. It also seems to cause sleep problems and double vision. I'm really enjoying the focus, but the risk overall may be to high.

When I first started using the drug I took it after breakfast and after lunch.  (25mg twice a day) I felt light headed, nauseous, difficulty starting to urinate and suffered mild headaches.  I was able to get another appointment with my psychiatrist to possibly find an alternative.  He told me to try taking the same dosages before eating.  I've been doing that for 1 and 1/2 weeks and the only remaining problem is the difficulty in starting to urinate.  I'm hoping that gets better as time goes on.  The effectiveness of the drug has been very apparent in helping me to concentrate and remember what I have to accomplish presently and what is upcoming. I will add an additional report in a couple of months.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	25-34	7/29/2008 2:39:44 PM	I want to make this a very detailed review for you new users. I'm a 25 yr old male. I've been taking this drug for almost 2 yrs. First off, I can notice great differences in focus. I no longer drift off and feel like my mind is in a fog. I take 60 mg per day and I weight 70 kg. It's important to know that the dosage is supposed to be 1 mg of Strattera per 1 kg of body weight, so I'm actually taking 10 mg under what I'm supposed to and getting good effects. It has also brought down my anxiety and made me a little more mellow. As far as the side effects go, I sometimes get a little lightheaded and nauseous if I don't take with food. I do have dry mouth, and my urine is very concentrated, due to the medication drying me out. I have to drink lots water. As far as sexual side effects, I have a slight discharge of seminal fluid once or twice but the main effects that I think men have is due to dehydration from Strattera. If you are having sexual side effects, try increasing your fluid intake and it seems to greatly help with fixing the concentration of urine and the feeling that you have to continue to urinate or release semen, even if you don't have too. I hope this helps, Strattera is great as long as you drink plenty of fluid throughout the day. It's helped me become more successful in my job and focused throughout the day. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	35-44 Male 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	7/25/2008 9:13:52 AM	I am 42 years old and have ADD. I have been on and off of this drug a few times. Currently on 25mg but may bump it back up in another month. It really works for me and has drastically improved my work performance and home life. The side effects seem to fade after you are on it for a while -mine were sweats, chills, insomnia. When the side effects fade, I think it is natural to wonder if the drug is still being effective so many choose to increase the dosage. Stick with the set dosage for a bit longer before deciding to increase.

When I upped to 80mg (as the doctor directed) I noticed differences but they were bad ones.  I did not feel like I was focusing any better.  However, I was experiencing the issues on the warning label: mood changes, anxiety, depression, and sadness.  When I had suicidal thoughts, I knew it was time to get off of that stuff and toss it.  I guess it works for most people, but I'm suggesting that you beware!

I feel like my IQ has been increased 50 points!  Side effects are worth it..I take it before bed and have trouble sleeping through the night.  I toss and turn, sleep very lightly, and wake at 3am wide awake.

I am at 100mg for about 4 months. My blood pressure has increased, the focus is not as good as it was in the beginning. But the chronic constipation is the absolute worst symptom.  I eat raisin bran every night plus a lot of vegetables.  I have decided to stop taking it because the side effects now are worse than the benefits. All the info I read says you do not have to taper, but having had the effexor nightmare, I want to be sure. Any thoughts?
Other	CadTechLV, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	35-44	6/29/2008 1:00:51 PM	Im a 41yr old male, I started this med May 1st for ADD w/o hyperactivity, 25mg for 2 weeks, 40mg for 2 weeks, 60mg for 4 weeks. Notice increased focus &amp; improvement of ADD symptoms. Within 1 week of use commented to my wife something seems different when I have a orgasm, not bad, just different. As time progressed &amp; mg dosage, started to notice seminal fluid leakage when having a bowel movement. This escaladed into very little release of semen on ejaculation and no release of the energy you feel at orgasm, but I would loose my erection, very little fluid would be ejaculated &amp; I still felt like I needed to have a release. I would then feel like I needed to urinate, but I couldnt, feeling would go away after a few minutes and orgasm was not pleasant, almost painful. Sensation was same whether it was through masturbation or intercourse. Sexual desire decreased a bit. No signs of ED as of yet, erection was still firm, but noticed I was becoming pre-mature and recovery was no longer 15-20 minutes. 2-3 hours before I was able to get another erection. Urinating was changing also, plus it had a strong unusual odor, some urine leakage after thinking I was done, feeling like I still needed to go, but nothing to very little would come out. I googled Strattera sexual side effects, found Im not alone, about 6-10% of Men &amp; Women experience this. I stopped this medication June 24th, problems subsided within 5 days &amp; all is back to normal. Going to find a different med Adderal or Dexedrine maybe. I worry about the kids out there on this med that dont know what things are supposed to feel like sexually. Im sure this med works for some, it helped me, but not worth these side effects. Im a parent of 3 &amp; would use concern about this med if needed for ADD. Sorry this was so long, but for me, the more info the better. Good luck, hope it works better for you, but now you know what to look for.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	anon, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	35-44	6/29/2008 3:41:49 AM	I had commented earlier about getting on Strattera after the first three weeks. Let me say that the difference between week 3 and week 5 is a LOT.  Mid-30s male, good physical condition.  But once I got into the 40 mg dose (and needing about 60) my insurance said &quot;Try Ritalin first.&quot;  Thank God.  My gut was constantly very, very sore, my digestion was completely out of whack, the sexual side effects were not pleasant (not really ED, but weird, weird physical conditions making everything unpredictable down there, in a bad way).I think I need to get off the adderall, as my heart can't take it, but I'm not going back to Strattera.  Made me a mellow and nicer guy, but too many other problems.Cool drug, otherwise, and helpful for calming down without being sedated.  Never made me too tired, and not bad mentally, but physically, this thing was the pits for me.Your use may vary, everyone's chemistry is different.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	6/20/2008 1:25:07 PM	I have mixed feeling about the drug. It has absolutely helped with my ADHD. If I forget to take it I know because of my lack of focus. One issue I have is  that it seems to have different levels of effectiveness on a day to day basis. Some days I am GREAT, and some it appears to have no effect at all. I take 80mg one time in the morning with food. Taking it with food helped the nausea issue. I rarely have any sleep issues since taking the full dose in the morning. One MAJOR issue being a male in his 40's is total sexual dysfunction (ED)   I am working with my dr now adjusting dosages. If I skip the meds for a few days the sexual issue goes away. Nothing is perfect as I was on Ritalin and Adderall for several years with not nearly the same effectiveness of this drug. I have read many thread about tiredness during the day. I have found that eating properly and daily exercise has cut out MOST of that issue for me. Hope this information helps.

I threw up about an hour after taking it with a big breakfast. It also gave me really bad heartburn, and bad sexual side effects. A 23 year old man should be able to get an erection! I lost 6 pounds in 2 weeks also..(not a bad thing)
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	19-24	6/3/2008 2:03:54 AM	I thought it was about half as effective in the concentration department as Concerta or Adderall XR. I took it for about a month and simply could not deal with the mood swings it put me through so I stopped taking it.
Other	welkden3, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/2/2008 10:42:35 AM	I am a 58yr old overweight female with adult attention deficit disorder (mixed type). I also have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and an overactive bladder. I have tried most meds prescribed for my ADD disorder: SSRIs, Adderal and more. None worked except for the Adderal but I developed tolerance which I knew to be a red flag to dependence. I have been on Strattera for four months and felt the results after 30 days. Since then, symptoms of chronic fatigue have all but disapeared, I have lost 21 lbs due to my ability to stop eating when I am full, and I no longer need medication for my blader control problem. I have decreased my Cymbalta from 90mg to 60mg to 30mg to now no longer needing it. It took awhile to see results but it is well worth it. This is the first med that has targeted norepinepherine instead of dopamine or seretonin. I think it should be re-evaluate as an anti-depressant as well as prescribed off lable for weight loss and bladder contol problems. It works better than Detrol
Other	Dean Stamidis, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	19-24	5/31/2008 2:28:06 PM	I was prescribed this drug since I felt I had a bit of difficulty concentrating.  I'm on 10mg now.  It helps me get up in the morning.  I don't like the drug and I feel as if it does me more harm than good.  My doctor might take me off of it now since I don't have that much hard of time waking up, plus you shouldn't take strattera for any condition but what it's prescribed for, which is ADHD.  I feel as if it makes me irritable and when I was on 80mg I believe it contributed to me being somewhat delusional, paranoid, and anxiety ridden, but I'm on other meds so maybe it was the the combination of meds.  I'm not 100% certain.  I'm on the lowest dose now of strattera and I am doing fantastic.  Sometimes less is more, especially with this drug.  If you don't like this drug or feel that it is making your condition worse, don't self-medicate with it or get off of it.  You may need a dose adjustment.  Talk to your doctor and therapist and they will know what's best.

The only thing I don't like about it is that it makes me very tired and I have a big loss in motivation which is not a good thing being in the military.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	asdf , 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	5/29/2008 7:34:21 PM	This should not be a medication for children, but other than that, it seems to work well.  Starting at an 18mg dose, I felt a significant effect, as if I was undergoing a neurotransmitter cascade in my brain.  The feeling was similar to the initial &quot;buzz&quot; after taking a shot or two of booze on an empty stomach.  Profound, but for a mid-thirties 170 pound man, not too bad or unmanageable.  Quite a pleasurable &quot;high,&quot; really.  The feeling in one's privates was quite odd, and I would worry about the &quot;climax without orgasm&quot; side effect if a higher dose was used to start with.  I cannot imagine what a child's body would go through on a 40 mg does off the bat.  That seems irresponsible.After a week at 18mg, I have started the 40 mg, after noticing a decreased effectiveness toward the end of the 18mg cycle.  Head/scalp chills and an upset stomach are the main side effects, aside from the buzz in the head.One is more tired on the drug, and that is exacerbated--counterintuitively--after getting a full night's sleep.  The drug IS supposed to slow you down, though, so that's to be expected.  Again, I can't imagine a kid dealing with this intensity. I've noticed myself being a little short or cranky at times (more so than usual), but I have been able to recognize and control it.  As for effectiveness, I was at the point where work was all but impossible, with an inability to focus on anything once even a minor roadblock occurred.  A bad condition for someone who writes analytically for a living.  Now, focusing is less of a problem and getting better daily.My guess is that the neurotransmitter cascade is designed to exhaust the adult ADHD mind that flies off on wild tangents and cannot stay concentrated.  It is not for a normal, rambunctious child or someone who is bi-polar/dissociative.  Its use should be tailored to specific conditions of the ADHD-PI spectrum, and not given merely as another option in kids who are pigeonholed as &quot;hyper&quot; by in-school clockpunchers.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Masonmom1315, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/19/2008 11:51:04 AM	My 5 year old son has been diagnosed with ADHD and Sensory Integration Dysfunction. He was placed on Adderal XR 10mg and within one month, he had lost 3 lbs because he had no appetite(he is skinny anyway since he can't eat many foods), was screaming and crying every time you even said no to him, wasn't sleeping well, was constipated, etc. He was miserable. He switched to Strattera 10mg in Jan. and it has been wonderful. He suffers from no side effects and has greatly improved at school. He was tested in Nov. 2007 by school psychologists and again in April 08. It was like he was a different child in the two tests. This week, we did increase his dosage to 18 mg and he has been a little spacy for the past couple of days, but I think once it gets in his system, he will be fine. I would recommend trying this drug to anyone having problems with some of the other drugs. It has really helped my son calm down and focus. I have been told by several professionals in the past that they had &quot;never seen anything like him&quot;. Now, you wouldn't notice him in a crowd of other 5 year old boys, which is the goal (I think) of all parents with children suffering from ADHD.

Also, it has made me sexually unable to perform as I was previous ly able to do.I would not recommend this drug to anyone I know, because despite the fact that it has enabled me to focus, the side effects are just too horrible when weighed in with the benefits.

He took Adderall first, which was a nightmare.  We switched to Strattera and he reacted very well to the drug. He has been on it for 2 years.  He does have to eat breakfast before he takes it or he has an upset stomach.  The problem is the drug seems to plateau and we need to increase the dosage.  The only side effects we have seen are mood swings.  When the dosage is correct, he is like a different child.  He does very well in school and behaves excellent at home.  You can tell the minute the drug has plateaued.

Since I have been taking it, I have been insomnic, nauseated, and seem to have become hostile towards the simplest of things. At the very least, I have been more focused, but these other side effects leave me with a less than desirable feeling about the drug. I think I need a new approach/remedy.
Other		4	3	4			3/10/2008 1:59:02 PM	I am taking Strattera for ADD Inattentive type (non-hyperactive). The biggest side effects I have gotten are dry mouth, trouble sleeping, foggy-headedness, and nausea. These have all been manageable- I have to take it in the morning to avoid insomnia and take it with food to avoid the nausea. I get foggy-headed if I stop taking it for a while  and then go back on. It's REALLY important to take it consistently, as I've learned. Despite the side effects, it does help me alot. Before, I was unable to just sit and DO my work, even if I really wanted to. It wasn't an issue of motivation, as it mostly can be, it was simply my brain not being able to do what I wanted it to. It feels like there's a weight on my thoughts now- so I can keep them locked down and under my control. It's great. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	who cares?, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	19-24	3/6/2008 1:59:02 AM	I began taking this medication for A.D.D. while in college, 25 mg once a day. It was alternative to Ritalin and other stimulants, which I took from the fourth until the tenth grade. Strattera kept my mind clear; I didn't have a thousand thoughts racing through my head, and kept me real calm and quiet, but hyperactivity isn't an issue with me. I was able to stay much more organized with daily routines. My grades didn't change. The cons (side effects) I've experienced include the following: irritablility (meaness towards others), drymouth to no extent, headaches (drinking water helped with this), sexual side effects, some depression, dizziness, drowsiness, sneezing (I took an antihistamine to control this pseudo allergy symptom, which made me even more drowsy), and nausea. This medicine would put me in a catatonic state. It's expensive if you don't have RX insurance. Good luck with it!

It has really calmed her down and helped her focus but tonight she told me (mom) that she see's dead people. Needless to say I was shocked. As we done more research on this drug we learned that she is actually having alot of the side effects. Not only is she hallucinatng but she feels itchy, her limbs are tingling and she seems to get tired real easy. I feel these side effects cause as much anxiety as the ADD. It is an excellent medication for ADD but like any other drug, not everyone can tolerate it or it's side effects.

I am 21 years old and I live in California. Back when I was in High School my parents made me take this drug. It was very clear to them and everyone else that I hade ADD since I was a child. I wasn't a crazy hyper wild child, but I had a hard time paying attention and coming back from la la land. Anyways, when I got to high school my parents said enough is enough. So we went to the Dr. and he gave me this stuff. The first few weeks were ok. I was actually able to pay attention and rais my grades. I was a B+ student now instead of a C- student. It worked, it really worked....until about a month into the application.I became extremely depressed. I am a musician and I don't feel right if i'm not writing music... well all that stopped in a big hurry. I didn't touch my guitar for like 4 or 5 months streight. i stopped talking to my friends. I wanted to die! Parents, if you don't want this to happen to your child do NOT let the Dr. prescribe this to your child. Trust me, the week I stopped taking this drug, is the week I got my life back. Sure the drug was &quot;effective,&quot; but to put that before your childs well being is wrong. Grades are not as important as life. Bottom Line.

As an adult with ADHD, it has helped me get through my days and focus immensely. No crashing, no bad side effects. Occasionally if the pill doesn't get all the way to my stomach, it can cause some burning indigestion, but that's rare. All in all, i rate it as a great drug. I can actually focus now!

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity		1	5	1			11/28/2007 11:10:06 PM	I absolutely hated this drug. The drug would last for about an hour then i would crash and become extremely tired to the point where I would doze off. It made me not want to talk to anyone and feel like a zombie. I'd also get goosebumps randomly. I tried different doses but all of them didn't work. I recommend adderall or focalin XR.

Strattera isn't helping my deficiency with my attention. It does help me be sleepy and want to vomit everyday. I told my DR that I am used to Adderall and Adderall worked completely! I hope he prescribes me Adderall instead of this Strattera stuff. I recommend to severe ADHD people (like myself)to try Adderall over Strattera, you will be satisfied.

This is so much more true with Strattera than with any other drug I have ever tried or heard of. If you go too high and/or too fast with dosage, you can get a train wreck. You'll decide that it isn't for you when it could actually make a lot of difference in your condition, which is what happened to me. I'm probably going back on it again, but I'm going to be so careful about not taking too much, too fast.

The switch was made to Strattera. I became very tired all the time and was unable to function because of dizziness. I decided to live with my ADD and learn skills to manage the condition.

Apparently others have these problems as well, but Strattera says they are &quot;rare.&quot;  I've never had this reaction to any medication, and as soon as I got off (probably 2 years ago) I've not had these problems again.

I've been taken the medication for a couple of months and have noticed a difference.  I don't like feeling the tingling in my body it's like iam on a diet.  I've been super hungry and feel like I am not getting enough nutrients.  I am tired all day but can't sleep but can at night.
Other	cha20, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	10/26/2007 12:55:16 PM	I have tried this with a morning dose of a minimal 25mg for ADD with distractibility and no hyperactivity. I am ending the second week, still at 25mg and have to stop the medication. Overall tingling sensation and tightness in chest and throat for the first two days, then the tingling stopped and I felt much better. Settled into focus and work and felt uplifted mood. Occassionally, however, the tightness in chest increased, physical activity felt began to feel like slow motion, unsteadiness, along with extreme fatigue in the afternoon and sleeplessness and anxiety at night. No matter how much I like being able to concentrate, the extreme side effects are discouraging.

I felt a focus and drive I could not recall having experienced before.  Over time, however, the effectiveness declined. Increased dosage seemed to help, but eventually faded.  After a coupleyears, I no longer sensed any effectiveness, and stopped taking it.

It's almost like I haven't taken any medication at all. I tried Concerta as well with the same effects, which were unfortunatley none at all. However, for a patient who is worried about becoming dependent upon a medicine for ADHD, strattera is very non habit forming. The worst side effect is the mood swings that occur when you don't take the medication at the same time every day, they are very severe.

I was also throwing up a lot and had a fever constantly. I was dehydrated, and itchy as well. I was good as new 3 days after i stopped taking strattera.

When it worked, it worked wonders...but I struggled with mood swings for the first several months, almost everyday and always at 8pm. It was odd, I would just fly into a rage for no reason, and if I did actually have a reason...oh man, watch out. I thought the suicidal thoughts as a side effect were laughable until I started having them. It was totally unemotional, just a matter of fact telling myself I needed to kill myself. Nothing would happen to set off these thoughts and I never had them before or since stopping the medication. On the plus side, when starting the med or when the dose was adjusted I had fantastic results. Focus was not a problem and I did better than ever in my classes(I'm in college). The results wouldn't fade into the late hours of studying and I was thrilled with that. The dosage only lasted for about a week or 2 though. I finally worked my way up to 100mg in the morning and the final 18 at lunch(I'm small, it was a lot, but I had worked up to that dose slowly), when I was getting sick after taking the pills and not having good concentration plus seriously cosidering suicide when I finally realized that I should have stopped it a long time before I did. I say give it a shot, most people don't have serious problems like me...but if your having mood issues stop it IMMEDIATELY! Your life is way more important than being able to focus through the day...there are other medication options.
