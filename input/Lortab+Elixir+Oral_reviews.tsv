Pain	Dizzy Patient, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	7/8/2012 10:51:51 AM	I had to have a cyst removed from my throat and this was prescribed as a pain reliever.  It burns like fire going down and tastes horrible.  I have also never been so dizzy in my life but I can swallow without pain.

At one point I screamed with pain after the first swallow.
Pain	Teesters,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female		5/10/2011 11:04:38 AM	Have a particularly bad case of Strep Throat and was prescribed the Elixir to help with the pain. And this has to be one of the worst prescription pain killers I've ever received. The only good thing about this garbage is how sleepy it makes me, which in turn allows me to zoink out. But I can only attempt to sleep so long as it's on my side and or my stomach because of fear of possibly voimiting. What little pain relife it does provide is done well before the &quot;4-6 hour&quot; dosage limit. If I ever get this as a prescription again, I'll be sure to come up with a reason to get something that I know will actually work, instead of waste my time.

Pain	SherryGabs, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	12/19/2010 1:52:36 AM	Had most of my stomach and small portion of small intestine removed 4 days ago. Was on morphine in hospital and was switched to Lortab elixir the day before discharge. The first couple of doses made me vomit, after that no more nausea. It does relieve pain, not totally, but well enough. The relief does not last 4 hours, however. I either have to suffer or take dosages more frequently. 
Pain	Mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	7/25/2010 12:44:22 PM	My son is 7 and had his tonsils and adenoids removed 3 days ago.  This medication does seem to help with  pain but he has had very little appetite.  We are giving him 4-5 mL every four hours, even throughout the night.  I have been waking him up in the night to make sure he gets his meds. on-time.  Keeping up regular doses is the only way to keep him from getting past the point where we can't even get the medicine down because he is crying so hard.  He does not like the taste, but it forces him to drink some fluids to wash it down.

Pain	calluna13, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	3/17/2010 12:29:53 PM	Had major surgery twice within the last year and they sent me home with this both times. Although I'm sure it's safer to send home than a more potent drug, it doesn't quite kick the pain the same as in hospital ones do. Not impressed by it at all!

Pain	Mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	2/21/2010 10:52:19 PM	My daughter is nine and was recently given Lortab Elixer at the emergency room for a fractured foot.  This was a huge mistake!  The medicine had no sooner hit her mouth and it was projectile vomited straight back out.  Why the nurse chose an alcohol based liquid I will never understand.  This pain reliever is obviously not for children and I am horrified that it has not been labeled as such.  Hopefully parents across the nation will complain to their pediatricians as I plan to do and help to keep this medication from traumatizing and possibly poisoning other children in the future.Jodi Kennedy- Mom 
Pain	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	10/11/2009 11:00:11 AM	This medication was prescribed to me after I had fractured my in two places. I found this medication helpful in the treatment of pain due to its short onset and long duration.  Also, two doses of this medication worked more effectively than four doses of liquid Motrin throughout the course of the day.  I can only speak for myself but my insurance co-pay made this prescription cheaper than purchasing an OTC pain reliever (Tylenol/Motrin oral suspension).  The narcotic effect is enjoyable, I can understand how people would abuse this drug.
Pain	Michael65270, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	10/10/2009 8:44:19 PM	Im 21 years old. I have lesions and abcesses in my throat and they gave me Hydrocodone (lortab elixir) for the pain. The first couple doses didnt seem to work. But have been taking it almost two days now and I can eat and drink just fine now. I would recommend to just give it time.
Pain	7-12 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	3	Male	7-12	7/26/2009 1:52:31 AM	My 8 year old son was put on this med because Tylenol w/codeine was ineffective after a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. This med has been fairly effective for pain, however he has had constant nausea, no appetite, sleeps all the time, and is &quot;out of it&quot; when he is awake. 
Pain	0-2 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	2	2	Male	0-2	7/13/2009 3:33:22 PM	My son (2 1/2 y/o) fractured his femure. Dr gave this as medicine for pain. Gave him half a dose (2ml vs 4 ml) and son woke up screaming after a couple of hours. He looked terrified and was unable to calm him down. Heart rate rate was not normal, breathing was labored. Took him into ER and DR said nightmares are a common side effect for little children. Then got T3 in place of lortab. Highly encourage parents weigh their options prior to giving this med to young children.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	5/1/2009 5:00:39 AM	My daughter is 3 years old and she had her tonsils out. I gave her this med every 4 hours and after the second day she just didnt want it anymore and so i just stop giving it to her she was eating and drinking good. but it done the job for her. At 3 years old. she did hate the taste but what kid wouldnt.
Pain	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	3/8/2009 2:04:03 PM	had a tonsillectomy. 1-3 tsp every 4-6 hr. wears off VERY quickly. Felt very nauseous.
Pain	HeatherJ1025, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	11/8/2008 9:57:38 AM	33 year old female. 2-3 teaspoons every 4-6 hours.  My surgery was 2 days ago, and in the beginning I was stretching it out to 3 tsp every 5 hours, but now I can barely reach 4 hours.  My doctor did warn me that the pain would get worse.  But he also put me on an anti-nausea med in case the hydrocodone made me sick.  This medicine (promethazine) tastes much worse than the hydrocodone causing me to stay off of it and just hold still.
Pain	Mike, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	10/13/2008 7:23:23 PM	I had a my tonsils removed (along with some other upper throat and septum work).  My only prob with this med is that it doesn't last long enough.  My dose is 15mL every 4 hours.  The pain is back in about 1/2 the time.
Pain	mom, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	4	Female	3-6	9/17/2008 7:55:37 AM	This is working for my child (6yrs) who had her tonsils/adenoids removed. She HATES the taste but knows that it will provide some relief. The day after surgery she was drinking and eating soft foods, but I did give her the med. every 4 hours on the nose. Just swallow it down quickly and chase with a flavored drink (her choice=orange gatorade/vernors) and its done! If she can do it, so can you.

The taste is not that bad if you consider the relief it provides.
Pain	IHAVEN'TGOTTIME4THEPAIN, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	35-44	8/9/2008 11:12:28 PM	s/p T &amp; A - miserable. MD reccs dose of 15ml/4hours - what?? That means 7.5mg hydrocodone/500mg tylenol. It barely takes the edge off for an hour. WTF? I have had my throat slit open. Even MD reccs to increase to 22.5 ml still leaves me in pain before the 4 hour dosing window opens.SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE! T &amp; A approx 84 hours ago and have not slept more than 2 hours and swallowing is excruciating. Will have to return to MD office on Monday - I'm actually getting bronchitis/productive cough too! 
Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	35-44	7/27/2008 5:11:01 AM	I am recovering from a UPPP, tonsillectomy and deviated septum repair. My nose is not bothering me at all. I HATE this med! It burns going down and the pain relief is only good for about 1 1/2 hrs. I have a pretty high pain tolerance and had much better pain control with Vicodin when I had previous surgeries. I am to the point that I am taking ES Tylenol caplets as these are less painful to swallow. I am not getting any sleep effects from this medication either.
Pain	schokcer28, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	7/4/2008 12:52:33 PM	I am 29 yr. old Male I had a Tonsillectamy. I have found this med to taste like Robitussin that is not flavored. However once you get past the taste it works very well.
Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	4/25/2008 10:47:58 PM	I find this medication to be effective, not in the sense that it just gets rid of the pain, but it knocks me out so I sleep until its time to take more. Its somewhat easy to use, burns though going down. I, much like the other people writing a review on this medication had my tonsils and adnoids removed. I appologize for any misspellings.. as i am still mixed up b/c of the meds. I wouldn't switch though, I do not tolerate medications well and its rare for one to work for me. So I would reccomend it even though it burns going down and has to be sipped. Takes me atleast 5-10 minutes to take 4 tsp. 
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/5/2008 10:22:56 PM	I had my tonsils and adnoids removed. This medication is the only reason I can swollow at all let alone get any sleep after my surgery.
Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	35-44	1/3/2008 7:20:47 PM	I am a 36 year old female that has had a tonsilectomy.  For this type of pain, the medication has worked very well. Of course there is still pain, but considering that a portion of my body in my head was removed from my body and without the medicine it is excruciating to swallow, I am so thankful for being able to take a great edge off of the pain.

Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	2	Male	25-34	11/19/2007 6:44:59 PM	Attempt to get another med.  Taking this med will cause nausea and/or vomiting (this is soley from the taste of the med).  PT = 27 YOM, tonsilectomy, 2-3 TSP every 4-6 hours &quot;as needed&quot; meds would wear off in 3 hours.  Taste of med would delay the dosing (thinking that maybe the pain was not that bad to be made to drink this med again).  Mixing w/ water, Sprite, Gatorade does not help with taste!!  Good Luck
