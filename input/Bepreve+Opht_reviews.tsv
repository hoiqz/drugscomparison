Well after being prescribed  this medicine I knew it was right for me. I'm glad I went ahead and suffered the cost of a mere three hundred bucks. Ultimately, I'm glad I used this product.

Because within 10 minutes of using them, one of my pupils became greatly enlarged, my blood pressure increased to a dangerous level and my heart rate was exceedingly high. I ended up in the ER as there was a concern of it being a stroke. The doctor determined it was an allergic reaction to the eye drops. Just be aware of a possible allergic reaction, as the manufacturer refused to acknowledge this possible reaction after I contacted them. So it is not listed as a contraindication or possible side effect in the information they provide.

His eyes are still red as anything and he's complaining they are burning and running. Called the allergist to see if we can try something else. Poor kid, I wish it would have worked for him, he's miserable!
Allergic Conjunctivitis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/21/2011 12:21:34 AM	This drop is the only thing that has worked for my crazy itchy eyes this weekend ! Get the big bottle as my insurance company was charging me the same for a bottle half the size. Hope this stuff works just as good as the allergy season rolls in !

The taste, which was kind of like a metallic taste, was just too much annoying.
