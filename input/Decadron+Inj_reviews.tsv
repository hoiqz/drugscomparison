Other	NukedN8V, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	7/12/2012 8:56:26 PM	Was given a shot of this due to severe lower back spasming. Tylenol 4, Percocet, baclofen, zanaflex, flexeril.... All provided moderate 3-4 hour relief (not taken at same time, but problem solving). Shot of Decadron has lasted 12 hours already with just mild side effects. Nausea, mood swing, fatigue. I am not sure how long it will be effective, but it amazed me. Saved me an ER trip.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	bbauc, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	55-64	3/20/2012 5:10:23 PM	I went to a clinic with what I thought was a cold and the doctor gave me an injection of Decadron 8Mg, 2cc and within an hour or so my face and neck turned red felt very flush, skin and eyes,eyelids got very dry.Presure in my eyes and ears, pain in my neck, shoulders, arms, legs. Numbness in my hands and feet. Honestly think I had a small stroke. Very irritable, severe insomina. been in ER and had IV for dehydration had to go see an endocrine doctor he ran a ton of test (no results yet) and the injection was Feb 14, 2012 and I'm still having a lot of these symptoms. I think doctors should only give drugs like that in severe cases and mine was far from severe.Had a reaction last year to Fludrocortizone so now I'm wearing a medic alert for steriods and I'm not sure if it's all of them of just certain ones. That in itself is scary because I may need them one day in a life threating situation.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/10/2011 3:08:58 PM	Every Autumn for the past few years, I get a cold/sinus/allergy symptems going on and it usually ends up in my chest and does have evidence of infection by being the color of GREEN!  The last three times I recieced the shot from my doctor which is free with most insurances or a low cost of $10.00 I felt fabulous the next day and everything seems to just disappear?!  I do suggest for people to look this drug up and see what all it is used for and may be helping that you might not be aware you even had in the forst place.  My only side affect so far is lots of energy the next day and less sleep for first night due to the steroid in shot.

Muscle Pain and Stiffness in Shoulder, Neck and Pelvis	Lola, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	3/10/2009 10:37:26 AM	I'm woman, 69 yrs. old. After more than a year with debilitating and disabling back, neck and pain on walking, my HMO changed my primary physician and during my first visit I received a shot of this wonderful medicine. Within 10 minutes I was pain free, could move my head in any direction, was able to walk without pain in my pelvic 'girdle' and I'm so very happy again and full of energy, last night I swept and mopped my kitchen and dining and family room areas. This morning I'm still pain free. I had been taking ibuprophen 500mg after trying other much more expensive prescribed meds. with mixed results. Had become depressed thinking this pain was going to be with me for the rest of my life. Now I have hope and feel no pain in my neck, back or pelvic areas.

Other	webmdbeliever, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/20/2009 2:42:33 PM	The Dr gave me a shot of this in my arm today to help relieve my terrible sore throat that I have had for 4 days.  My sore throat had left me unable to sleep, eat, or talk.  Within 2 hours, relief was evident.  I just seem to be a bit sleepy, but that may be due to a recent lack of sleep.  The injection site had a pretty good sense of burning pain a few minutes after the shot, but it has now disappeared completly.

It was given to me 12 hours ago &amp; since then I have been taking Aleve as well but no side effects so far.  I was very happy with the relief it gave me.

Skin Rash with Sloughing	JOSHSKORN, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/27/2007 8:43:46 PM	I was in my doctor's office getting a routine checkup.  I'd been suffering from cellulitis for a while now and I'm on Zyvox, which had started giving me diarrhea.  My doctor gave me a Bentyl injection in my butt which did nothing for me but gave me a skin rash breakout all over my body approximately 10 minutes after I took it.  The Decadron injection reversed this reaction over about 20 minutes or so and I was fine after that.  My doctor's office called my house a few hours later just to check up on me, which I never would've expected.  I was at work.

Other	MaryMDuff, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/13/2007 9:00:59 AM	My husband has had to make several trips to the ER very late at night due to the extreme pain from Gout from his toe/ankle and elbow. Of everything he has been perscribed by his doctors with consideration to his health and chronic kidney failure an ER Doctor ordered a shot of Decadron and within 6 hrs he had almost full mobility restored along with a greater reduction in the pain... far greater reduction than any of the Rx pain meds put together. But he has also found other benefits of this drug for his particuler health problems and non health problems. He has a greater ability to move around and feel more steady on his feet, sinus drainage due to meds has been greatly reduced and the list goes on.
