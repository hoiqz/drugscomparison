Absence of Menstrual Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	8/15/2012 9:53:57 AM	I was on the depo shot for 6 years and didn't have a period at all.  I decided that I may want another child sometime possibly in the near future so I started Necon to help get my period back and to regulate it.  Well....I did get my period back however now after using necon for approx. 6 mths my periods are only 1 day so it defeats the purpose of getting my period back.  Also, I have had alot of emotional changes while taking this birth control, I am very emotional and around time for my period seems like anything can make me cry.  I also have experienced mood swings since starting necon.  I really am just not happy with this birth control.  I wouldn't recommend this if you are considering pregnancy eventually.

At first, it helped very little but after 3 months my face has completely cleared up. However every time I start a new pack, I get extremely sick and nauseous on  the first monday and maybe tuesday. But overall I'm very happy with it because it helped my acne alotttt.
Birth Control	LilLaur, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	7/26/2012 12:07:47 PM	I have only been on this pill for a few months. I have noticed weight gain, water retention, and abdominal bloat/cramps/pain.I am not very satisfied my my particular side effects--I am an avid runner etc., and have STILL gained weight from this!My abdomen is so bloated, my pants/shorts barely fit me, and I am just very uncomfortable. I think I am going back to my doctor to complain about this!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	7/20/2012 4:09:04 PM	I would NOT recommend this medication to anyone.  In the first month I experienced headaches, breast tenderness and breast swelling. After 3 months I experienced severe itching on my jaw, chin and neck, dizzyness and lightheadedness with nausea. Once I realized those were side effects of the pill I promptly contacted my physician who switched my medication right away.

When I first took it I constantly stayed with headaches everyday it felt like minutes. Then I started seeing my periods go on and off. The doctors stated that it was normal until two years ago I &quot;thought&quot; I was pregnant until I let three months go by and no period. Finally I went to the doctor, I wasnt pregnant months later no period. Since then I have not had one period... I would say beware of this birth control to the effect it messed up my system now we have to plan kids the MORE EXPENSIVE way!!!!!
Birth Control	LidB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	6/22/2012 1:13:56 PM	I have been on this for about 2 years. The only problem is I do not get my period AT ALL on this. I am associating the pill with this since I used to always get my period with the pill I used before. I am thinking of switching, since this is very odd to me. I wonder if anyone else has experienced this as well??
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	TMF8484, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	6/20/2012 12:20:35 PM	I began taking this because I spotted regularly and I was going into menapause. I had no risk factors that would indicate I would have a problem. I took it without incident for almost a year. Then one day I developed a horrible headache that would not go away. I wound up in the hospital with deep vein thrombosis on my brain. The doctors told me I was very close to having a severe stroke. I had no other risk factors for stroke. I don't smoke and I am not overweight, nor do clotting problems run in my family. They are convinced it is this pill. Be careful. I found it worked well, but long-term use at age 48 was potentially catastrophic - at least for me. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	6/18/2012 9:17:49 PM	after three weeks, the only symptoms I have experienced with this medication is breast tenderness and slight breast growth. I was on depo provera for 4 years before this so it's an adjustment taking a pill everyday, but of course that's my own battle! I haven't felt any changes within my mood, appetite, or libido.I'll be sure to update my experience with necon 1/35 in a few months!
Birth Control	mim, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/30/2012 1:18:10 PM	I had only 3 pills of this drug and have ended up in ER because of heartache and potential heart attack of blood clotting. I still have to go for evaluation and monitoring. This pill is horrible and I would not recommend this to anyone. 
Birth Control	rosie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/28/2012 2:14:24 AM	I was on Yasmin for the last 3 years, and I guess it was because my body was used to it, but I had other birth controls before yasmin and felt the same with them however; with Necon I have become someone I don't know. I get horrible headaches that wont go away, I have very light periods but very painful crams, the PMS that comes with it, is horrible. I have outbreaks and I cry every single month and get really emotional and depress I also think it makes my immune system suffer since I've gotten sick twice while on the pill. at first i thought it was because my body was not use to this birth control so I decided to give it a few months. it has been exactly 4 months and I HATE IT!! I am an emotional roller coaster and I get sick easily! I have been on other birth controls besides yasmin in the last 5 years and I have never felt like this before. I can't believe all the positive comments before mine, and when I go to my check up next month I am asking my doctor for a new brand. 
Birth Control	xoxoallielove, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	5/12/2012 1:13:25 AM	This is the only birth control i've ever been ob but I love it. I get heaadaches sometimes from it, but they go away with ibuprofen.  i used to have 5 or 6 day periods, very heavy, very crampy, and i'd get sick before them (fever, high blood pressure, dizziness, etc) and now it'd like oh i'm on my period? Didn't notice. It's like 2 days and pain free and easy. I've only been on it about 5 and a half months, but even though my boyfriend and I have unprotected sex 2 or 3 times a week on average, i've yet to get pregnant. i've missed a few pills here and there and taken Next Choice just in case once, and missing a pill can make my emotions a little out of whack, but they get back on track in about 2 days (:

I have to say I was spotting for two weeks 14 days exactly and bled heavily for 3 days. I felt nauseated and had a headache and felt dizzy but it went away. I like it and I set an alarm to remind me to take it on time.I don't like that I tried to hide it from my mom and she noticed u was bleeding even though my cloths. I feel fine now. Just give it a try (:

Anyways I feel no big changes and this is the first bc Iv been on no one knows and they havnt said anything about my mood and my acne has decreased yay(: but yes give it a try (:
Birth Control	Sara323, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/24/2012 11:26:39 PM	After bouncing around for some time from birth control to birth control my doctor finally prescribed me Necon 1/35. I found this to be the most effective form of oral contraceptive for myself with relatively no negative side effects. I set an alarm on my iphone for the same time every day and have never missed a pill, therefore i find the ease of use of this pill to be very easily manageable.Other pills that i have been on have given me yeast infections, violent mood swings, low libido and various other complications but on Necon my periods have been lighter ive noticed less cramping and not a single negative side effect. Birth control is different from person to person but Necon 1/35 is definitely worth a shot if you are considering it.

Birth Control	nthenshewaslyke, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/5/2012 2:13:06 PM	just wanted to get on here and let everyone know that when i read these reviews i freaked out- but i still decided to give it a try. I was on Yasmin for about 3-4 years then was put on Ocella which was fine until the third month where i had breakthough bleeding so i thought id give Necon 1/35 a try. I have been on it for a week so far and i think i have lost maybe 2lbs of water weight ( probably from the ocella) and so far so good. no mood swings- ive actually calmed down a lot and i can feel it! my appetite had decreased for some odd reason. boobs are the same, weight is somewhat the same and my sex drive (most importantly lol) is the same. i know that a week is not long enough to see drastic changes. I plan on giving another update next month. I am also planning to take two packs continuously to regulate my period. anyways.. everyones body is different and so far necon has been great! i read somewhere that if you are switching pills (depending on the estrogen and progestin levels - if the new pill has a higher or lower dose- there are going to be differen effects. http://www.integrativepsychiatry.net/hormone_bala nce.html hope this helps
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/26/2012 3:56:12 PM	I have been on this pill for over two years now and I absolutely love it. Before I got on this pill I have 7 day period, horrible cramps, PMS, and acne breakouts. Since I've been on this pill, I only get 2 day periods, I just about never get cramps and if I do they don't hurt really bad. My PMS is completely gone and I no longer get acne breakouts. This pill is also extremely effective when it comes to preventing pregnancy. I recently got out of a 2 year year relationship, but over those two years my boyfriend at the time and I were very sexually active, I've missed pills, had condoms break and even (stupidly) not used one at all. And throughout all these situations I never once became pregnant. 
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	3/23/2012 1:10:49 PM	I was on Necon for 7 mos. I was switched to it from Yaz(which I honestly loved but was afraid due to the horror stories). I don't think I've been this unhappy w/a bcp before. I've had extreme mood swings(crying hysterically for no real reason) and gained approx 15 lbs with regular exercise and watching my diet. I would spot during the 2nd week of the pack and the 3rd week was horrible. Severe breast tenderness and cramping/back pain. I basically had all of my &quot;usual&quot; symptoms(when off bc) for 2 weeks a month. My period was also lasting 7-10 days and very heavy. I gave it time for my body to adjust but it just got worse. I finally switched this week and already feel a little more myself. If you experience any of these symptoms, please don't wait as long as I did...3 months to adjust and if not, change. I wish I had... 
Birth Control	Sp1992, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	3/20/2012 3:14:11 AM	I've been on this pill for three weeks and my appetite has decreased! I'm not constantly eating or feel bloated. I was on ortho tri cyclen lo before, but it made me gain a lot of weight. But this pill is a miracle pill for me! My breasts are tender but it's tolerable. No complants so far. I'm very happy and satisfied with necon 1/35 :)
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	3/19/2012 5:45:16 PM	I've been on Necon for about 7 months. I've felt like a completely different person. I've had severe mood swings, my anxiety is through theh roof, and I'm exhausted all the time. I've also experienced the breakthrough bleeding during the 2nd wk of the pack every month. The back pain and cramping begin during the 3rd wk of the pack and stay through my period(which is longer than when on any other pill, ~7days). That third week, my breasts are extremely tender but luckily that only lasts the week. Aside from all of that, I've gained about 15 lbs (and an additional 5 lbs of water weight during my period). At 5'4, that is a lot. I'm very active and a vegetarrian who pays close attention to diet. I have even been following WW for the last 3 months. I have not dropped a pound. I say avoid this at all costs. I know everyone is different but I've tried quite a few different pills over the last 16yrs and this is BY FAR THE WORST! I had my doc switch me today so I don't have to start another month on this horrible birth control.
Birth Control	AJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/13/2012 1:45:54 PM	I was switched to Necon (generic Ortho Novum)one year ago after experiencing horrible PMDD-like symptoms from Yasmin for several years.  Not only did my horrible mood swings finally disappear, but my period now only lasts 2-3 days tops, it keeps my skin clear and I've experienced no weight gain while taking it (in fact, I've lost a little).  Like all BC pills I've taken over the years, it is definitely a sex-drive killer but that's a minor thing to deal with, after the monster Yasmin turned me into each month!
Birth Control	chellycheerios, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	2/10/2012 2:42:49 AM	Ive been taking this pill for 7 mo. and there has been no problems with it so far. Light periods, no cramps (I hardly get any cramps anyways),my breast did grow 2 cups bigger but I think my pregnancy had a lot to do with it. I hate the fact that theres times when I forget to take it but Ive managed to find a way by setting my alarm clock on my phone.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	19-24	2/3/2012 5:42:50 PM	I started taking this to get rid of my cramps and &amp; heavy bleeding, which it did. However, I wake up every night sick to my stomach and has killed my sex drive! Definitely not worth it! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/27/2012 8:41:59 AM	I've been on a ton of pills over the past 10 years, and this one was probably the best. I was on Yaz/Yasmin and the mood swings and yeast infections I would get before my period were so bad I couldn't take it anymore. I was on this pill for a year before I decided to try something new. The only problem I had with it was that my breasts were swollen 2 weeks out of the month and it makes me hold 2-3 lbs of water weight when I am getting close to my period. Other than that it was great!

Endometriosis	sammy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	12/14/2011 4:58:12 PM	I started on this pill after going to the emergency room and being told I may have endometriosis. I have had only a few side effects with this pill.  I am more tired and also a slight mood change.  However, the biggest side effect for me was my breasts became extremely large and sore after only 3 weeks of taking this pill.  I already wear a size 34D and I am a thin woman, too. I feel like they are noticeably larger, not to mention very painful.  I actually thought I MUST be pregnant to be having these symptoms.. I am not however.  I thought my side effects were slightly bad, but after reading all of these reviews (weight gain and depression etc.) I will not be taking this pill anymore!

It gave me terrible headaches, w/c I did not relate to this pill as I was on my 3rd pack by the time I reacted. Of course the pain made my blood pressure erratic w/c created another problem. Don't get a lot of headaches other then than during my period but this one lasted a week until my doctor advised me to stop taking it.

I barley have any cramps on my period, and it is very light and only last for around 3 days. The one down side tho is that i have gained a bit of weight( about 5 lbs in the past 2 months, which isent awful!) Another thing i noticed was my breast size grew tremendously, I went from a small B to a 34D! my skin got pretty bad for a while but is now starting to clear up which is really great. 
Birth Control	Birdie, 19-24 Female 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	11/8/2011 5:16:35 PM	I was on Necon 1/35 for 6 months or so. It made me so moody, irritable and depressed. I couldn't get out of bed sometimes because I was so depressed. It made me lose a lot of weight, which for me wasn't good - I am 5'0 and usually weigh around 102 lbs - losing weight made me look anorexic, which I'm not! Before taking this pill, I ate a lot, but once I was on this pill, food became blah for me. I am off it now - yay! - and on a TriNessa again. I can deal with some mood swings, but not with very, very bad depression. I would not recommend this pill, but everyone's body is different, so find the BC that works for you.

I started liking the pill since it was helping, no longer did I have bad cramps. I have noticed some of the changes that other have mentioned and am no longer taking the pill. I have been noticing the mood changes that I have and some of the pain that others have mentioned. I am stopping taking the pill and changing to another!!! I only wish that I would have known about the reviews that people have put out there before now! Thank you to those who have reviewed and mentioned some of the side effects. I thought that I was one of the few!

I have had no major issues. Acne was never an issue, and remains a non-issue.  I first started on the pill due to excruiating cramps every month and long menstrual cycles. Since I have been on the pill (this one and the previous brand) my cycles are only 3-4 days and I have mild cramps every blue moon, but nothing unbearable prior to being on the pill.  Within the past few month I have had some weight gain, but because I have been on this pill for a long time I do not think that my weight gain is due to the pill. Overall I am satisfied.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	10/22/2011 3:11:51 AM	I only started this pill 3 days ago, I've been sick on and off thru the 3 days and have thrown up, The package says that should subside within 1-3 months. I sure hope so! After reading these reviews I'm wary, worried about gaining weight mostly being already heavy! I've had a change in appetite already though, I haven't felt as hungry but that may just be because of the nausea! Hope everything works out....
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	9/26/2011 10:06:27 AM	This is the worst b/c I have ever taken!! Hands down the worst! I have only been on it for a week and have already experienced: nausea, panic attacks, extreme tiredness, extreme anxiety, depression and a sense of worthlessness! I know this may seem dramatic, and I know that this b/c may be okay for some women, but ultimately has not worked for me. I don't recommend it at all!

My acne is little to none (sometimes one will pop up during my period). I got on Necon for extreme cramps and heavy bleeding. Necon has helped trememdously! My period is now very light and last 4-5 days instead of 7. I have noticed recently in the past 3 months that my breasts have been much more tender and that my cramps are starting to come back.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	13-18	9/19/2011 6:01:32 PM	This isn't the right pill for me. At the beginning of each month when I start the active pills again I get super sick the first day. Super nauseous, dizzy to the point it's difficult to stand and my intestines get crampy and weird. Not to mention it basically causes a panic attack. This only happens in the morning the day after I take the first active pill but it's really scary. Another annoying side effect is breast tenderness, they've been nonstop sore the whole time I've been on it.

I was on something else and my doctor changes it. I loved my previous pill. I have found an increase in appetite, which I hate eating anyway so I hate that. I dont eat because I know its just the pill and Im really not hungry! I can say that I am happy that I have NO menstrual cramps and a CLEAR face. But, it has been hard for me to lose weight. Everything I did lose I gained back since I got on this pill. I will be getting on in Jan 2012 due to getting the esure done!

I had previously been on Loestrin Fe &amp; BeYaz and it caused breakthrough bleeding every month. With Necon there is no more spotting (thank god) and I have not noticed any other side effects except I am tired and sleepy throughout the day. It's effective and side effect is manageable.

If you have really painful endometriosis and do not use the sugar pills, IT IS A LIFESAVER! All birth control pills have some side effects, you have to just try different ones to see if they work well with your system. Necon works great for me and it's inexpensive and that's important when you have to buy as many as I do.

Now I'm on this because insurance wants me on the generic, and it's horrible!  2 months in and I've gained 6 pounds, been exhausted during the day, and had my period before I was even done taking the first months pills (was not to the sugar yet, by about 4 days).  I am going off and hope to find a better solution - IUD was not it either!  Hope you have better luck than I did!

I have had breakthrough bleeding that is granted very light but it lasts for a week every other week since I have started it. I was previously on Trinessa for two months but switched to tge Necon because it was causing severe mood swings and general psycho-ness. Finally going to switch back to what I was on a few years ago, never had any problems with Sprintec in the past.

It causes severe mood swings, low sex-drive, and EXTREME weight gain.  I have put on about 50 pounds in the last year, while eating right and exercising regularly.  The only good thing about the pill is that my period is very short.

The bleeding stopped within 2 days of taking this pill. Side effects: nausea and heavy acne on my chest. I hope I can stop taking this pill asap. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	7/14/2011 11:07:58 PM	I have been on Necon for almost 2 months.  It has had fewer side effects (no acne worsening, no cramping...), but the one I have experienced has been incredibly bad.  I have gained almost 20 lbs since starting it with no changes in lifestyle.
Birth Control		5	5	5			7/11/2011 12:45:56 AM	I have been taking necon for over a year.  I have had no problems with the pill. My periods are regular, I have no break through bleeding, and have not experienced weight gain due to the pill. I find it easy to use and, so far, completely effective. Prior to using this I tried 2 other pills and experienced side effects such as slight weight gain, mood swings, and extreme breakthrough bleeding.    
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	6/30/2011 7:31:13 PM	I was put on Necon because I had horrible, long heavy periods with horrible menstrual cramps/migraines....I've taken it for 4 months now continuously, skipping the placebo pills....The great thing about this pill for me has been no periods, no break through bleeding, and no cramps!!BUT, I gained 20 pounds, am always hungry now, and i exercise and eat healthy.  I also have no sex drive now....The weight gain is just awful...

It's really hard to loose weight on this pill, and leaves you with no sex drive. My doctor just switched me to Lutera, lets see how this goes.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	25-34	6/6/2011 1:25:09 AM	I got pregnant while taking this pill and then proceeded to have an early miscarriage. I know I got pregnant due to my irresponsibility, because there was about a week or 2 of irregular pill use/taking the pill at different times/forgetting; however, I also believe I miscarried the pregnancy due to being on the pill before knowing I was pregnant, given how it changes the embryo's ability to attach to the uterine wall and changes cervical mucus... BE CAREFUL AND TAKE YOUR PILL AT THE SAME TIME OF DAY EVERY DAY! 
Birth Control	miserable, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	5/15/2011 1:38:53 PM	i am 25 years old and barely started taking birth control this year. my doctor recommended this pill because it could help eliminate the cysts that i have in my breast. i did not want to take birth control because i have heard a lot of negative comments about it, but i trusted my doctor. she put me on Ne con and i have been miserable. it gives me extreme nausea, really bad headaches, and makes me irritable. the only good thing is i did not gain weight.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	magpie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	5/10/2011 5:47:37 PM	I am in perimenopause and wanted to decrease my heavy periods and eventually reduce them.Upon starting the second week of active pills, I experienced, swollen abdomen, breasts, ankles, fingers, irritability, cramping, runny bowel movements and terrible gas.  I am switching to Aviane to see if a lower dose of estrogen will be better for me.
Birth Control	h, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/3/2011 5:11:13 PM	I was on this pill for two months, I had really bad break through bleeding on this pill, I also experienced a huge increase in hunger and weight gain. This wasn't the first time I was on the pill, I was on Tri-Nessa and Tri-Springtec, and was really happy on those pills. I never had the side effects i had with this one. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	College Newby , 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4		19-24	4/26/2011 2:24:57 AM	When I started college I started using birth control. My period was always troublesome and I thought BC would be a soultion. I first used Yaz and that was AWFUL. I bled continuously and I lost so much blood. I stopped taking it and started taking the Necon. Since then I have been so much better. I have some increased vaginal fluid like the side effects say, but is better than bleeding all the time. Its a great solution for a heavy period, I went from a full 7 to 3-5 days. I think that the less complicated and the less your birth control does, the better. Great for girls who have never had anything like this in their system before. I take it every night before bed and while changing to a 3x a year pill sounds tempting I dont want to mess up my system again, especially when I have found something that works. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	4/18/2011 10:30:17 AM	Some may say this is not long enough to tell anything...I have been on Necon for 5 days and have gained 5.5 pounds. Since noticing the weight gain I have been trying to eat healthier and exercise more but the weight just keeps adding up, I am calling my doctor today to hopefully switch to something else. I am not willing to wait an entire month and 20 pounds later to stop

I have been taking it for about 5 months and while I was cleaning I accidentally threw my pack away. Being off for a week has been horrible I have been so depressed this week. I'm getting back on very soon. I hvent had any irregular bleeding and I know exactly when my period is going to come ad when it's done. I have never had that with any other birth control. I really like necon.

Birth Control	geminigrapefruit, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	3/21/2011 1:22:25 PM	I swicthed to this after Ocella became a tier 3 Rx. This was one of about 3 options I was given for a generic. I switched for about 6 months and I am very happy to no longer be on it. As others have started I gained close to 30 pounds in 5 months while still eating right and exercising. I would go through terrible depressive mood swings and didn't connect it to this medication because a pill had never caused it before. Just beware, after the weight from this pill is put on it's really difficult to get off. I finally shed the last of the weight almost 10 months later. I wish I had made the connection sooner!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	3/3/2011 9:54:50 PM	This pill works in the sense that it gets rid of my period cramps, but that is it. It has caused me to gain a large amount of weight (50 pounds) in the course of 1 1/2 years. I have been exercising, eating healthy and I know it is this pill that is not allowing me to lose any weight. I have been on other BC pills and I have NEVER had this weight issue, and I eat and exercise the same as I did on previous pills, if not better. Also lately the one good thing about this pill has changed. I am now getting menstrual cramps and breakthrough bleeding. FML!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	3/2/2011 6:48:34 PM	I do not recommend this pill, I know that drugs work different with different people but literally almost every review I have read about this drug has sucked and my own experience with it just proved it to be true. I in all honesty switched from Apri to Neco I have breakthrough bleeding that begin in week 2 and it now week 5 (i skipped the sugar pill week seeing as I already got a period) and I am still having breakthrough bleeding accompanied by irritation down there. This pill has made me miserable I have no sex drive and feel gross. I'm switching back as soon as this month is over!!!

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	1/18/2011 5:53:39 PM	I have been on this pill for almost a year and never thought it was causing any of my health issues. I was put on it after having my second child as a birth control and in that year I have gained 20 lbs. I have terrible mood swings, cramping which I never had before, irregular periods, loss of interest in sex, and low energy levels. I work out regularly and eat well but after testing myself for all heriditary problems my doctor asked me to try getting off the pill for a few months to see if it was the culprit. I have only been off for a week and already feel better. I am glad to see I am not the only person suffering from the terrible side effects of this pill. 
Birth Control	katiegray, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	1/17/2011 4:01:14 PM	This is a great pill if you only want to be on birch control for 2-3 years, other than that it sucks. I have been taking this pill since I was 20, and I am now 23. I am just now having break through bleeding and am NOT happy about it. This pill was great, my periods were lighter, and my cramping was not as bad, and it somewhat cleared up my face. I have had BTB for the past 2 weeks now because of this dumb pill. I guess it only works for 3 years and my body just got immune to it. Time for an upgrade!
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Nmiller1988, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	12/28/2010 1:46:48 PM	I am 22 years old and have been married for 3 years now. I started my period at age 10 and had never missed or been late for my period until this year. I had been suffering from severe pain as well as missed periods. My doctor prescribed me for this medicine and the first Month was horrible. I wanted to cry half of the time. My husband did not know what was wrong with me. My period was very light as if it was not even there. The second month it got better, mood swings calmed down some and my period was a normal period for three days. The thrid month was horrible. Mood swings I had two long, but light periods that month, mainly because I had been forgetting to take the pills on the right time for the days. I am now in my fourth month and it is going GREAT, no more mood swings, taking it regularly and everything is good. I would recommend this product to a friend. I would just strongly inform them that the first couple of months are rough, but to stick it out and everything would be ok (as long as they take the pills as directed.)

Originally I was started on it due to my severe menstrual cramps and long periods, and now use it for birth control. My periods are so much lighter, lasting 3-4 days. I also at the time was having mood swings and depression-and starting on this birth control seemed to help with that as well. I've never had any side effects and never any break through bleeding!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	12/17/2010 3:15:56 PM	I am a 22 year old female who has had breakthrough bleeding since I started my period at 16. I have been on ortho tri-cyclen lo (my main pick), the ring, femcon, and many many other forms of the pill. For the first time in 6 years - I have not had breakthrough bleeding! This pill was a miracle for me after so long of trying to find something to stop BTB. Luckily, I have a boyfriend who does not care about BTB during sex, but I was still ever searching for a pill to stop it. Well, Necon 1/35 definitely made things pretty regular (took it continously for 3 months), but unfortunately, for the first time in my life I got Bacterial Vaginosis. Now I can't say that this pill caused it, but my doctor said it is a definite possibility and I am pretty sure it was the pill after such a big change with the BTB. I went on Flagyl to cure it, which it did for the most part, but things still seemed &quot;off&quot; down there (odor). I couldn't help but be embarrassed to have sex with my boyfriend because of the smell (he would much rather deal with the BTB), so I am now switching to Low Ogestral and hoping whatever is happening down there will stop.As far as moodiness, well it's hard for me to tell because I am already a naturally emotional person, but I didn't notice a huge change in my mentality apart from other birth control pills.I hope this works for others! It worked so well for me with BTB, but I just can't stand the PH balance it gives me. I am a very small-framed/skinny/petite woman and may possibly have polycystic ovary syndrome (may be causing my BTB). I hope this helps anyone else in a similar case to me.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	12/8/2010 6:53:39 PM	I do not like this pill from the first month of taking it I had problems with break through bleeding, mood swings, lack of interest in sex,vaginal itching and burning. I will never use this pill again nor would I recommend it.  
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	12/2/2010 2:33:37 PM	I want to punch the person who developed this pill, and my doctor. I've had mood swings, severe chest pains, awful headaches, and nausea. If I have a heart attack or a stroke at age 18, I'm going to be very angry! I'm not taking it anymore starting today, it sucks.

I just finished my second period on this medication, and called my doctor to switch to a different birth control.  I've been on other medications in the past, but have never had such terrible side effects!  My periods only last 5-6 days with a normal flow, which is nice, but not without its trade offs:-TERRIBLE cramps.  I've never experienced cramps before, and I've had my period for seven years!  These are the moan-and-groan-and-make-your-boyfriend-rub-your-f eet-while-you-hold-a-hot-pad-to-your-lower-abdomen cramps.  Awful!-Acne breakouts.  I will admit that I have acne prone skin, but I've never broken out this much as part of PMSing.-Nausea.  Even if I take the pill at night (in hopes to sleep through the initial nausea), I will still feel nauseous during the day.Of course, medications work differently on different people.  This just wasn't the birth control for me!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Whyyyyy?! :(, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	11/29/2010 10:00:01 AM	I have read some horror stories about this pill, but I don't want to knock it so  soon.  Doctors say to give new pills 3 months before you decide you hate them, and I've only been on it for a week and a half so I guess we'll see.  I have already noticed some weight gain (about 3-4 pounds), increased appetite, slight mood swings... The mood swings are nothing I can't handle but when I KNOW my emotions are irrational, I'm not a fan.  I was on the generic of yasmin (ocella) for years and it was great, then for whatever reason it stopped working and I started spotting constantly. And i mean nonstop for 4 months.  So I told my dr and she switched me to necon.  Well, again, I know it's only been a week and a half but guess who's still spotting? -_-; I have to hit the gym twice as hard because of this and it's only been a week.  I'm dreading what the story will be at the end of 3 whole months, if I can stick with it that long.  Maybe I'll write another review towards the end of the 3 months, but for right now... I'm not a fan.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/10/2010 7:57:04 PM	I started taking Necon and i have nothing negative to say about it. No out of the ordinary syptoms. Easy period, no werid mood swings, no weight gain... Only thing was occasionally feeling like i had the nasuiated feeling but besides that nothing. I would definately recommend it to a friend.

Indeed, it has prevented pregnancy.  However, who wants to have random spurts of bleeding?!  Not me! At 30 years old, I have been on-and-off the pill for more than 10 years.  And I have never experienced so much drama with another scrip or time on a pill.  Steer clear!.  I am resuming my OrthoCept script ASAP!

I am completely unsatisfied!
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	4	5		19-24	9/16/2010 8:03:11 PM	I have noticed so many bad reviews on this pill but I have yet to have any side effects outside of being nauseated sometimes. Overall I think it is a great drug and would refer it to a friend if need of a recommendation. My period is very light and no mood swings or anything. I am glad I dont have the problems other women are having.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	9/15/2010 6:59:54 PM	I, too, have had undesirable side effects from taking this birth control. Within three days from the day I started taking it, I have had horrible mood swings, and have been spotting in between periods. I have been on several other types of birth control in the past and have had NONE of these issues before. I have never in my life spotted in between periods until taking this pill. I would absolutely not recommend it and when I am done with this pack I will definitely be switching.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	9/14/2010 1:47:10 PM	I did not have any extreme side effects with this drug, but it did make me moody - so much so that I had to stop. My friends had begun to notice that I was snapping at them a lot more often and my BF and I would get into fights all the time. Definitely not something I'd go back on anytime in the future.

I'm known for being chipper, even when on my period! I've been on this pill for 5 months. I didn't put all the factors together until recently. Now I'm definitely one to avoid when its that time of the month. I had my first actual breakdown when I first started this pill, sobbing so hard I couldn't breathe while at work, over how someones tone of voice affected me. I mood swing like crazy. I'm depressed, and definitely anxious. Start my period after just one day of missing the pill. And, even though this did clear up my cystic acne I had been getting from my last pill, my superficial acne has definitely come back. I can't wait to go see my gyno to get off this.

This is my second time donating and I didn't make the connection last because I had some other things going on in my life, but yesterday I realized that I have been exceptionally MOODY (like, a nearly constant simmering rage) and somewhat depressed ever since I started taking the pills again.  I'm never like this except for now and the last time I was on the same pills, so I'm thinking it has to be related.  Seeing the other reviews that say the same thing is a big relief--I'm not going crazy! :)Fortunately I'm only on them for a few more days.  If you're prone to depression or mood swings (I'm not!) I wouldn't recommend this pill.
Birth Control	Jenblaze@aol.com, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	7/15/2010 2:46:36 AM	I have been on this medicine for 3 years.  When I first started taking it, I had TERRIBLE leg cramps.  I went for all sorts of tests to no avail, eventually they went away.  I never even considered birth control as the culprit, until now.  For the past few months i've been having chest pains on the left side.  Arm and shoulder pain, only on the left side, i went to the hospital twice thinking i was having a heart attack.  They still can't figure out why??  For some reson I was looking up on the computer side effects of this birth control and after reading them ( which i should have done a lot sooner) I have stopped them, and now I have no more arm and chest pain.  Also, i would constantly get dizzy spells...I would be in the middle of shopping or driving, and all of a sudden i would get so dizzy it felt like i was spinning...I've had all sorts of blood tests and everything is fine.  I think it was the birth control.  Some people can take this and be FINE, but everybody is different, and I think you need to see what works for you.  I did not get pregnant on this, but if I missed a pill during the month I would immedietly get cramps and my period would get all screwed up....in 3 years i missed about 5 periods.  And after looking this up, i wish the doctor would have told me that i shouldnt be taking this medicine if i have breast cancer in my family, which i told him about...on my moms side and dads side, lovely.  Honestly, i don't think i will ever use a birth control pill again.

My period normally lasts 2 to 3 days with it. The first couple months were hard to adjust to, but after 6 months on this pill its fine.

I am not alone!  This pill has made me have zero energy, have high anxiety, and feel depressed.. and I'm never ever depressed!  Also, if I happen to miss one little pill and make up for it the next day with two (as the instructions say), my period in between periods will start right away, along with cramps &amp; everything.  On other pills, that never happened.  It's like my body freaks out if I miss one and thinks I'm on my period.  Stay away from this pill :( I am switching when I see my gyno next week!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/4/2010 11:39:29 AM	I was only taking this to regulate my cycle and to help with uterine swelling between periods. In my 5th week of taking this birth control I was diagnosed with 3 blood clots in my lungs. I am 30 and do not smoke. Will never take this or any birth control again!

Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	13-18	6/26/2010 10:24:01 PM	I'm on my second pack of this pill and it has made my periods a lot lighter and less painful, HOWEVER, it has given me extreme mood swings and now that I see it is common with this pill, I am switching asap. (I have had no other side effects) I don;t reccomend it
Painful Periods	erin's managing, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	6/24/2010 12:49:36 AM	I bleed three weeks out of the four for the first three months. I have been taking necon for about 6 months now and I absolutely hate it.  The side effect I endure are painful migraines to the point of just wanting to knock myself out, depression, weight gain(12Lbs), deep pimps, sever mood swings, and more tired then usual.  Do not recommend  and totally not satisfied &quot;that's for sure&quot;! 
Birth Control	Jamboree, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/18/2010 8:39:53 AM	I have been on this medicine for 5 months the only thing that I have noticed is that I experience random moments of nausea, and annoyingly my period last for 7 days when it used to be 4 at the most. Other then that the pill works fine for me.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	6/11/2010 8:57:21 AM	In the first three months I took this pill I didn't have my period.  The pain of my Ovarian Cysts got worse.  My acne increased and I had the skins and symptoms of a  UTI but didn't actually have one.  My doctor told me to stick with it.  The other side effects stopped but I got severe mood swings.  I have never cried so much in my life.  I am normally a very easy going happy  person and this pill makes me feel like Jekyll and Hyde.  I don't recommend this pill to anyone!

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	6/6/2010 10:47:23 PM	I've been taking this pill for about three months now, and I've decided I'm going to switch ASAP. I didn't realize it being possibly related to this pill before, but I have been extremely depressed, anxious, irritable, and prone to crying frequently in the past few months. I also missed a pill this month, so doubled up as per the directions, and now I've been having a period for two weeks straight. This coming week will be the actual &quot;period week.&quot; I've also had sudden flare-ups of cystic facial acne (I'm 25 years old! Should not be happening!), which is only able to be controlled through chemical facial peels. The worst, though, has been the depression. This pill has pretty much made my hormones go haywire. It's not worth it to me. I do not recommend this pill for anyone. 
Birth Control	dawn lemons, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	6/4/2010 6:53:09 PM	When I first started taking the pill I thought it was great and it made my once extremely painful periods settle down, regulated them and made me bleed less.  I was happy at first but after 4 years of taking them I believe that they are the main cause of the health problem I am having in my life now.  After switching pills I have been feeling a little more like myself but I still am not in the best of shape I use to be.  While on Necon, I not only began having major mood swings and becoming easily agitated but also I was becoming easily depressed, unmotivated, not wanting to have sex and just was not the fun energetic person i use to be.  The longer I was on the pill the worse it was becoming.  It took me a long time to actually put the changes together as a part of taking the pill but when I aso started having gallbladder problems adn began reading peoples reviews on the pill I began to realize that the pill was most likely the culprit.  I recently had to have my gallbladder removed and they found lesions on it.  I would like it if others have had the same problems while taking this pill to please respond to this post because something needs to be done about it if the pill is causing multiple people these side effects.  Because of the problems I have encountered with this pill I have had problems being successful in college and at work.

I was put on it due to ovarian cysts and now that they are gone I want to come off of this pill immediately! I have gained atleast 20 pounds since I've been on it without any change of my diet. I used to be 5ft1in. and weigh 110. I now, at the same height, weigh 130. Not only have I gained weight, I always feel down and depressed. I have always been a very outgoing and exciting person, but ever since I began these pills I always feel bored and sad. DO NOT USE THIS DRUG! 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	5/4/2010 4:52:02 PM	I have been on necon since January.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/9/2010 1:13:32 PM	I have taken Necon for about 8 years now. I haven't had any problems yet. I recommend this to all women.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/28/2010 7:34:49 PM	I was on Necon for three years without a hitch.  About two months ago, I got off it noticing super light periods and heart palpatations as well as a racing heart and high blood pressure.  I stopped taking the birth control pills...but am not sure I they were the cause.  Always use caution, ladies.
Birth Control	CHW, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/27/2010 11:16:00 PM	I am 35 years old and have been on Necon for 6 years and love this pill. I have tried every pill on the market and this one works for me as recommended by my gyno. who also takes it. I never have experienced weight gain as I have heard others have. I never have weird mood swings and will continue to take this pill as it is an excellent fit for me. I know everyone is different and the way a pill affects people varies, but for me, I started out as a size 4 when I started this pill 6 years ago and I am still a size 4. The only thing I did have was a strange drug interaction for a 3 month period when I was taking B12 injections (due to a deficiency caused by Celiac Disease) twice a month for those 3 months and I did have 3 months of irregular periods and acne. Once we realized there was an interaction and I stopped the B12 injections, my cycle and face went back to normal instantly. I would recommend this pill to others.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/18/2010 9:19:35 PM	My doctor switched me to this in November without me noticing any side effects.  In January I noticed a dark spot on my face  &amp; apparently it's Melasma!  It can be caused by the high hormone dosage, I immediately discontinued it but I still have the small spot on my forehead.  I had no idea that that was even a possibility....beware
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	JergensScent01, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/18/2010 3:07:47 PM	I have tryed almost every birth control out there. They either gave me spotting between periods or terriable mood swings. I am new to this BC Pill - have started on my 2nd pack and I have to say I ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT! I have a history of depression and it has NOT triggered that. My periods are short, no spotting, no mood swings! I do however have a lot of breast tenderness and growth tissue - no complaints from my husband ;) went to the doctor about the growth tissue and I went up a cup size! But nothing to worry about at this time - no lumps and it is soft breast tissue.  I love this BC Pill and would recommend it to all my friends who may have had problems with BC Pills from the past.

Painful Periods	1girl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/1/2010 3:28:23 PM	Very light periods, but regular, some cramping still but have typically have bad cramps so I'm okay with that. I have migraines which coincide to inactive pills but it doesn't seem to matter which BC I'm on, they always occur that week. Definitely some moodiness/depression the week before inactive pills but again, nothing I haven't noticed on other BC's. Overall, a good (cheap) Bc to be on!

However, after a recent Dr visit, they think I have hypertension related to this pill. We will have to see in a couple months if it's true . . . 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	1/31/2010 4:17:59 PM	I have been on this birth control for about six years. It has been extremely effective and has given my light periods and few cramps. The negative side to this pill is that I have become more moody and depressed all the time. I thought it was just the week before and during my period but my mood swings have been lasting all month. Not enjoyable at all! This reviews have been very helpful to me and I plan to call my Doc  to switch to a different medication ASAP.
Endometriosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	12/31/2009 12:34:33 PM	Necon is the only birthcontrol pill that hasn't made me irritable. it doesn't make me have my period all the time like others have. the side effects havn't effected me nearly as much as the other pills i have tried. The birth control pill &quot;Avian&quot; had awful side effects, but Necon doesn't.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	12/22/2009 3:26:42 AM	i started taking this type of B.C. about a year ago.  i have a hard time remembering to take the pill everyday, but please remember that everyone is different and this pill will effect you differently, its really not as terrible as some people are saying.  if i forget to take my pill for a couple of days, I get VERY moody, and bloated.  so this has really helped to control it.

Also, I'm experiencing hair loss, which I've never had from a pill before.  While my periods are light and there are very few other side effects, the mood swings are horrible.  Going to switch.

I will say it was good for having a light menstral cycle but they still lasted around 5 or so days.

Birth Control	Casstaib, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	10/31/2009 12:16:46 PM	I was on this for four months when I developed a blood clot which, without warning, caused two seizures followed by a stoke. I'm only 29 and now I'm on blood thinners and anti-seizure medication and my next pregnancy will be high risk! PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS!!!
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	10/5/2009 11:46:45 PM	I have been taking this drug for three years so far. My doctor originally prescribed it to me to treat two benign cysts, one in the breast and another in the ovary.Both of the cysts completely disappeared within six months of taking the medication, and I haven't had any problem with cysts since.I have had lighter periods and have been using it mainly for birth control. I take it every night at around the same time, and have had no side effects except for once when I missed a dose and double dosed the next day, which resulted in diarreah.This is a combination pill, which makes it much more effective than other pills because of the higher dosage of hormones, but it also means people sensitive to those hormones will have more side effects.If you check the other reviews, all the side effects are listed in the paper packet included and apply to every other BC pill you can get on too.Remember that with any Pill, when starting and when switching, you should use another method of birth control as a backup, and be sure to check the interactions. More drugs interact with the Pill than most people realize, including dietary supplements.This pill has worked wonderfully for me and I don't plan on switching anytime soon.

Other	MLLK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	8/19/2009 1:20:30 PM	I was taking Ortho-Novum 1/35, then my insurance said they would cover it. So I got the prescription and they gave me this one - Necon. They said it was the same thing, but I have had the worst month every! I had my period for 12 days. Then it finally stopped, then I had spotting, and now my period started 4 days before the sugar pills. I have had mood swings and head aches and fatigue like crazy. This is the worst pill ever! It is not the same, and I love ortho-novum, I'm switching back even if it costs more. Nothing is worth this piece of crap drug. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	8/9/2009 11:23:18 PM	Took this for 2 months, on my second pack...just one week from the sugar pills..I started feeling real nervous like, anxious, fatigued and just wanted to do nothing.  Period lasted all 5 days and minor cramping.  Alright pill, never felt any nausea.
Endometriosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	8/7/2009 5:57:22 PM	I had taken this back in November of 2007. I found I was preg. in Feb. of 2008. I hated this pill I gained a lot weight, I also had bleed for a week twice a month.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/9/2009 3:47:34 PM	Prior to this pill I'd been on five different types of pills. The first two were for a year. Its been the more recent three that have been a hassle. My mom suggested Ortho-Novum 1/35 to me after I stopped responding to Levora normally. But due to budget I got prescribed the Necon instead. And so far, I won't complain I love it.
Birth Control	ET, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	8/4/2009 1:14:45 AM	I have used this drug for about a year and have experienced painful migraines, mild depression (I started saying I've lost my fun - I was always the energetic happy one), fatigue, and loss of apetite.  The worst is that at 27, I have deep acne sores around my jawline that look horrible, and I never had to deal with this before. After all these reviews and knowing what I've been dealing with, I'm calling my doctor to switch ASAP.  Thanks Everyone!
Birth Control	BHW07, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/17/2009 10:16:25 PM	I switched to this pill in March/09 and found out I was pregnant May/09.  I never missed a dose and was not on an antibiotic.  Previously, I as on Mircette, which I loved, but due to the cost, I switched.  
Birth Control	irritated, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	7/17/2009 8:30:03 PM	Do not take, it is lethal! I used ortho-novum, but then they switched me to this and told me it was the same thing. I don't even think so. I have almost every side effect possible and it's only been 12 days! I strongly advise not taking this medication, there are to many oral contraceptives available to torture yourself with this one.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	7/6/2009 10:25:34 AM	I started taking this to help relieve period pain and pms symptoms which had been getting worse and worse with every month. It did take care of that aspect of it, but it took my usual level-headedness and threw it out the window. I never have emotional issues at work, this pill made me emotionally and mentally unstable. I blew up at a coworker over a simple comment that normally wouldn't bother me and ended up sobbing in a manager's office, it took me about a half-hour to calm down. Not only that, but for the last week of active pills and during the week of inactive pills I was spotting, but it wasn't like normal blood. It was thick, disgusting, brown sludge. It might have been just the way the pill reacted with my specific body chemistry but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
Birth Control	heartea, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	5/30/2009 9:57:01 AM	The headaches started recently but the mood swings, feeling tired all the time was from the beginning. Weight gain almost puffy, swollen, maybe water retention, don't know. Period a week early and spotting a week later. The hairgrowth awful. The last straw was the Melasma on my face. The dermatolgist said it was from the pill. I stop taking it that day. I'm so relieved to hear all of the reviews and know it was not just me.
Birth Control	FUN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	5/13/2009 3:38:48 PM	I have been on Necon for the last 7 years and would not think about switching!!! I have maybe 4 short periods a year on this medication. 
Birth Control	jjoy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	5/9/2009 6:25:46 PM	I stopped taking Yasmin &amp; Yaz b/c of migraines &amp; asked to switch back to Ortho Novum 1/35 which I took for years before having 3 kids. Necon substituted &amp; has been awful! Little breakthrough bleeding but still had some headaches &amp; weight gain during the first cycle last month. My main concern is the tightness in my chest &amp; extreme shortness of breath I'm experiencing, plus not being able to sleep.  I've taken my last pill..calling dr. on Monday to switch.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	19-24	5/6/2009 10:06:24 PM	I didnt realize that the pill could affect you so much. I have been having chest pains and gaining weight from it. I have been on two types of birth controls before and have never had these types of side effects. Im definitely going to change. 
Birth Control	sandbgregSOCA, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	5/5/2009 1:55:28 PM	I have been on this for almost two months. Before taking this pill, I had mood swings only the week before my period. Now, I notice that everyone upsets me almost all he time. I noticed slight chest pain (one day only) similar to what I felt when we had all those fires in Southern California. I had a few head aches, but I did not think they were from the pill. I had two breakthrough periods while I was on week 2 of each pack. I hate those. My mom says it looks like I'm gaining weight, but my clothes fit the same. Since I am on county insurance, I am going to wait until July to renew my insurance and then go back to my doctor and inform him of my side effects. I'm going to keep a diary of my moods and physical symptoms. I had no clue that so many women on here were not satisfied with this drug. (So, I'm not the only one!) 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	BENTLEY44, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	5/5/2009 12:59:10 AM	i havn't had a normal period ever since i first started when i was 12.. i tried everything my doctor finally put me on necon and i started noticing that everything made me mad really easy. I started just feeling like i was mad 24/7. I didn't even start my period on the nonhormone week i started a week early and have been for 9 days straight. I have had cramps all through out my period while taking it. It's made me more irregular than i was when i wasn't taking it... I WILL NOT BE USING IT ANYMORE!!!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	4/28/2009 8:03:28 PM	I took Necon for 2 1/2 years not realizing it was a big part of my depression and mood swings.  I've been off it for 3 months and have been experiencing pain in my lower abdomen.  Also, when I was on other birth controls I was able to get pregnant immediately after stopping them, unfortunately not this time.  I don't even think I'm ovulating. I'm very frustrated. 
Painful Periods	apalmer, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	4/9/2009 11:58:16 AM	I've  been on Necon for about 2 years now, and I have my period every 6 weeks. I tried about 4 different types of bcp's before I found the right fit for me. Necon helped regulate my periods and I had a lot less side effects on this than any others that I had tried. I did notice the loss of interest in sex and spoke to my doctor about that. I recently lost my job and my doctor has switched me to Tri-Sprintec for affordability's sake. I will absolutely be making arrangements to get back on Necon! My periods were lighter and I felt absolutely in control with my mood and feelings (I'm feeling quite differently on tri-sprintec). In my case Necon has been great for me. The ONLY downside were the headaches I would experience when I took the sugar pills the last week of the pack. They were moderate but pesky and seemed to come around the beginning and end of my period.Overall Necon was my favorite choice and I want back on it!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	lelabug, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	25-34	4/8/2009 11:58:30 PM	I was prescribed bcp to help shorten my period and painful cramps. My first bcp my doctor put me on Lybrel which did not work for me at all. I bled/spotted for 4 mos straight. Got switched to Seasonale bled/spotted for a month when I just had enough I called my doctor back and he recommended that I stop Seasonale for 10 days and then start with Necon 1/35. I FINALLY stopped bleeding/spotting when I started taking my first pill with Necon 1/35. I have been on Necon 1/35 for 3 weeks now and will be coming up on my sugar pill week and so far have not bled or spotted. I have no problems with it yet and hope this will be the right bcp for me that finally will suit me. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/8/2009 1:51:58 PM	I have been on this medication for 5 months now. I have mood swings, i have gained a little weight, and I have break through bleeding very often. I am planning to switch. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	meg, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	4/7/2009 7:02:16 PM	I have only used Necon for one month and one day now, but I had mood swings, symptoms of depression and lethargy from the second week till the end of the third week.  My moods did not stop until the inactive week of my period and I instantly noticed a difference--I felt like normal again.  I was not certain that the mood swings were caused by the pills until I took the first pill of the next month and, within a few hours, I felt symptoms of depression, lethargy and mood swings again.  I called my OBGYN and asked if I should stick with it for another month to see if my body needed time to adjust, but they said no and that I should not have that reaction from a pill.  I went back to my old pill, Low-Ogestrel 28, and, only on my second day, I feel back to normal again.

Birth Control	cuteracooneyes, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	3/10/2009 10:34:26 AM	I have been on this pill for about 9 months or so. At first, it was fine and then I started to get a bunch of unwanted hair all over my body! I take BCP's so that I don't have to have my period, but I needed a higher dose because Yasmin wasn't working so well. But I think I'd rather go back to Yasmin because I didn't have ANY unwanted hair. I have yet to have the serious mood swings, but I really don't even wanna test those waters. I think I'm going to change. It was effective, but at what cost, ya know?
Birth Control	oh_stephanie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/7/2009 11:51:48 PM	I've been taking this bc pill for about two years now. My periods are WAAAY lighter than I used to have, but the only downfall is that I get horrible mood swings. It feels almost like I'm PMSing all the time. I've just been riding through it though, but now that I've read that this is a common thing, I think I'm going to switch.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	2/23/2009 2:13:23 PM	I was prescribed Necon 1/35 due to abnormally heavy periods.  I have gained weight, had horrible mood swings, have had absoulutely no energy &amp; have even had bouts of depression!  On top of all these side effects I still had bleeding!!  I was on it for a total of 6 weeks and am not taking it any more as of today!  Hate it!
Painful Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	2	Female	13-18	2/9/2009 1:58:35 PM	I started taking Neocon 1/35 because my last prescrip. wasn't working.  Now, every day between 7-9 and 1-4 (both time frames also) i get this crazy stomach ache, dizziness, and the feeling like i'm about to throw up. i plan on waiting another week, but this still seems a bit awful. don't recommend this one...
Endometriosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	2/8/2009 5:26:41 PM	The doctors said i MAY have endometriosis, so they recommended me being on this pill. I hated it. My breasts got larger and were swollen for 3 weeks out the month. I felt like I also was PMSing for about 3 weeks out the month. My relationship with my boyfriend went south, and I was always easily irritated, angry, and almost to the point of depression. I do not recomment this bc pill for anyone!
Other	LinuxGal1979, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	2/5/2009 4:05:49 PM	Necon 1/35 is horrible!!  Since taking it I have experienced an itchy rash on my breasts, (only while on the active pills..it goes away during the sugar pill week), severe migraines right before and during my period, swollen breasts, extreme fatigue, weight gain, mood swings, depression...the list goes on....a complete 180 from my normal self...I know it's the pill!  Too bad it has taken 6 months to realize the culprit.  
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Grape, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	2/4/2009 8:54:58 PM	This is the first time I've been on birth control. I have been using the pill for about 6 months, and I feel really tired all the time, I get really depressed, and my chest has started hurting a lot. I also missed my period, blood work has proven I'm not pregnant though.

Birth Control	Maud, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	2/2/2009 4:58:13 AM	I have been taking necon for over a year now and didnt think it may not be good for me until recently. My sex drive has been almost nothing the past few months, I have been depressed and my mood swings have gotten so bad that I dont realize I even had one till long after. None of this is characteristic of me and from what I have been reading on other sites, I do not seem to be the only one. For a while I have been thinking im depressed and thats whats causing everything else, but I keep finding more ways all my symptoms could be attributed to this pill. Im thinking about getting a different prescription. Also, I am always tired! Which is weird because im generally a very active and outgoing person.
Painful Periods	missmelodyr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	1/14/2009 10:15:04 PM	I have been on this medicine for about 12 years.  I have a 3 day period with no break through bleeding unless I miss pills.  As far as I can tell it is affective in preventing pregnancy.  It made my cramping bearable.  Aleve taken the day my period begins prevents cramps all together.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	koolaid_mom3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	1/2/2009 1:58:24 PM	I took this medication because I was having a ongoing period that was lasting for several months. When I took this I had a migrane for about 3 days. Be very careful if you have migranes due to hormones. I am about to go on a lower dose drug for my bleeding. 
Birth Control	bcpill, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	12/3/2008 6:23:15 PM	I was on this drug for about a month when I had to get off of it. This drug has caused severe naseua, mood swings, and depression for me. I am going back to my doctor tomorrow to try a different type of birth control pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/21/2008 1:17:53 PM	I started necon about 3 months ago (my first time on birth control) and the only side effect I experienced was slight nausea during the first month and a period that lasted 2 weeks. I started this birth control at the end of the summer when I had gained about 5 pounds from lots of beers and hot dogs and have since returned to my normal weight (which was something I was worried about when starting the pill) 
Birth Control		5	5	5			9/3/2008 11:54:06 AM	I had none of the more serious side effects with this pill; my only side effect was irregular/missed periods during the first few months of use. A very good pill to take: 100% effective in my experience. Easy to take and easy to stop.
Birth Control	hiprincess22, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	8/21/2008 9:37:02 AM	I started this pill 3 weeks ago and every single day I have been woken from sleep with painful cramps that occur like clockwork. I am hoping it will subside (sooner than later) but I know that when I was on Demulen this did not occur.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1	Female	13-18	7/26/2008 5:42:01 PM	I was started on Levora-28, and  I took it for about 5 months. It did not work for me at all I had bleeding for 4 weeks straight, stopped for 2 weeks then started again.. Painful cramps... overall it just made my cycles worse than ever. so they just started me on necon 1/35 (28) I have only taken it for 1 day but am hoping it will work. Thanks for all the information and other reviews. 
Endometriosis	nadia232, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	5/27/2008 10:23:54 AM	I've been on this pill for almost 9 months. For the first 3 months it really wasn't working now my cramps are lighter but I still have to take something ontop of it. I'm having crazy mood swings and depression and I've never really had a heavy period but I'm starting to and my chest is starting to get even bigger not that I even need it. I'm definately about to switch to something else.
Birth Control	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	2	1	1		25-34	5/16/2008 3:49:03 PM	I have been taking this pill for 2 months now; after being on Ortho Novum 777 for 10 years.  I was switched becasue my period became lighter and my cramps became very painful.  I hate these pills!  I have been on my period with a heavier flow than I have ever experienced.  The cramps are gone, but my breast are itchy and tender they have gone up a cup size and I didn't need that at all.  It majorly increased my appetite as well.  I am working on finding another GYN so that I can try somthing else.  I would not suggest these to anyone.  
Birth Control		1	1	1			4/8/2008 6:50:03 AM	This stuff makes me bleed MORE than ever!! AND I have only have been taking it for a week and Im bleeding!!!!!!! WTF!!!!!!!!!
Absence of Menstrual Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	3/3/2008 11:30:21 AM	Was put on this BC because my regular BC that ive taken for 12 years(Ortho Tri Cyclen) might not have enough estrogen in it. My Cycle would start on a tuesday, and for the past year or 2 it been getting later and lighter until I just had a spot(literally a spot!!) one month. im not sure if this is normal or not and really cant find info about this occuring. Does anybody know if this is common or not?

I was on it for one year and once I switched to a different birth control pill (Tri-Levlen/Triphasil/Trivora) I returned to my normal self again and have been on this new pill ever since (4.5 years now).

It makes me able to function ten days before the start of my cycle.  Without this pill every day, I am a bat flying out of hell mid-month, a puke factory at the beginning, and bed-ridden the week of my cycle, bleeding to death in pain.  Best taken with food at night, to prevent nausea the next day.
