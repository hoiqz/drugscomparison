Nausea and Vomiting	cat, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	6/14/2012 7:02:13 PM	This medicine did help with the severe nausea I had, but beware of it if you get migraines. One pill caused a migraine that lasted for 3 days. I decided I would rather have the nausea than the migraine so I stopped using it.
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/24/2012 9:46:25 AM	My doctor prescribed this immediately after I told her my nausea had progressed to vomiting at 8 weeks. I do not vomit easily so although it doesn't sound as bad as the other reviewers, the nausea really was severe. I was living on ginger ale and saltines and now I can eat real food and get through the workday in some comfort!

Now I can at leaset function at work and home.  The only complaint I have, is the cramping and constipation are making it hard to decide which is worse - the nausea or the uncomfortable side effects!

I have tried Phenegran and a few other anti-nausea meds with little or no relief. The very first dose of zofran I took helped amazingly! No more nausea and no more vomiting!! This is truly a miracle drug (at least for me anyway). I haven't had ANY side effects. The only down side is that it is very expensive. Luckily I have insurance, so it only cost me 6 dollars for 6 pills (generic).

Doctor ordered home health and Zofran by SubQ - I had a 24 hour pump that delivered a constant dose throughout the day.  It was the ONLY thing that helped me.  Without my pump I would still be so sick.

Took the pill for several days after each chemo cycle as a followup as I experienced nausea and Zofran made life better. Experienced some headache with the first use but as the weeks continued no additional side effects.  Three months later I had started radiation and per my doctor suggestion to use Zofran for possible nausea I found that I was experiencing constipation and some dizziness. After the first week I stopped taking the pill and discovered no further problems.  Overall very satisfied.

Started taking this and boom- no more nausea! wonder drug! Took it my entire pregnancy and had no more nausea, unless I missed a dose by accident.  Keep taking at same times everyday and you won't have this problem.  Little did I know that I would be taking this same drug a year later for cancer treatment. Very powerful stuff, and it works!

As long as I took this drug on schedule my nausea was well controlled, at most times non existent.  I had 8 rounds of 4 hour chemo, so this really helped.

After the second dose, taken 8 hours later, he developed a raised rash running up the sides of his neck, up the base of his skull and an area on his side. He also complained of neck stiffness and pain. After giving him Singulair, the rash subsided and Motrin took care of the pain.

I usually fell ill at week 5, starting the drug by week 6. Initially, it minimized the nausea, but by week 8, it was no match for the surging hormones that made me miserable. I found it adequate for taking of the &quot;edge,&quot; but not a total solution for any woman with hyperemisis. To ward off the constipation associated with this drug, Miralax works quite well. I recommend drinking it with your favorite juice.

Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/12/2010 4:19:39 PM	I am one of the unlucky ones who has been feeling sick my entire pregnancy.  When I first started the zofran it worked wonders, but a month in it stopped working as well. To remedy the situation I would take the pill about an hour before I had to get up out of bed. I would try to sleep to let it kick in, otherwise the pill and whatever in my stomach would come back up.  It has been so wonderful to take this medicine.  Consitpation in the beginning was pretty bad, but as I progressed through my pregnancy I only have to take half a pill in the early morning and I'm good.

Dr.s kept saying I have this and that and finally I said can I just get something for the pain and nausea, and I'll be on my way!!! They gave me Zofran, and I felt awesome, Ten years of having all sorts of conditions and no answers, finally something to ease the nausea. If you take this drug when absolutely need to, it works seriously! Saves you money on gas to the ER, and your sanity, because the just don't know what you have..

I am the poster child for stomach side effects caused by medication.  First time I took both and immediately starting feeling nausea.  This continued for 2 days so I consulted with WebMD and learned from other reviews that Zofran was causing nausea.  I stopped taking the Zofran and started feeling better.  Net, the Zofran made me feel worse/nauseated, than not.

At first it worked but by weeks 8/9, I was still vomiting while on the meds and the consitpation and bloating was unbareable. So I decided to stop taking the meds and went from vomiting 3 times a day to 1x a day (or a few days without vomiting). And after 1 week of pune juice (yuck!), the consitpation eased up.

I am taking the 8 mg ODT tabs now. I do NOT remember this constipation problem before! Also, it does not work as long as the 8 hr. dose frequency. I am wondering if the difference in the previous wonderful experience and this constipation pain could be from the dosing? I thought I was on a 4-6 hr. dose frequency previously, but it was a long time ago. I don't remember having problems still being nausous either. Does anyone have any info on this?

I was given phenegren instead, which has its own share of side effects, including drowsiness and double vision, but no additional pain.

We  went through every pill known to man to help and none did. They decided to try this and it worked. This pill is the only thing I was able to take and not end up in the hospital due to dehyrdration. I absolutely love it. Now that I am pregnant the moment that I start getting to where I cannot control my vomiting I take one and I am better in an hour or so. It is an awesome pill and I am so thankful that my doctor perscribed it to me when I was younger.
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/22/2009 1:08:05 PM	Currently 12 weeks pregnant and have been taking generic zofran as needed for a few weeks. It works very quickly and lasts. I find that I do not need to take it as often as is acceptable because it is still working up to a day after any given dose. My doc did not have me try any other medicines first because the others cause sleepiness and that just wouldnt work with my job. Even though it has been approved by my doctor, I am still very cautious about taking it and do not unless I feel like I cant continue my day without some assistance.

Have been hospitalized 3 times and each time they give me zofran iv and i feel human again almost immediately! I just wish my insurance would cover the pill form because even the generic is 10$ a pill and i take 4 a day extremely unaffordable without insurance guess i will just have to keep going to the hospital because they do cover the iv. This is definetly a miracle drug to stop my nausea!

Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	LA_Mommy_Of_3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/18/2009 3:44:01 AM	Zofran became my best friend with my last pregnancy! I used the orally disintegrating tablet, it was so easy &amp; worked fast. In my two pregnancies before this last one I used phenergan &amp; it made me want to sleep all the time, but I continued to take it because I would rather put up with the tiredness than the vomitting. Although w/ the majority of pregnancies, nausea &amp; vomitting ends after the 1st trimester, mine didn't! With all three of my pregnancies I was severely ill through out the entire nine months of each one. When my OB gave me Zofran with my last pregnancy I wanted to kiss her...LOL! It was such a god-send. I could actually function on a normal level without having to run the the restroom to vomit numerous times as day. I will admit the taste of it is pretty nasty but I just learned to hold my breath for those few seconds it took to melt &amp; swallowed it down with some water, &amp; that was it. I think the key to getting it to work the fastest in pregnancy so you don't vomit is to keep it next to your bed with a glass of water &amp; take it as soon as you wake up in the morning. That worked the best for me, I would take it before I even got out of the bed because I knew, if I didn't, as soon as I would stand up I would have to make a run for the restroom to vomit.

I have crohns disease and I also take an anti-depressant that was making me nauseous.  I tried Compazine and that didn't work as well as Zofran.  I would recommend this drug to anyone who has any nausea.  My only complaint about the drug is that it makes me a little sleepy but that only last a little while.
Nausea and Vomiting	eli_loves_rob, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/9/2008 10:49:11 PM	I had to take this medication due to severe vomiting because of problems with my gallbladder while I waited to have surgery.  It has been giving me headaches where my head feels like it weighs a ton, but overall, I would take the headache pain over having nausea any day!  You need to have excellent insurance for this medication.  It runs approximately $475 for a weeks worth.  But totally worth it!

I'd taken phenergan before, but my doc suggested trying Zofran, since it doesn't make you as sleepy.  (And I needed to function at work). I'd given it in IV form where I work (nurse), but not the oral form of it. What a difference!  No nausea.  Not sleepy. No side effects--yet anyway. And my insurance covered it!!!  I would redomment it to anyone with nausea....no matter the cause!
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	9/18/2008 9:42:16 PM	I have severe nausea with my third pregnancy without vomit.  This drug eased my nausea but the severe constipation and stomach cramps were worse than the original nausea!  I ended up with more nausea because my digestive system was so backed up!  The label only indicated headaches so only through research did I discover the drug as the source of my problem.  
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/11/2008 11:40:01 AM	This drug workeed great for my excessive vomiting in pregnancy.  I totally agree that you must have insurance to get this.  I do not have prescription coverage and 20 pills cost $263.00.  Totally worth it!!
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	7/14/2008 9:38:58 PM	This medication was very effective at ceasing my nausea due to pregnancy. And, this medication has recently been made generic! So, it is definitely affordable to anyone now.

We got the liquid form of this medication and it has been a Godsend! Need very good insurance though, without it would've cost us $650 for a small bottle.
Nausea and Vomiting	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/27/2008 10:53:18 PM	I took Zofran to control the nausea/vomiting that was brought on by percocet following minor outpatient surgery. It was a godsend!! It reduced my nausea by 80% &amp; stopped the vomiting completely. However, you'd better have good insurance because without it, my 5 pill prescription would have been $132!!

Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy		5	5	5			4/10/2008 12:49:08 PM	I had to use this during my second pregnancy after trying bothe phenergan and Tigan.  Zofran was the only thing that kept the food down. I just wish it didn't cost so much
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/27/2008 9:57:28 AM	This drug was recommended to me by a friend. I had severe morning sickness with my first two pregnancies and now pregant for the third time and sick again. I was not doing well taking care of two older kids and working full time. I tried Phenergan at first and did nothing for me. Zofran has worked great. I take it twice a day and have not thrown up since taking it and can actually function at work. I am very tired at the end of the day but that's a side effect of pregnancy not the drug :)
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	3/26/2008 1:23:51 AM	I recently became severely allergic to phenergan while in the hospital for ulcers.   While recovering, I have had to continue taking medicine occasionally to keep my nausea under control. This has been the only anti-nausea medicine to work for me so far. Although, Zofran cause TERRIBLE headaches in my experience. I'm not sure if I would prefer the extreme nausea or the almost unbearable headaches.

I would take a Zofran and in 5 minutes I was feeling just fine and able to get back to sleep. This medication is a godsend.
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		3/13/2008 9:14:49 AM	Zofran worked well with no side effects for excessive vomiting during pregancy.  The generic form did not work as well.Zofran was also used 5 years later for nausea caused by strong antibiotics.  It had no side effects, like those associated with phenergan, which can make patients lethargic.

Zofran has been a life saver it works with in about 10 minutes and even works on the flu!

I took one immediately upon leaving the pharmacy and within 5 minutes I felt better.  I haven't had any side effects and I can now get off the couch and take care of my other kids.
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy		3	5	3			1/23/2008 12:01:06 PM	The generic version did not work when I was pregnant.  I know of other women who had the same issue.

My doctor had to ask the medical board of my insurance company to approve this for me! It is very expensive and the only thing that has allowed me to hold down any food! I am so thankful for this drug!
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	11/29/2007 10:40:25 PM	found out i was 6 weeks pregnant on the 2nd day of my honeymoon. throwing up constantly.. more thant 3 times an hour, went to an urgent care and they gave me iv Zofran and a prescription.. i didn't throw up again the rest of the trip, however, i have had to continue taking the medication and i'm currently 16 weeks pregnant.. and when i stop taking the meds for a day, the nausea and vomiting immediately return.. it hasn't made me feel like my pre pregnant self, but it has made what was a severely debilitating condition tolerable, so at least i can keep food and liquids in.. my only complaint is that this medicine is SOOOOOOO very expensive and we don't have insurance.. but i have to have it to be able to half way function in my daily life..i would definitely reccomed this to women with severe nausea and vomiting.

It was soooo hard to be at work with the feeling of needing to throw up every second. I started taking Zofran that my doctor prescribed me and it made a WORLD of difference. I DEFINITLEY recommend this medicine for anyone who has morning sickness. I still have the other symptoms such as tired, peeing every 30 min and being in bed by 9:30 every night, but I can deal with that. So far I have not had any side effects. (knock on wood)  ; )

However, it commonly causes severe constipation, which is difficult to deal with. Highly recommend if you're sick every day and cannot get through life otherwise!  It's amazing.

Without it I would be vomiting all day (hyperemesis) malnourished and dehydrated. My past pregnancies I used Atarax/Reglan/Phenergan all with a drowsy/sleepy/very sesitive to odors effect and I also continued to be sick occasionally. Taking Zofran allows me to basically continue my everyday schedule including work without feeling sleepy or drowsy. Sometimes I feel queasy or a little gassy, but it is tolerable. It has made being pregnant enjoyable rather than miserable.

I was unable to keep anything down and was placed on this drug.  My milk has decreased significantly, not sure if this is related to the sickness or the Zofran.

Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	Aimee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	9/29/2007 12:56:44 AM	I vomited every day of my pregnancy. At least with Zofran, i could wake up, throw up once, take the Zofran, and feel OK the rest of the day. When I was able to get some through insurance (which was very difficult since it was not an approved drug), It made working possible. I would have been hospitalized for dehydration and insufficient weight gain for the majority of my pregnancy if it weren't for Zofran. 
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy		4	5	3			9/27/2007 9:02:58 AM	This medicine has allowed me to continue working during pregnancy.  It has caused me excessive gas and stomach cramps.  However, I can continue to work with those conditions vs. the constant vomitting and nauseaness.
