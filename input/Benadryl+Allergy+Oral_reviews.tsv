Chronic Trouble Sleeping	1sickpuppy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/5/2011 2:38:06 PM	I have a script for  Ambien, it doesn't work for me at all. My Daughter gave me some Trazadone and I take half of one and two Benadryls, and i sleep for 5 1/2 to 6 hours. I have been taking Benadryl for about 7 years, and by (2) its self its good for two to three hrs. sleep. No side effects.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	justaptient, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/3/2011 3:40:27 AM	i occasionally take benadryl before bed if i have been having problems sleeping and need a good nights sleep. i can justify taking it because i also have allergies and can become quite congested when i lay down at night especially when pollen and ragweed are in season so i have to sleep with two pillows. i suggest having at last 8 hours to rest or you will wake up drowsy. it usually wears off completely after about 10 hours for me. works fairly well for insomnia most of the time but does not always work. but i figure its better than taking ambien or xanax, which are both pretty potent and addicting.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	ocadena, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/13/2011 1:52:41 AM	I use the pink tablet which I'm able to break in half. 1/2 hour later I'm sound asleep. Be careful though in trying to skimp and purchasing same as products, ie Waldryl caused my tongue to swell up for 6 hours. Benadryl has worked for me for the past 2 years and no side effects, well except for one good one. I take it before sex, and it helps prolong the pleasure. It desensetizes the senses enough to prevent premature ejaculation. Belive it or not.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Cherylann79, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	25-34	6/17/2010 12:26:14 PM	Took this for a week due to SEVERE allergies (nothing else helped!) And I got fast/irregular heartbeats, trouble breathing. So bad I took myself to the Urgent Care and they scripted me Allegra. 1 day w/ no benadryl so far and no more anxiety/hb issues. Allegra is helping w/ the allergies too! Be CAUTIONED if you take this drug. Benadryl always used to help w/allergies and sleep but now it scares the CRAP out of me. I'm only 31 and otherwise healthy so be warned!
Hives	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male	35-44	5/5/2010 6:03:18 PM	Hives from bedbug bites.  Benadryl stops the itch for about 4 hours per 25mg pill. The stuff is magic.  Histamine causes capillaries to be porous enough to leak plasma, but not hemoglobin.  This is where swelling comes from.  A histamine blocker like Benadryl (or any diphenhydramine hydrochloride) blocks the hystamine receptors and prevents the reaction.  It doesn't cure the reason for hives, but makes the itch go away real good.  Plus drowsy.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	robin Fairchild, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	65-74	11/19/2009 10:07:56 PM	I self-prescribed benadryl for myself due to serious insomnia.  It definitely worked, giving me a very good night's sleep.  But the downside is I believe it badly trashed my short-term memory.  And I read a report on another website that it was indeed potentially quite harmful in this regard.  So regretfully I discontinued the benadryl.  But it did work quite well when I used it and I am sorry it has had this effect on my memory.On a side note I was prescribed Lunesta by a sleep clinic doctor.  It also worked quite well but had a similar effect on memory.  So I had to give that up.  And now I take nothing for my insomnia and am usually sleep-deprived during the day.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	joedoe, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	10/26/2009 9:48:36 PM	I started to take the soft gels for sleep aid, but I use a knife to punch a hole into the sofe gel and squeeze half of the contents into the sink.  Take it 30 minutes before going to bed and I sleep through the nite with 6-7 hrs sleep without any effects.
Other	jess_sayin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/17/2009 11:25:40 AM	I was having headaches every day and sometimes would wake up with a headache. It felt like a tension headache. I started taking 2 25mg benadryl pills at night.  Now, I have slept great through the night and woken up without a headache for almost a week now.  I don't take any benadryl during the day.  The two pills at night seem to last all day.  I feel 100% better.

Itching	Panej, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/6/2009 3:34:47 PM	Started having body itch all over my body and was told by a doctor to try benadryl allergy. The relief was almost instant, but got drowsy pretty quickly but would wake up in the morning alert (big plus). Relief lasts for up to 24 hours on just one 25mg tab. Sometimes though, I wouldn't really say whether I'm taking it for the restful sleep or the itching, but I'm please to kill two birds with one stone as I was suffering from insomnia from time to time months before I started taking it.I have been taking it almost daily now for two months and I hope this is fine.

The only problem as far as my allergies are concerned is that I get very drowsy with this medication, which is not a problem at night, but is problematic during the day.
