It is the first blood pressure med to work.  I must have tried 10 different BP meds.  I have slight swelling of ankles and feet, stomach cramps, and a great deal of hair loss. The hair loss is upsetting me greatly.  Does anyone know if this hair loss stops?My blood pressure has gone from 190/80 to 118/68.  I guess my choice is to be bald or be infirmed!!

Actually the Lisinopril worked better in that there were no ill side effects as with the Tribenzor such as edema in the legs, ankles, feet, face, lips, and eyes.  Dizziness and headaches were also associated with the use of this drug.

After trying several different meds, this one finally lowers my BP.  On the day I was given this drug, my BP was 168/112.  Just after 7 days it is down to 119/81 which is where my BP used to be.  I'm very happy to feel like my old-self again.  The only side-effect I've noticed is sun sensitivity. (I should be wearing sunscreen anyway.)
High Blood Pressure	AsianO, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/18/2011 5:07:06 AM	Four months ago I started this drug at 20-5-12.5, I felt lightheaded and dizzy, my BP went from 160/87 down to 112/69. Doc said to cut the pill in half so I did. BP had stabilized since then. Side effects: I am losing a lot of hair, I am experiencing shoulder joint pain that, to open the car door to get out made me cry, (the pain is terrible but is not always), knee pain, and just recently my rt leg was swollen from the ankle to the knee after I walked 5 miles that day. I was to see my doctor yesterday but the swelling is gone after 2 days. If stiffness and joint pain persists I will have to see my doctor and possibly change to a different medication.
High Blood Pressure	Susan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	10/11/2011 1:22:37 PM	It's easy to take and seems as effective as any other BP meds I have taken.  It is too high to pay for without the one year introductory card provided by the manufacturer ( $25 for each month's supply). I won't be able to afford it after the first year.  Other meds have worked just as well - I took this one because I changed doctors and he wanted to try the samples on me thinking it might work well.  It works fine but no better than the others

Lowered pressure from 160/90 to 119/77. I don't like the effects of the diuretic. I wake up with cracked lips and tire easily when working out of doors in heat, no sweat. I live in FL. I plan to talk with my doctor about taking the drugs separately without the diuretic.

Today is the 4th day and Im still fine...hopefully I will not notice any side effects as the days go by but so far I feel like a new person!!! :)
High Blood Pressure	Anonymous in San Diego, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	55-64	8/17/2011 2:50:47 AM	I took this medication once daily for 6 days. It did lower my blood pressure approximately 10 points both systolic and diastolic. However I was awakened at night with severe muscle cramps in legs and feet and developed muscles twitching in my arms and hands during the daytime which lasted the entire time that I took this medication. My doctor had me discontinue this and return to my previous meds.  The muscle cramps in my lower extremities immediatly stopped but I still have the twitching in my arms, some 3 weeks later, which I never had before with any other medication.PROS: does lower blood pressure.CONS: attacks the muscles. Definitely not worth the risk, at least for me.

Excellent med keeps my B/P at a constant low ranging from 90/70 to 106/62. Where previous it was HIGH ranging from 170/100 to 190/106. I too experience some lightheadness, some tiredness and dizziness. However, I recently found out through a fasting blood test that this med may be affecting my kindey functions. After reviewing the possible/rare side effects of this med I discovered that    this med can cause kidney diease and/or kidney failure. I will need to review other B/P med options with my MD any get off this med as it is causing my Creatine levels to be out of the normal range. Normal range is .59-1.07. I am currently at 1.50. Which means if these numbers continue to increase  to 2.0 only 50% of my kindeys will be working. Not good and very scarey. Not all meds are good for you, even though they do the job! Be aware and always stay on top of all your meds and possible/rare side effects that can cause damage down the road and or possible death.

My doctor put me on several medications to control my high blood pressure, (5) to be more precis about it. That is about 1+ per year and finally &quot;Tribenzor&quot; ! It has so far been the most effective for me. Be patient, don't get frustrated. I was told in the beginning it might be several different drugs until they level your pressure and it did in fact take a while,WOW Finally Tribenzor.

I can walk 1 1/2 mile and have a reading of 137/78 when before I could not walk half a block without it being 178/100. Side effects that have subsided were anxiety and high bp spikes. Current side effects dizziness,low bp, constipation(mostly due to dehydration)minor chest pain and shortness of breath(mostly while sitting for periods(goes away when i get up and walk around)minor short lived headaches, and dry mouth cough. My Dr. feels these are alright since my last visit he gave me a scrip for 11 more months and said see you in a year. But over all has been doing the job. I have adjusted my diet, and take daily 30 minute walks. I have gone from 270 lbs. to 238 lbs. in the 2 months and still losing, also stopped drinking and smoking which helps alot. So if you have just started this, hang in there, it gets better.
