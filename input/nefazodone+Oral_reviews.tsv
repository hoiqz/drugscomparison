Depression	andythor, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/18/2010 8:27:16 PM	I took Serzone for 2 years from 1999 to 2001 during the most stressful and deepest depression I have ever been through. Although I have been depressed most of my life, after taking Serzone I felt cured and after 2 years of treatment I came off the medicine and actually did rather well for 4 years. After the &quot;liver scare&quot; most providers were unwilling to prescribe nefazodone in 2005 when I required treatment again. Lexapro had a lot of side-effects. After another 5 years of treatment with Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Prozac, and Zoloft, and a new psychiatrist, I started back on Serzone (nefazodone) a couple weeks ago and the improvement is unbelievable. This medication is just superior in treating my depression and I have just decided to monitor my labs and enjoy life again. 
Depression	Puma Girl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/28/2010 12:15:32 PM	I've been taking it for 10 years. Have tried several other antidepressants which caused unacceptable S/E's. Liver tests are fine, no nausea if taken with food. It has given me my life, still have highs and lows but within acceptable range. I sleep well. If I don't take it, I can feel the dark fog moving back in. Thanks, Nefazodone, for saving my life!
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/16/2010 4:03:19 PM	I have been on this medication for 12 years.   It has given me my life back!  I am now on the smallest dosage possible, twice a day, but find the weepy's come back if I miss a dose or 2.
Panic Disorder	Jeff, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	4/6/2010 11:36:43 PM	I recently switched to Nefazodone from Lexapro (which I took for 7 years). I was hoping the sexual side effects I had from Lexapro would go away, but they did only briefly as I was on low dosages of both. I still have them with Nefazodone, although it is slightly better now.In terms of how I feel I Nefazodone is great. I feel &quot;normal&quot; now compared to before. I wasn't even aware of how bad I felt on Lexapro until I got off of it- it made me very depressed and clouded my thinking somewhat. The Nefazodone works great for anxiety and the depression I was feeling on Lexapro is almost completely gone. I also feel like I can work and operate much more effectively and clearly now. I continue to take regular blood tests for liver function, but have had no problem. I give Nefazodone two thumbs up!

Depression	Gratefull, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/12/2010 10:13:17 PM	I have been taking this med for 14 years with great results.  I am no longer depressed, and I took other drugs and suffered serious s/e's and didn't get such a response as with nefazodone.  I am experiencing no s/e's and my dose has not had to be increased.  My liver tests have all been normal and unchanged. I am very happy.  I hope I will always have this drug.  Before I tried elavil, nortriptaline, prozac, and other horrible meds that did next to nothing for me and made me sick.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	3/8/2009 3:52:07 PM	I have been taking this med for about a month.  I have mild anxiety with depression.    It makes me feel sluggish and tired, a bit out of it even though I take it at night.  I am only on 150mg so I possibly  need to be on a higher dose, which would probably make me even more tired......not sure what I think of it yet.

Depression	lakota, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/2/2008 5:29:32 PM	I was diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder, May 1998. I tried 14 different drugs for depression. Nefazodone(SERZONE) along with Lamictal has saved my life. I would highly recommend giving it a try. Prozac was a big no-no for me. It made me very suicidal. I take 600mg of Nefazodone and 200mg of Lamictal (used as a mood stabilizer)every evening. This is the best combination for me. I've been taking this for about 4 years and I've really not noticed any side effects, except sleepiness about 2 hrs. after I take Nefazodone. I am very happy with this combination. All the other drugs I've tried, caused stomach problems, weight gain or made my depression even worse than it already was.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	5/10/2008 9:06:09 AM	I am a person with chronic depression.  I have some blurry vision with nefazodone.  I take 450 mg. every day, it does make me dizzy and groggy, so I take all of the pills at night during or after dinner.  For me, it caused bad nausea and tummy aches only if I did not take it with food or a full stomach.

Other	bunkster, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/5/2008 9:04:26 PM	I take serzone/nefazodone for social anxiety.  It works very well.  My friends/family who knew me before I started this med noticed an immediate change.  I was much more chatty in social situations and less shy.  My mother said she hadn't seen me like that since I was a toddler.  And my friends who've met me since are stunned to hear that I'm actually very shy.
