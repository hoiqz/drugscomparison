However, I have been itching like crazy!!  I believe it may be a side effect and is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars for experience.
Arthritis	torrietee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/16/2012 3:02:15 PM	This was a &quot;wonder-drug&quot; for me. I was told totake it every day for approx. a month. However, being afraid to take something every day, I only took it for a week or so. This was all I needed.The pain in my knee(osteo-arthritis due to injury) was gone and didn't return for 10 months. I didn't have any side effects at all and this drug was just a miracle for me.My age at the time was 33.

I was not able to bear weight on my knee until I started taking it.  Now that I've had my knee surgery, I continue to take it for my other bad knee...without Voltaren I have to walk with a cane.  I know because I ran out for a week and won't do it again. No side effects for me.

I did not take it regularly at first and did not notice any difference. But now, taking it twice a day I can say it's truly amazing!! I could hardly move in the morning due to pain and stiffness. Now, I get up, feel good and can move pain free almost immediately. I never get headaches anymore and love the mobility this drug gives me. I can tell immediately when it is wearing off, so be sure and take it twice a day if your doctor tells you to. No side effects at all thus far. Great stuff!

If I take it twice a day I have complete relief of my neck pain.  However, I am afraid of the side effects so I only take it once a day.  I take it at night so I can sleep and by late afternoon the pain starts coming back.  So wish it didn't have all those horrible side effects.

Other	mw, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	10/11/2011 11:16:24 AM	I was prescribed Voltaren 75mg twice daily for extremely painful sciatica.  The second dose each day, when combined with Tramadol (which was prescribed at the same time), produced severe intestinal cramping, 8+ hours of intermittent diarrhea, stomach bloating, nausea, headache, gas, lack of sleep, and general misery!  By not taking Tramadol at night, I only have stomach bloating and a feeling of stomach discomfort and headache.  My sciatica pain has been reduced a little bit but is still present and limits my physical activity.

It does NOTHING for the pain. I'm also taking Loritab, neither medication begins to even touch the pain. I can't sleep (toss and turn all night with pain constant in my mind), can't move my arm without pain, it has been a waste of time and money. Both are about as effective as IB Profen and even 800mg of that doesn't help.

Dr prescribed this medication and it barely helped the pain. he upped my dosage (from one pill a day to two a day) and it worked somewhat but i had the worse stomach problems. lets just put it this way, i could not go to the bathroom for anything. i started eating all kinds of fiber and still, could not go. sorry if this is too much information but this is what happened. i finally quit taking the medicine all together and quit the Dr too. He could not diagnose what my problem actually was he was just trying whatever to make it go away and the pain did not go away. finally i hired a personal trainer and 5 sessions later, i have VERY minimal knee pain. Go figure.....

Sometimes disturbs my sleep, can somewhat limit easy movement. Taking Voltaren almost totally relieves the aches and pains.  However, it definitely gives me a stomach ache.  I try to take it only after I've eaten a decent size meal.  Otherwise, I'm better off skipping it.  It's effective for sure -- but you may pay a price in stomach discomfort.

Pylori.  I almost died from a perforated duodenal ulcer that came about within 4 months of Voltaren treatment. All the doctors and nurses involved in my emergency shook their heads when the tests came back H. Pylori positive. Apparently it is well known in the emergency medical field that H. Pylori and Voltaren are a receipe for disaster.

I quit taking it for a few days at a time I notice a rebound effect on the knee. It seems for the first 24 hours after I stopped the knee got as bad as it was when I first damaged it.

Other	 (Caregiver) 	1	1	1			3/17/2010 6:04:13 PM	 Be very careful with this medicince. My 73 yr old father died suddenly last week due to a GI/stomach bleed. He was taking this drug for a few months for his sciatica (back pain). He was also taking an aspirin a day as most men his age do and the combination of the 2 caused the severe stomach bleed. The doctor knew my dad was taking aspirin but did not tell him to stop taking it for some reason. He also should have probably been prescribed nexium or prilosec to help protect his stomach, but he wasn't. So be careful...I would hate to see this happen to someone else!

Two days later collapsed with bleeding from stomach and rectum. Additional symptons nausea and hicups. Hospital confirmed that cause was Voltaren. Be aware

I had to get off it immediately.  It also did not allow enough blood to get through the kidneys, causing my previous constant cholesterol level to go from its usual 190 to 255!  This drug can be very dangerous and it can happen very quickly. It can be very dangerous for your kidneys and you should get continual blood checks.  I did and it still happened that fast.

I have severe pain in both hips that travels down to the knees at times.  I initially was put on ibuprofen, then meloxicam now Voltaren&#174;.  Ibuprofen worked the best but my doctor told me I was taking too much.  The Voltaren&#174; does absolutely nothing for the pain to the point I thought I was given a placebo.

I could not believe the mobility and relief it gave me. I started taking in 97.  Two years ago my Rhuematologist warned me and mentioned he had taken all his patients off Voltaren and would no longer subscribe for me.  He said it was deadly.  I didnt buy into his scare tactics.  I contined to take through my family doctor saying nothing.  Last year I started with very strange and overwhelming, scary symptoms. Weakness  starting in my legs, over taking my entire body. I could feel it moving from lower body on up to finger tips. Over several months it happened more frequently and seemed to get worse. Last time it happened I took my PB and it was 210/110. I was advised to go to ER. After a couple days it occurred to me to stop the voltaren.  The episodes of severe weakness stopped completely and have not occurred again. I now know it was the drug. I really miss taking it but the risk over benefit was no longer an option.

Within 48 hours my knee went from the size of a grapefruit back to it's normal size. I did experience diarrhea for the first week. I have Behcet's Disease and have a history of Ulcerative Colitis so I'm concerned about taking the Diclofenac long term. I just can't stop taking it without my knee swelling up again.

After being on this drug for just 6 days, my knee no longer hurts, my foot has improved 75%.  I also suffer from Lymphedema and often have swollen legs and feet at the end of the day.  The surprise after taking this drug is that I have not been swollen one day since starting it.  Also, where my ability to bend my knees and to kneel or bend were restricted due to fluid retention, now it is no problem.  My lower body, legs, knees and back have not felt better in years!

I don't think it helped that problem.  Within a couple weeks, my blood pressure shot way up and now I'm trying different medications to fix the side effects of this drug.  I've nearly forgotten my original problem (headaches) because of my heap of new problems - mostly heart and blood pressure related. My stomach felt like I had a gallon of acid in there. I can't exercise at all because of serious heart palpitations (caused by high blood pressure medecine), and my perfect lasered eyes have become hazy (no longer legal to drive).  The eye problem my have been caused by the muscle relaxants - I don't know which.  Big bunmmer.

I do not limp when this drug is in full effect.  I take this medication about every 2-3 days for pain relief.  I find that 1 pill will provide relief for about 1-1/2 days, and then the pain returns.  I highly recommend this drug!

The first time, I could only take it in the evenings as it made me extremely moody and very tired.I've been taking it less than a week, and now I remember why I only took it in the evenings.  My doctor suggested I only take it in evenings until I get back for my next appointment.In my opinion, Aleve was doing as much for the pain, but the Voltaren definitely made a difference in the swelling.  Do not drive while taking this medication until you are certain how it affects you!!  That is my warning and it should be stamped on the bottle, but isn't.

However, after 10 days,  I experienced the worse heartburn I  have ever had,thought it was a heart attack, and  had an elevated blood pressure reading that sent me to the Dr's office. I am on blood pressure medication, but it has been under control, but this drug elevated it to an unsafe level,and I cannot continue the Voltaren. I am very disappointed as it  almost eliminated all pain.

In the last couple of years, I suffered from extreme bloating, stomach pain and nausea.  A new rheumatologist told me to discontinue voltaren because it caused bleeding and intestinal problems.  After I discontinued the medication, the bloating, pain and nausea subsided almost immediately.  I would never consider taking this medication again.

Pain in back has reduced 50% after 4 days on medication but it ate a hole in my stomach, so to speak.  Was laying down and had a pain just underneath my rib cage that felt like a truck was on top of me.When I stood up the acid that was burning my Upper GI tract went away.  Now on prilosec and maalox.One of those times when the cure is worse than the disease.If your stomach can take it, it works.

The downside of the drug is that I develop painful mouth ulcers that make it nearly impossible to eat, drink, or speak.  It's not worth it.  I've got to find something else!

Doc gave me these to help relieve the swelling and the pain/stiffness. I was PLEASANTLY surprised with Voltaren...helped ease the swelling and relieved pain. The only down-side of this medication is that I occasionally get minor stomach cramps and gas, which I first got within 12 hours of my first dose. From what I hear from people, because of this medication's strength, you will figure out rather quickly whether your body will tolerate it or not. I definately suggest you give it a quick trial because the results for me have FAR out-weighed my minor side-effects.

I can,t stand or transfer without pain, sometimes falling.I think I am too old for knee replacements and I don't know if I have options.I halucinate if I take pain rx.  It makes me feel strange, and I don't know where I am.Damp days or standing are horrible.  I didn't know they would be that bad.Am I stuck with using Voltaren or Tylenol?  I have many illnesses and I doubt I could endure another surgery.  I don't know what to do.  I am usually in the house by myself every day, so that is depressing.  The pain has gotten out of control.  Usually when I talk to doctors, they don't know what to do since I have such a history.  Do you have any advice?  I am wheelchair bound now.  I broke my femur 6 years ago and it is a nonunion and I have a rod in my thigh.  It broke twice, then my hip broke, then my heart went out of rythem and I had to have surgery.I would go to the surgeon in Illinois if I thought I would have a successful outcome with knee replacements.thank youBetty Davis

Before she started taking Voltaren, her mind we clear and recall was uncanny. We could talk for hours about hern past, going sometimes into her childhood. Now she cant remember that was just talking to one of her children or was visiting them for entire day. Voltaren is dangerous and can cause internal bleeding in the brain. Take it off the market now!!

I take the 75mg BID dosage. I don't usually take it 2x a day and try to limit it 1X a day at the most. I have had horrible back pain since '96 and a ruptured disc last year(surgery 7/07). After the surgery last year....man, I can't live without it!! But i have found that I can take it once a day...no stomach problems but will look into the kidney thing. The key is to take it with food and to drink lots of water with any meds you take because we have to remember that all of that stuff gets filtered through the liver and water helps it filter without toxicity.
