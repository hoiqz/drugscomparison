Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/13/2011 10:50:23 AM	I have been taking Esgic for about 5 years now. I have TMJ and get headaches at least 4 to 5 days a week. This medication gets rid of the headaches usually with 1 pill. When the headache is really bad, they told me i could take another pill. I have never noticed any side effects from this medicine that I am aware of.  I dont leave home without this medicine, because the headaches just come up out of nowhere. Dont know what I would do without Esgic!!

Migraine Headache	kelkel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/23/2009 10:27:31 AM	I started taking this because i was 3 months pregnant and having a migraine or tension headache everyday because of increase of hormones.  I want to tell ya that this is the best medicine that i have taken for migraine!  It works right away but better if you dont eat anything before you take it.  Plus it calms me and relaxes me at the same time.  I love it!

It works wonderfully.  My mother also takes it for hers and it helps her.  My sister and brother also took it for theirs.  to me it is the best there is for migraines.
Tension Headache	Scott, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/26/2008 6:04:25 PM	I've had periodic extreme tension headaches for years.  After trying over the counter medications, I went to my doctor and was at first diagnosed with a migraine problem and prescribed a migraine medication that simply didn't work and had the side effect of making me dizzy.  She then prescribed Esgic which has done the trick. Taken exactly as prescribed, this is a great resource for severe tension-type headaches.

The combination of the 3 medications has been heaven sent.
