Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	45-54	5/4/2012 6:54:44 AM	Been taking Onglyza about 3 months. Has lowered my reading to acceptable levels. But I have to count carbs. And watch everything I eat. So I don't eat too much or the wrong things. Haven't noticed any side effects. Except for a stuff nose some. And have had a few leg cramps but not on a regular basis. Will probably continue to take this medicine. As I have tried 2 other medicine's. And they tend to lower my sugar too low too fast. And I can't stand the low sugar shakes.

My skin is so much softer and I feel great.  My fasting sugar in morning is usually below 105 everyday--am so pleased.  No problems healthwise noted at this point.  Have been taking Onglyza for 5 weeks now and very pleased.  Also take small dosage of Metformin and Amaryl.  Blood pressure is good also.

Plus what most people dont realize is they also have to change their diet.   you can't just take a pill and keep eating Junk food and expect your sugar levels to be Normal..   I have read most of the reviews  and  see that most diabetics are very stupid people!

It has not brought my sugers down enough to really be worth the pain.   I have told the Doctor that I hurt all over. I hurt bad in my lower stomach. She wouldn't take me off of it so two months ago I stopped taking it. I hurt even worse now. I guess my body is in shock or something. It's so bad I ach all over and have trouble getting up even walking is difficult. I havent told my doctor yet, but I'm sure she will tell me to start taking it again. I don't know how much more I can deal with the pain. I wish I had never been put on this medication. Is there any hope for me or am I going to have to live this way from now on?

Then took one pill.  Blood pressure and sugar both sky-rocketed.  Had debilitating headache similar to migraine that wouldn't go away, I felt like I had been poisoned.

Took Januvia for 2 years, couldn't figure out the itching.  Within 2 weeks of starting the Onglyza, my itching returned, only much worse.  I had breaks in the skin from scratching.  It did lower my levels, but could no longer stand the itching, as it affected my ability to sleep without taking an antihistamine nightly.  Also, experienced increase in hair loss, which I was already battling.  It was not worth it.  Onglyza lowered my quality of life.

This drug caused my blood sugars to stay higher than normal (not excessive).  Worked for about 2 weeks, then didn't really help after that.  Actually caused severe mood swings among other things.  Not very satisfied.  Started on insulin while on Onglyza and am finding that I don't need the Onglyza and my blood sugar is actually lower since I have stopped taking Onglyza.  Would recommend if you're not on insulin, but if you're on insulin, you really don't need this.  The side effects are good great to outweigh the benefits.

I immediately noticed that I was having some side effects (headache, stuffy nose).  I called my dr. who wanted me to keep trying it.  I continually got worse.  After 4 weeks, i called the dr. back.  He took me off Onglyza but wanted me to try Junivia.  This was over a week ago &amp; I have not tried the new med because I have been so sick.....upper respiratory problem turned into chest congestion like none other!!  I have never had anything like this so I think the Onglyza has caused this.

I have to be very careful in the P.M. because my glucose level tend to dip very low.  I am also on Metformin 500X2,glipizide 5mgx2, long-acting insulin 18 units daily.  The one side effect I have notices is frequent upper respiratory infections.  Other than that the drug has worked real well for me.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	4/15/2011 6:35:28 PM	I have been on Onglyza for 2 weeks.....I have Dawn Phenomen Diabetes, meaning my surgar goes up during the night when I sleep and during the day decreases. My morning readings decreased  by 20 pts.  A possible side effect that I need to get information on is that I am feeling DEPRESSED AND ANXIOUS.  I am lethargic and lack ambition.  I take Onglyza in the morning.  Today I stopped Onglyza because I want energy without anxiety and depression which is a horrible feeling...I am beginning to feel 'numb'...I am on no other medication...I cannot contact Onglyza by phone which is a great disappointment.

I also take Amaryl in the morning and after dinner. I was doing great on the drug up to about one month later.  I developed pain in my knees at first.  Then it progressed to my upper thighs and calves.  I literally could not walk.  The pain was so bad that I could not sleep and there was nothing to help alleviate the pain.    I thought that maybe, I had sciatica or some form of arthritis. I was also on Crestor and I thought that my leg cramps might be caused by that medication.  I stopped the Crestor and the pains got worse.  I got to the point that I was crying. I finally decided that I must come off of this horrible medication and without doctor's orders, I did.  After about two days, my pain has improved and I can finally I can finally walk and function again.  I will have to notify my doctor of my action and I will never take this medication again.  It is very expensive and I would rather die than take this medication again.

It has a dramatically adverse effect on your Coumadin levels and the Coumadin seems to destroy any positive effect the Onglyza has on blood sugar levels. After a month on Onglyza, with no other changes in diet or medication, my Coumadin levels were at historic lows. 2 weeks after stopping Onglyza the Coumadin level was back to normal and blood sugar was improved

He has been taking Onglyza, and it reduced his sugar from 400-500 to 100-120.  If this doesn't continue to help, he was told his only logical option will be insulin.  So far, so good.

The day after I started taking it I began to feel extremely lethargic and began running a low-grade fever (99-100) off and on. Feeling bad in general. I take 1 Onglyza with 1 750 Metformin in the AM and then 1 Metformin 750 at night. My levels have come down some but not significantly enough where I'd like them. Maybe I just haven't given it time. I could just have a UTI or something but the coincidence is strange. Giving it a few more days and then I'm calling dr. I've lost about 18 lbs recently - don't have the sweet cravings mentioned but I have NO energy to exercise which is not good!

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	NM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	8/23/2010 9:17:44 PM	My sugar levels have come down, some since on Onglyza but I've had lower left side abdominal pain, every night and finally, noticed it is a symptom. I don't feel it is worth taking, with this pain and I've also noticed hair loss but could be from another med, I started near the same time. I am going off it and hope to find something that lowers without causing a worse problem. None of this was explained to be, prior to my starting Onglyza. Would NOT recommend! Worried about this pain. Never had it before and also, I've felt very warm in the mornings.
