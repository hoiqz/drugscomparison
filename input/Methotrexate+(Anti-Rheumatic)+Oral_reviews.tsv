Rheumatoid Arthritis	WoodlandPark, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	55-64	7/18/2012 5:52:32 AM	I was diagnosed with RA in Feb 2012 after years of all-over aching and tiredness. Was also diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and polymyalgia. Was put first on six, then eight of these once a week along with daily predisone.  Nearly six months later there is little to no improvement, except for my skin conditions.  For this, it's worked wonders --though I can't tell whether it's this or the prednisone that's working. But there was only a small improvement in the tiredness and aching, and none in the swelling.  In fact, the swelling is worse.  I also developed headaches and canker sores bad enough to affect my speech.  Am going to insist on being taken off this med because I'm swelling up all over in spite of being on furosemide for a leaky heart valve. Little improvement, terrible side effects--I figure there must be something else that will keep my skin issues in line.

I take 12.5 mg once a week and Prednisone and Mobic daily. I take the MTX with lunch and Take my other pills with dinner and that seems to do the trick for the upset stomach. So far I have good movement but the pain is still there. Dr. will up my MTX dose next month so we will see how that works.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	kemorris, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	5/30/2012 12:10:59 AM	After starting a regimen of Enbrel injections weekly, methotrexate daily and low doses of Prednisone I wondered what happened to my healthy body?  RA just appeared out of nowhere, BAM! It took the Enbrel 5 months to kick in but when it did I felt really good. I used my hands a lot as a Barista and I was pain free. However the Methotrexate was awful, I couldn't walk up or down stairs without being out of breath. A trip to the mail box resulted in the same affect.  I would find myself sitting in my car on the way to work taking deep breaths just to feel like I had enough air in my lungs. I am very active and this drug left me feeling absolutely helpless. Sort of like a fish out of water...panting and gasping for air. I finally told my Dr. that I refused to take it anymore so after 5 months I quit.  It was like an immediate change in my breathing ability, I can walk, hike, swim and I have no breathing problems anymore.  I also noticed that when I ate a meal I would be in the bathroom almost within 20-30 minutes due to diarreha. I didn't realize Methotrexate was causing it but as soon as I quit taking it that problem went away also.  I still have RA and am still searching for the right drug that works great for me at a price I can afford.  If Medicare would pay for 100% of my Enbrel injections I would still be on it.  I am now traveling the rocky road of infusion drugs.  Started on Remicade, had 2 infusions and had an allergic reaction.  Have now had 1 infusion of Actemra but have not had any relief that I can notice from it.  Was put on 25 mg of Prednisone to control the swelling and pain that went rampant after they took me off Remicade due to the allergic reaction.  Two days on Prednisone and I started feeling so much better. Pain levels went from a 12 on the scale of 1-10 down to a 1-2. It's a miracle drug but not without many downsides also.

However, it makes me very sick.  I only take 8mg but I am still wiped out for several days.  It works, but it's not fun to use.  Btw, for all other users, I find that eYing foods with a lot of sulfur makes the side effects worse.

Has help with mouths sores but not nasea and headache. Still would take Mtx than to have RA flare-ups

I also take Celebrex for pain and inflammation.  Dr. took me off MTX so I could get pregnant in 1985, went right back on after giving birth. I don't know what condition I would be in without MTX.  My rhuematologist tried giving me Remicade which only made me worse.  I have had RA since I was 3 yrs old, I turn 50 this yr!

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Nancy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	2/19/2012 2:32:26 AM	I was diagnosed with RA in Oct. 2011.  I was put on Plaqunil 20mg.  I took it for 5 days and became deathly ill.  I had watery diarrhea and was uninating constantly.  I could hardly eat or get out of bed.  Needless to say after losing 14# in 5 days, the doctor took me off of it and put my on MTX.  I just took my 10th dose.  Started off with 10mg/week and am now up to 15mg/week.  I've had breathing problems so I keep an O2 meter.  Usually my O2 level is at 95 and now it won't reach 90.  I get calf cramps the first couple days after I take it and terrible headaches running up the back of my neck.  I thought it was sinus but I think it's the meds.  I can't get out of bed either.  It's like I'm drugged.  But then at night, I can't get to sleep.  In spite of faithfully  taking it, I had a terrible flare up last week for four days that kept me in bed.  I'm concerned about my lungs and am contacting my doctor this week to discuss this.  It's especially bad when I'm on a plane as they only adjust the O2 level to 10,000 feet.  I can't go on like this as I can hardly walk 100 ft.

Started out with 4 (2.5 mg) pills a week.  Had a little nausea at first with that, but then no side effects. Then dr put me up to 6/week.  Had more side effects but that was months ago and now have little to none. I also take 1mg of folic acid a day to help with the side effects.  Mostly I might feel a little nauseated later on in the day, and have a slight headache.  Next day I'm good as new.  I used to hurt too bad to wear shoes with any kind of heel, but now I can wear my dressier heels again.  It's a miracle to me!  My hands are not hurting hardly at all any more.  I can get dressed in the morning and work as well as I used to.  It's definitely worth trying to get relief!  I read reviews on here before I took it and a lot of them scared the crap out of me and I didn't want to take it.  I don't know why some ppl are having such bad reactions to it, but I have reactions to everything I take and I've been fine.  So I definitely urge any metho newbies to give it a try and not let all the negative reviews scare you away.  If it works for you, it's totally worth a few little side effects!!!

Rheumatoid Arthritis	MARY, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	12/11/2011 3:04:03 AM	Having known I had positive rheumatoid factor for years, and psoriasis, and &quot;degenerative arthhritis&quot; of the spine since my 40s, I was finally diagnosed several years ago at age 61. Although I didn't achieve remission, and the associated diarrhea took a while to stop, I have built up to 5 2.5 mg tablets once a week, and have no problems. My pain is managed with Vicodin twice a day, and I'v learned to rest. It has remarkably improved my mobility, since I was walking with a cane after a knee operation that wasn't healing correctly. No-one should try the new biologics before trying methotrexate first.Heavily advertised, I feel they are over hyped and dangerous, unless nothing else has helped. I can't get the shingles vaccine since it's a live virus, and I have to be careful about cat bites and scratches from my 3 cats, which are very infrequent. Sometimes they've required antibiotic therapy. However, my overall satisfaction is very good. You'll get over your total germ paranoia, and the quality of your life will vastly improve.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male		9/24/2011 9:09:04 PM	I was treated for several cuts and abrasions, in an emergency room, after a fall onto a concrete driveway (May 19th).  Before being released, I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. I had been in the hospital six months earlier for 4 days.  During that stay I was hooked up to several &quot;devices,&quot; including at least 2 days on a heart monitor. There was no indication of afib at that time.  Just prior to my fall on May 19th, I was put on Methotrexate by a Rheumatologist - this was on May 11th.  This WebMD site notes that you should &quot;Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as irregular heartbeat...&quot;  I did later, by letter, copying both my family doctor and cardiologist, as well as the Rheumatologist that prescribed it.  Only my family doctor responded with a &quot;...it could have contributed...&quot; The Rheumatologist and cardiologist were both silent!  Later tests by the cardiologist confirmed that my afib was not a result of any heart related problem (2 tests: 2 wks. on a heart monitor, and a test called nuclear stress test).  None of the three doctors seem to want to address this issue.  So far as they are concerned, my afib was caused by &quot;other factors.&quot;

Rheumatoid Arthritis	p823, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/26/2011 4:07:21 PM	I have been taking MTX for 22 years. Initially, my diagnosis was Lupus, but over the years has been changed to RA (I know, weird). It has been a MIRACLE DRUG for me. Before, I could barely walk, but w/in ~2 weeks I was up walking! My son was 2 at the time, so it was hard not being able to walk! Each drug acts differently in each person. I had tried other ones before MTX that did not help. My doc added Enbrel to my regime 2 years ago. I am not too keen on taking Enbrel and don't take it regularly. I have NOT noticed any difference in the way I feel, but my x-rays do show that I have not had any additional deterioration in my joints since I started taking it. I also take OTC Folic Acid 1000mg/day. My doc says I have been taking MTX longer than any of his other pts. I understand there is risk, but for me, as I said, it has been a miracle drug. So far my blood tests have been good; no kidney/liver problems at all, so I will continue to take it as long as I can.

I had both severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. I have bone deformities in all fingers and toes, which occured before I started methotrexate.  This drug gave me my life back. It also works on my other autoimmune diseases; celiac and a severe blistering disease, plus others. I still have side effects like mouth sores etc. but it is well worth the trade off.  There are alot of newer drugs  now that I haven't tried. It doesn't help much with my osteoarthritis.  I am in a wheel chair most of the time due to pain from the osteo deteriation, but I have full use of my hands, something I didn't have before and I have very little psoriasis. If for some reason I have to stop using it for even a week after I should have taken my shot and get very ill since all of my diseases flare at once. It takes sometimes takes months to get everything under control again. I would definitely recommend trying it.

Since using the methotrexate along with a daily folic acid, I have regained the use of them and I am back to work!  I have not noticed any outstanding side effects, altho I do try to stay out of direct sunlight as much as possible.  I have my life back!

Initially an increased dose was missed by my specialist, however now I am taking 20mg/week in a single dose.  I am also on prednisone (reducing this due to osteoporosis development - currently on 9.5/day.  Was started at 40mg/day), and on folic acid once/week.  I did not notice many of the side effects (eg no headaches, nausea etc) and still am a (somewhat less active) energiser bunny in terms of get up and go... I do have some recurring ouchies - the methotrexate is not totally supressing the RA, however I am getting the hair loss .. (ARGHH).  I am active - doing tai chi, gardening, weight/fitness exercises, and playing with my horses (two young arabs who I am training).  I doubt I could function without medical intervention - the RA is nasty.  The meds actually help me keep going.  As for depression and other side effects - I am not the best at tolerating stress at the moment - perhaps related however I have also had a TBI which lurks in the background.  I do know that different people react differently to medications (I'm one of them) - the real thing is to give your doctor a chance at finding out what works.On rare occasions I will take a painkiller when things get a bit tough.  I did have some severe cramping in my legs at one point - basically I went into spasms.  Still haven't identified the cause, however it coincided with a small stroke I had and the specialists put me onto a chlorestrol reducing drug Lipitor - which can cause similar problems .. it has now resolved and I still take both meds.

I'm finding aqua exercises very tiring compared to time before taking drug. I have bad headaches 2 days out of 7 and occasional nausea. I'm taking folic acid. I'm very tired, although this may be due to other conditions. Major concern - I keep developing urinary tract infections. Finish treatment &amp; have another info toon 4 days later. Chemist concerned about use of antibiotics with methotrexate for any length of time. May have to discontinue as side effects haven't settled after 8 weeks.

I do not like it at all. I get very nauseous and usually throw it up about 15 mins after taking it. So I started taking three in the morning and then three at night. Doc. told me to double the folic acid. Did not help. I feel terrible!! I have been getting very bad headaches, cramps in my calves, and am very moody. I want off this drug.

We tried something else but it didn't work, but this is awesome. I take it once a week with an anti-nausea pill and I am good to go! Also take sulfasalazine and 3mg of prednisone. I KNOW it works because if I am 24grs late in taking it I can barely move. The anti-nausea makes me a little drowsy for a day but at least I am not throwing up anymore! 6 good days with 1 bad out of seven is worth it!

PCP prescribed Nasonex (which I didn't take), temple artery biopsy, blood tests, Percocet and prednisone to keep me going while waiting to see my rheumatoid doc who gradually reduced the prednisone and prescribed additional blood work and a TB test.Methotrexate became my salvation once it kicked in (about a month and a half) and ended any need for percocet. The RA is now well controlled with seven pills taken on one day each week plus 3 gr daily of folic acid (to help keep my hair anchored).  Additionally, I take calcium and vit D.My doctor is magnificant and approachable! Since I'm concerned that I'll max out on methotrexate I persuaded him to reduce my dosage of methotrexate but symptoms came back and blood work confirmed that the inflammation was up. If I weren't on a immunosuppressant, I'd get a shingles shot.  I'm very happy with my situation!

I've been on it a coule years and the first 6 months were TERRRIBLE.  I threw up most days and got bald patches. I perserved though because I trusted my doc and did not want permanant damage.  I'm on a mixed therapy of 40 mg of Humira and 20mg of methotrexate and feel GREAT. Better than I have in years!! My hair is still thin, but who cares.  I can walk!! I can type!! I can pick up a coffee cup, turn the key in my car, walk my dog. I also take 12g of folic acid- I started at 1mg and had awful hair loss so my doc kicked it up over time. I'm very happy with this drug, even though we had an unhappy beginning:)

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Zosha, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	1/24/2011 1:53:06 AM	A year ago, after recovering from carpal tunnel surgery on both of my hands ,I found out that the severe pain in my hands was  being caused from RA. My rheumatologist placed me on a low dose of metho. and 1 mg of folic acid. I did not have much relief in the pain but I stuck with the meds he put me on because he warned me that I would have to wait about 3 mos. before I gained relief. He was right. In 3 mos. the pain  started to decrease and to make a long story short in one year I see a great change. I now take 10 mg. weekly. Most of my hand and foot pain is gone. I had to have my wedding rings sized from a 9 to a 7 1/2. The most bothersome side effects for me are headaches, nausea, some hair loss, occ. blurring of vision and a noticeable decrease of stamina. I also am not as strong as I used to be and I know that I will not be able to pursue nursing again. When I try to paint or do heavy cleaning I have bursitis type pain in both of my upper arms.These symptoms of course may be related more to RA than metho. All in all metho. has increased the quality of my life.

At first, I really didn't notice any change in my condition and didn't have any side effects.  My Dr. increased my dose and that is when I started having side effects~ headaches, nausea, fatigue, lethargy,and I just felt bad.  He said the side effects would subside but they never did.  He decreased my dosage but I still had side effects.  Since he felt my RA was under control, he eventually took me off of it. I hated that stuff!  Now my RA is flairing up and I have to go back to him, but I'm not going back on methotrexate.  There are too many different meds out there.  I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one to have a bad experience.

A bit of nausea when I first started but I lucked out and accomodated quickly. Have a thick head of hair so haven't noticed any major hair loss. Unfortunately, it did not drop my sed rate, I'm still in the 40s+, so going on Remicade IV infusion. But have been very happy with methotrexate for psoriatic relief and joint stiffness. Good luck to everyone.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	11/5/2010 10:59:20 PM	I took methotrexate at 15 mg when I first was diagnosed with RA.Within 30 days I started having severe mental problems, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.  Unfortunately I didn't realize that the medication was causing this, I thought I was just going crazy.  I ended up trying to kill myself and landed in the mental hospital.  My doctors kept insisting that the medication was NOT causing it, but all of my friends and family said that they all realized as soon as I started taking it I was acting very weird.  I stopped taking it and within a month I was fine.  No more crazy thoughts.  I could have died from this medication and I would NEVER recommend this medication to anyone.

Some nausea and fatigue at first but quickly accomdated. Taking 8 tabs 1x/wk with no side effects. Unfortunately, my sed rate is still in the 40s+, so having to switch to remicade. Blue Cross won't pay but $500 out of $1,600 for Humera shots and as I work and have insurence I don't qualify for the $5.00/mo. break for unemployed/no insurence folks. So, get to go to the hassle of IV infusion thanks to insurance. But, liked methotrexate as it cleared my psorisis and did help some with joint pain and loss of ROM. I'm a therapist so am lucky that mine is all soft tissue and I can with work get my range back when a joint freezes up. Best of luck to everyone.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	11/3/2010 10:23:15 PM	I was on methotrexate for 6 months when i was 17 years old. I quit the medication due to side effects of nausea and emotional problems. Now I am 21 and my rheumatologist put me back on methotrexate in august. i started at 6 - 2.5 mg pills weekly and it took me two months to get over the nausea. i am very tired and once again i am experiencing emotional problems. My doctor doubled my dose of folic acid to help the fatigue problem and decreased the dosage of methotrexate. Methotrexate affects everybody differently. I have a love hate relationship with the drug. I have one family member that loved the drug and another family member that despises it.

I have sarcoidosis, brain tumor, high blood pressure (uncontroled), lung problems, seizures, pain in my whole body, knots in my hand and feet, left eye pain, severe weakness on my left side and the left side of my head and face draw all the time.  I also have tremors (maily left side) plus musle ticks.  However -- none of the above was caused from the medication.  The reason I am satisfied with the medication is that it has not made me sick at my stomach.  At the same time it has not helped the overall body pain either.

I started getting lumps on wrists and elbows and he just blew me off when I told him, after what I read on WEBMD I am quitting this drug and getting a new doctor. These lumps are very tender, if I just brush against something I want to go through the roof.

Psoriasis	SM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/8/2010 7:07:25 PM	I have severe plaque psoriasis of foot soles and palms of hands and began this med on low dose 3 2.5 increasing monthly to 10 2.5. I also take humira every other week. I've seen great improvement from 85% down to about 30% or less but it took a couple months to see this improvement. I feel achy, tired and nauseous for 24 to 48 hrs after the methotrexate, but no side effects from the Humira. Also dr told me methotrexate may require liver biopsies rather than simple blood work to check liver function after the 3 yr mark. I am overall very happy with the results and will continue this combination for as long as it takes. With prayer and these meds I am hoping for a complete reversal of this condition.

I cannot tell any change in my condition but will continue on with these untill my next appt. with the Dr. in September.

It caused bumps and lumps on my arms and fingers and severe hair loss. It ruined my quality of life in just 9 months of taking it..  Over a year after stopping this medication the lumps still remain and my hair has NOT grown back at all. I am devastated.  I was doing well until I started taking Methotrexate.  I am outraged and furious that I was ever put on this horrible, destructive, life-ruining medication.  Having rhumatoid arthritis was bad enough but to be further destroyed and damaged by this crippling medication is absolutely unforgivable.  I HATE METHOTREXATE, the companies who make it and the doctors who prescribe it.  I can never forgive the damage that this horrible medication has done to me.

Was able to come off prednisone but still on Methotrexate 7-2.5 pills once a week. Everytime we try to lower dose have flare up.

I did experience hair loss for the 1st year.  Very fatigued the day I take meds 7- 2.5 once a week with daily dose of folic acid but good to go the remainder of the week. Almost anything is better than the daily struggle and pain of RA. I feel almost back to normal. I also feel much better when I can exercise.

Sometimes so bad I can't stand to lay still and I can't stand to move around. Was just dx with RA and have rheum factor of 23. MD said this is pretty high?

I am taking folic acid but it's not working.  I was encouraged to take prednisone but my fear of weight gain has stopped me from taking it.  I am on Orencia and now Plaquenil and feel worse than before.  I am struggling to try to maintain a normal life and keep working but it's hard.  The pain is all over and I suffer from severe fatigue.  I want to exercise but don't have any strength to do anything.Is there something out there that can be taken that does not require so many medications.  I'm afraid of what kind of damage I am doing to my internal organs with all these meds.

I had nausea, vomiting, fatigue and rash in the beginning. The nausea and vomiting is gone but I'm still fatigue and have a rash on my face that is terrible. I'm taking four 2.5mg tabs weekly and my doctor wants to increase it. I don't want to increase the dose due to the side effects of this drug. I was on Prednisone, Indomethacine, Celebrex, Mobic and so many other drugs to no avail. I'm seriously thinking of alternative medicine. I hate this drug. Now I feel like I have a liver problem. there has to be a cure for this condition. Everyone else on the blog has RA I'm the only one so far with Ankylosing Spondylitis.

Finally started to feel better on the sixth day.  Was unable to do anything, and even missed our Niece's wedding.  Ended up in hospital overnight side effects were so bad.  Very frustrated at this point.  Please, think twice when taking this and start on a week when you have absolutely nothing to do.  If possible, be prepared to take a week off from work.

Other	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	4/7/2010 11:37:23 AM	I was diagnosed with RA 17 years ago and have taken every medication for this disease. My pain levels were above 10. I began MTX injections 7 years ago with my doctor in Mexico when the local RA doctor told me to come back when the disease had progressed further and was bed ridden. His pseudo name was Dr. How Much Money can I make! The first year and a half of treatment I was taking it with Humira with no positive results. Now I am treated with Rituxin infusion twice a year,10-2.5mg MTX and 5-10mg of Folic Acid. My pain levels range between 5-8 depending on the weather and decreased Rituxin levels before my next infusion. I find Rituxin has been a good benefit to my system, along with MTX and the Folic Acid. The Folic Acid stopped all of my hair loss and the only major side affects I have developed was contributed to the steroid shots I was taking prior to my current treatments. Also, I have an excellent doctor locally and I had to wait 7 months to get an appointment after she reviewed my medical file from my doctor in Mexico. When the pain and inflammation becomes severe I take a medication called Diclofenaco and it is one of the top medications listed in Arthritis Today magazine. I hope my comments have been of some assistance. RA should be given more attention and research by governmental agencies, the reasons it is not is primarily due to the low numbers of patients afflicted with RA. It seems we are not as important as other diseases because of the low numbers when assessing the pro-rata share of money for research.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	cathy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	3/29/2010 5:07:58 PM	I was diagnosed thirty years ago with R.A. Was on prednisone for almost fifteen years along with Plaquenil.After all that time on Prednisone, I began breaking bones right and left. My life was narrowed down to Dr visits, out-patient surgery followed by &quot;stay off your feet six weeks---here's some Vicodin&quot;. Ridiculous way to live. Finally found a wonderful rheumatologist who put me on Enbrel about 15 years ago. Saw a difference immed., then it started losing its effectiveness. Just started on Methotrexate (2.5mg 1x wk) about 6 weeks ago. Cannot believe how much better R.A. is. Still have flares---but not like before; do not have to stay on the couch and grip a walker in order to get up, plus put up with the unbearable pain that only people with R.A. understand. It's really too soon to tell about anything permanent about the Mex., but I'm just so happy to be able to get out of bed without the dread of trying to walk, and the horrid depression that goes with it. No side effects, yet, but I have noticed numbness &amp; tingling in my hands and feet---as though they're asleep. This could be a deal breaker, because I'm dropping things and have no grip. It just started yesterday, and also sinus-type headaches. Will check with the doc on these issues if they continue. But so far, my quality of life has gone from a 2 to a seven!!!

Started with 4 2.5 pills a wk and now taking 10 2.5 a wk.  My hands always go to sleep mostly at night.  Because I am always tired I was told to take 1 mg of Folic Acid daily.  Not really seeing a difference am constantly in pain Dr just says that is because I have RA.  Think it is time for me to find a new DR that can help me be a little more comfortable.

Next, Ultram, put me to sleep standing up! #3, prednisone 15 mg/day worked better than nothing.  At least I could walk again.  Finally put on metho @ 15 mg/wk w/Daypro 2x daily &amp; folate 1x/day  I'm walking w/out a cane or walker again.  I get lab work monthly.  My inflammatory markers are almost w/in normal range again.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	terihoney, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	2/13/2010 11:45:45 AM	 I've begun using Methx one month ago. 4, 2.5 pills once a week along with folic acid daily, Pauquinel and Relefen and vitimin D3. The major side effect that I experience is tireness and nausea. I tend to be more forgetful. My fingers continue to swell and twist, wrists hurt. I go in for blood work every other week. I have to wonder...what did they use in the days when there were no drugs.

Psoriasis	sara, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	1/27/2010 12:53:54 PM	I've been on it for a month today. My guttate psoriasis has pretty much cleared up, 98%.  I am on this stuff for another 2 months to go.  I take 5mg 12 hours apart, (3 doses) once a week.  I get lab work done the day before to ensure mu kidneys and liver are not effected in anyway.  This was my last alternative, I tried everything, to avoide taking a percription...but it has changed my life around.  I can take my kids to the pool, go to the gym, and WEAR A T-SHIRT!  I hope this resets my skin growth clock when I get off of it... hope this helps somebody!

But those aside, my pain and swelling in my ankle, wrists and hands is greatly improved. The good days are far more often now!

It has not had any impact yet on my symptoms, but I was told not to expect relief right away.  And no side effects so far.  I also take Naproxen (500mg 2x/day) and folic acid (1x/day).  I have an appointment in about 6 weeks, and I was told that if I am getting no relief, we may increase the dosage.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	1/4/2010 10:24:06 PM	I have been taking Mtx for 4 months now and am up to 8 (2.5 mg) pills once a week.  I have not experienced any really bad side effects: no nausea, no hair loss, no rashes...but I do find myself tired a lot.  I have been weaned off Prednisone and my hands and feet have gotten bad: swelling, pain, stiffness.  However, my Dr. says this may be from Osteoarthritis rather than RA.  I haven't received the results of blood tests on liver yet.  I will see my Dr. in a few days.  Because of all the possible long term damage, I am going to ask about discontinuing the RA.

Sure keeps my disease in control. Was on Celebrex first, for 1 yr., then became immune to it. I get liver checked with blood test every other month, NO LESS! And I take folic acid, it's a MUST! I'm lucky, hope I can continue to be able to take this drug!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Jane, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	12/18/2009 2:46:47 PM	First started on Placquinil with poor resutls.  Went on methotrexate about 7 mnonths ago. Started out on 6 pills a week/once a week and after 4 months didn't feel any better.  Dr increased dosage to 8 pills a week/once a week and within 6 weeks I was feeling much better!  Most of the joint pain is completely gone, I'm not near as tired.  I'm close to having my life back!  Did experience some mouth sores at first but not now.  Haven't noticed an increase in colds or anything, but then I don't have kids and work in a private office.  This has really helped me!  I do take Tramadol w/a couple of acetaminophen 3-4 times a day for back/hip pain (car accident).  The Tramadol was not helping my hand/finger pain much at all.  The Methotrexate has done the trick for me.  Hope it keeps on working!

However, I am not completely cleared up. On the down side, I was told by my dr not to drink alcohol while taking this medicine so the biggest bummer,  I miss having a cocktail once in a while.

Other than having more colds due to lowered immune system(and living with three children under the age of ten)I haven't had any problems. With the other medications it definately helped bring me back to where I felt human again. Glad to be on oral meds now, if there are any new developments will let you know. Best Wishes

About a month ago I tried to come off the methotrexate because I couldn't tell it was working.  I almost became crippled with pain without the medicine.  Realized just how important it was in my treatment.  Prior treatment was 8 2.5 pills weekly but I had a huge amount of hair loss so my Dr. decreased it to 6 pills weekly, this stopped the hair loss.  I do find that if I take the pills in the evening about 6 or 7 pm then it decreases my chances of stomach upset which I have if taken in the mornings.  I too am only 42 and I am seeing a huge amount of crippling of my hands and feet but most of my pain is in my upper thighs.  Legatrin is a great medicine for that.

Mr Dr. put me on this b/c my RA is progresssing faster than was predicted (I got diagnosed at 28 and I'm 36). I haven't noticed any difference. I'm still in constant pain throughout by whole body. My knees and hands are constantly swollen and cracked. I'm still taking it, waiting on it to start working. I have had some stomache problems since taking this med, but I haven't experienced the hairloss. I'm also waiting on something to work for my RA. The pain this causes is dibilitating.

It helps only enough for me to tolerate the pain but I am no where near 100%.I still have pain in my shoulders, fingers, hips,and knees. I take 6 Naproxen (500mg) a day and that still doesn't help! My middle finger is crooked now so I know its not stopping the joint damage. Now my Dr is talking about putting me on Humira. Hopefully that works!

Previously I was taking Imuran which became ineffective. This med does help me, however, it does mean that I catch things like colds/flu a lot easier and they last longer, and go straight to my Respiratory system. It's a trade-off though, and it has decreased the pain and swelling all over my body. This med did not restrain the SLE as long as I had hoped, as I am now taking Prednisone for the last 3 months, low dose 10mg/daily. I can definitely tell when it is wearing off, as my joint pains return almost with a vengance.

After trying Effexor XR, Hydrocodone, lyrica,Naproxen,Prednisone,and Zoloft, Methotrexin has been my best medicine for my condition.  It has made moving around and walking, gardening more available to me!Methotrexate Rules!

I've been on MTX for about a year, but taken off twice due to elevated liver enzymes.  each time i was off, the flares became much worse with dibilitaing pain.  I also take Arava which i am still on.  on MTX, i was pain free.  now i'm on Tramadol w/Tylenol but it only covers the pain; does not treat it. I haven't seen much about elevated liver enzymes on here; wondering if it's a rare thing.  Hoping that my doc will find something new to help me.  i do not know how all of you have managed to live with this extremely painful disease for so many years.

This is my fourth week, I take 4-2.5mg tabs 1xwkly w/folic acid and prednisone. It has really improved my quality of life and I haven't experienced hair loss or any of the other scary side effects. I am keeping my fingers crossed and will give an update when I have been on it longer. Good Luck and Don't Give Up! 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	tanya, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	7/7/2009 10:26:25 AM	I got better results with the drug when combined with enbrel. however, Im experiencing a lot of hair loss. I assumed at some point when my body got use to it, the hair loss would stop, but it hasnt. I started taking 8 pills per week, for the first 6 weeks, but still experienced a lot of pain. The enbrel was added and about 7 weeks later I almost felt normal most of the time.  For the past 3 weeks my doctor decreased the methotrexate to four to see if I would maintain my improvement and to see if the hair loss would subside. I have been experiencing discomfort in my rists and fingers for the past week, but not sure if its due to the decrease in medication dosage.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	pattral, 55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	1	3		55-64	7/5/2009 1:40:47 AM	I have been taking 3 Methotrexate once a week for about 8 months with 1 Folic Acid a day. I have in the past 3 to 4 months developed severe back pain with constapation. I had been 5'4&quot; tall most of my life but have schrunk to 4'7&quot; over the past 5 to 6 years. I have had regular blood test done which shows no problems but have been in the hospital twice over the past 2 years with blockage in my bowls and severe back pain to the point of tears. My feet do swell slightly. My gastrointestinal doctor has said since I have schrunk so much my intestines and bowls are having problems digesting the food I eat so has put me on a High Fiber diet and I take 2 perdiums every morning with Metamusil once a day. This does not always work so if I do not have a bowl movement after 2 days I take 2 Colace at night. My back is still in constant pain and extremely tight across my lower back that rus up my intestinal area. Does anyone have any suggestions that might help mewith this. I do not know how much longer I can handle it.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	ATXdancemom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/12/2009 2:48:28 PM	I am a single mother and have had RA for about 8 years. I have been taking Methotrexate for 3 months now along with Folic acid daily. First my Dr started me with 4 pills per week then bumped it up to what she said was the max, 8 pills.  My joint pain has gone away; have soreness in hands and shoulder periodically. I do get fatigued and I had muscle pains that brings tears to my eyes that I can't hide from my 13yr old daughter.  I have no soars in mouth, and not thinning or loss of hair so far.  The Rx info received with my prescription mentioned a side effect of irregular menstrual cycles for women and my cycle has come a week earlier for the past two months. I have tried sulfazine, plaquanile, arava and previously methotrexate. I've had allergic reactions or acquired a cold that results in moving to the next drug.  God Bless you all and may you have more triumphs than struggles dealing with RA.

My skin started clearing the first week.  My skin is no longer inflamed, painful, or itching (in other words, it no longer hurts to wear clothing).  When I first started the medication, I felt nausea, and muscle weakness.  Now I'm just tired most of the time.  I think the trade off was worth the effort.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Jeannie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/9/2009 10:22:12 PM	I have only been on Methotrexate for about 2 &amp; a half months. The first 2 months I was so discouraged. I took the pills &amp; simply couldn't see one bit of improvement. Darn I didn't even expierence a side affect lol.My Immunologist asked me to give it a little more time. He said for some reason the 2 month mark was like the magic number. I kid you not it was almost 2 mths to the day, I found myself almost pain free.I still get little flare-ups &amp; a week or so of Prednisone W/Methotrexate and Im usually back to normal. The hardest part of this condition for me was actually getting diagnosed and getting somone to believe the amount of pain I was in.. It took 6mths or more to get the nerve to find a specialist myself.. Had I waited on my family Dr. Id still be poping Vicodans and typing jibberish to you right now lol. I was &amp; still am unemployed so obviously, I did not even know how to get a Dr. to even see me. One Sunday afternoon I was in so much pain in my hands joints along with  pressure from the swelling on the Carpal Tunnel nerves, I was literally in the floor crying. I had this fleeting thought, that somewhere sitting in a Drs. Office was a Dr. that cared more about my pain than my Ins. or ability to pay. See how pain can cause you to have bizzare fleeting thoughts lol. But it wasn't it must have been Divine intervention. I got out the phone book and called the best hospital in my area, which was WAKE FOREST University BAPTIST MEDICAL CENTER in Winston Salem N.C. Finally a Dr. answered her phone. Her specialty was not even in the field I needed. But she listened to every word.But she did say WFUBMC was funded with grants to do charity care or 1/2 price rates for those without ins. She said I had to first get into thier system &amp;to go to thier ER. I did, I got my Dr.&amp; the hospital donates my RX'sIf you are hurting &amp; w/o medical help, please try your local University Hospital. This condition is too painful &amp; distructive for you to handle on your own.Good Luck
Other	JP, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	5/1/2009 11:42:35 AM	I was prescribed this as treatment for Myasthenia Gravis in Oct. 2007 along with frequent plasma pheresis. Full effect was not achieved until this year, as I was slowly stepped up in dosage. I now take 10 mg twice per day, one day per week. Since starting MTX I have been able to lower my steriod usage to 10mg/day from 60mg/day. Its use has at least stabilized my MG. I have only been hospitalized for MG crisis twice since Jan 2008, vs. 13 times 2007.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Rose, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/29/2009 11:08:20 PM	I have taken for over 15 years.  It was a mircle drup for me. I thought I was going to be wheel chair bound but not any more.  It has helped be lead a almost normal life.  I was unable to climb stairs, raise hands over head, hurt all over and had nodules on elbows (that have gone away).  I had tried all the NSAIDS, also on plaquinal &amp; predisone.   Eventually was able to dropped the plaqunil, and predisone.  I am on 5 2.5 mg tablets weekly and 1 MG Folic Acid each day. I think the folic acid reduced the side effects because I have taken it faithfully and never experienced the side effect of hair loss, nausea etc.  Have had my blood checked each month as scheduled to monitor blood counts and liver functions.  Had to go in for recheck once after I had taken tylenol durint the month for headaches.  OK after I stopped the tylenol.   Last year I had some issues come up,  hair loss, loss of appetite, fever, night sweats, shortness of breath, and then pain on left side ao bad it hurt to move.  Was diagnosed with a plerual effusion and had to be hospitalized for fluid to be removed.  Not sure what caused all this.  Rheumatologist didn't think it was Methotrexate.

I was put on 6 2.5 mg. of methatrexate a week along with medrol 4 mg.daily.  I haven't had any pain or swelling since I started taking.  They are now starting to lower the doseage of medrol to 2 mg. for 2 weeks and then off of it completely, which is a little scary.  It's been great to be pain free for the first time in a long time.  I have had no side effects at all.  I will just keep my fingers crossed.
Psoriasis associated with Arthritis	cali, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	4/8/2009 7:27:20 PM	My diagnosed issue is called Psoriatic Ankylosing Spondylitis with a side order of RA &amp; Crohns. Current dosage: 8 x 2.5mg per wk. I'm also down to 3mg of prednisone a day. About every other day I need to take 1 50mg Indocin. I truely believe my stomach problems are related to Indocine and not crohn's. I don't have typical crohn's symptoms just the bleeding part. I find my body adjusts to the MTX dosage. Right now I'm struggling to stay at 8 x 2.5mg dosages. It does effect my psoriasis fairly quick, about 10 days. But it doesn't clear me up completely. Just allows me to be comfortable but I still have red skin patches that do not shrink or go away. Years ago when I was first on mtx it used to clear me up completely. Now that I'm older it seems the drug isn't as effective against my skin issue.This like all drugs can NOT be used indefinitely. Your system will adjust and you'll have to move onto something else. That's why this is my second go w/MTX. I've read where humira is supposed to be better but if you don't have good insurance be prepaired to pay $1500 per one two week injection. I'm not kidding. New drugs are nice only if you can afford them. My insurance rejected my doctor's request to put me on humira. That's why I'm back to MTX. Over all I function in a full time job. I've had this problem since I was 20. Now at 56 I've learned it doesn't get any better with age. Keep a positive attitude and don't give up. Also, as much as it may hurt you HAVE TO exercise. I found my drug dosage seems to be more effective when I exercise. When I stop exercising all of my problems exacerbate regardless of the dosage.     
Rheumatoid Arthritis	fancypants, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	4/5/2009 4:36:28 PM	4th time trying methotrexate, this time by injection.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Runner Pam, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	4/5/2009 1:16:04 PM	Been taking MTX for 6 wks - 4/2.5mg tabs. No problems w/fatigue (actually, it kinda winds me up, which contradicts what many other people experience). My stomach has been a little queezy, coupled w/a lack of appetite, but that seems to be getting better. I do, however, have horrible oral ulcers/mouth sores that are rather unberable. I've been taking 1 mg of Folic Acid daily. My Doc just put me on Leucovor which is Folinic Acid which he said helps w/hair loss &amp; mouth sores. Havne't had any hair thinning, but some say it takes about 2 months of being on the MTX for that to start happening. My doc wanted to bump me up to 5 MTX tabs, but is holding off for 8 wks, so that I can get the mouth sores under control.

I take 7 x2.5mg tablets every Sunday. First 4mths was horrible, throwing up, diareaha generally feeling really bad. Not so bad now, I can feel it wearing off by Fridays. Still have bowel problems and the fatigue is bad. Have to take a nap everyday by 2pm or I am asleep by 7pm.  Have not had a &quot;flair&quot; since I started this drug.  I miss not being able to have a drink of alcohol at social events, but I have &quot;non alcoholic&quot; versions.  I have to have blood work twice a month to check liver etc.  Overall I think this drug works well for Lupus and keeping joint pain to something that is manageable since pain meds are not encouraged while taking metho because of the negitive effects on the liver.  If you have Lupus I would recommend methotrexate.

Before In the beginning, I was in a hospital bed, walker and cane for 2 yrs. Now at 55 yr old, I can get around good, I do have flare ups but not to the degree before the methotrexate treatment kicked in. I take 6 tablets every Saturday. For the first two months, I was not able to function well until Monday evening. I take my meds and do not miss any dosage. Once, I stopped for 3 weeks and I was in trouble. Please do not stop your meds and follow your dr's advice.

I am taking it for dermatomyositis. It took almost a year to bring the disease back under control. But I am finally beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel. The only side-effect that I have with the medication is generalized myalgia (muscle pain). It only lasts for about 24 hours and then subsides. I am very pleased with this medication. It has worked effectively enough that I am almost completely off the Prednisone. So far, my liver functions are all normal.

These have grown into painful bruise-like areas making it difficult to walk. My right foot has poor circulation so it is much slower to improve. This has gone on two months now. I am also taking 400 mgs. Plaquenil daily. Is there anyone out there who has suffered the same problem?

My doctor has me taking folic acid 3 times a day and I take the folic acid with my medication and it helps with the upset stomach I was experiencing with just taking the medication. I still get tired if I overdue but I don't have the pain in my hands and feets like I did before.

Was on it several years ago in combination with Arava. Very ineffective, so switched Dr.'s and was put on Remicade for 5 years. LOVED IT. Did have few side effects, but could live, work, enjoy sex, etc. Began to lose effectiveness, Dr. retired, so I am back with the original doc, and unhappily back on mxt. 8 pills each week, not working, in pain 24/7, and life sucks again. Now she wants to do Humara. Not sure yet, very nervous. I am 50 and feel 80, or worse. Dont know how my husband puts up with me. I wish you all luck.

I began to show full blown symptoms of this disease in the 2nd grade and am now a senior in high school. Although my JRA is only being supressed and not out of my system, I have been able to live just as any other kids do. I play soccer, softball, tennis, cross country ski and downhill ski without any joint discomfort at all. The medication has been convienant to use and I have been very satisfied with my results this far.

I have RA for about 10 years. My hands and feet were starting to get deformed.I was always in pain 24/7. No energy what so ever from my body fighting the pain. My Rheumatologist started me on Methotrexate and the deformities are about 70% gone. I now have energy to have a &quot;normal&quot; life instead of just pain and wanting to sleep. I can even ride my horse again.

I discontinued use of prednisone 2 weeks ago.  My symptoms seem to be gradually worsening again.  My side effects include headaches, occasional nausea, extreme fatigue.  I've been on a range of medications and my experience has been that if you don't see results within 3-6 months, move on to something else.  If your doctor refuses, find another doctor that wants to work with you.  You have to advocate for yourself.  My heart and prayers go out to all of you battling for better health.  Good luck.

I don't like the side effects but they're necessary for the help it gives me and not as bad as how I would be without it.  I'm tired all the time and have hair loss (and I'm only 21).

It is more thinning than loss. Fatigue is major side effect.  I think the shot of depomedrol that I get 3 times a year helps the best.  Not sure if I want to stay on this long term.  Pain in joints has decreased but not sure if I really need this long term.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	11/20/2008 10:27:53 AM	I am currently taking 8 2.5 mg once a week.  When I first started this medicine, I read the reviews, and they rather frightened me.  After having taken it for 4 months now, I have not had any of the extreme things that frightened me, and I wonder if everyone's doctor gives them the folic acid with it.  I have had no hair loss, tiredness leveled out quickly.  I do get tired some, and initially some brief dizziness, but that really improved very quickly.  It has helped my RA, but I don't think enough.  I see my doctor again in a few days, and I think we will discuss other options. But I did want to write to say ask your doctor about folic acid, and to add a less scary review than the ones I had read.

I worked up to this dose over several months. Taking folic acid is essential to combat fatigue. I still get mouth sores the day I take the mtx but that is the only side effect now. It took 3-4 months to be effective. It's better for the joint pain than the skin for me.

( orally - 10 mg. per week ) It seems to help me a few days - but wear off quickly.  This week, I have noticed &quot; Lumps&quot; on my back also - they are puffy and sore.

Was taking 15mg of Methotrexate weekly and 40mg of Prednisone daily. Have been weaned off of the Prednisone because of side effect issues after long time use and now only take the Methotrexate. Joint pain is excrutiating, don't see much improvement. Quality of life is in the toilet. I spend my days and nights in my recliner unable to walk or stand for more than 5 minutes at a time, am in constant pain. Some diarrhea and stomach upset as well as hair loss and EXTREME fatigue. Unable to perform the everyday tasks ex. cooking, cleaning, bathing, dressing myself need assistance. Dr. eventually wants to wean me off of the Methotrexate as well. Then what??? Oxycodone helps offset the pain somewhat but do not want to live my life on pain killers. There has to be something better!!!!!!!!

WRONG!!  All it has done is wasted 3 1/2 years of my life. I have been in the hospital numerous times and I now have tumors on my adrenal gland and in my liver thanks to the prednisone and methotrexate.  I have had NUMEROUS kidney stones (more painful than child birth) and now I am having even more pain in my joints than before as well as undetermined infections in various places.  STAY AWAY....STAY FAR AWAY!  The side effects of the steroid and methotrexate are far worse than the benefits.  I have yet to find anything that relieves the pain except pain medication which my doctor refuses to give me.  BEFORE you take this medication please please please review and research and get a second opinion before starting.  May your life be blessed with good health.

But I would strongly recomend that everyone having an ectopic pregnancy way your options because 6 months later I had my second ectopic pregnancy and had to have emergancy surgery to take my tube out which was the same tube both times. It's hard enough to go though that once but a second time is horrible. Life does go on and remember you don't have to get over it right away all of us have to grive over a loss of a child.

My psoriasis has cleared up for the most part. it is still on my arms and face! I have tried creams with it as well. nothing is working. My lymph nodes are constantly swollen and the day after taking the meds i feel horrible. I am not able to do anything. it interferes with my school work and cannot focus. I have also gained a new condition with my eyes. its some kind of rare disorder, not sure what its called! I have fits of dizziness through out the day and am nauseas with the majority of the things i eat. Has anyone had any problems with coughing up blood? it happens to me every week, without fail. I am concerned about getting another condition, lymph nodes in my arms are swollen also. its a great medication if you are willing to deal with the side effects.

Although It is quite possible that if I changed doctors and found an md that actually did something other than have me come in weigh me and feel my joints then hand me pre-printed prescriptions that all he does is sign maybe I might find a little better outcome with this medication.

It was worked well, I am now not on the steroids. I am on 11, 2.5 pills once a week. I have had minimal hair loss, but have think hair and it would be hard to tell. I have however gotten a rash, on my lower back that itches, twice now. Had creme to heal it, and cleared it right up. Did loose just about all the weight I gained with the steroids. Over all not a bad experience. Much better alternative to the steroids.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Stramber, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/1/2008 5:04:39 AM	After 8 yrs. Methotrexate seems to have taken away my immune system so much that a fungus Aspergillus got into my lungs - round opaic (empty) holes in my lungs.    Aspergillomas (fungus lumps) were worst in one lung - they cut off l/2 my lung !  Pain of this still haunts me 9 yrs. later.I had a bad cough mostly in the cold of the morning before dawn.  My Rheumatologist ignored this so did my general practitioner.  They told me NO xray just when I feel like it !   I insisted after a time, and that's what they found.  So if you have any kind of COUGH insist on a chest xray.I think it an indecent thing to be supressing an immune system.We sufferers all need to stand up and insit more gene testing thanks - once we find the gene/s responsible then drug/s to target the real problem.Not just hit and miss with whatever the drug on the market is and needs to be refunded to drug companies. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Living With RA,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		7/27/2008 1:16:59 PM	I have been taking Methotrexate for over a year now. I was started on 4 tabs 2.5 mg weekly. My doctor just reduced it to 3 tabs weekly, because I am starting to experince increased hair loss. I have read that others are having hair loss. Does this stop, or does it continues while I on the methotrexate? The medication has helped me very much and I'm just hoping that the hair loss will eventually stop. If there is anyone that has experienced a reversal of the hair loss, please email me at: technohoney@verizon.net

After 5 visits to the doctor they figured out that it was the medicine. It worked great for the erythema nodosum but the chest pain and coughing sucked.

The side effects however, are terrible,I have become fearful of the sun, whenever I go out I wear sunblock 70. I immediately look for shade, the second the sun hits my skin I'm on fire and if I don't get out of the sun within a few minutes, the burning will continue for hours after I'm back in the shade.the 2nd side effect is the hair falling out, it falls out by the handfuls, I wash my hair only when neccessary and brush my hair only when leaving the house. The last side effect is the tiredness, I have to take naps everyday, this is not a choice. and I have begun to just feel very ill. My Dr. has just changed my med. to arava just this week so, we will see.

I have experienced the majority of the side effects associated with this medicine.  Unfortunately as we increase the dosage we increase my moodiness, etc.  Also the medicine has not relieved the symptoms associated with my skin issue.  It seems to be more of a burden with the side effects considering that it doesn't appear to be helping.  I will stick with it a bit longer to see if I can see results at the higher dosage.
