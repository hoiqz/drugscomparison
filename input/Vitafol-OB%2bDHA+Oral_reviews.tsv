Pregnancy	silvercandiez, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/3/2012 4:38:14 PM	I loved these vitamins! I took them during my entire pregnancy. I never felt nauseous. The vitamin pill was small and easy to swallow, no after taste at all. I do wish they were available over the counter as they were more expensive than regular prenatal vitamins. Overall, I think this is a great choice for people like me who hate the taste of vitamins like me.

Another downside is cost.  While all medications I've taken cost me either $10/$20, this one costs me $50 monthly.

I have acid reflux and there are some days where I do burp within the hour and it tastes like orange juice but that is as bad as the taste gets.  Overall, very wonderful and worth the prescription!

It does not taste bad, easy to swallow, and has actually increased my bowel movements. I have taken other PNV in the past and they taste horrible, made me nauseated, and caused severe constipation.

The aftertaste was awful for most of them and they made me sick. This one was recommended to me by my doctor to try and as of yet has not made me sick. It has increased my BM as well which is wonderful! Its easy to take due to the smaller size  with no aftertaste. I highly recommend this prenatal!

I hate taking pills however, this one is smaller than the average prenatal vitamin and is very easy to swallow.  Unlike other pills, there's no aftertaste, no nausea and they only need to be taken once a day.  Highly recommended!

This prenatal vitamin did not make me nauseous. It did not make me constipated either but it did decrease the frequency of bowel movements. Overall, I would recommend this prenatal vitamin because of the size of the pills. Plus, it is easy to take.
Pregnancy	cache30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/19/2008 2:28:03 PM	I am taking vitafol pre pregnancy. I have read many posts about prenatals that cause nausea. This drug has not caused any nausea for me or any other side effect. It has increased my energy level. the best thing is that unlike most prenatals it is easy to take. The pills are smaller than average vitamins and it doesnt leave an aftertaste/metallic taste in your mouth. Best yet no constipation.  I would strongly recommend these to woman ttc or those mothers already expecting.
