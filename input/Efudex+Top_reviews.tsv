My first was about four years ago, and two years ago I used Levulan which is a photodynamic therapy method for certain skin conditions.  My experience with the efudex has been very positive.  I did experience some discomfort in the final few days of application and was given a prescription for a small dose of hydrocodone which helped tremendously.  I also have had some discomfort using my CPAP machine.  The redness and inflammation from the efudex don't lend themselves to the straps of the  CPAP mask (I wasn't diagnosed with sleep apnea until the last year).  However, I have had six basil cell carcinomas removed over the course of the last 10 years and while this is more painful, I don't need to be cut on if I can help it.  I also recommend that this be done in the late fall or winter.  The cooler weather made it more tolerable for me. I would like to know from the posters on this site whether the effects are not as severe with each subsequent course of treatment.

This past Spring I used the drug on my forehead, am currently using it on my upper chest, and next week I start on my face. One thing to add from last visit. My eyes did swell up some so the dr gave me a prescription for a topical steriod and it cleared it up in a matter of two days. Eye swelling was NOT one of the side effects listed, but I believe that anytime the medicine is used close to the eyes, it could happen. I am actually anticipating it for the next round. Now, using it on your chest is more annoying than on the forehead. Every piece of clothing rubs it and it itches constantly. Hot water from the shower, while at first stings, actually makes it feel better. Am using a product called Aquaphor instead of vaseline and, while is it somewhat the same consistency, seems to be less gooey. You can get it at Target or any drug store. I am on day 10. I did a small patch last month and it took 25 days to start the peeling process but never blistered up like my forehead did. Every place you put it reacts differently and in a diferent peiod of time, by at least a few days. I could not stand to do my whole chest area at one time..could not be that cruel to myself. Will write again when I start my face. I will plan to stay out of the public eye for abour 4-5 weeks. It's the price you pay for all the years of baby oil and iodine!Hope this is helpful!
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	abgibob, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		11/24/2011 10:43:25 AM	I had an ugly growth on my left lower eyelid that had continued to get larger over the last 6-7 years.  My doctor had tried freezing it off by dipping a cotton swab in liquid nitrogen but that procedure had no effect. I had used Efudex before on my face and the top of my head with good success. I asked the doctor about using it to see if it would remove the growth on my eyelid. The doctor told me it I did that I would have to be very careful and suggested that perhaps I could try using a small cotton tip to apply.  I actually used the small stick portion of the cotton tip to apply and I was VERY careful.  Amazingly, the ugly growth simply peeled off and is COMPETELY gone with zero damage to my eye. The doctor was both pleased and somewhat surprised at the success.

It is not for the weak of spirit. My young child could not look at my face for a few weeks. I became the poster child for skin cancer for several months. Very effective medication.

No problem. Easy. She didn't say I would have terrible pain, itchy skin (with a felling like I wanted to rip it off!), and it's day 17 and I fell horrible! I look horrible, and the scabs still haven;t formed, let alone fallen off. I didn't have any noticeable skin cancer. I was just a person who wnet in the sun as a kid and she suggested a do this as a preventative measure. I suppose if you have a skin cancer diagnosis, the terrible pain would be worth it. But, as a preventative measure...NEVER! Searching the internet, which I should have done beforehand, I see this could last 2 months!!!! Yikes! It is VERY PAINFUL!

In about 5 days, it was very red and somewhat inflamed. This went on until day 23 when the blistering appeared on most of the area. For the next 4 days, it was a mess..always wiping off excess skin. Kept vaseline on it at all times, which I think helped the 'peeling' process to not be so painful. Tylenol and/or Aleve was very helpful as well. I made 2 trips back to the dr because I just couldn't get a time frame from any of the instructions available. Yes, the process was, at times, almost intolerable but, after reading about the final results, I pushed through. Once the peeling is over, the healing process is very short lived. It is April 30, exactly one month since I started and, yes, my forehead has no patchy, peely spots and is actually as smooth as a baby's behind. I am considering doing the rest of my face in the winter months. The sun and heat is very harsh on the skin throughout the whole treatment. I have bangs, so I could cover the redness by day, but immediately pulled the hair off of my forehead when not in public. I hope this review is helpful to anyone considering using this product.

I am using on my forehead and head, mostly in balding areas.  This is my 3rd go around.  I used it in a small are in 1993 and in a larger area in 2004.I look hidious.  My leasioins have just erupted into welts and scabs.  I know the process and understand that this is good for it means I am at the end of the process. I will apply the creme until Monday and move into healing and regrowth phase.

I had scaring in my heart from a flu virus that had infected my heart in '98. I had spent 10 years rebuilding my heart as much as possible.   Then I took Efudex for precancerous skin cells on the face. About six days into treatment I had angina that landed me in the ICU.  I stopped the Efudex and recovered, but they could find nothing unusual to give me angina.  Then when my husband used it a couple years later and I unwittingly touched his treatment area three days in a row it really messed my heart up.  I felt like I was dying and so weak I just laid in bed and prayed.  They said it couldn't be my heart but I've had two sudden deaths since a few months apart.  The latest CAT scan shows my heart is miraculously completely healed!  I am wondering if this drug destroyed the scar cells in my heart and made it recover.  Maybe it was for the best, but I felt like I was surely going to die the second time round. I hope someone does some research on this.

I experienced flu like symtoms, headache,intense burning, no sleep, swelling, excoriation to face and chest.  Was not given any warning of what to expect or how to deal with all the ramifications.  3 weeks later I am albino looking with a leather like chest.  My face is bright red but no longer painful.  Cannot tell you how terrible this experience was and I am not a baby by any means so know what you are possibly headed into and think hard about it.   Would never recommend this to anyone without trying a test patch as I reacted very seriously or so I am told by my doctor.I recommend intense  consideration before doing this

On face - in third week of treatment and not sure I can continue.  The pain and burning is almost too much.  Everyday gets worse, but don't want to stop the healing.  Feels like there are millions of ants crawling and biting my skin. Have not really slept in 4 days and thats bad also. Still trying to hang in there.

I used the medicine for facial redness due to sun exposure over the years. After 10 days, I discontinued the medication, one because my doctor advised me to but also because I could barely stand one more day of discomfort, especially around my lips. Recovery was pretty quick though, and after my skin looked fabulous. I had old friends at a reunion go on and on about how great my skin looked. They did not know I had this treatment.

I have precancerous cells in my lower lip, and my doctor prescribed Fluorouracil 5% once a day (before bed). I didn't notice any change for the first 3-4 days. But, soon my lip turned became raw and painful. I didn't listen to the doctor who told me to stay out of the sun. By day 7 I had a very swollen lip, bloody sores, &amp; lots of pain, especially on the corners of my mouth. I stopped using the topical cream for three days, and now my lower lip is scabby and bleeds. I used a thin coat of the cream yesterday night. I will visit the dermatologist in three days.   The hardest part of using the cream on a lip is not accidentally swallowing it,which I haven't done to my knowledge. I use a cu tip to apply it to the lip. I also wash my hands if I get any cream on them. I am patiently waiting for this to end and the pain to stop, although I do sleep well and can for the most part, ignore the pain.

This time I'm using it on my chest in a larger area and have had a big reaction, having oozing spots in less than two weeks, so stopped using as the doctor said to do so.  Very red and painful. I'm now using an antibiotic cream to help with the healing.  I still have some area to do but will wait until this has healed.  Was very satisfied with results on my face.  Don't know about the chest yet.
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/2/2010 2:51:46 PM	This is my second time using this product. The first time was on my forehead where I had patches of damaged skin. The healing process was rather quick after completion of my 4th week about a year ago. I have just completed my 4th week on my hands and arms. As I continued the process, there was more sun damage than I first realized. There is a tremendous amount of redness with scabs forming over the affected areas. Don't be discouraged by the effects of the product. It works very well, and it left my forehead as smooth as a babys. Still waiting for the final results on hands and arms. But the scabs begin coming off almost immediatly after completion of the treatment. Some redness continues, but remember the affected areas were damaged and patience is required before you realize the final results. Don't give up or worry about what people see. Just explain to them what you are doing as I have done with my coworkers and friends. I just laugh and tell them that soon I'll have the skin of a teenager. And I'm 54. However I avoid the sun as much as possible where as I used to do just the opposite.

My family MD finally prescribed pain meds and after 24 hours I felt better. I have not seen pain meds mentioned on any site. I essentially had second degree burns over my entire face.

Should have stopped @ 4 weeks, went 6. Pain, off the the charts. Swelling,uzing and down right scary to look at .Half bald, top of head, neck ears, face and arms.Got the treatment twice a day. After I stopped @ doc. advice soaked in hot bath tub for a very long time and very gently rubbed off all dead and damaged skin. HAD to cover all new skin with a/d ointment or pain was. Did the ointment for over a week plus. Retin A was the major cause of pain. No one should use the two together.Keep out of the sun when useing and afterwards.Yeah right ! So for most of you out there use a very high sun blocker. My Dad died of skin cancer. Just thought you should know.

Now at this point in my lfe I am being treated for actinic keratosis.  I'm just beginning my third week of treatment. I've noticed my lower lip swelling and peeling even though I'm not treating it. It must be seeping onto it. I've noticed some &quot;not feeeling 100%&quot; and also some depression with it.  I'm tired of explaining to people what it is. I look and feel awful.  It seems to be getting worse as the weeks go on. The burning is getting to me.  I'll try the warm towels and letting it dry really good before appying.  See if that works...

I was to supposed to also use on back (next), but will wait until winter to do that. First week--thought this was no big deal; then it started showing.  Tightness started hurting that week.  Third week was more painful and 4th week was bad enough my Dr. said I'd had a &quot;good&quot; (thorough) reaction and let me quit a few days early.Took two weeks of healing to get my nerve up for next arm.  Looked less intense than my driving arm, but seemed to hurt more and heal more slowly.  Wasn't as solid but seemed to be deeper.First arm is looking really good, and despite the pain I'd certainly do it over--not nearly as messy as the nitrogen burning and the end result is worth the pain.  Dr. gave me some steroid cream to use at the end of the second arm and that really helped.It really does affect only the bad cells, because I was very thorough and the underside of my arms had almost no bad cells, but upper arms by shoulder were almost solid (and I was not avid &quot;sun worshipper&quot;).  This has made me a walking advertisement for sunscreen.

Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin		4	5	4			8/22/2008 3:20:37 PM	This is my second 3-week stint on Efudex, first time was about 10 years ago. Using it on face and chest area. As expected, it caused inflammation and weeping of the cancerous areas, but after about 2 weeks post-treatment, fresh skin emerged with no scarring or discoloration. Hopefully my derm will give me the all-clear; appt is next week.

You will get a few stares from people who do not know you.  I recommend that you use only duing the winter and late fall months.  Heat makes the condition a lot more uncomfortable.  The healing process is a bit slow, but the end result is well worth it.  At 48 completing the process will help off set many further complications down the line.  Good luck and keep your spirts up.

Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	user of Efudex, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	45-54	1/1/2008 5:02:55 PM	(1) Very important instruction... I learned the hard way: Wait at least 10 minutes (20-30 even better) after washing applicable area.  Water increases the rate of absorption.(2) the nose, and the area on each side of the nose and mouth absorb higher rates of Efudex, and may become hyper-sensitive, so it's best to apply less to these areas.This is my third time on Efudex in the last 7 years.  Other times were 7 years ago and 5 years ago.
