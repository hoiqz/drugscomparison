Why should you need to resort to a sharp implement to get the pill out of the blister???????

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	4/10/2012 4:16:19 PM	While this helped with my allergies, it made me drowsy and lethargic during the day and caused me to have trouble sleeping at night. I have only been taking it for two days so I will try taking it in the morning instead and see if that helps.

The insurance company does not want to pay for this anymore.  If you get the otc allegra D 24hour, then you get 15 to 20 tablets.  I need 30 tablets per month.  In Tennessee you can not buy more than one box per month, and now I am  having more problems  I was put on BPM Pseudo 6/45mg which is not as affective.

But , now I have no medical insurance and cannot afford to buy Allegra anymore.  Counting the days til October when I once again have insurance.  I forgot about the headaches I get when I don't take the Allegra D.  HOping to find something OTC,

I was unable to open my eyes or lift my head for two days before the dr prescribed it.  I can definitely tell when I miss my morning dose.  I'm dragging and my head is heavy.   Does anyone have suggestion for financing since I've just about used all my FSA?  :)

Allegra-D is the only thing that works. My insurance doesn't cover it which is a bummer. But I have to have it or suffer every day.

I had chronic sinus infections to the point I could not lift my head or turn my head.  I was seeing a doctor who kept giving me antibiotics weekly and I asked after a year what if its allergies. He said maybe.... Quack!The new doctor tried me on Allegra-D and I have been Sinus Infection free knock on wood since the mid 90s.I hope I never get immune to this like I am to almost all antibiotics. I can only take a hand full of antibiotics now.I was having problems yesterday and I took another one and was feeling like my self again. Someone had called in a 12hr one aday and that's not enouht. I can not afford to get an infection again. Good Luck to you.Live by it!

I was having severe sinus headaches - that felt like migraines - probably 25 days out of the month. I tried EVERYTHING (prescription, over-the-counter, and even natural remedies) but nothing worked. I was miserable until my doctor prescribed Allegra D-24 hour. My constant headache was gone about an hour or two after taking my first dose and now I rarely ever get a sinus headache. I had problems sleeping for the first 3-5 nights after I started taking it. I started taking the medicine earlier and earlier until I was taking it first thing in the morning. (You have to take it 1 hour before eating or 2 hours after eating.) If you can hang in there past those first few nights of trouble sleeping (take a sleeping pill or something to relax you) you will feel so much better! It was totally worth the adjustment period for me! I have no side effects at all now. And, in fact, it will help wake you up a little in the morning if you take it then. I am so glad my doctor prescribed this because after trying at least 10 other medications this is the only thing that has helped me. Side note: I was recently prescribed Astilin nasal spray as well and that works wonders too! I am not a doctor, just a patient, but I definitely recommend both for severe sinus/allergy problems.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/23/2009 2:42:23 AM	I haven't slept in days.  I take this drug at 4 a.m. before I go to work and STILL can't sleep.  I can breathe through my nose though.  I'm drinking as much water as I can but I am still having trouble with extremely thick mucus.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	5/9/2009 11:31:02 PM	Compared to other medications such as Zyrtec and Nasonex, it is more effective. I haven't experienced any side effects. But 1. It's expensive. 2. I have an irregular meal schedule, so it's almost impossible to take it at the same time every day. 3. It doesn't seem to last 24 hours for me, so I'm suffering the last few hours. 4. I still have some allergy symptoms, although much less severe than without the medication.

It also work on me like speed- no appetite and difficulty sleeping.  I take a melatonin to sleep and I have lost 15 lbs since February (it's 4/21).  Only problem is I was happy at my weight except for @4 lbs.  It is nice to avoid my yearly weight increase because of the Prednisone for severe allergy attacks.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/2/2009 8:22:08 PM	Allegra D is the ONLY allergy medication that clears my sinuses. I have tried everything, Claritin, Zyrtec, Tylenol, and allegra is definitely is very best. The only downfall is how expensive it is.

Thank goodness after 3 MRI's, various scans and tests; Dartmouth Hitchcock diagnosed and allergy developed to the &quot;D&quot; in Allegra D. The lesions on the brain will always be there, however, no more TIA's after usage ceased. Thank you Dartmouth Hitchcock.
