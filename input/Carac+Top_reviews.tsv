Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	ProfessorMac, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male	55-64	9/10/2012 3:51:35 PM	I initially used Carac 10 yrs ago in tandem w/ Aldara, today mostly use Carac alone as Aldara produces immune suppressive complaints. If Carac is overused (which I errantly did), it can lead to permanent scarring. If underused, the lesions will require retreating or a visit to the dermatologist to have the area frozen. The challenge in using Carac is knowing WHEN you have reached the END POINT, and stop treatment of a lesion. I feel the mfrs info for use could be better in detailing how to know when you reach the end point. Also, the end point is different for your arms &amp; face v lips v scalp. Clearly more user info is needed.

This time I am on day 26 - I have 4 more days.  It's on the side of my nose where my glasses sit.  The pain is terrible when I wear my glasses (sometiems i wear contacts).  I have to use a little dot bandaid but know I should not cover it.  I CANNOT wait for the 4 days to be done, but I know it will work.

Want to discuss organic virgin coconut oil, recommended 1/20/12. Treatment symptoms (soreness, itching) weren't bad. After the 21 days I tried the organic virgin coconut oil instead of vaseline for the dryness. In my case the 3 areas itched and burned. I was extremely, extremely uncomfortable.  My dermatologist's office returned my earlier call--asking about organic virgin coconut oil--too late that day (because I'd already put the coconut oil on the treated areas) saying not to use organic virgin coconut oil, it would cause burning. For me,it already had. Hours after washing the areas with mild soap and water, I happily applied vaseline. No problem.

I've had six applications so far and just now getting uncomfortable, patchy red spots are starting to burn, itch, and ooze. Shower hitting it stings! So far not too bad, I guess I will find out in a couple of days how much longer I will be using it.

Using on forehead and temples. Started getting red spots after day 4. Not too painful until the start of third week. Some spots have turned dark brown, and now have a lot of peeling. Burning is irritating, but not too bad.  I have not stopped going out in public and have not had a single comment or second glance. When I mentioned this to my friend (?) he told me &quot;It's because people expect old people like you to look ugly.&quot; :-p
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	3	3	Male	45-54	1/13/2012 1:07:03 PM	Just finshed first week of treatment. Day 4 is when Carac really started to show its teeth. I was only going to do small areas of my face to start but after reading many reviews and talking with others that have been through this I decided to treat intire face. Face is very red dry, blotchy and hurts. Some stomach cramps on day 6. Hang in there people I have seen really good results on my brother and cousin that suffer the same condition. Lets see what next week brings and good luck.

I've been off for a week &amp; healing continues.  Dr. says about 18 cancer areas treated well. 2 problem areas remain &amp; will be evaluated in 2 mo.  I'm using organic virgn cocconut oil as a moisturise. Much easier &amp; more comfortable to use than vasoline. Absobs better &amp; helps against yeast inf. of skin.  Also advised to use old remedy of casteroil pack. Helps rid toxins. Check at health stores.  My skin is much improved p/ a couple of days.

I also lived almost a decade along the equator in Southeast Asia in my 30s, so many regrets... This is my 3rd December, 3-4 week treatment, and I just finished the full 28 days. (Before I had bailed at around 21-24 days.) My results have been the same each time: not much until about Week 3 when the redness, heat, tenderness, swelling, and peeling start. It took 2 little tubes to do my whole face and neck. My totally dark red areas were my cheeks and the middle of forehead (with the worst reaction in the creases between my eyes and sides of my mustache). My daughter's makeup (and Aquaphor) were my salvations!

Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	carac, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	12/24/2011 3:53:19 PM	My husband's dermatologist recommended this treatment for my husband's precancerous skin cells. The dermatologist said to do it every year, and each time the treatment would be easier and there would be fewer cancerous cells. He must be crazy. My husband used the treatment 3 years ago. It was a very difficult experience with a lot of pain, but not impossible. He last 25 of the 30 days he was supposed to last. He just finished another treatment that lasted 26 days and the experience was way worse this time. Instead of being easier, it was more difficult with worsening skin. And he has used sunscreen faithfully for the last 3 years. I have never in 20 years seen him so miserable and he is very tolerant of pain. He cannot sleep, he is thoroughly exhausted at all times. The pain at worst is a 9 or so, but a constant 8 over the last 4 days since he has stopped taking it. His life has stopped completely. I fail to see how this helps. If he does this again, will it be worse still?

The areas are now red and scaly, not a pleasant site and it does tingle sometimes.SO for all those sunworshippers out there reading this, STOP NOW, beacuse what we are doing now, could have been prevented if we did not lie in the sun all day when we were in our 20's, and even our 40's.

I applied a even coat of  carac cream from the knuckles to the elbow every evening, washing with non scent soap before, pat dry wait about 20 minutes than apply. Each week the cream was detroying the precancer and each week it got worse looking.In the middle of week 4, I stopped applying it as it was very ugly and thought it had done its job. Every month after the treatment it has cleared, it takes time, it took my arm about 7 months to clear up. It takes at least 15 grams per week for one arm, apply it even make sure you have enough and tough it out because it certainly worked for me.

Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	charmore, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	5/5/2011 4:14:18 PM	I am a ginger (red-haired, very fair) who as a youngster was a lifeguard at the beach for years WITH SPF 50, and hats.  Now 40, and the AKs are getting widespread. So, decided to try Carac in lieu of decades of cutting/burning cancers off of my face.  My doctor prescribed 6 weeks, 2x/day. There is no way I will do that.  After I already have &quot;the burns&quot; and looked like measles on day 2, I went to 1x/day. By day 7, I had dry, flaky, cracking patches that ooze. Every evening I count the minutes until 2+ hours to apply cream. And that pain (cream) is pleasant by comparison. I am now on day 10 and have had a face on fire for over a week. It bleeds, it scabs, it oozes, it hurts like !@#@#!. I think this first go-round I will stop at 2 weeks because, frankly, I can't do this much longer. But it's worth it: my dad was constantly getting his head and face cut off in bits.  This is preferable.  My 6 yo daughter says it's ugly and asks &quot;does it hurt?&quot; I tell her it does hurt, and it's what I get for sunburns. Looking forward to a few years sans AKs! Then, another round. But next time, I will schedule it when I can WFH full time :-)

I have Actinic Keratosis.  I have had 5 BCCs and 1 SCC removed from legs.  I am so suprised at all the red dots.  Did not realize I had it this bad until you see what is happening to your face.  Not a fun experience.  It seems to be worse for me for about 5 hours after I wash it off.  I have to take 500 mgs of IBProfin to make it through the morning.  I have resorted to working in the afternoons since mornings seem to be worse for me.  If it gets much worse than this, and I am told it will, I will probably have to stay at home the last week.  I going to try some aquaphor moisturizer starting tonight (after 2 hours ofter application) hoping for some relief.  
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	3/15/2011 3:52:32 PM	On day 15 of 17...54 yr old female.  Treatment on chest.  Had Efudex about 6 yrs ago on face.Last 3 days have been very painful, dry, tight, red, blotchy, and scaly.  Day 14 have had to take tylenol.  I have used virgin coconut oil instead of aquafor because it is less greasy under my clothes and works great for the stinging and itching.  I see the Dr. day 17 and can't wait, hopefully that will be the end of my treatment and I can start on what the others called the &quot;cooling gel&quot; which they didn't give me for my face at the time.

After reading quite a few reviews, I was not looking forward to starting this, however, it has been much easier than I expected.  After the first week, I had a LOT of red patches, some flaking and peeling.  But my side effects have been very mild compared to others'.  I can live with the embarrassing redness just as long as there is relatively little pain, some dryness and some flaking.  
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	Luckiestcat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	45-54	12/26/2010 4:50:20 PM	I am on day 17 of Carac 1x daily.  The 2nd week was very difficult with lots of stinging, burning.  Now, into week 3 my skin is peeling and the inflamed, reddened areas - cheek bones, cheeks, temples primarily - are less &quot;active&quot; and are drying out.  It is most difficult late at night/early am hours.  I apply Carac around 7 pm...stay up late to avoid the horrible feeling when I lay down.  It seems that when I'm horizontal, the blood circulating causes more irritation compared to sitting or standing up.  The secondary lesions; those not as active therefore reacting to Carac later than the initial areas of my face, are in their main burning, stinging phrase (forehead, eyebgrows)...so it's almost like I've gone through two rounds with this medication.  Most difficult for me is the stinging, burning..I can tolerate the dryness a little more because I use Aquaphor or Vaseline 2+ hours after applying Carac or, if I can stand it, not until the next morning.  Some say week 3 is the hardest...I must agree with this.  This is when reactions seem the most pronounced.  I guess it depends upon how much or how severe the AK's or BC's or SC's are on the individual.  I can't wait till this is over, though. It seems like time is just crawling by.
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	11/20/2010 10:31:31 AM	I am a 53 y.o. red headed male who grew up in the tropics. Dermatologist prescribed me Cara for 2 weeks on nose, forehead and temples. No effect until day 4 then my nose turned completely red and my forehead became blotchy. Skin became increasing red, itchy, irritated (painful to wash). Today is 2nd week after stopping treatment and most of red, peeling, itchy skin is gone. In fact, my skin has never looked better -- smooth as a baby's bottom! Just stick with it and when you are done with treatment, use Aquaphor to soothe the irritated skin.

I have several small spots and applied cream w/ a Q-tip.  You will have redness and peeling approximately 2 weeks after applying cream but it was not severe for me.  I was able to apply foundation and it was not very noticeable.  Carac is MUCH BETTER for me than the liquid nitrogen applied in the dr's office.  I like the control.  It is expensive ~$150 but worth it.

Other	ReneeZ,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female		10/17/2010 2:53:39 PM	Since I had 3 pre-cancerous lesions, I have just started the Carac 3 days ago.I'm using it on my entire face, ears, neck, chest, &amp; shoulders for 4 weeks, &amp; the top of my arms &amp; hands for 6 weeks.I realize that I have tough weeks ahead of me.I have found that the Carac ointment is very difficult to apply because it rapidly turns to powder when applied to the skin.Does anyone have any advice on how you learned to easily apply this?I thought that my RX might be faulty,&amp; called my pharmacist.He tested a tube,&amp; said that indeed it did quickly turn to powder,&amp; that it was just the chemicals from which it was made.My Dr. also prescribed topical Cloderm to use every 2 hours during the day for discomfort &amp; pain, but told me to not use this after 6pm daily so that it wouldn't interfere with the absorption of the Carac.He also told me to take Ibuprofin/Acetaminophen &amp; Benydryl for discomfort &amp; pain. He doesn't want me to use anything else at all on my skin. Since I plan to hibernate (I've stocked up on supplies so that I don't have to leave my house.)in my home during the weeks ahead, the Dr. doesn't even want me to use sunscreen.He said that he wants the best absorption possible during these weeks.He said that within his 40 years of prescribing this med, he'd never seen scarring. He also told me that the Carac attacks only the pre-cancerous lesions,&amp; that it is not predictable as to how many of these are underlying within the skin.It is because of my fear of developing skin cancer from the 3 known pre-cancerous lesions,&amp; certainly the possiblity of others that I have to stay with this program until the entire 6 weeks have passed.I know that I will probably have some bad times ahead, but I have to make it through. Right now, I have a positive attitude.I hope that I can keep it when times are rough.However,I have talked with others who have gone through this problem who now have gorgeous skin,&amp; I plan to use this as a goal.Thanks in advance for any advice &amp; encouragement.

My arms are in the process of peeling and burn constantly.  I have had a difficult time sleeping.  If I keep busy I can stand the pain.  As I said before a scotch relaxes me and that helps.  The results better be fantastic as the suffering is harsh.

The two things that ease the pain and relax me are 90 plus sunscreen and a drink of scotch. Tylynol, advil, or aleve didn't seem to do much.  It's hard to say if its working but I have most of the side effects.
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	kmann, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	6/15/2010 11:27:41 AM	I am starting my second Carac treatment. The first was two years ago. Each treatment will last 2 weeks as prescribed by my dermatologist. After the two weeks, I will visit the Dr. to view the results and get the cool down cream (at least this is what I call it) to clear and smooth the skin.I am in treatment for Malignant Melanoma (5 years now) and this is just one of my many preventative treatments.As other posters wrote, what to expect is this:Start the treatment knowing you do NOT have any social plans for the next 3 weeks. Apply the cream as directed. Your face will NOT experience anything for 2-4 days however each person is different. Pretty soon, it will feel like a faint sun burn, then as the days go on, it will increase with redness, remember, with this treatment, the redder the better by the end of the 2nd week, red blotchy sores will appear, like a major case of some type of skin rash...its not pretty. HOWEVER...after the 2nd week (or however long your Dr. has you on the treatment) you will apply the Cool Down medicine...sorry, I forgot what this is called and it is a prescription cream, almost immediately your face will feel better and within a few days it will look like a million bucks! Smooth skin, blotches and sun damage will be less noticeable and in my case, I looked younger...and that says a lot!This is good stuff for folks who have major sun damage and /or have dermatologist issues. Hope this helps...

After reading about Carac I was scared, but it was not as bad as I expected.  Weeks two and three were uncomfortable-itchy and burning.  I tried to stay inside where it was cool and keep busy.  After two weeks of Vaseline after care my face has only two tiny tender patches near both eyes.  For those beginning treatment-it was worth it for me.

I have to use it on my entire face and after only 4 days my face became red and eyes burned and by now I am in agony. The cream is so thick that it peels my skin when I put it on. I already have the peeling and cracking and also blisters in places. Also I haven't felt well since about the 3rd day or so of treatment, just kind of blah, nauseous and headachy although I didn't read where anyone else reported that so maybe it's just me. have to agree it's no fun going out in public but if it works then it's worth it. Sure wish I would have listened and not baked in the sun all those years! I'll let you know if I can make it through the full 6 weeks.
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	spidergirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	4/21/2010 9:12:13 AM	This is for the ladies....I was very scared to use Carac cream b/c of horrible photos I saw on the web.  I have done 4 small areas (about 2 in. areas at a time).  Timing-wise only expect to see anything end of 2nd week. Depending on how much AK's you have you will see red splotches that intensify in 3rd week.  If you put makeup over top of the area (if it isn't too bad) then NO ONE notices anything.  My really bad area that I did was my nose so if I had to time it again I would just look 2-3 weeks out of calender and if you have something important to do then, don't start carac cream.As soon as you stop using it the skin heals up and is very smooth underneath.  Use a lot of sunscreen over area and you can continue to cover w/ makeup.  It is better than getting liquid nitrogen you just have to plan.  Summer is coming so I am going to stop until after next xmas and then tackle a few more small areas until I am all done!  Easy easy w/ out any major problems.

Face started get sore and red on day 3 of treatment.  Patchy red areas that burn and itch. Was told to not put any creams or lotions on because it interferes with treatment.  Tylenol helps with the pain. Half way through treatment and not sure of effectiveness.

By week #2, scabs were forming with persistant redness.  It was not a pretty process, but it's endurable. I'm thankful to have read a review where someone suggested Korres Yogurt Cooling Gel/Creme-very helpful for the cracking and burning! After the healing, the results were wonderful!!
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	kginww, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	55-64	4/14/2010 1:28:45 PM	I am fair skinned and spent my youth at the beach wearing baby oil to help me tan.  I just finished putting Carac Cream on my upper lip to my nose for 30 days, then on the rest of my face for 30 days.  I have senstive skin and was very uncomfortable and unsightly after 1 week of use, but I am glad I stuck with it. Many spots peeled off my upper lip, jawline, upper nose and cheekbones.  My skin is smooth now, even where there used to be wrinkles, though I am still very red. Here are my tips to get through tough times with Carac Cream:  1.  Take a painkiller one hour before washing face and applying Carac Cream.2.  Wear disposable gloves to apply so you don't later get it in your eyes or nose.3.  If the Carac stings, burns and itches while drying, sit in front of a fan and read.4.  After 2 hours, apply Eucerin ORIGINAL cream in a pot, or Eucerin ORIGINAL lotion, or Aquaphor.  Skin doesn't absorb Vaseline, so it doesn't give lasting relief, though it helps you talk and eat when you put it on cracked, dry lips.5.  Isopropol Alcohol or Windex help get Vaseline and lotion off your glasses.6.  Apply ice packs in a wet cotton washcloth for really bad times.7.  Buy a U shaped travel pillow to sleep on so your cheeks don't rub on the pillowcase.  Put it flat on the bed with the bottom of the U under your neck.8.  When your face is raw, everything that touches it stings, so use mild soap and shampoo like Dove soap for sensitive skin and Baby Shampoo.

UNSIGHTLY, yes but no pain or burning or swelling. No feeling of tightness or severe sunburn feeling. My skin breakout began on the second week of treatment. Dr. said face should be completely clear in 30 days. I will update the final result. My experience has been good not at all like what I have read.

Skin is red, tight, peeling in spots.  I guess it is working.  It was not so bad the first two weeks, but took a bad turn last week.  My nose turned purplish red.    Co-workers are noticing.  One week to go.  Dermatologist said I can put makeup on, so that worked till the flaking started. Working at home tomorrow :)  Everyone hang in there.  It is better than surgery.....I THINK.

From 30 years as passenger on 700 mile trips the right side of face lit up plus my nose and upper left lip.  It's been rough during week 3 and now in week 4 face cracks and hurts terribly when I laugh, eat or kiss my husband goodbye (now I blow the kiss..haha)) Anyway, I am so very hopeful that the skin on the right side will be much healthier upon healing.  I'll write again at two weeks post treatment.

I've been a subject in a cruel Nazi experiment: How long will I endure self-induced pain and disfigurement before I cry uncle. 14 days.  Uncle!  Someone earlier said to not use this product if you are &quot;faint-of-heart.&quot;  Correct.  It's very painful. I can't sleep, I'm physically sick from the pain, and I have a cold but can't wipe my nose BECAUSE THE SKIN IS GONE.  When I heal again, I'll try something else.
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	Carol, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/6/2010 4:11:57 PM	I'm on my 20th day of 21 using Carac and needless to say,I've had enough.  I used it on my whole face and I have scabs everywhere which was predictable. I can see all the healing but I don't know the effectiveness until all the reddness goes away. VERY IMPORTANT - I definitely had an allergic reaction, coughing and some trouble breathing.  I told my husband I don't know why I am coughing and having such a tough time at night after 10 days, when it hit me, that is when I am using the cream, at night!  During the day I was fine and then at night I couldn't sleep and my poor husband was going nuts.  It does get depressing so I am hoping for great results.

I didn't get very red/sore/raw/peeing/etc until the last week.  Other than a couple of surprise spots, it only hit the sites I had had biopsies, so knew I was going to have reaction there.  It wasn't that bad.  Burned, itched - kind of like the sunburns of long ago that got me to this place to begin with, rather full-circle.  I did find that Korres Yoghurt cooling gel slathered on thick and left to soak in was an oasis for my face each morning.  I'm healing nicely, and am looking for suggestions on non-chemical sunscreens - I have skin sensitivities and haven't found one yet I can tolerate.

I am covering my entire face and forehead with the cream. I am on day 17 and it is very tough going.  Red &quot;hot spots&quot; all over my face, but also areas where the skin is completely red, raw and stiff.  This treatment is not for the faint of heart, but I am told that it works wonders.  I wish there were some type of &quot;relief&quot; cream that could be applied during times when my face feels like its on fire.  My Dr. said to use it only for 3 weeks, not 4 as I have read from others.  I will report back.

The whole face.  I have had several slice and dice procedures to remove basal cells from my face, and this can't be any worse than having a razor slice off part of my upper lip - can it?  Has anyone had scarring from it?  If treating at night, can I wear lotion and a powdered sunscreen the next morning?  wish me luck - I'll post at the end of my 21 days.

Good thing I am home from work! I would really be in a mess with my face to face contact with the public. I'm only doing my nose and butterfly mask, it's red, purple areas, scabbing in some places. Has anyone heard read the article &quot;Supercharging Efudex with DMSO?&quot; The process is excelerated to only 4 days!! Not the 28 days we are going through! But is it safe?? DMSO causes it to rapidly penetrate your skin. Will it hurt the rest of my body??

Please, don't give up. Instead ask your doctor about doing it in small sections. Sooo much less discomfort or fear of infection. I wouldn't even consider doing my whole chest at one time.

My doctor told me I didn't have to do my whole face at one time... so I've been doing it by sections. Sure, it takes longer to get the whole thing done, but lots less discomfort and ugliness. I've finished my forehead (two 4-week sessions) and am now working on my right cheek. The stuff is good!

It was prescribed to me for AK lesions on my chest and I was to use it once daily at night time.  I am happy to report that the treatment went fast and was no where near as bad as half of these reviews state.  After week one, I did start breaking out with red bumps.  By the end of week 2, I had LOTS of bumps that covered about a 4 inch wide area of my chest and some of them were starting to open.  While it was uncomfortable, it was not by any means painful.  By the end of week 3 some of theopen patches would bleed upon using the cream, but it still wasn't that bad.  I never had trouble sleeping at night.  It was, however, very unsightly just like the doctor will tell you.  I made sure that I wore shirts that covered the entire area during treatment.  I stopped the treatment a week ago and my doctor prescribed a steroid cream to put on the area twice daily.  I've only been using the cream for 3 days and already it is half way cleared up.  It's not even uncomfortable any more, just very itchy.

(twice a day for 21 days)....I am a red head with fair skin.  My doctor wanted me to do a &quot;mardi gras&quot; mask to start and do my neck and chest in the winter.  I am beginning to flake and get redder by the day.  It hurts and is very tender to touch.  I am choosing to go to a once a day every other day just to lessen the pain.  I go back to work in 2 weeks....it sounds like at the height of ugliness....I hate not being able to be out in the sun, but I guess that is what got me here...:(

My cheek was in question, but I had an idea there were problems where my reading glasses sat on my nose.  I am already on fire.  The areas around my nose are the most painful.  I have found several spots that hadn't reared their ugly heads yet.  Moisturizer in the AM helps with pain and tightness.  Any lotion should work or Vaseline.  Can't wait for what I have coming.  I was a sun goddess and am paying for it now.  I think it would be less painful to go in and have these places frozen off instead of the pain and eye swelling an just feeling blah.  Will keep you posted

I'm on day 8 since discontinuing treatment and experience continued peeling.  Also appears that I've begun to have a rash and some new spots that look like poison ivy.  Perhaps it is since I worked in the garden yesterday.  Hope I can say it's been worth it once this is over.  Must keep arms covered, very unsightly!

The first 3 weeks, even the first 4 weeks were tolerable but near the end of the 4th week I started to have open bloody sores.Normal treatment is 3-4 weeks but my doctor wanted me to go 6 weeks if I could.After precisely 5 weeks I could no longer tolerate it.  Almost my entire face was bleeding and burning.  I could not sleep at night.  I had to take drugs to get to sleep and still could not lie down on a pillow.  I could not stand anything touching my face.  Showering was a like being engulfed in flames.  I bled all over my pillow, etc.Finally I just had to stop to let myself heal.It has been 9 days since I stopped and most of the scabs are gone from my face but it was only in the last 2 days that most of them were removed.I hope the results are worth it.  The pain and suffering was great.

But once it got awful, it got geometrically worse. Pain, cracking, burning; and this is my FACE we're talking about! But I had done my homework, knew what to expect; and I work from home. So I soldiered on. Only my friends at the post office saw me (I had to mail out orders!) and I mostly stayed at home through the course.
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/12/2009 6:28:19 AM	Day 18 of 28 day tx. for my entire face.   My first 'hot spot' was noted on day 4. By day 12 I chose to work from home due to unsightliness &amp; concern for increased risk of infection; I.e.(peeling/cracking/exposed areas).  I clearly could see the progress by this point, however today I'm debating to d/c early due to extreme irritation such as burning, itching, dryness, inflammation around eyes, unsightly appearance &amp; several days of minimal sleep.  I am pleased with the 'new skin' that has replaced sloughed spots butI wish I had clearer M.D. direction re knowing when enough is enough, rather than leaving it up to my own tolerance &amp; discretion; I.e. if no new hot spots appear, is the tx. complete??  Will there be additional damage by applying cream to all the new, healthy skin?   I will write again in a couple days with my decision.  I am very pleased/grateful that this type of tx. is available for my face.

Last time I reviewed this product I was on day 22.  Day 22-28 were suprisingly the hardest! I was so tempted to stop for mostly for emotional reasoning, I was anxious for the end. Day 22-28 my face got the most red, ichy and dry it ever did during the whole 28 treatments. The things I'm most greatful for is the peace of mind, also the ability to use a moistuizer starting the third week.  Advise I would give; Wash your face only once a day during treatment period. Wait 10 full minutes before putting on Carac Cream. put vasaline around your eyes and lips before applying cream. Don't put any product over carac no makeup,sunscreen,moisturizer, unless your doctor says you can. Funny story; My 11 year old niece was entering my house for a family party with a 5 year old fellow cousin who has not seen me in a while and the 5 year old took a little step back upon seeing my face as I greeted them.  The 11 year old look at me with an expression of ooohhhh so sorry your hurting and quickly looks down at the 5 year old cousin and tells her &quot;that's not her real face&quot;.  oh out of the mouth of babes.  ;-) 28 days is not a big deal. I went to work, entertained and went out.  GLAD it's over. Glad I have less of a cancer scare and would do it again if I need to.

I am doing a 28 day treatment. I am on day 22. I wash my face once a day. I prefer night so I can go to sleep through the most ichy time of treatment. The first 4 days my skin did not have a reaction. Days 5-9 my skin started to get slightly irritated. Days 10-14 spots appeared and the skin in my T zone peeled. The irritation stepped up, but nothing more than an extrem dry ichy slightly burning feel. Day 15 my doctor said I was responding very well and I had a moderate reaction.  She also gave me a moisturizer to use, that has alleviated my pain to almost nothing. Day 16-22 my face is red, peeling, dry, irritated, burning but it all goes away, when, I have waited my 2 hours+ and I can put on my moisturizer. All people respond differently so ask you doctor if moistuizer is an option for you otherwise it could impeed your success. I have 6 treatment days to do still. So far the biggest thing was dryness, and it looks terrible. It beats loosing a lip or nostral.

Don't know if its working other than where I have to put it (upper lip, nose and left cheek) spots are very red, my eyes are burning and its beginning to get very blotchy.  I trust my physician - sure hope this does the trick and I promise I'll never go out without sun screen again.  I'll check in next week with an update.

I applied to face neck chest and arms.The first week wasn't bad but by week 2 things were heating up. By week 3 I was on fire with major redness and swelling, my skin was so tight that I had to apply lotion to open my mouth to eat. Didn't sleep for 1 full week and was unable to go to work as clothing was painful. I finished the treatment everywere except for the face, Dr gave me steriods to discontinue treatment because of severity. In the end it did a great job of finding lots of bad cells and my skin looks great. I just had a squamous cell come up on my nose that I guess it was unable to remove.

Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	2/26/2009 11:07:39 PM	Completed four-weeks of 1xdaily on the face. Reviewer who observed that week three is the worst was almost correct. First two weeks, nothing but a little redness and slight burning. Third week it started waking me up at night and had problems eating as skin was very tight. Week three it began flaking and peeling. Shaving with a blade was out of the question. Tried ice packs to keep the swelling down. Week four was very painful; redness started to turn purple and skin was constantly flaking and peeling. Gym workouts were the worst; sweat was like acid on my face. Decided to cut the four week treatment by two days.Have been off the drug for almost a week and this is the first day there has been no discomfort. Redness is greatly decreased but skin is still flaking and peeling. Still a bit of soreness where at creases around the mouth and edge of the eyes. Skin looks much much better than before medication. Some &quot;questionable&quot; discolored places are totally gone. Now looking for the world's best sunscreen as I'm certain I was the victim of name-brand stuff with little UVA protection.Recommend this product and the full 4-weeks.

Other	cweb, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	2/16/2009 8:29:32 PM	I  started using this last week for prevention of skin cancer, I had a few small spots.  Was supposed to do for 2 weeks it has been 8 days and my face is on fire, bright red, blotchy patches, burning, feels better with my eyes closed.I can't put this stuff on for another weekBut as I read previous reviews,  I guess this means it is working. Very hard to go out in public, and I am a sales rep too..Got lots of looks at the stores I went to today, like I am a freak show. Well I guess I kinda am right now. Will post back when it heals up, and let others know.Who invented this cream and said &quot;Fred we got it perfect&quot; Imagine what they rejected if this is the good stuff....

My entire face is very red. It isn't very blotchy but am overall red appearence. It is mainly embarassing to look this way. The only discomfort is stinging and burning for the first hour or so after I apply the Carac at night. My skin is beginning to peel. Aquaphor has been a life saver for me. It is petroleum jelly with lanolin and some other ingredients. I keep some with me at all times and reapply as needed. Just hang in there and know that it really is a short time that may save your life.  
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	2/7/2009 11:43:35 PM	I started applying this to the top side of my hands and have finished 3 weeks at once a day. Applying it once a day didn't really show any change so when I saw my Dr. yesterday,she said to start applying twice a day as there was no real change.  Even after two days of twice a day now, the redness and scaling are much worse.

So far, some areas of redness, but mild.  I see my doctor in one week.  Have been told week 3 is the worst.  Would appreciate any Carac users experience - how was it week to week?
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	1/28/2009 8:38:46 PM	I just started treatment for my AK 6 days ago. I am pretty uncomfortable, red and blotchy. I am a runner living in New England and the winter weather is not helping. My face is very chapped so I started to put Vaseline on when I run and this has seemed to help. As I am sure everyone else will agree, this beats the alternative of doing nothing and risking my health. Thank God for make-up! I will report back as to the results.

A little redness.  The area I am treating is very small; about the size od a pencil eraser.
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	1/8/2009 2:28:21 PM	I am a repeat user of this cream and I must say I hate the treatment.  It burns like mad by the end of the second week and my face looks like I've been splattered with hot grease.  But it does a great job clearing up the skin problems and I have not had any long term scarring.  My advice is, don't use the cream in the summer unless you absolutely have to or you're only covering a small area as the added heat seems to intensify the burning and redness.    
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	ready4progress, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	1/5/2009 10:49:02 AM	I'm using carac cream for my face as instructed by my doctor.  The discoloration of my skin is not that bad, nothing some face powder is not covering up.  However, the burning is almost unbearable.  I'm having trouble sleeping because of the pain.  I am sleeping with a cold pack on my face to relieve some of the pain.  I have my 2 week follow up in another week and will keep you posted.
Roughened Red Patches of Skin due to Sun Exposure	winonalisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/26/2008 10:30:58 PM	Just started treating my entire chest area for pre-cancerous spots (AKs) on my very sun-damaged skin.  Within 3 days of starting treatment, skin broke out severely (raised, bumpy, inflamed red spots). I believe this indicates it's working to attack the damaged areas that have not yet produced precancerous visual symptoms.  Dr. assures me it will get rid of my damage (&quot;liver marks&quot; and the red, scaly spots that never would go away), improve my skin tone, and most importantly help to reduce the likelihood of skin cancer in the future.  Dr. also says it will get worse before it gets better, but I will be patient and wear turtlenecks to hide it until it's healed. Will report back in 60 days.

My dermatologist prescribes and monitors my usuage.It is very unsightly as the Rx does its work, but that is better than developing more melanomas. this is my second time to use carac top and I have had no scarring.

Side effects of skin erosion and tenderness are super painful.  Redness,scabbing and overall unsightliness are overwhelming and makes me ultra self conscious.  The affected areas on both sides of my face, on the apple of my cheeks.  The affected area is like an upside down triangle, from nose, to hairline, to sides of mouth.  I am now concerned of scarring.
