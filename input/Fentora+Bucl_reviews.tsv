Also have RA. Med works well but I do feel it causes mental confusion at times.  Main problem is getting the insurance company to pay for this.  Trouble every refill.  My doctor's office has refused to issue a new script on time, making me wait up to 7 days because my doctor was on vacation and the other doctor would not approve.  Nurse refuses to believe (or maybe care) that I go through withdrawal.  Does anyone know a drug that works as well for break-thru pain and is not as expensive? Does anyone else have to wait up to 7 days w/o medication before getting a new refill?  Did you have withdrawal?

They also cause severe sciatica. Nothing works as well as this medication for breakthrough pain.  Without pain I am able to enjoy life.  The pain free state is certainly taken for granted. I do not have cancer but can't believe that the constant, extreme pain I experience is &quot;less painful&quot; than that felt by cancer patients. Due to this drug being approved only for Cancer patients my insurance company has an &quot;out&quot; to refuse payment. My son was married recently and to ensure that I could attend and remain through the reception I bought the RX myself.  It was almost $1500. for 28 pills. I enjoyed the festivities because I remained pain free thanks to Fentora. It is criminal that I am denied insurance coverage thus quality of living because someone in the FDA thinks this should be approved for &quot;cancer pain&quot; only. Obviously the FDA is not as informed as it should be as it relates to the origin of severe cancer type pain. This drug should not be considered &quot;off label&quot; if prescribed for other types of extreme pain.

I do feel that Dr.s need to monitor their pt.s better to see if they need an increase in medication due to becoming tolerant of the medication as well.

Doseage changed once. This was a last resort med.  some would last about a year and than become tolerante to the med and have to change it. This so far has kept the worst pain down to a bareable level.

Fentora was wonderful at controlling my pain and I didn't feel high. The only two issues were that tolerance comes quickly and the cost. After I got up to 9,600 mcg/day (12 x 800mcg) within a year I decided I needed to get off these. Also, insurance stopped paying and the 800mcg's were $35 per pill so it would have cost me $12,600 per month. It took seven months to wind down reducing 10% per week and it was rough. When I got down to 2,200 mcg/day I jumped off. I still had severe withdrawl for two days in spite of taking subutex to help but I am finally done. I miss how well they worked but I don't miss being captive to them. If I missed a dose I got withdrawl sickness failry quickly. Great drug for break through pain but it gets a hold of you very quickly which could be managed had it not been so expensive.

I have been extremely tired I do not know if it is from this medication or something else going on I do not have much of a appetite but that's OK. I just hope and pray that my health insurance will not stop paying for it. Thanks for everybody else's reviews

This is substantial considering the levels and duration of chronic pain.

After exceeding 120 mg of long acting pain (per dose) and 90 mg of break-through medication - a pain management specialist recommended Opana and Fentora.  The Opana was equivilant to oxycontin and too expensive.  The Fentora, though very expensive, is extreemly effective.

I have tried the companys pt assistance but since I have drug coverage, I can't get any help. If anyone has found a way to get around this issue, please  send a review of your experience. The drug is great, if only you can afford it.

This med has worked very well, with the exception of  becoming very tolerant very quickly. And it is eats up my gums severly. I also have to battle with my ins. constantly. with their limitations on how many tablets I am allowed to have. Like they can control my pain with limiting how many tablets your allowed.But a good med for pain control. Wishing everyone the best.

Very quickly I found that although Fentore provided the best pain relief with fewest side effects, one &quot;side effect&quot; that I had not counted on was the speed with which tolerance, dependence, and subsequent inter-dose feelings of withdrawl would develop.  Within a couple of months, I told my prescribing physcian that i did not want to keep taking it, and we worked out a tapering of schedule.  Even with the taper, withdrawal from Fentanyl was intense (trust me, you will want to be somebody else if you ever need to stop taking this, so don't do so abruptly).  Cost was an issue as I could only afford through the mail away plan, and sometimes the mail away pharmacy would not deliver the next script in time to avoid gaps: YUK!  Remember, faster in equals faster out, and it is this feature that presages dependence potential.  Use the (Duragesic) patch instead if your MD thinks it will work for you.

This is the only medication that has helped the pain in my head.  It is so expensive though that without insurance it is impossible to afford.  It is worth every penny.

It had to be increased rather quickly and I became quickly addicted to my 800 candy.  I have great fear of this rx and will be switching back to Actiq this week.  I am also on duragesic patch.

This is the only medication I have ever taken that completely takes away my migraine and I am able to function again. The only problem is as another person mentioned it is so hard to find a Doctor who will prescribe this medication to treat Migraines in my area. I have been contacted by the maker of the medecation and my insurance and they both say this medication is used seldom to treat serious migraines. There are doctors out there who are disapproving of this medication which to me (the patient) is very, very sad. I now have to suffer when I shouldn't have too. The medication works when nothing else will.

It takes effect quickly, smoothly, and has relatively few side effects.  I only wish the DEA didn't leave doctor's feeling so terrified - that it's now extremely difficult to find a provider who's willing to prescribe these meds to those who need them.  Most doctor's with whom I spoke became wide-eyed with the fear of God at the mention of a class II med.  It is among the most expensive meds out there, but to be able to function againwell worth the extra expense

I stopped taking it because I cannot afford it even with good insurance.
