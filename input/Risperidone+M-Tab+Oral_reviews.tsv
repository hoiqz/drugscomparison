Bipolar Depression	25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4		25-34	10/26/2011 4:21:15 PM	Ive been taking it for over 5 years, I gained some weight, but I decreased the dosage a little bit (my doctor did, of course) and I don't feel as hungry all the time anymore. I also felt it decreased my sex drive a bit, which should be better with a smaller dose now. I love this medicine though. I was extremely anxious and worried all the time and now I'm calm and peaceful. Great medicine!
