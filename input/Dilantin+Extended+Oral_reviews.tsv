Simple Partial Seizures	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	55-64	2/7/2012 3:10:14 PM	Haven't had a seizure in 5 months so I am not sure how well it may have prevented them because on day 9 I started breaking out in a rash which now covers my whole body. Medication stopped and will try a different medication. I took Keppra which made me depressed and suicidal even though it controled the seziures. Will now go to a third drug.

Please read warnings on all RX's before taking. May God keep you safe.

No seizuresfor 15 years.  Stopped Dilantin and had gran mal 2 yrs later.  Dr prescribed tegrital had gran mal after 1 month w/new medication.   I'm back on Dilantin and have not had a gran mal for 25 years.  Important to have your dilantin levels checked ever 6 months.  Bleeding gums can be reduced w/soft toothbrush, brushing min twice daily.  Dose has varied between 300 and 500 mg daily.

Epileptic Seizure	In Vermont, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	9/18/2011 1:57:15 PM	It took a while to get the right level of Dilantin in my system. I had just about every side effect that was listed. The worst were sleeplessness and joint pain. It overrode the HRT I was on so hot flashes returned, and facial hair increased, plus bleeding gums. I am now weaning off of it. Weaning onto the new drug has not been fun but I think I will be in a better place with it. 
Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	the special angel, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/5/2011 8:20:14 PM	I have taken this medication since June,1965 and it controlls my seizures but I can not take the generic. Since the generic came out I have tried using it at least 5 times and had a seizure within 14 to 21 days. I think it maybe because I have taken the Brand Name for so long before generic was available. Has anyone else had this problem ?

Epileptic Seizure	dawn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	4/8/2010 3:09:22 AM	This med has decreased my seizures greatly, I am also currently on Zonisimide for partial seizures.  I previously trid Keppra, Depekote, Tegritol, Trileptol, Zongran none of which I could stand.  Either they didn't work or they had terrible side effects.  This med IS NOT PERFECT, my levels have gone up and down.  The last time my levels went up my allergies were bothering me badly and I missed the sighns until the level got to 50.9.  All meds have side effects but the side effects of Dilantin I can tolerate for the most part.  My only gripes are the up and down levels and the dental problems.

I insisted they get me off these meds, so i was put on a sceduale to wean off.  After getting off the depakote i felt better and seizures slowed down... but was still on my dilantin... and still not at at well..anxiety, fear, crying jags. now i have been off of both drugs a few days and have horrible mouth pain. Other withdrawl symptoms have been anxiety, fear, shaking, tremors and still havinf seizures, but milder and less often..... I will be seeking other more natural ways of getting my seizures to stop.... i just don't trust these drugs. I am wondering who slse has had such a horrible experience?

I am back on it now, with no intention of any more children, and before this was Keppra (sucks big time!) BUT I've had extreme cases of anxiety &amp; panic attacks, and earlier this summer I thought I was having a stroke. Thats happened to me with both Dilantin and Keppra..just loss of feeling on different sides of the body each time..greatfully it wasn't a stroke, but somehow it has to be tied to the med..its the only thing I'm taking. I'm ready for something new..or maybe just go back to phenabarotal (sp?) !!!

No seizures since I started the treatment; however, since the neurologists (yes, plural) say I will be on medication for the rest of my life, we are currently trying to transition to Keppra XR due to the long term side effects of Dilantin.
Convulsive Seizures	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/14/2008 11:58:24 PM	I have been on dilantin for over 22 yrs. Having just gone through menapause, I feel like dilantin has inhibited the absorption of hormone therapy to relieve hot flashes. I am also having trouble with penechia which comes from low platelettes. My CBC came back abnormal twice but when I went to the onocologist he said I was normal. Something is not right but I cannot get anyone to connect the dots so to speak between hormones, dilantin, platelettes, B12 absorptiomn. I was told dilantin does inhibit absorption of B12. Can anyone help me?

It did have a sedative like effect overall. I have now learned from my neurologist that some studies have shown that with extended use it can cause boneloss. I have switched to Kepra and am having success. I hope Dilantin has not had any lasting effects, I've been on it for nearly 20 years and have a family history of osteoporosis.

Epileptic Seizure	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	12/5/2007 11:43:59 AM	I have taken three different types of medication for my Epilepsy, Dilantin 100mg kaps, Dilantin 30 mg Kaps, Those are taken together for me, Before that, I was taking Kepra 1000mg, and Before that I was taking Depakote 500 mg.  When I first started taking the depakote, I was okay, and everything was fine, but for some reason I decided to do some research on the medicine and found out that it can cause Pancriatitis (not sure how that is spelled), so I went and got that changed to Kepra, because I wasn't only scared of getting sick more because of the medicine, but I also wanted to have children.  While taking Kepra, I was still having the seizures, so, I figured, best for me to get my meds changed again.  When I first started taking Dilantin, I was okay, but, about a month or two after I started taking this medicine, I started having petite mals again, which is why I had to get my meds upped.  I am still really shakey, and I have a hard time standing because of that.  I am not sure if this medication is working for me either.
