However I am having problems with the drug stores.  They tell me that the manufacturer of Roxicet has stopped making it?  It is the only one that helps my pain and I do not know where to go for it.  I live in Middletown, NY?

Pain	BSJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	35-44	6/19/2012 6:42:23 AM	I was prescribed this medication after having my tonsils out to deal with the pain. I was to take 5-10ml every 4-6hrs. I found out quickly that I could only take 5ml because the 10ml wiped me out cold for at least 8-10 hrs.The taste of this medication was horrendous (it was cherry) and that is the one flavor I cannot stand so for me, this was hard to take and I had to chase it immediately with a little water.What this medication helped me most with was being able to eat semi-solid foods. Once the effects wore off though, I definitely wanted another dose, especially when I went back to work after a week.I had no side effects from the medication.

It doesn't really stop the pain, it just makes you not care. I didn't like the sensation. I also started having horrific night terrors / sleep paralysis / auditory hallucinations after 4 days. I had to go back to the Dr. and demand something else.

I had it in the liquid form since I was not able to have pills. I have no addictive behaviors but found myself watching the clock for my next dose. It took about 4 days for the flu like feelings to go away after I stopped taking this drug.

After Surgery, I began having normal menstrual cycles after 10 years of irregular cycles. They were also very painful. I have tried Tramadol and tylenol and both are Ok at controlling the pain but it does not get rid of it. The Roxicet works great and once my cramps are under control I can then use the non narcotic drugs to control them. The only thing is that it does make me quite groggy so I can only use it when I am at home for a while.

This particular medication I am taking has a 54-543 on the one side of the pill and a 'pill cutter' mark on the other side of the pill.  When I look up the actual pill description, it comes up as Roxicet; another brand name for Percocet.  In all my six years as being a Pharmacy Technician for Rite Aid Corporation I have never seen a brand name used to describe another brand named drug which is the same.  Example:  If you are taking Glucophage XR 500...THE PILL BOTTLE SAYS THIS --- If you are taking Metformin ER 500/Metformin XR 500, the bottle is marked accordingly with a small printed message below this name on the bottle stating it is considered a generic type version or another version of the brand name drug Glucophage XR 500.  This particular Roxicet was never mentioned on my pill bottle no where, but actual has this formulation of medication in the bottle based on the 'pill identifier' description.  It actually has Oxycodone/Acet++ with the actual BRAND NAME BELOW IT OF PERCOCET.  THIS LABELING PROCEDURE HAS TO BE INCORRECT AT BEST!!! MORE ON THIS LATER AS I DISCOVER AND INVESTIGATE WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON IN THE UNITY PHARMACY SITES HERE IN WASHINGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND MY MEDICATIONS.

My throat hurts so badly that when I talk I have been told I sound like a special needs person.  Roxicet does NOT take my pain away, it just kind of makes it more bearable. I have found that it does not last me the 6hrs that it is supposed to, wearing off after about 4.  This could maybe be due to the fact that I haven't been able to eat in four days, or because mine is a liquid prescription (so I can actually swallow it). Only thing I can say for it is it starts working for me within 5 min, and it has caused me no drowsiness so far.

He gave me 150 pills at 30mg and said to take up 2 5 a day. Next thing you know I start withdrawals after 2 hrs. So I got up to 10 a day. I do not have a addictve behavior nor depression. Im very happy and successful and these pills almost killed me. I realized I had to go cold turkey due to the fact that you cant cut down when your body needs them. I became very moody and angry. It stopped working on pain and I had to take them just to get normal otherwise deathly sick. So when I stopped I had to go to hospital twice because I couldnt keep fluids down and vomited everything. They gave me blood thinners to help with the withdrawals. Bottom line you still have to deal with severe withdrawals for anywhere from 3-10 days. I think it took me at least 2 months to feel right. My doctor is currently being investigated on 5 deaths due to this due. One lady had severe constipation from drug for 3 weeks her insides blew up from sepsia. One more thing roxicets really mess with your respiratory system. There were many nights I couldnt catch breath and thought I was gonna die. Please be very careful on this medicine and make sure your having bowel movements or take meds for proper bowels.

I started with 5mg oxycodone with tylenol 4/day 4 years ago, increasing regularly to 10 mg 8/day and now to roxicet 15mg with no tylenol 8/day.  The relief starts after about 30 minutes and lasts about 3-5 hours, depending on what I'm doing (my mind is busy or just waiting for the next pill!).  After that I get anxiety, sneezing, nausea, and restlessness until my next dose. I can go up to 12 hours from my last dose at night until I wake up.  The pill works best with something to eat.I don't get any drowsiness except sometimes on a long drive, but I also take neurontin, which deoes create drowsiness.  I take 1200 mg before I go to bed to help me get through the night without waking. All in all roxicet works well, but you always have to keep increasing the doseage when you get used to it.

Overall the reduction in pain was minimal, about as effective as any over the counter pain reliever.  Only major side effect was extreme drowsiness which I have never experienced with any drug.  Even sleeping pills and Nyquil have no effect on me!  This was a good thing when I was trying to sleep through the pain.  Not a good thing while at work.  Thank goodness I take the bus, I was definitley in no shape to drive.

Over the course of the last few months, my pain has been hard to manage. Oxycotin and other drugs became to strong and made me feel tired/worn out all day. This drugs has worked fairly well with the pain that mainly comes at night.It's easy to use and hasnt had any side effects such as nausea,constipation,etc.Overall, Im somewhat satisified and I havent felt withdrawl symptons.
