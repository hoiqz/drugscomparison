Ulcer of the Cornea of the Eye with Bacterial Infection	Jo Jo, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	65-74	9/21/2012 1:10:50 AM	
Other	Dad, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Male	35-44	7/4/2012 2:24:18 AM	Never again. Suspected something was wrong when price of this fluoroquinolone (Vigamox brand) sunk in. The long term (5 year+) risk to benefit is massive. Never had leg, knee, or brain fog issues until taking this drug. Then read that it should be reserved for use of last resort ie when other antibiotics have failed for the bacterial infection. Do not use in children nor in completive athletes - negative side effects in the next two years can not be cured (eg tendon, muscle, nerve damage, brain function). I wish I had known this - simple antibiotics easily worked in my neighbor's kids.
Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	Nicolas, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Male	25-34	7/4/2012 1:17:07 AM	Works. However, works by interfering with DNA action. Side effects can show up two weeks to two years plus after use seemingly even with these eye drops. Classified as an antibiotic to use only when others have failed.NEVER give to kids because their cartilage is still growing. Avoid use in athletes. Do not give to old people 70+60+yr. Expensive because many uses have been banned and numerous similar versions have been pulled from the market. Extreme caution is advised.

The 3ml bottle sells for over $86...multiply that by 3 people in the house with pink eye and you have $265 in very expensive eye drops. 
Other	GlaucomaEYES, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	6/16/2012 1:35:19 AM	I was prescribed this to use after glaucoma surgery. I DID NOT have an infection- so, I'm not really sure why it was given to me to take in the 1st place. I had given the Dr. all my allergies but she obviously didn't read them &amp; I didn't find out till after I took this that it is a flouroquinolone which is a VERY bad class of antibiotics Which is in process NOW of becomming a drug ONLY prescribed as a last resort because of the high possibility of debilitating musclular/tendon damage that doesn't show up for weeks or even a year after use. (google it) It works by distrupting DNA processes! It's not like any of the other antibiotics. I had taken this in the past (I didn't reconize the new generic name of it, &amp; trusted that my Dr had read my file)Well, sure enough after using it I got hives &amp;  the worst headache ever! It makes your head feel like your brain is trying to squeeze out of it! Read your prescriptions &amp; look them up- it's your body! Don't let the greedy pharmacuetecal companies strong arm you into the low cost nightmare drugs- usually they are low cost for a reason! Azithromycin or biaxin drops work even better stay in the eye longer &amp; are around the same price with none of the bad side effects of the flouroquinolones!!!-I would only use those if you could DIE if you don't &amp; nothing else has worked- they are THAT bad- read up on it.
Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	Fred, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	45-54	6/14/2012 10:16:20 PM	Do not use, especially on kids!  This antibiotic is much more expensive than others that usually work $95 vs $6, and this type of antibiotic has side effects including death, induced arthritis (in rabbits), and negative impacts that show up six weeks to a year later. The antibiotic works by disrupting DNA. It has been pulled from market due to these risks for most other applications. If your genetics are at risk - like I was - the damage can be severe - my muscles locked up 5 weeks after use of &quot;a few drops per day af a fluid that stung the eye&quot;. I was hunched over for two months until chiro and rmt could get me straight again. Around that time my tendons and plica did funny things - 11 months later my knee meniscus ripped in several locations for not very good reason. If you do your research, include this whole drug class - I no longer trust some of these sites. Several people are making money on these high priced drops. EVEN it is an antibiotic of LAST resort for the not limited use applications. Even if your drug plan will pay for this $$$ - think again, my kids pink eye were easily treated with gentamicin for one and tobramycin by another. IF you hear that your eyes are worth more money-run. ELSE you will be like me.  Note - for some people this may be needed as a last resort-but unlikely. Do NOT risk it. Do a wiki search on fluoroquinalone before you risk lots for a few crummy drops of this moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5% - I wish I had. PS perhaps take calcium and magnesium after treatment is done to mop up any leftovers. SAM-e may also help DNA recovery but I hope it doesn't come to that for you - or your kids.

Web searches after showed risk of this drug class is very high. Would not recommend unless other (normal) pink eye antibiotics do not work. Cost of this drug was over $50, while other types cost less than $5 for my kids. This antibiotic class is a Use of last resort type - do not use it.

It was a bit expensive even at the cheap place ($102) but it was worth every penny. The pain in my eye was literally immidatlly taken care of, and the redness and puffiness. I have to take it once every 2 hours only in my right eye which for some reason makes my left eye feel dry in comparison at times, but I'll live.
Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	allibean, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	3-6	12/17/2011 4:00:15 PM	My son was attacked by a pitbull. We tried several eye drops/creams to get rid of the bacterial infection caused by his injuries before we found this drug. Love it. Have used it in both of my children for pink eye as well. People complaining about the side effects should research their prescriptions a lil mote before using them. I thoroughly research anything I give my children so I understand all possible side effects/reactions. Yes, it caused dry eyes, tearing, and redness. That's to be expected. It works by drying out the infection. Hrmm no brained that it might dry your eyes and sinuses too. I love this eye drop and would reccomend it. Works fast and effectively with little trouble (not like ointments that make a huge mess). My kids allow me to put it in their eyes no problem (3 and 2) as we deal with pink eye often due to seasonal allergies.

My 2 year old has this eye infection for the second time and he was prescribed this Vigamox again. Unfortunatelly there was no generic and the insurance didn't cover. Really? can't they have another company making this prescription for less? This is not a drug for cancer, or anything like that... Very disapointed with the price for the size of the prescription.

Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	pinkhorse, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	7/20/2011 3:19:03 AM	My 3 year old had been using it for his bacterial pink eye for 3 days, 3x a day as recommended by his doc, and on the 3rd day, he broke out in hives, itchiness, swelling, welts.  I gave him topical Benadryl to combat the itchiness so he could sleep. However, I am discontinuing the use of this super drug, since it appears the condition will go away on its own according to other reports. It did clear up his eyes tremendously on day 1, which previously was swollen shut, was red, and had yellow pus coming out. However, I would exercise caution before using it again.

And it still works! When it is finished I will buy another bottle and keep it, it's really a great medicine.

HOWEVER- within 24 hours of his first dose he developed 2 very bad nose bleeds.  Blood literally poured out of his nose at some points and took about 2 hours of stuffing repeated cotton balls into his nostril(s)to get the bleeding to finally stop each time.  A total of 4 of these nosebleeds and only 3 days into treatment later, I believe the drops are to blame and have discontinued use.  I'm in contact with the Dr. to prescribe just basic Ciloxin GENERIC ointment.  Why not start with tried and true methods and then proceed to the stronger (and very expensive) treatments if the infection persists?  That's what is done with oral antibiotics to lessen the chance of the body's resistance to various bacteria.  The same precaution should be taken with antibiotic eye drops as well!  I'm disappointed with my Dr.'s recommendation and can't help but wonder if she was swayed into prescribing Vigamox because the drug rep had just recently dropped off free samples to their office.  Hmmm.  Funny that they just happened to &quot;run out&quot; of these prior to my son's visit, yet refused to write a script for the ointment saying Vigamox was the only way to cure his pink eye!  We can expect health insurance rates to keep sky rocketing if Dr.'s insist on prescribing such expensive medicines immediately without trying the older and less expensive remedies first.  Vigamox retails at $120.00 at Walgreens for a small 3ml bottle!

After putting drop in eye, experienced a burning sensation in both arms, which lasted about a minute.  Used drop for 2 days, 4 times a day, before reporting this problem to the doctor.  His office replied, continue use and if problem gets worse, contact family physician.  Not satisfied with this response as family physician had not prescribed the drop.  After calling back, was told to stop both drops, and given another prescription drop that is working fine now.

Day 1 his eyes were also puffy after the first few applications. This is our 3rd day. It has been traumatic trying to put it in his eye since I assumed I had to try and put it directly in it. Thank God for this site and the post that recommended the closed eye method. I will try that after calling my Pediatritians office. Unfortunately I didn't gain ANY of the information that I have gained from this site from my Pediatritian. If I had it would have been worth it because it has worked and quickly.

But the medicine is working beautifully, I seem to have had some sinus pain, but nothing I could not deal with, just seemed like the air was cold. Also my mouth and tongue felt a little funny like I wanted to get ulcers but they never really developed and now by all of that is subsiding. The drug was very expensive because I do not have any insurance, however, I do not regret paying for it because it really did do what is supposed to do and that was to help heal my eye almost right away. 
Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/12/2008 9:40:13 AM	It's working beautifully and quickly for the pink eye, but after 3 days my sinuses are starting to go crazy. This medication seems to dry them out quite a bit, especially while sleeping.I've had pink eye before, and used a different, cheaper eye drop. The few extra dollars for this one was well worth it, as I was able to go outside the very next day without discomfort due to the sun. It also stopped the excessive tearing by the first night.

Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	0-2 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	0-2	8/31/2008 2:24:37 AM	This was prescribed to my 11 month old daughter after the (weak) cheep stuff didn't work. We used it for 3 days and it seemed to clear up the pink eye but then her eyes stayed red and she developed hives and a rash on her face. Our pediatrician told us to stop administering it (which we already had). I have been trying to figure out if this is a sulfa based drug but I can't find anything to tell me that. Her grandmother is allergic to those types of drugs and she may have inherited that.

My whole face itches, but there are no visible hives.  I do not have any swelling or discharge in the eye area.  My eye dr. wants me to continue to use it, but not sure I can tolerate it.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/24/2008 9:36:36 AM	I have been using vigamox every hour of every day to treat a corneal ulcer. i started treatment on tuesday (it is now sat.) after today i can reduce my applications to every 2 hours. my eye feels SO much better- the only reason i didnt give 'effectiveness' and 'satisfaction' the full 5 stars is because i wont know if the drug has worked for sure until i go in for my next exam on tues.

Other	steeler7, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	5/2/2008 12:45:31 PM	Tried Vogamox for Style.  At first I thought it was working but then my redness and swelling returned.  The Ophthalmoligist said because I stopped with the warm compress it didn't all drain out.  She gave me a prescription for Keflex antibiotic pills and said to use a warm compress every two hours until it drains and swelling goes down.  Similasan over the counter works fine to relieve pain swelling ang redness. Don't use Vigomox for Stye.
Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	cutie momma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	4/30/2008 12:47:16 AM	I used this on my 3 year old and my 5 year old. It worked great for me.  I have a tip for giving this to small kids.  What I have found to work the best is to have them lay down on their back.  Then, with their eyes gently CLOSED, put the drop in the corner of their eye.  Then have the child open their eye slowly.  This way the meds get into the eye, but you don't have to traumatise the child by dropping the eye drop directly into the eye.  It is works great.  My children have had no problems since finding this way to deliver the medicine.

Within 24 hours inflammation showed great improvement and almost gone at 48 hours.  Twice-a-day dosing much easier than some that need 4 times a day.

Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	caring mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	1/23/2008 1:07:19 AM	Both my children had pink-eye, one was pretty bad, it looked like someone had put red food coloring in his eyes. Within 2 days they were cleared up. Same with my daughter. I laid them down and had them look away and put the drops in, within minutes they said their eyes did not hurt. Continue the treament as stated, Ithink it works great. It also allowed them to go back to school earlier.

Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/17/2007 9:06:38 PM	Yes, difficult to place eyedrops in a toddler, but very effective overall.  I've also tried an ointment for myself (less expensive), but it's quite messy and left me with blurred vision during treatment.

Both the top and bottom lids were swollen within 30 mins of admin..
Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/19/2007 10:02:36 AM	Used to treat a corneal ulcer.  Reduced pain, redness, and tearing within the first few hours.  Healing started quickly -- eye pain and redness was reduced by 50% by the next day.  I am using it exactly as prescribed by my doctor (am on the 4th day).  Healing takes a week or two.
