I also have Gastroparesis, which makes taking pain pills worthless. I get Sub-Q injections every 3hrs and the pain is considerably eased. Nothing can take my pain away, but this is the best it's ever been. I no longer have any side affects, they all go away within a short period.

Acute Pain Following an Operation	hatedit, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	11/14/2010 10:49:18 PM	After surgery I woke up with terrible pain and a headache.  When I was alert enough to ask the nurse what she was inserting in my IV she told me Diluid and that it would relax me and put me to sleep.  Joke on that one!  I felt like I had a brain tumor and was litterly climbing the walls for hours.  Later after calling the nurse again and again for help she came in with the same medication.  I refused it and she gave me regular Tylenol (which usually does not work) but I took it anyway and the next morning the headache was so bad and they would do nothing else for it so I left the hospital against medical advice.

Was the only Med that worked for pain relief before and after surgery to drain it. Only side effects for me were lower blood pressure (but not dangerously low) and sleepiness/light headedness.

Severe Pain	megandennyjr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/24/2010 9:22:54 AM	After an ovarian cyst had burst, I had SEVERE pain, at first they gave me Morphine and it didnt even cut my pain. Then, they started me with doses of dilaudid. After about three iv injections, did I feel relief. However, the only side effect, for me, was SEVERE! I asked them to stop the dosing of it. I was vomiting SEVERELY and continuously. I told them I would rather deal with more pain than more puking...

When given through an IV you feel immediate relief.  I highly recommend this for anyone in extreme pain.
