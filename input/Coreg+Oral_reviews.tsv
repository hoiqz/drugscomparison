High Blood Pressure	Stephen, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male		6/11/2012 12:58:17 AM	I had a triple bypass ten  years ago.  I was prescribed Coreg about six years ago.  It did not do me any harm that I know of.  Recently a new doctor (new to me, that is) took me off Coreg.  That was about six weeks ago.  So far, no problems.  BP is o.k.  ED somewhat diminished.

Got an electrocardiogram w.doppler and was diagnoised with heart failure.. added coreg to diovan 160/25.  Started on 6.25 2x daily and did very well.  Upped it to 12.5 2x daily and bp dropped too low (never a problem for me-lbp). Went back to 6.25 2x daily.  Also very tired and not able to sleep well, but had those problems before coreg.  Otherwise, I am doing well now.

Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	DancingQueen, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female		12/22/2011 1:16:48 PM	The dosage for this med ranges from 3.125mg to 25mg per dose x twice per day. It is difficult to find the correct dosage since the med takes about 1-2 weeks to enter your system. Have been on this med since 1/2009 at lowest dosage. Just had another bout with afib and got prescribed 25mg x twice per day. This dosage was too high and resulted in low blood pressure and feelings of lethargy, no energy. It took about two weeks to find the correct level in 1/2009 after first bout with afib and placement of pacemaker, so I'm expecting the same length of time to adjust dosage now.

Started Coreg in the hospital and my BP has been controllable ever since. My blood pressure and/or pulse are sometimes very low, and I have been worried about it, but saw my doc today and he is not worried.  There is no doubt that I am often tired and have less energy, but I think I must stay the course until I do MY part in improving my health - through weight loss. It's easy to seek better living through chemistry, but the truth is I HATE taking these drugs and know that chances are good that if I lose 20 to 25 pounds, I probably will not need the drugs. My goal is to drop 20 pounds this winter and be off the drugs in time for summer. Best wishes to all in your recovery.

I have tried carvedilol but caused leg cramps so bad I couldn't walk.  I take coreg to keep my heart at 60 beats so my valves don't wear out to soon. All the side effects are part f my life now. It took about a year for me to get use to sleeping more and the dizziness but now they want to TRY different drugs that are CHEAPER.  I am really scared something might go wrong. Its a scary feeling when your heart isn't working.

Chronic Heart Failure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	9/3/2011 11:50:29 AM	My EF improved dramatically using this medication in combination with meds for blood pressure, cholesterol, allergy, and vitamins as prescribed by physician.  I also lost 53 pounds, exercised 20 minutes a day (now 40 to 45), and have been heavily involved in Christian-based support groups.  Twenty-six months after treatment, however, I have been experiencing sleep difficulties and a sense my heart is beating too hard or irregularly at night.  Actually, I have a difficult time accurately describing the latter symptoms, but it is usually in bed that I experience this some troubling feeling concerning heartbeat. Also have some dizziness.  That doesn't detract from my optimism, however, since my EF is now in normal range (was a full 10 points below) and blood tests are very encouraging.  In fact, intend to take these newer symptoms to physician who, I predict, will reduce my Coreg dosage to one pill per day (I now take two, 6.25 mg each).   The night pill, I was once convinced, used to help me sleep, which is why the cardiologist continued prescribing this second pill (decision made in June of this year--2011).  Since then have lost 12 pounds, which is when the dizziness, usual sense of heartbeat (let's say noticeable heartbeat at night, in bed), and difficulty sleeping really started.  The last symptom (and really the last two) may have also some stress-related causes, although I've actively addressed those.  So...today (Sat., Sept. 3) through Labor Day I will probably continue taking this second pill, but Tuesday Sept. 6, 2011 I am calling the physician.  Reason didn't react sooner is I have a follow-up appointment with family physician in early October and thought this could wait.  After all, I am a man and we just sometimes foolishly resist checking with the doctor.

Just recently, I have noticed nausea upon waking in the mornings.  It makes me tired and makes my thought process clouded for some reason.  This is not the only medication I am taking.  I also take Plavix and simvastatin.  I have a very irregular heart beat anyways which A-FIB causes me a lot of discomfort the majority of the time.  I have noticed that if you take this medication with food, it somehow makes it not so queasy on your stomach.

My pressure is normally ok 118/74 to 136/80 during the day, but midday my pressure shoots up -They say it anxiety because I dialysis 3 times a week, so I take Xanax 2 hrs before the treatment. My problem is my pressure is worse because dialysis takes all of my meds out during the process. I wish they made something that didn't dialyze out!!!

Chronic Heart Failure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	1/1/2011 6:11:31 AM	Diagnosed with heart failure and enlarged heart five months ago following a viral infection of my heart. When I began treatment my EF was 25%. I take 3.125 mg carvedilol 2X a day. Four months later EF is 45%. I am also taking ace inhibitor Altace (generic)which seems to be an amazing medication. I am happy with my progress on both medications. Coreg does slow me down somewhat which I don't like. I notice this more sometimes than others. I sometimes have to push myself more than I used to when it comes to physical activity but the trade off for such improved heart function in four months is well worth it. Also when I first began taking Coreg, it gave me abdominal pain. Some say eating right before taking helps with that. That side effect rarely bothers me now and I do eat before taking it.

Severe Heart Failure	SuzyQ, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	10/20/2010 3:47:12 AM	I was diagnosed with COnjestive Heart Failure due to a Viral infection in 1998.  I have and will be on this medication for the rest of my life.  I was 38 years old wehn I was diagnosed with this conditon.  My doasfe has been adkusted several times.  I do know that I started having problems with my vison and lights in stores affected me terribly to the point they seemed so bright I would have seriuos dizzy spells and barley made it from the store to my car as I knew I has to get away from the brigh t lights.  They were blinding me.  That was around November and Decmeber of 2007.  They had switched me from the real Coreg to a Generic one which was part of the cause of my problem.  I saw my family Doctor in January so I could get put back on the REAL Coreg and when he saw the doasge prescribed by my Cardiologist he knew immideiately that soasge was to high.  He cut my doaage to 6.25mg. twice a day whcih did stop that side affect I was having with loights appearing extremely bright in stores.  And alos the severe dizzy spells that came along with it.  Cutting the dosage in half did make a difference,  I had a Full Recovery from Conjestive Heart Failire in the Spring of 2003.  I reallly beleive part of the reason was from the drug Coreg.  The main use and treatment was for Conjestive Heart Failure.  I remember the commercials about why and how this drug came about and was approced by the FDA in 1997 I believe.  SO, I have been taking this since 1998 and always have to be careful as it does cause dizzy spells when gettting up from sitting to fast.  I am always aware that it will give me those if I kump up too fast.  I thik it also helped immensely in my Full Recovery.

I asked my doctor, if maybe there was something else that would be effective, for my blood pressure.  He tells me, that this is the best medication for the heart.  I do not have heart disease. I can tolorate the dizzyness.  I am having weight  gain also.I really would like to try another medication .  I am depressed, because I never feel good.

It gets up to 200+ over 100+.  A Nephrologist put me on this med knowing I have asthma.  Description states do not take if you have asthma.  Very dissastified.

Dysfunction of Left Ventricle of Heart following Heart Attack	verysick,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		9/1/2010 2:24:14 PM	I have been on Coreg for 6 months after having a severe heart attack at 52 years old.  I have no side effects but I really cannot say Coreg does anything.  My doctor is slowly increasing the dosage now. My EF was 33% when I started on Coreg. I will see how I feel in a few months.  I really feel alot of pain every day due to a difibrillator that is not put in correctly. (Cuts off circulation all the way down my left arm, which is now spreading down my left leg.)
High Blood Pressure	sandy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/28/2010 12:21:21 PM	This might not happen to any body else out there, but i posted a note the last one about all of the side effects that I thought this drug was causing me. I started on this drug 9/09. I was nervous, dizzy, tired, thirsty, and my knee joints started hurting to the point that I could barely walk. My left thigh and foot swelled and I thought I might be in CHF. I had an echocardiogram &amp; there was NOTHING wrong with my heart. I went to a new Cardiologist and he didn't understand with my records why I was put on Coreg in the first place. He took me off that drug and it's been 6 days, and ALL of my side effects ARE GONE! My leg has gone down, my joint pain has stopped. When you get knee pain that goes from 0 to 100 within 3 weeks it's not just arthritis. I was taking arthritis tylenol &amp; now I don't need it. I've put up with this for almost a year and I had no clue it could be the Coreg until I started resreaching side effects. I was not going to settle for arthritis in my knees or venus veins in ONE leg and not the other. I am back to ALMOST normal thanks to this new cardiologist but thanks to MYSELF and the others on here that took the time to post that they also had trouble with this drug. I hope that many others out there will CHECK things that come on suddenly. Now my husband takes Coreg and he has never had a problem. but he had a heart attack at 59 with a 98% right coronary artery. He has a reason to be on it. To put some one on that with high BP was uncalled for. I hope that this helps some one else out there.

High Blood Pressure	cassie, 55-64 Female 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	8/22/2010 12:58:28 AM	I was put on coreg 3.125 mg 2 a day last September 2009 for high blood pressure along with htcz. My BP did go down, but after a few months I started noticing I could sleep 8 hours and get up and still feel sleepy, and have a head ache. i have had dizziness also and joints hurting in my knees and here almost 10 months later my left leg (thigh) and calf and my foot have edema. this started about April and got slowly bigger. I have felt tired and will go to sleep easy. I also have asthama and and I have had a few bouts with that. I've had a thickness like the size of a nickle on each side of my thigh swollen in round circles. I think that this medication has caused this and it has taken this long for it to finally cause the swelling to get bigger. I had an echo cardigram last October &amp; it tested my heart was fine. I've also been thirtsy and felt bloated and have gained weight with no extra food intake. I will see the cardio doctor Monday the 23rd to see what he says. I will post what we find out. Coreg did bring my BP down but I'm not sure if these side effects are worth it.

I have no idea why my two previous reviews have not been posted. Please contact me at 'paul.morrison@shaw.ca'.I have attempted to use Coreg on three different occasions at the strong urging of my cardiologist. Each of the previous two attempts left me weakened, dizzy and extremely lethargic. My overall fitness level suffered as I no longer had the energy to walk or ride a stationary bike. I had difficulty sleeping due to the bizarre sensations I felt in my chest (to me it feels as if there is a hand clenching my heart, trying to control it's beating). Now, as I quit Coreg for the third time, I have endured the same side effects as my earlier time on the drug. Unbelievably, I have just spent 17 hours in the emergency ward suffering from intense dizzy spells, nausea and sunlight sensitivity. I was taking 6.25 mg twice daily and had been on the drug for approximately four months.

Dizziness, weakness and nearly zero energy. Lethargic beyond belief. Now I am left too dizzy to walk, let alone work. My vision has also been severely affected. I've just had 24 hours in emergency care, released to open up a bed, am home and unable to get up the stairs to my bed without assistance. Yet, what does the cardiologist say? &quot;Stay on the coreg.&quot; I don't think so.

Dr's. believe it was due to a virus settling in my heart after a bad respiratory infection &amp; genetic predisposition.  Injection fraction was 15% and close to death @ 41. Dr slowly increased dosage to limit side affects (although fatique was awful). Eating immediately before taking limited side affects greatly.  Injection fraction currently @ 35% and scheduled for another ECHO this month.  Hope to be close to normal. My mother died from same disorder 10 years ago. Unfortunately, Coreg wasn't available yet. She may still be with us.

Soon after taking it she was incredibly bloated while still taking dieretics (sp). She could no longer stand or do anything on her own. After four and a half months she died, needless to say this drug not only did her no good, it is our assumption that this drug ultimately killed her. NOT RECOMMENDED

Dx'd with valve problems but mainly irreg. heart rate, fainting, etc. This drug has eliminated most of all these symptoms.  I still get racing heart rate at times and skipped beats, but increasing the dose has really helped me. Supposedly it also has anti-oxident properties as well and it reduces the workload on the heart. It doesnt lower my blood pressure which is good since its normal to low.

Switched to 12.5 twice daily after 2 months and experienced dizziness and memory loss after one week I went back to 6.25 mgs. Memory loss is better but still have complete blank moments almost daily. My test results show great improvement with my ejection fraction going from 10% to 45% and combined with my other scripts it seems to have been a great contributer to my recovery! My only advice is to watch your dosage carefully! Side effects can be limited with a little attention to your body and communicating them with your doctor.

Rx 25mg 2x am/pm. Took 1st pill last night, awoke this am with my stomach ulcers on fire. Took am meds but not Coreg - cut pill in half because my dosage I believe is too high. Took 1/2 pill Coreg and within 2 hours so dizzy I was passing out. Ended up too dizzy to stand, called relative who sent my sister over - my bp when I took it early before 1/2 pill taken was 93/43. I am diabetic,also. After passing out twice this afternoon my cousin stayed on the phone with me and my family came over. I am going to take the half pill and cut it in half tonight - so I will be taking 1/4th of the pill and see if this helps and doesn't inflame the stomach ulcers tonight. Otherwise, there is NO way I will go for very long with the side effects of this drug. The dizzyness by itself is too dangerous since i live alone. So far, I think the dosage of 25mg 2x a day is too high. Maybe if it is adjusted it might work for me. It certainly brings down the bp but the side effects are too troubling. My Nexium controls the ulcers so they are never a problem but after reading the monolith of this drug, I realize the Coreg is problem the problem. In the meantime, the bp goes too low, also.  So far, this is too scary!

He had high BP and was initially given Metropolol to lower his BP and make his heart stop pounding all the time.  He took the Metropolol for about a year and the symptoms were not going away, so the doctor put him on Carvedilol (generic for Coreg). Since he's been on it, the BP is normal, no fast heart beat and he feels great. This drug has been perfect for him with no side effects.

It works great, but occasionally my pressure droped to around 66/44. My MD put me on Coreg 6.2 mg bid. The 2nd day, my pressure rose to above 196/98. The third night after taking Coreb, I woke at 0500 with a tremendous pressure headache, my pulse was throbbing, my heart racing. I immediately got up and took my Benicar &amp; Atenolol. By 1100, my pressure dropped to a more reasonable rate, 144/85..still a bit high, but not stroke territory!

High Blood Pressure	jerikb, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	4/15/2009 8:34:31 PM	After signing up for a medical study, during the screening process they found my blood pressure high, and I told them I had recorded a 126/84 only 9 mos. earlier.  They suggested I go see my doctor, and at his office I recorded a 160/110.  He put me on coreg, and after 2 weeks my bp is 126/84 and resting hr of 72 bpm.  Seems to be working, no other mediction prescribed.  A bit of a nuisance at 2x daily as I have never been on any regular medication but as I am getting older into my later 40s I guess that's just a fact of life.  I wouldn't say &quot;dizzyness&quot; as a side effect, but if I stand up too fast or turn my head to look another way quickly, it's sort of a &quot;floating&quot; sensation, almost like being at the top of a roller coaster rise, weightless.  No loss of energy, but I'm not as excitable as I used to be.  I have a very stressful job with daily delivery deadlines; now daily problems don't cause me to get as as upset anymore or cause my heart to pound the way it used to. We'll see how it goes.  I don't think I really like it, but I think if the house was burning down around me I'd be saying &quot;whatever&quot; and just calmly find a way out and walk outside and watch it burn emotionless.

Tests came back that I did not have high BP, or high cholesterol - heart catheritization was &quot;clear&quot;Immediately I became very sluggish, and withdrawn after taking Coreg.I've asked repeatedly to be taken off of it, but my cardioloigist refuses - I am now looking for a 2nd opinion as I am not pleased with the side effects

I take a lot of medications,but this Coreg has made me feel horrible. I am totally exhausted. I get my daughter off to school at 7:30a.m.and have to lay back down because I'm so tired. I hate this medicine. I just can't function properly. I have fatigue from the lupus but nothing like I now have everyday.

My dosage is 2-25mg in morning and night and 25 mg around noon time (total 125mg daily).  I also take Diovan 320, Inspra 25mg, Norvasc 5mg, Digoxin 0.125mg and lasix 80mg 2x a day. I also take many other meds for diff medical issues.  The coreg worked great for a long time, at one time I was on the heart transplant list. They believe the coreg was a big factor in increasing my muscle pumping blood back into my body. My probem is I have a difibulator which has/does go off on occasion as my HR goes up over 170 for 3 minutes at a time. Not a fun thing to experience. Not sure if the coreg is still working like it did in the past. Not sure if this is true but I have read that coreg should not be used as a long term solution. I sleep ALOT as well as get dizzy/lightheaded on occassion. Not sure what to think but it is getting depressing.

Now, it only happens after being bent down for a while. Tired is gone.I only take 6.25 mg 2x a day along with lisinopril for a balanced approach. Works great. People should be aware that tired also comes from blood pressure sometimes just being normal when they are use to being  &quot;go, go, go&quot; up with the pressure. It isn't the meds that make you tired but the release..........

I have High BP and it's working.  I take 10mgs.  If you have side effects it might be a good idea to start at a low dose and work your way up.  I tried ACE Inhibitors and they practically killed me!  So I welcome this medication and hope it continues to work for me.  :)

This was controlled for a year then began to experience severe fatigue,couldn't climb stairs nor exercise well began to bloat again and found it impossible to lose weight, kept gaining. Finally off it. I'm a new person. I am able to walk at a brisk pase  I can now walk up stairs without dragging myself up. I have so much renewed energy and I have my life back again, since I stopped taking it. This drug never helped me. It just interferred without my daily living. I suggest anyone taking this drug monitor themselves carefully.

He did crossword puzzles daily with little effort. He had enjoyed all the things especilly dancing, and driving. When his heart rate dropped to 44 AFTER activity. I paniced. I was planning his funeral.  My daughter, a RN to me he was over medicated. So, reluctently we took matters in our own hand. We cut the Coreg in half. We closely monitor his symptoms of CHF and to our amazement he came back to life. He is not tired all the time. He is not confused anymore. Within a weak he has become independent again. We have had about three months of these side effects. I am glad we figured out what was wrong. I only wish we would have sooner. Coreg seems to work. However, to much of it is WORSE!!!!!!
