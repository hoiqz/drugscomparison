Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis	mccers, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	10/1/2012 6:04:36 PM	Since my partner has been using Stelara (about 3 years now) his psoriasis has cleared dramatically. However I have experienced severe mood swings in him, very irrational, paranoid and depressed during the week - 10 days after injection. And a constant fatigue. IS this the experience of other Stelara users? If so, any advice on managing these side effects?

Very severe at times.  first steroid creams and ointments, then progressed to tar and photo therapy, then to methotrexate.  Methotrexate was effective but along came enbrel and Dr. had me switch.  Enbrel was effective for the most part....still had to use some steroid creams, etc.  Have been on Stelara since it first came out.  Very good results over this past year....tested effectiveness by not using any steroids and psoriasis is pretty much localized to elbows.  Now just use steroids periodically to maintain.  Nice to just have to go to the Dr. every 12 weeks vs. having to do weekly shots.  Only side effect is vertigo which has started the past month and not sure if it is related to stelara or not.

They never metion that if you take this after takeing other s like humira you can have demylanting brain lesions which there is no cure and its crippling affect.like humira this drug should be off the market there studies are a farce.

After the loading doses and at least the first 12 week treatment, my psoriasis quit bleeding, that was a huge improvement.  Like many here I went through all the usual treatments until Stelara (also on Methotrexate), including Remacade (this is when the bleeding started).  I do have side effects but I'm going to try to tough it out since I would like this to work.  Sore throat, runny nose, tired, headaches, some of these symptoms subside after about 1 - 2 weeks.

My psoriasis grew steadily worse. Not worth the health risk involved in the use of this medication , for me.

I've been taking 90mg of Stelara every 12 weeks and for a while it seemed a lot better.   In the last few weeks, however, it is now by far the WORST flare I've ever had.   I just don't know what to do!!!

Enbrel,Humira,Remicade,Raptiva,Orencia,Laser and Phototherapy.  Nothing worked and even had allergic reactions to some.   Have been on Stelara since November and it has been amazing. I had given up hope but it has really worked for me so far.....Downside is that it is ridiculously expensive and my next injection wont be covered by insurance and long term side effects are unknown ... however this is the first summer that i have enjoyed in a long time     Good Luck!

After the first 2, my psoriasis came back with a vengence, but has improved remarkably.   I just read an article that said some patients don't see any improvment until about 1 year...so keep the faith!!!

Have now developed Lichen Planus which doctor feels is linked to Stelara....anyone else have this issue?
Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis	marie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	8/5/2010 10:34:31 AM	Never again!  I was injected and the next morning my tongue was swollen.  I called the drug manufacturer (the Stelara toll free number on their website) when I was concerned when the tongue was all swollen and they kept me on the phone for 20 minutes just to ask me my name and phone number 4 times and then tell me to call my doctor since they could not give me any medical advise.  Why couldnt they tell me that All I wanted to know if this was a possible side effect because their website does not list it (but thankfully drugs.com did list it).  At the time I was not overly stressed or worried my tongue was visibly swollen and I could not eat but I was able to breath normally. I called my doctor and he gave me an epi pen if my throat closed and he was very concerned.  I could not eat all day because of the swollen tongue and spoke funny with a lisp.  Later in the day, my jaw swelled and locked where I could no longer speak, my eyes and lymph nodes swelled as well. I had intense pain in my ear down to my jaw bone like a ice pick was piercing the ear drum and going down into my jaw.  I was still in denial.  I initially thought I may have had a dormant bacterial infection or viral infection that became active with the immune suppressant, not an allergic reaction.  I went to an emergency clinic.  We got there right at 7:30.  The doctor kind of laughed at me when I said I thought that I may have an infection. He told me that I had an allergic reaction.  He gave me a shot of prednisone.  He said if I went to the ER they would give me the shot, a Rx for steroids and an antihistamine for home.  I left there at 8 PM.  By 9:30 all of my symptoms were cleared.  It really was a true allergic reaction.

It is helping some and have noticed some improvement. Im using stelara every two months however when i was taking it once a month i had dramatic improvement. Every two or three months just not that effective.

(still need to apply ointment on and off every week)

I have a home light therapy unit but that isn't exactly safe long-term.  Neither is the cyclosporine that, although effective, my doctor won't leave me on for extended periods of time.  My psoriasis left unchecked often covers my entire body! I've been on raptiva as well as humira and neither drug helped at all.  The humira actually aggravated my psoriasis and my doctor had to put me on a large dose of cyclosporine to get it under control again.  So when Stelara became an option, I didn't think it would work because the other biologics didn't.  I was so very wrong! After my first injection my skin was significantly clearer; only the spots on my knees and elbows and a little behind my ears lingered.  Soon after my second injection my skin was completely clear.  I am still having a hard time believing it.  I'm actually going to get my third injection tomorrow and I am excited! About getting a shot!  The only thing that I would change about the drug is the fact that I have to go to the doctor to get the injection.  It would be a little more convenient if they sent me the meds at home.  Nevertheless, I could not be more surprised and happy with the results I've gotten from Stelara. By the way, I have had no side effects from the medication either which is awesome.

So far, I am 95% clear!  That is with starting level of 70% of my body with psoriasis.  I was on Raptiva which was 85% effective and Enbrel which did nothing.  I think this is a wonder drug.  Too bad I can't give the injection myself, though.

I got my second injection a few weeks ago and other than some skin discoloration at the patch sites my psoriasis is almost totally gone.  I have had psoriasis for almost 50 years and nothing has worked like Stelara.

So far, no noticeable changes...still very red skin patches, lots of scaling, itchiness had decreased somewhat.   Have noticed some tiredness and have experienced an acne breakout (may not be related, but started after the first injection).   Will have another injection April 29.

I experienced two days of mild lethargy, other than that, no other side effects. it has helped approx. 75%. Humira did not work for me so my doctor says this should  work. Well, at the same time, I was given Clobex steroid cream. The combination took the psoriasis away except acouple of areas on my heels and palms. Cannot see it but can feel it. Hope I continue to improve and stay that way.
