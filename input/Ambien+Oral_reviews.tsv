No side effects other than occasional headaache. Does not always put me to sleep timely and not aways keeps me asleep long enough, but overall works for me where nothing else does.No funny business or sleepwalking or talking.  I wory because I am addicted to it.  Cannot go to sleep without it having tried many other remedies.  Ambien works for me.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Ambien, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	8/17/2012 12:10:43 PM	I see why this drug is recommended only for short-term use. I used it for more than a year and I needed increasingl stronger and stronger doses. Finally, I noticed that it caused depression. I remember being in my doctor's office and I was sobbing with depression. I had a severe withdrawal, extreme insomnia. My doctor then changed me to another med which is continuing to work safely and okay. I think Ambien is wonderful for very short-term use. Don't use it for long periods however. I contracted a disease in 1989 (either Lyme, CFIDS, or MS) and I had SEVERE SLEEP DEPRIVATION due to the disease.

They are not. I started taking the generics and I found myself to be nauseous and not falling asleep. The next day I was slow thinking and miserable. I've taken Ambien for 10 years with no problems. If your lucky your Doctor can write you a prescription and put on it no substitutes.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Trebuchet, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	8/9/2012 4:53:49 PM	Took one: it made me dizzy and nauseated. I did sleep, but it wasn't good sleep because I was nauseated; it was like drunk sleep. Very surprising since I'd heard so many good things about Ambien :( But worst of all was the hungover feeling ALL DAY and the headache that made me sorry I'd ever heard the name 'ambien'. It was free through my insurance, but I'd rather pay the $90 for Lunesta and get a little good sleep than ever touch this again. It's just not for me.

I now can sleep for 5 to 6 hours instead of 2 to 3 hours which is a huge difference. After several months of use, I now only need it once or twice a week. I will say that you only need half of a 10mg pill and no more. If you need more then there is something else wrong and you should not take this medication. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	mmnurse, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	7/29/2012 11:21:25 AM	The Ambien helped me to sleep very well. I am a nurse...the first day after use I found myself very groggy after I got to work and could not remeber my computer ID, it took me two hours to pass meds that normally only take an hour.  Second day side affects even worse...my drive to work was very scarey, finally got there, told my my boss I couldn't working safely under my liscense and had someone come get me.  Got home slept four hours and woke up to nonstop profuse vomiting, went to ER had fluids and anti nausea medication and was put off work for three day with no driving, i am now on my third day  still taking something for nausea and vomiting and still having bad side affects and itching as well.  Although this drug assited me in sleeping the reaction I had to it was awful.  Pt.s need to be aware of ALL the side affects and possible reactions they may suffer.

Other than that I have no complaints and is very pleased with the product.

Doctors knows all the problems and that's all I get even if the said i could only 1, I've explained. I need to know what the pill looks like because sometimes they look different from the other and I'm wondering that may that's the reason that it works at times and some don' work.. brand name and generic would make a differance. So please show me a pictures of both.  Thank you,Maria Delgad-Ortiz dob 8-8-51

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	gogirlgo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	7/8/2012 2:47:32 AM	The very &quot;first&quot; time I took this pill I landed in the emergency room and then the hospital for 4 days. I do NOT remember the ride in the ambulance, nor the very loud MRI, and to add to the situation I did NOT fall asleep after taking the pill. I remained awake for approx. 24hrs, and yet do NOT remember 23 of those hrs. My story is not rare. THIS drug has a very scary effect on people. USE caution, you may be one of &quot;those&quot; people who react and do things you will not remember or would normally do!!!

My GP prescribed Ambien to help me sleep. I used to wake up ever few hours but with just half a pill I sleep 6-7 hours solid. It does not interfere with my other medication, and have not had an &quot;episode&quot; of doing things in my sleep. I just take it when I get into bed and lie down.

During this time, I started to have severe neck, and upper neck, shoulder blade and back muscle pain.  Because I connected the Ambien with the start of the muscle and neck pain, I did some research and found others who had the same problem.  I stopped taking Ambien for 2 days and the pain has decreased by about 50%.  I am going to discontinue ambien for a couple of weeks to see if the pain stops.  Anyone else have issues with neck and shoulders?

Difficulty Falling Asleep	75 or over Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male		6/11/2012 10:57:32 PM	Been taking this drug for 1 year and am completely satisfied. However, still was concerned about addiction and whether over time the drug would still be effective. I decided to cold turkey and in spite of the horror stories I heard re; withdrawal it was simple. I I only suffered one night of rebound--- sleeplessness -- and that was it. My recommendation, try to avoid and don't feel that you it's the easy way to get a good nights sleep. Be realistic. It is a foreign substance and we have to pay the piper in some way. Our body chemistry was not formulated to add alien substance if not an absolute neccessity.

Somewhere along the third month she told me to see a psychiatrist, who prescribed me ambien 10mg cr(highest dosage) for my insomnia. The ambien didn't only not help me sleep, but also made sleeping more difficult. I was on ambien for a month and a half, and within that time period I: woke up 5 different times having sex (twice not with my boyfriend), driving my car on the wrong side of the road, in downtown detroit at three in the morning, and making every food in my fridge&gt; i would have to hide my money because if i didn't my money would be missing. My younger brother told me that several times i tried hooking up with him, i was told i good naked excessively when i would go places. While i was on the medication i would feel anxious, i saw more things than i did on LSD, and i felt very uncomfortable all the time, i was however more open to discuss my problems, i don't remember though. While on Ambien i would steal any kind of pill to sell it and make money off it to buy more ambien, I got so addicted that within that month and a half i got a total of three different doctors to prescribe me a month supply. so yes i took about twice the amount prescribed, not including the ambien i was being off the streets. when i wasn't prescribed a fourth script i started taking xanax after my doctor gave me that for my anxiety, not even a month deep i was out of money, doctors, ideas, and people to use. It got so bad i ended up in the mental hospital for 5 days. Im not saying that will be the end all be all for taking ambien, but i am say: if you do take it, be careful! I'm sure it has helped many people, but unfortunately it destroyed my life. try melatonin, its natural and is a chemical already found in your brain. I do not take anything for my on-set insomnia, i just let it ride out and try to get sleep when ever my body will let me. its a pain when i work and i havnt slept in days. i wish you all the best

It only helped me sleep for one night.  It replaced an anti-depressent and I had ever withdrawal symptom that is mentioned.  It has been 3 days and I still have not slept.  Dr. said to stop taking it.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Is Ambien worth it?, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	4/15/2012 12:10:37 PM	I started taking Ambien after 911. Living in lower Manhattan made like really stressful. I slept great an felt good when I woke up. But was told I say and did things I could not remember the next day like order stuff on line, making phone calls, cooking weird food, displaying uninhibited sexual behaviors.  As my life stresses became bigger I turned to Ambien at night to escape the days worries, just to shut my brain down and rest.  I started working night shift and found only Ambien helped me sleep right away in the day because I could not block out the noises.  So here stated my addiction.  After 12 years on Ambien I'm up to 15-20 mg to get to sleep at night or I am up until 6am the next day.  My only fear is that I will burn down the house one night because I tend to get hungry after taking Ambien so I cook weird dishes and fall asleep, leaving the pot on the stove. (scary at times) either my daughter will smell it and wake up or the next morning the pot and it's contents are unrecognisable.  I try to eat before taking Ambien or take it with a snack.  I've really been thinking about trying something else less risky. Because soon my daughter will be off to college and I won't have anyone to get up and turn off the stove:(

Chronic Trouble Sleeping		3	5	1			4/3/2012 11:34:42 PM	This medication is creepy. I take it according to my Dr.'s orders (5-10mg) and always end up sleeping at some point. However, most nights my husband tells me I do all kinds of things that I can't remember the next day. I only take it out of total desperation to sleep, but wouldn't recommend it to others before trying other methods/medications.

Once asleep I have no problem staying asleep. I have been taking Ambien for 8 years now. The thing is, follow the advise: don't drink alcohol, empty stomach when you take it.Go to sleep about the same time at night.No naps. Yes, It is addictive, but if you follow the &quot;rules&quot;, it can really work well. It works for me. I take 10mg doses only, NEVER more than 1 pill per night. I hope this helps someone.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Be of good cheer!, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	3/10/2012 5:21:47 PM	   Ambien never could do for me what was expected of it and not being able to stay asleep long enough/night has been a chronic problem especially having to deal with manic-depression. Recently there have been warnings about these newer classes of sleep medications!  I was taking 10mg/night allowing for 7 to 8 hours sleep time but began only sleeping ~ 4 hours/night. I've been taken off Ambien and now take the 5mg or 10mg Melatonin 30 min. before my bedtime.(The 10mg of Melatonin is a time-release formula &amp; have been sleeping ~ 8 hours/night). Last night I've just started Seroquel XR 200mg/night taken about 2 to 3 hours before bedtime and also taking the 5mg Melatonin 30 min. prior to bedtime also as advised by my Dr. As of the first night's changes, I slept 8 hours or more. I'd even drank a cup of coffee about an hour before taking the Seroquel XR which I later thought would ruin my chances of sleeping as well but it didn't. Although if I were going to drink coffee before bedtime, I think 4 to 6 hours prior would be advisable. In the case of sleep aids I would highly recommend that a person consult their pharmacist and/or Dr. before proceeding with these combinations. Walmart carries the Melatonin varieties at very reasonable prices. Have a great day!

The longer I used the Ambien I found I was having increased problems falling asleep and I began having bouts of extreme fatigue while driving as I used the drug more frequently. Two mornings ago I found my vehicle, which was in the driveway, with all of the windows completely down. I had no explanation for the occurrence. They had been up when I arrived home after dark and it was a cool evening. I never open the windows, and I always lock the vehicle. The ignition key is required to open them as they are power windows. I was relieved that the car had not been driven and that everything of value was still in place. The only conclusion I could come to is that I had gotten up from my bed, in the night, and gone outside and used the key fob to unlock the car and then turn on the ignition and roll down the windows. I woke up in bed with no knowledge of any of this. I have no previous history of behavior of this type. I was not experiencing any of these symptoms before taking the Ambien more frequently. My conclusion is that this drug is not a good fit for me... I will never take it again.

Difficulty Falling Asleep	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/21/2012 3:55:13 PM	Ambien is a lifesaver for my chronic insomnia. I fall asleep within 15 minutes &amp; I wake up refreshed. Only problem I have with it is that I do things I don't remember. I make phone calls, have sex, etc and I remember NOTHING. People tell me what happened &amp; it can be annoying.

Lately my thoughts have turned to taking more and I've become depressed, moody and don't eat or sleep for 4 or 5 days.

I have a hard time shutting my thoughts off, if i lay in bed at 8pm i will be laying there wide awake until 5 to 7am, still exhausted and restless and more agitated. my doctor gave me ambien, i checked it out, it's not addictive and ive never tried to fight the feeling of sleep when i take it. If you are trying to get that affect then yes you are abusing drugs. It instantly works for me, i take it at 8:15 and am asleep by 8:30, no joking!!! It's excellent, i have tried all sorts of other medications and am allergic to benedryl, so i can't take over the counter sleep aids. ambien keeps me asleep until i wake up to my alarm in the morning and the best part: I FEEL FULLY REFRESHED and not groggy or moody at all. it's like a genie in a bottle. I take it when i need to, it has helped me to get into the swing of falling asleep by myself. I started taking it every night 10mg tablet and then went to an every other night and now I'm down to maybe twice a week. last week i didn't take it at all. So i think it just depends on the type of person that is responsible and has it for its only purpose and that's to sleep. I took ambien with my first pregnancy as well and my son has no problems whatsoever, he's actually an extremely smart child, well above average for his age group.  I would recommend this to anyone that has difficulty going and staying asleep.

It works for some and not for others-a solid night's sleep for those of us lucky ones it does work for!!

It made me tired, but it was impossible to sleep because I felt like I was stretched across the room and seeing a tree in my house. I would not recommend this drug because of its side effects.

BUT .. the crazies have hit .. language skills gone, go to put something in frig and it ends up in oven, the way I dress now is truly hysterical (everyone but me), I cannot talk in a full sentence and if I could write what that condition is called, I would. DON'T DRIVE under any conditions. I must've been living my other life because I started driving on the left (I live in the US). This all may seem harmless, but wait until you suddenly begin falling and it wasn't a planned pratfall. Only take as last resort &amp; someone very kind (and patient) lives with you, full-time. I will miss the solid 8 hours but now have yoga ... has some really sexy benefits. Try it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Dawna, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	55-64	1/24/2012 4:14:57 PM	I have taken Ambien 10mg for many years and every  night I went right to sleep. Then the Ambien stopped working as well and I was either having trouble falling asleep (up to 2 hours!) or staying asleep longer than 3 hours. Today the doctor put me on 100mg Trazodone. I think I will take 100mg Trazodone and 5mg of Ambien and if I awake in the middle of the night I will take the other 5mg of Ambien because it works so quickly. I take the Ambien when I am IN bed and ready for sleep so as to avoid any possible side effects of sleep walking and calling random people on the phone as my son did when he was prescribed Ambien. Ambien has been a great drug for me - I only wish it would still help me sleep through the night.

My sister also uses  ambien. She planned she and myself a trip one nite after she had taken it and her son called her to invite us to go with them. When they called to confirm that we were still going, she had forgotten about it. I thought we were still going because she called me after her son called! No harm done, just thought this was so funny. (day dreaming at nite time!)   :)

She was off it a couple weeks then went back on. Hysterical violent hallucinations like an acid trip for two hours. Screaming hysteria and violent shaking without being able to calm her down.  The dr. said he thought it was more of a nightmare and didn't think it was the meds. We tried it again the 2nd night, even worse. I threw the meds away and will never give my child this again. Worst experience in my life.

Ambience has worked for me.
Difficulty Falling Asleep	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/3/2012 12:01:12 PM	I started taking 5mg of this medication over a year ago because I have had trouble falling asleep for years. I follow the directions to the letter. Take it on an empty stomach, no alcohol, go directly to bed, devote plenty of time for sleep (at least 7 hours). I also don't leave the tv on because of the flashing lights and sounds. I usually read for about 20 minutes until the medication kicks in and fall asleep easily staying asleep all night. I have had no side effects except for a few hallucinations when my boyfriend keeps me awake past the time when the medication starts working. I know they are hallucinations when I'm having them, they are pleasant and I know I just need to go to sleep. I have stayed on the same dose but I also only take it several times a week. This medication along with a night time routine is really helpful in establishing good sleep patterns. Best advise: start out on the lowest dose possible, increase very slowly if needed and follow the directions.

Its the worst insomnia I have ever had.

Anyone else have the same result?
Difficulty Falling Asleep	Anonymous, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	45-54	12/22/2011 6:27:33 PM	This is a very dangerous medication that should be taken off the market. It can cause sleepwalking. I myself apparently swallowed a whole bottle of Ambien and a whole bottle of Zanax in my sleep. It could have been fatal. Lunesta is equally effective without this risk.

Wasted money in my book. Better going to the Dollar Store and buying a bottle of sleep ad for $ 1.00 and taking 2 pills at one tine . Now I just go there and buy 5 box's of 24 per month, in case I can't sleep , and don't run out.

I have cervical dystonia in my neck that is painful 24/7.I don't enjoy going shopping because my neck wants to turn all the time and I have to stop it.There are days the pain is so bad I want to end it. When there is less stress it gets very much better.I have learned to live with it but it is a great struggle.I do have a job with stress but I work hard through my problem and no one realizes there is something wrong      un-till my head starts turning,which tightens up my neck muscle so bad they cramp, and will stay like that for hours or day's. but I have to keep working because I strive to be the best.I'm a 57 year old male who came down with it a few years ago and has seen it affect me in a lot of ways.A lot of things I used to love to do I can't do quite so well anymore but I keep trying.When I get home from work I'm very tired and have to take a nap. then i will get up and do a few things before before the pain starts and    I have to take a pill to quit my brain down enough to get some sleep. Some times I'm awoken from the pain in my hands and arms because the muscles have contracted in my hands and arms and are very painful.or my jaws are clenched shut cracking my teeth and causing me to have TMG.Sometimes I just set there and cry..why me? All my plans I had made for retirement have changed.If it wasn't for the treatment I get or the Ambien to sleep, I don't know how long I could go on.,

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Kitkat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	11/26/2011 2:53:04 PM	I have had chronic insomnia for quite some time.   I have been put on Ambien and have been using it for three weeks.  I don't have any side effects but I don't get much sleep with it either.  When I take it I go to bed and put on my TV with the sleep timer for two hours.  Somewhere between 1 1/2 - 2 hours I finally fall asleep.  I sleep 1-3 hours and then wake up dozing off and on the rest of the night.  I guess I am getting more sleep than I was before but want to know what it feels like to actually sleep 6-8 hours at once!  Going to doctor in a few days and will discuss this with him.  Need more sleep!  I haven't had any of the issues others have brought up so I guess it depends on your body chemistry.  I have always had to take more of a drug than recommended to make it work effectively but will not take more of the 10mg I was prescribed of the Ambien unless the doctor recommends it.

I was relieved when I was given Ambien and it worked. I was on it about 6 months until I started hallucinating and having memory loss. My kids even named it my crazy pill because the hallucinations made me act crazy. So thats when I stopped taking it. It wasn not addicting to me had no problem stopping. I was then put on Trazadone which so far so good.

It is the only thing that will let me fall asleep. Suffered from complete insomnia for years - watching the sun come up day after day, week after week. I suffer from severe arthritis and fibromyalgia, but Ambien lets me fall back asleep during bad pain episodes. The only problem I have had is that I wake up deeply depressed which lasts for 2-3 hours. Perhaps I need to change my depression medication.

I used it for four years but developed severe anxiety attacks during waking hours.  It is also very expensive.  It resulted in disruption of cognitive ability.  It is EXTREMELY addictive which I found when I tried to stop taking it.  I even wrote the manufacturer asking how to get off their product.  The company had an attorney call me and asked a zillion questions then stated the company would get back to me.  They NEVER DID.  I did finally break the addiction after several attempts over a few months.  I did not sleep for six days on my last attempt but the end result was I broke the addiction.  It was very stressful.  Ambien was initially prescribed and stated as NON ADDICTIVE.  I hope someone begins a class action suit against the manufacturer, I would be happy to join it. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	oldsarge, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	65-74	10/21/2011 11:30:31 AM	My wife has been on this medication for years now and cannot fall asleep without it now. However, she does get a good night's sleep without any side effects. I'm now going to try it. I've had a couple of her pills and they worked well for me. Medication affects us differently as people are chemically made up in many different ways. Lifestyles and other medications do have an effect on side effects. Any medication that goes to the brain has a tendency to do strange things to some, but not all. Are you laid back? Hyper? Emotional? All of these play a role in side effects of meds that go to the brain. There is nobody that is 'normal'. We are all different. Just because someone gets up in the middle of the night to drive, eat, or have sex without knowing it, is not something that should scare others into not taking it. The sex part does interest me however (smile). As with any drug, read the rather lengthy info packet that comes with it and discuss it with a pharmacist if you have concerns.

I usually take 2-4 hours (same problem my dad has, could be genetic), and never sleep more than an hour or two at a time. With  a combination of Ambien and Celexa (for my depression) I easily fall asleep 45-60 minutes after taking 10mg and stay asleep all night, as long as I don't miss that window. I always take the meds and go straight to bed, but often get distracted with hallucinations of some sort. But it works great - always wake up refreshed.

I cut the 10mg in half or quarters depending on the time I go to bed and wake up because it does make me very groggy the next day. If I can get a full 9 hours I will take 5mg. I stay asleep and haven't noticed any side effects except some tiredness the next day. I won't take more than 2 nights a week because of all the concern with it being addictive. 
Difficulty Falling Asleep	75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male		9/23/2011 2:59:11 PM	Great, but worried about addiction. I have troublecoming off it, as I can'teasily fall asleep. Sleep ends chronic pain untilI wake up.Some success giving my body arest from it, but it does seem to be addictive. Generic works fine.
Difficulty Falling Asleep	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/15/2011 5:33:58 PM	i have had insomnia for years. this does work but only for 4 to 6 hours each night. it also stops woorking entirely after 7 to 14 days. i dont know why mr dr wont prescribe another drug as i have a few chronic diseases and cannot sleep because of the pain. so i literally go 36 hrs without sleep at all (in between the times that ambien DOES actually help a little). i am 53, take bp meds, insulin and have diabetic neuropathies very painful, cholesterol meds, arthritis all over no meds 4 that very painful, degenerative disk disease no meds 4 that very painful, and MS no meds 4 that eitheralso very painful and just about every type of headache you can imagine, very painful as well!. i am ALWAYS IN PAIN just differs in locations and serverity. I am also in an abusive marriage but cannot divorce as i have no way to make ANY $$ to support myself. cant get ssdi because he (the abusive husband) wouldnt let me apply 4 it AND YOU MUST APPLY WITHIN 5 YEARS OF YOUR DISABILITY DATE SO WHEN I CALLED SSA THEY SAID TOUGH LUCK.THIS IS NOT WRITTEN DOWN ANYWHERE AND NO ONE ELSE HAS EVER HEARD ABOUT IT. I PAID INTO THAT SYSTEM 30 YEARS AND I DONT GET A DIME BACK BECAUSE OF A 5 YEAR APPLICATION TIME LIMIT (IT IS NOT ON YOUR ANNUAL SS STATEMENT EITHER) SO MY GOVERNMENT IS TOTALLY SCREWING ME OVER! IF I HAD THAT $$ I COULD THROW THE ABUSIVE BUM OUT!  gee maybe i need to  get some tranquilizers, ya think?THERE'S GOTTA BE A BETTER WAY! GOING WITHOUT SLEEP EVENTUALLY KILLS YOU!

One time I woke up in the livimg room floor trying to get to my feet. The latest I got up in the morning, and remember talking to my bro-in law at 9:00, then I woke up when I rear ended a pick-up truck about 7/8 miles from my apt. at 9:30. Later that day I found out that I had hit a car and a van leaving the apt. complex. Do not even remember leaving the apt.. I now know how an addict feels when quiting cold turkey. IT IS BAD!

I used to need a nap in the afternoon and do not when i take Ambien and get 7-8 hrs of sleep.Started taking due to time zone changes and a restless sleep partner.Don't know why Dr. wont order this drug. I never have had a problem except for bossy drs thinking they know best. Thats why people have to get in mexico or pay big bucks on line.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	waterslide, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	45-54	8/22/2011 2:38:14 AM	This drug works really well and I would reccomend it... but beware and know that you likely will become dependent on it and eventually need to wean yourself off.  Highly addictive.  I used Ambien to sleep through my chronic pain.  It works best if taken on an empty stomach right before going to bed.  I had to wait up for 20 or 30 minutes before laying down to get the best effect.  I used it for many years and was very Dependant on it.  In the end it really took a toll on my memory.  I was not even able to read a book anymore.  I also started writing emails that I did not remember sending... things like that.  It took three months to wean myself off, but I did it.  I miss the deep sleep, but now my brain is working again!!  Reading books and communicating much better now :)To wean off, you will need the plain generic pills to chop in pieces. Taking 3/4 of the dose for 2 weeks then 1/2 a dose for several weeks and down to 1/4 of a pill.  Took me about 3 months to stop it.  I also had some Ativan or Valuim to help with the anxiety.  I still have to take an anti-anxiety pill to sleep but it does not have the &quot;big&quot; side effects that Ambien did.

I started taking it when I started working night shift at my job and couldn't get to sleep during the day. I took it for 3 years. The longer I was on it the more I found myself craving it and actually looking forward to bed time just so I could take it. I made MANY mistakes while on this medication that I don't even remember doing. Yes it helped me sleep but it was not worth the price I paid. And on top of that, coming off of this pill was hell. I've been off of it for 3 months now and hardly sleep, feel sick all the time, and I have the worst headaches ever. I hate this drug and I advise anyone NOT to ever start taking it.

Difficulty Falling Asleep	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/2/2011 8:31:47 PM	WARNING:  Please be careful when considering this medication!I was complaining about mild insomnia and my doctor prescribed this medication for me.  I began experiencing nightmares and blackouts so I decided to switch to something else.  I began to wean myself off of Ambien and did not sleep for three days.  I experienced shaking, sweating and crying for no reason.  I basically felt like I was going through hardcore drug withdrawal.  By the end of the third night I had a seizure and was hospitalized for four days.Ambien might work for some, but it is highly addictive.  PLEASE be careful and do your research.
Difficulty Falling Asleep	braz, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	7/31/2011 9:04:25 PM	while this med has helped me get to sleep, if i am not actually lying down in bed under covers etc. i find that i carry on with life and then some..... odd eating situations, indepth conversations with family members( then don't remember the discussion). actually getting out and driving for no reason.... finding myself at locaions miles and miles from home and sort of &quot;coming to&quot; and wondering what the heck i was doing there and how i got there. periods of loss of short term memory. but even with some of the side effects (most of which were almost always only present if i wasn't actually in bed ready to go to sleep), i sleep very well and it is very fulfilling sleep, something that goes a long way in helping me to keep a sound grip on the realities of daily life. I plan on continuing with using this medication 100mg dose as prescribed..... making sure i go to bed like im supposed to while taking this drug.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	7/31/2011 4:23:04 PM	I have been using ambien  (10mg) for several years and it has been effective although lately I am not sleeping as well.I am lethargic during the day.  My doctor originally prescribed it as a short time remedy that would reestablish my sleep patterns.  It has only made me dependent on ambien in order to sleep. My brain has forgotten how to sleep. Any similar experiences out there? I would like to be no longer dependent upon it.

I can fall asleep fine but would wake up in the middle of the night. I still wake up but I am able to get back to sleep. However, I have been having short term memory problems and wonder if its related to long term ambien use. I dont mean I get up and do things and dont remember. I mean during the day I have trouble finding a word, like I can see it in my head but can't remember it. I am otherwise normal, have no other medical issues that would cause it.  Anyone else experience this side effect???

I get mixed results. Sometimes it works quickly and I go to sleep rather fast. Other times it may take 1-3 hours for me to doze off. And sometimes It doesn't seem to work at all, and I don't sleep at all. I've noticed that the effectiveness correlates to the amount of carbs. that I may haved eaten earlier in the evening.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Houston/ Central Texas, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	7/20/2011 3:57:57 PM	I am 62,female and have had insomnia for thirty years.Have been on generic Ambien 10 mgs for 15 years. The oblong Zolpidem 10 mgs dooesn't work as well as the round Zolpiem 10mgs. I have never experienced any odd side effects nor do I increase my dose. I take melatonin with my generic Ambien, both work for about 6-7 hrs. I don't ever get sleepy at night. I don't drink sodas or tea, don't exercise late.I take meds on an empty stomach, keep bedroom extra cool,block all light with blackout curtains,no clock,TV or phone in my bedroom,use earplugs for noise. I pray and breath deeply before bed. I'm a normal weight, have some arthritis, but live with that. I think this drug is as good as it gets, otherwise, I would have found &quot;it&quot; before now. Insomnia is a bummer. I think it may be an inherited disorder,runs in my family. Why do so many folks suffer with this? I no longer have kid/or elder parent stress..so I should sleep.I do better in the colder months, so temp may play a part. Houston,Central,Texas is hot.

No dreams or nightmares. Never get sleepy or feel need for sleep.  Take 1/2 dose, lie down, go to sleep quickly, wake up 6-7 hours later. No hangovers.  This med. works. No side effects. Before ambien no Rx or over counter sleep meds had been effective for my wild, vivid and dangerous dreams &amp; one hour or less sleep per night.

I was told it was a great alternative to addictive benzodiazapines.  Ambien is very frightening.  I drove while sleeping.  I went to work after taking 15-20 10mg pills.  I became addicted and almost lost everything to this &quot;safe&quot; drug. Once I tried to quit I started having grand mal seizures from the withdrawal.  Went to Hazelden to get off this medicine.  I met many others there that were in to get off ambien and also had seizures from the withdrawal of this medicine.  My advice would be to try ampitriptlyn to sleep.  I did a lot of scary things over the years while on ambien. Ambien almost took my life.  Don't try it.

This drug is great because of the length of time I have been taking it, it began to become less effective so now I take two during the night.  Four hours apart.  I alway get between 7-8 hours of good sleep.I have never had the wanderings or munchies other people have reported.  I have carried on a discussion with my husband I don't remember.  No reaction would ever be worth giving up the med.  Also be careful of off brands or time release.

Because of her refusal to go to bed after having taken it she starts to speak as if she's drunk and becomes very verbally abusive towards everyone. I don't recommend this to anyone that refuses to go to bed after having taken this.

After one week usage, I started getting very depressed and weepy.  I would sit in my bed at night and just cry over nothing. Ambien made me feel like I was losing my mind and going crazy.  Along with the depression, I also suffered panic attacks and severe anxiety.  In addition 15-20 minutes after I took it, I would blackout and days just started running together. I couldn't concentrate very well, and was angry at my family for no apparent reason.  I really hope they take this OFF the market soon!  It was awful, I would rather barely sleep then go back on this.

Difficulty Falling Asleep	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	5/9/2011 2:31:36 PM	I have used the sleep drug for only a month.I asked to change from Restoril. I have only used it about 5 times, it does put me to sleep quickly but I have very disturbing vivid violent dreams when I am using this drug, I remember my daughter asking me do I remember getting up in the middle of the night, greedily eating and having an off the wall conversation with her, I told her I did not remember and that if I was eating and talking I would remember,but I did not. Also this drug makes me feel very swollen, I did not know the dangers of this drug until I took it the few times I have.It is a very scary thought to know you are up and about  with no memory at all, and the violent dreams leave me very disturbed the next day I do not know sometimes if they are real or not.&quot;BE Careful of this Drug&quot;!!!!!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	anonymous, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2011 10:14:14 PM	I've been on it for a few years combined with Seroquel.  At first I was doing things like texting in the middle of the night, having friends over and not remembering anything the next day.  That went away and I learned to turn off my phone to avoid having conversations after taking the Ambien.  overall, I think it's a great drug, and it works better on an empty stomach.

This drug gave me THE WORST sleep hangover. I woke up more tired than I was before I even went to sleep and it gave me a headache in the morning, which made me irritable, etc. It is also very addictive. I only recommend taking this seldomly. I take Ambien when I travel and am sleeping in unfamiliar places, which is not very often.

Then I usually wake up 4 hours later and take 5 mg more.  I sleep well and can now finally enjoy my vacation and be more energetic. I also like to put my IPOD Touch under my pillow with the speaker on and listen to an inspiring and encouraging podcast like Joyce Meyers or Chip Ingram.  (My husband likes to listen to his buseness podcast with a monotone speaker.)  It keeps my mind off my problems and I doze off.  My IPOD has a sleep timer, so my battery doesn't drain every night.  I have also used a IPOD nano with speaker headphones.  If I wake up in the middle of the night, I put my podcast back on and I am able to back to sleep.

Difficulty Falling Asleep	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	4/21/2011 9:29:20 AM	I was given Ambien as a teenager to help me fall asleep.  While it did do that, I sadly woke up every day with horrible zombie sleeping pill hangover.  And while I was on the pills, I like many others was someone that did things in my sleep.I am an avid sleepwalker anyway, and while on Ambien I would get up every night and cook extensive meals, talk to my family members, and even get into fights.  I gained over 50lbs while on this pill due to all the sleep eating, and I had no idea I was doing it until I was told and found the collection of dinnerware next to my bed.Ambien also made me incredibly violent, again while I was not awake, and would often do or say things in my sleep that would leave me with hell to pay in the morning when I finally did wake up.

Thank God the only injuries were to me, and my car was totaled, but I was about 20 yards from a very busy street.  I could have killed someone!  I got a DUI.

It is pretty good for getting you to fall asleep, however it is not effective with maintaining lengthy periods of sleep.

I'm extremely claustrophobic and both the sleep doctor and my primary care doctor agree this is a good choice for me. It helps me be able to receive the benefit of the CPAP and get a full night sleep. As long as I use the CPAP machine the doctor will continue to refill my RX.

Used Ambien in 2003, but our insurance co. quit covering it, so I had to resort to over-the-counter sleep aides, which DID NOT WORK for me! Last March I heard it had gone generic and I needed it badly, as I was diagnosed with bilateral breast-cancer a year ago this week. Sleep would have been impossible during the weeks and months of my biopsies/diagnoses/surgeries. Too much anxiety &amp; heartache to deal with! The generic Ambien (Zolpidem) worked so well for me, I've stayed on it the entire year, with NO side-effects. I only take 5 mg. per night, and usually sleep all night now, unless I'm overly-anxious about something. I've tried NOT taking it a few times, but can't get to sleep ... and once I do finally drop off, I wake up at ANY little sound, and stay awake. (My husband snores LOUDLY, so the &quot;little sounds&quot; really aren't that little!) Ambien/Zolpidem has given me a new lease on life. We NEED our sleep to function in the day, and I am MUCH MORE functional with this medication.

I took Zolpidem about a month and it did absolutely nothing--and I take trazodone 300 mg. along with it to help me to fall and stay asleep.  I guess I tolerate meds better-I feel sorry for those of you who've had all that &quot;sleep walking, driving, hair cutting, etc.&quot;  I ended up just sitting up all night smoking cigarettes like they were going out of style.

I do feel addicted to them, and as the time has passed by, I do feel memory loss, loss of concentration and extremely depressed. And worst of all, As i read the reviews, i can relate to them. I have done crazy things after taking it and have had no idea of what I've done... I've gotten myself in trouble and others... Make you very agressive and this is embarassing but it does make you do sexual things and wont remember... The medication is great to fall asleep but definiatley there should be more control over it...

If you take 5mg (the lowest you can get), cut it in half and see how it works. At 5'8&quot; and 130 lbs, 10 mg was way too much for me, and I &quot;lost&quot; three days. Even 5mg is typically too much and I cut it in half. The manufacturers have set the mg way too high, I suspect. People could do much better on less. I started taking it due to chronic pain and having trouble staying asleep because of the pain.

It helps me sleep and makes me feel silly if I don't lay down right when I take it.  I have noticed some fuzzy memory recollection, but it isn't like a total memory loss, more like remembering a dream.  Just hazy around the edges. Just use common sense and for goodness sake don't drive your car.

I cannot goe to sleep or stay asleep most nights.  I have tried all the natural techniques and herbs, but none work well enough to enduce sleep for me.  The Ambien CR has worked and not given me any adverse side effects.  However, I was forced to switch to a generic zolpidam and it does not work as well as Ambien, plus gives me a horrible taste all day.  Lunesta also gave me a bad metallic taste, but it was not as bad as this generic 'ambien.'

I have not experienced any side effects.  I often have pain throughout the night and this med has allowed me to sleep sound enough that I don't change position as often.  I usually have to take a few OTC meds that cause drowsiness so I sleep a full night.  I noticed with just the ambien I was waking up too early.  Sleep is the only relief for my pain, so I need all I can get at night.  I also don't usually respond well to narcotics for pain.  I need more than what they want to prescribe, so needless to say my pain control sucks.  This medication has allowed me to at least do some regrouping over night.   My conditions have caused me to be disabled since 2006.  It is nice to take a medication, and finally have it do what it is supposed to.  Would recommend it to anyone having sleeping issues.  I don't usually have any of the crazy side effects people have from different drugs.

When I take zolpidem tartrate (generic for Ambien) I can sleep 4 to 6 hours without feeling need to urinate. The sleep aid medication has much less side effects on me than Flomax. The side efects I am experiencing with the zolpidem tartrate is substantial decline in sex drive. The decline lasts only about 36 hours after taking the pill. The medication is not addictive. I don't take it during weekends or vacation and I make up loss of sleep at night by napping during day.

The first night I took the medicine I didn't fall asleep right away and my boyfriend told me the next morning that I was freaking out because I didn't know who he was and why he was in my bed. The next night, I ended up driving to my friend's house in the middle of an ice storm and took a total of 3 pills, 2 of which I don't remember. I woke up at my boyfriend's house with no recollection of how I got there. I would suggest hiding your car keys and only taking the pills as soon as you get into bed. Memory problems aside, I would recommend ambien for sleep problems, it works like a charm.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	MMurray, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	2/2/2011 7:29:06 PM	I was put on the generic form of Ambien CR and it works well, BUT I've become angry, sad, lethargic, moody, and sometimes down right mean on this during the day after!  I have to stop taking this and suffer through a few nights of not sleeping in order to find something else.  I cannot carry on this way.  My husband says I'm a completely different person since starting this 3 weeks ago.  It works great in putting me asleep and allowing me to sleep all night, but be VERY CAREFUL this stuff is habit forming AND changes who you are as a person!

I tried all the over the counter crap there was.  I tried a perscription called Halceon, did'nt work.  It got so bad that it was affecting me physically.  I almost flew over an overpass in my car on a highway.  When the doctor perscribed Ambien it was a God send.  I've been taking them for 3 years and now I'm noticing that the doasage need to be increased.  But all the other stuff you people talk about hasn't happen to me.
Other	yellowjacket, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	1	1	Female	65-74	1/28/2011 10:10:24 PM	This medication was given to my 91 yr old mother in a nursing home.  She was already on Namenda and Aericept.  She actually had seizures while under this medicine.  Their reason was to relax her so she would not try to get out of bed and possibly break  a bone.  I askeed them not to give it to her again.  Needless to say they gave it to her again.  I know she was tired last night because she had to  be taken to the hospital yesterday for a CY Scan to see if her pneumonia was better.  She has a very bad rash on her face, neck and chest and it is infected from her scratching it.  I hope they don't give it again.  She had no trouble sleeping 10 hours straight at home when i could take care of her before she got sick.

Took for 1 week. Hallucinations, bizarre dreams, wake up talking to people that were not there. Move from bed to chair. Had no idea where I was after only a few minutes of bed/chair change. Scary med! I'd never advise anyone to take Ambien.

Further, along with PMS I also have some occasional/transient insomnia  I don't have regular sleeplessness or an inability to fall asleep, however I AM a person who has always needed my 8 hours in order to function well. My doctor informed me of the side effects of somnambulism, gave me quite pointed and graphic examples of people who had experienced serious side effects, but I was willing to try it after only having slept about 3 hours in 3 days. I have found that 10 mg is the magic number for me after only getting about 4-5 hrs sleep on the 5 mg. I DO have some crazy dreams while on it, but I have very graphic, full-color light/sound/smell type dreams when I'm not taking it which not common to most people anyway, so I consider this a very mild side effect. Also, I don't wake up in a fog or too drowsy. A few things- you are NOT supposed to take this drug until you are READY FOR BED. I can't believe all the things I've read here from people who take this regularly and do completely irresponsible things like take it and then sit up and drink wine! Hello? This drug is a HYPNOTIC. It's not like downing Nyquil and getting drowsy. It lulls your brain quickly in to a sleep/dream state so you MUST take it, not should, when your PJs are on with the glass of water at your nightstand and your head on the pillow. It works very fast- 30 min or less on an empty stomach in my case. Second, if you're taking this EVERY day and you're losing your mind, depressed, has it not occurred to you or your doctor to try something else? See a sleep disorder specialist, change drugs, and most certainly get a new doctor.  Holy mother of science, there are SO many drugs on the market that there is no excuse to suffer. Take it AS DIRECTED and if it works for you, great. This drug is not for everyone, esp. people with underlying disorders like undiagnosed  or untreated depression. Read the packaging!!

I consult my doctor with a check up every 6 mos, and he monitors my reactions. You have to be responsible with this drug.Dedicate 8 hrs for sleep after taking,and time to fully awake next morning.Reactions have occured from talking, eating, and surfing the WEB with no memory of it, have resulted only when I I  took it late at night, and very tired. I had concerns about taking it for a long period,and it takes 2-3 days to come off of it, but sleep is not peaceful and relaxing if off of it.

I fall asleep much easier now, and generally get more sleep. I have not had any appreciable side effects, nor does it seem to be interacting with my other medications (for blood pressure and migraine)
Difficulty Falling Asleep	trng2hlp,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		1/12/2011 6:22:33 PM	It has been great. It helps me get to sleep and doesn't carry over into the morning if taken properly.  Lately my neurologist had me try methyprednisolone for headaches even though I told him insomnia is my biggest concern with meds. If I didn't have the Ambien I wouldn't have been able to sleep at all.  I'm still having trouble getting extended sleep and have some lingering eye blurriness during the day. Not sure why the blurriness is happening but I was only using the Ambien 2-3 times a week before now its daily.

Other	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		1/3/2011 3:03:02 AM	Please BEWARE, people with ELDERLY loved ones. While this drug may work for a certain group of individuals, if you take it into your old age, it will turn on you. It wasn't until my Mom was put into assisted living that we discovered one of her medical problems. This drug she had taken for years without too many problems created complete psychosis when she developed mild demensia. She was not my Mom. It was awful. Her last time to take it, we had to call an ambulance and she cursed at me (something she'd never done in my life), &amp; tried to pull out her IV among other things, until about 5:00am when the hospital flushed the Ambien out of her system. She then looked at me and said &quot;honey why don't you go home-you look tired&quot;, and I realized my Mom had returned and the Ambien-induced psychosis was gone. The irony was she was taking Ambien for help sleeping and was exhausted all the time, yet she didn't remember being awake all night. And thank goodness, she never hurt herself before we could get her off of it. I don't think it's worth the risk. I would certainly advise Any elderly person I know to never take this drug. 
Difficulty Falling Asleep	jfink, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	25-34	12/31/2010 3:29:58 AM	Started taking ambien about 3 months ago, I find I can't sleep without it. Oftentimes I'll look at my phone and find text messages I don't remember writing. Some in my drafts that weren't sent luckily. I haven't driven anywhere, nor have I eaten in my sleep (I think) but I know I text in my sleep without knowing it. I can't necessarily say this is deal breaking, I haven't slept this well in years, but I find that I need to have a better schedule with it, take it at the same time every night, and go to bed shortly after, empty stomach, and only one. I know that I've taken more than one before. I have only done it once or twice though, so I'm not terribly worried about that. Any alcohol what so ever though and it makes it ten times worse. Definitely do not drink when your taking this ever, definitely notice more intense side effects if I've had anything to drink. Definitely be careful with alcohol and any other drugs your taking.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		12/23/2010 1:44:39 AM	After years of suffering form insomnia due to anxiety, PTSD and pain from many spine surgeries I was given a plethora of different drugs to try. I had a severe, adverse reaction to almost all. I was definitely worse after being a guinea pig.When I finally went through a sleep study and tested with Ambien, I finally woke up not feeling like I ran a marathon all night. I was responsive and clear becasue I finally had some solid sleep!I did wake up after 3-4 hours and was finally treated with Ambien CR. I take one at bedtime 10-15 days a month and clonopin on the other nights. It is true there is a loss of inhibition (eating outside a diet during the night) but nothing remarkable. I've seen a lot worse-drunk people! Note: Take it as described. Do no add alcohol, additional tablets or other drugs and don't drive. Not so hard, people-remember, it's sleep medication! Note: the generic forms ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE to being as effective-don't waste your nights or money on them.

Ambien worked great for me but there is one MAJOR side effect I had, I would get up and make phone calls, write emails and worst of all as crazy as it sounds I would do online shopping and not realize it until the next day after I was fully awake and I would check my bank account and I was in total shock, I thought someone stole my credit card and it happened a couple of more times until  my oldest son heard me up one night and come in the room and had a full conversation with me and witnessed me online buying stuff and I have NO RECOLLECTION OF IT ALL. So now when I have to take an ambien I have my son hide my purse and wallet before he we go to bed and car keys just in case. So to anyone who takes be very careful and be sure you have someone sleeping with you because you just may have similar side effects.

It took away my nightmares and gave me weird (awesome) dreams. I only ate food at night a couple times. But always go to bed after taking it. You'll fall straight asleep. If you stay up and wait to feel tired...well, it doesn't work that way.

This has been a godsend, as it not only puts you to sleep, it keeps you there for a full 8 hours.  I wake up refreshed except if I take too much or have to get up before 8 hours sleep. Then I'm groggy for about 10 minutes. It has the added bonus of enhancing your immune system by destroying free radicals and correcting your natural circadium rythmns. Awesome stuff!

I took my medications at different times thinking they may have something to do with it and still had no luck.  I started taking the Ambien and I was taking 5mg when I would wake up and not be able to fall back asleep, but most of the time by the time I woke up it was too late for me to take it and get up for work.  I started taking 10mg before bed if I had bad anxiety or a lot weighing on my mind that day.  I may take it 1-2 times a week.  But sometimes I'll sleep for 3-4 hours and be up for the rest of the night after taking 10 mg.  So I'm not totally impressed with it.  It has never caused me and crazy side effects like you hear about.  I take it and stay in bed for the whole night and can get up fine to my alarm.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	5	Male	19-24	11/11/2010 10:02:25 PM	I have had insomnia for years and just felt with it, My doctor finally gave me ambien and rozerem, but the rozerem was too expensive on my insurance.  I have had both issues with falling alseep, and staying asleep, for the last month on this taking 10 mg, I can fall asleep in about 30 mins, and stay asleep for 5-6 hours, if I take 5mg I can't fall asleep, and end up taking the other 5mg a couple hours later and fall asleep in about 30 mins, I have to take it on an empty stomach for it to work, overall have been very happy, The only thing is if I dont take it by 12, I can't take it, because I have to be up at 6:30am, There have been two times in the month that I have not been able to take it, and had very odd dreams, the first one was scary, that I was held up at work, and the second that my teeth shattered whenI was eating... but so far no getting up, and even if I did it would be worth it for the sleep.  Over all love this med. no weight gain, cross my fingers.

I take a pill just prior to going to bed---maybe 20-30 minutes before.  It does not seem to phase me in the least.  I don't have trouble falling to sleep. I just can't seem to get more than 4 hours out of it.  That is not much better than prior to taking it. I have not increased the dosage to more than one pill. I cannot believe that one pill will do what most have written in their reviews. Disappointed!

I've tried EVERYTHING.  This is my 2nd round w/ Ambien. (2 yrs 1st time, 3 years now).  It works better than anything else, from herbs to meds to yoga, that I've tried.  I had the &quot;sleep activities&quot; during part of the 1st time I use Ambien.  I made food, organized, surfed the web, tried to make lists...and to my husbands delight, although argumentative at first, right before falling asleep, I became suddenly &quot;easy&quot;.  I haven't experienced any of this in years (poor hubby).  I have had to increase my dose to 15mg nightly, which worries me - where am I going to be in another 10 years?  ....but this has been a great med for me so far.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male		11/5/2010 1:31:17 PM	I have taken Ambien CR 6.25 extended release for about a year, off and on. When I do take it correctly - just before wanting to go to sleep - it usually works in about one half hour and I stay asleep for at least eight hours. I am retired,  my sleeping hours are very erratic, wear a sleep apnea device, and  night-guard for my teeth. All this contributes to my difficulty in sleeping. Add to that, I am often so sleepy in daytime, I take Provigil 200 mg to stay awake. The one possible side effect for me is a feeling of nervousness during the day. Maybe it is something else, but intend to stop Ambien for a week to see if this latest condition is a result of Ambien or one of the other meds I take.

Due to a thyroid problem, I have chronic insomnia.  **TAKE AS DIRECTED**  I dont use this when I'm away from home.  I do suffer from what I call, &quot;AMBIEN AMNESIA ATTACKS&quot;, and don't recall texting, instant messaging or calling people.  When friends/family get jibberish msgs, they know I'm on Ambien.  It usually takes affect after 5-15 mins of taking the medication on an empty stomach.  No other side effects.

Tried dyphenhydramine for a while, but it left me feeling groggy. Finally asked another nurse on my floor about her sleep, she said to talk to my MD about Ambien. Did very well with a 10mg dose, put me to sleep very quickly (less than 15 minutes). Only problem is that on the maximum reccomended dose (10mg), only got me 3.5 hours. Which is more than I usually get, but still insufficient. I will give it a few more nights, days actually, then I will speak to my MD again.

Other	55-64 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/19/2010 7:30:53 PM	This is a VERY dangerous drug. I am convinced that this drug shortened my father-in-law's life.  He took it for about a year without problems--then suddenly he started hallucinating all night long.  Family members had to spend the night with him, he got so agitated, to make sure he wouldn't get out of bed and fall (he was elderly).  He would claim to see strangers in his house and would get very confused at night. He talked and yelled out all night long.  When the drug would wear off in the morning, he was fine and thinking clearly for the rest of the day.  We didn't figure out it was the Ambien causing this condition until it was too late. He insisted on taking this drug to help him sleep, and the problem kept getting worse. We finally had to admit him to the hospital--they had to sedate him there, and was knocked out for 2 days, then taken to a nursing home. He died a month later.  Since then, I have talked to several people who have felt this drug had altered their brains (or their relatives' brains).  After seeing first hand what Ambien did to my poor father-in-law, I would plead with everybody NOT to take this dangerous drug!!!
Difficulty Falling Asleep	75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		10/18/2010 2:51:27 PM	I cannot take this medicine.  It caused me to feel very nervous and shaky - when I walked, I felt like I did not have full control of my body.  Also, after taking the medicine and watching TV, I was double images on the screen.

I've been on it for about 4 years.  I do things I don't remember.  I have sex, watch movies, have whole conversations, eat food but no driving.  The other night I slit my wrist and ended up at the ER.  INSANE!!!  I'm not suicidal normally, but I guess I am on this stuff.  Scared me and my husbnd to death.  Short term use seems OK, but I'm getting of this stuff as soon as I can. I'm looking for a better solution to falling asleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	anonymous, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	10/13/2010 12:58:36 AM	Been taking Ambien (generic) for about 6 years due to lifelong insomnia problems. Started at 5-10 mg a few nights per week, then increased as insomnia wornsened. Weight gain, chronic back pain, and tons of job stress are probably factors, but no sleep vs. sleep meds seemed logical. Now, I have to take 15-20 mg to even get 3-4 hours of sleep, but found that 10 mg puts me to sleep, and another 5-10 during night does okay. This drug IS physically addicting in that your body builds up a tolerance, but Ive never had the wacky behaviors others describe (except for a buzz feeling if I dont lay down 20-30 minutes after taking). Those who find it expensive, get generic at Costco-super cheap. Ive tried almost all sleep/sedating meds, different therapies, and natural practices-only Ambien works. Sleep tests didnt show abnormalities, so consensus is its something with my neurotransmitters (brain chemicals), specifically gabba. Have taken Xanax or hydrocodone for anxiety/pain with Ambien, but hate the side effects of those combos, even though I sleep more. Hope this info helps, but everyone is different, so dont use my info in place of your doctors advice.

It help really well by puting me to sleep.  I have had serious issues with going to sleep before.  This product is great but the risks of doing stuff like sleep eating and calling people in the middle of the night and having no memory of it is getting old.  The other day i spilt powerade ever where and put all my pills and vitaims in the freezer for some reason (lol) its good but they should try and find a better product
Difficulty Falling Asleep	don't do it, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	10/5/2010 12:02:25 PM	My mom almost died using Ambien.  She went from a functioning, athletic person, to a quivering, anxiety ridden mess in about a month.  She had to be hospitalized for deyhdration among other things and was convinced she was going to die.  She has been off Ambien about 3 weeks now and is recovering VERY slowly.  I know everyone does not experience side effects THIS bad, but this is really, really bad stuff.  It's like any other addictive drug, some people can take it recreationally and live their normal life, other people take it and it ruins theirs or kills them.  You just don't know until you have tried it.  The question is...do you want to take that chance???  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	10/5/2010 9:25:05 AM	My husband has had some strange side effects. He has gotten up once before and went outside naked with a gun and woke up in the yard with it in his hand. He thought that he heard his daughter screaming when she had already went back to her mother's house and he thought that she was in duress and needed help. He has got up and cooked or fixed other stuff to eat or drink. He has got up and played computer games and surfed the net. He has on several occasions woke me up during the night to be intimate. He has also talked to people on the phone. He gets up most of the time and smokes cigarettes and talks to people having full conversations. He doesn't remember anything usually but sometimes he tells me he had weird dreams and it's what he did the night before and I have to tell him if it was real or not. Most of the time I tell him about it the next day if anything happened.

Nothing else works for me. I am worried about my dependence and have started cutting the pill in half each night. It has been difficult, because now I wake up every night after 2-3 hours of sleep. The effects have worn off and now I can't fall asleep for 2-4 more hours. My doctor says that I have insomnia and that its OK to take it. I have heard of &quot;ambien poisoning&quot;, and am quite worried.

It worked great the first year. Sleep-shopping on internet that I did not remember doing. I absolutely loved this drug but became very addicted to it also. My mind and body could not, would not sleep if I missed a dose. After year two decided I had to get off it so I switched to Trazodone which is effective and works for me without the side effects of addiction.

I cannot believe my doctor gave it to me in the first place. I could not understand why I was feeling so bad as the day went on. The first night I did not take it all the withdrawal symptoms vanished. It must have something in it that blocks methadone. I have to have the pain med as I have chronic pain from a car accident. I take melatonin and ty pm to sleep now.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	sleeping great, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/7/2010 8:04:58 PM	Love Ambien and think it works great for those who need it. I have never been able to sleep a full night. I woke almost every 2 hours and it would take me 30min to an hr to get back to sleep and when I did sleep I had the strangest dreams. My doctor started me on Ambien about a yr ago and now I sleep all night with no dreaming. If you take this drug as perscribed (1 pill a night guys) It is a godsend! You will get the best sleep of your life. I have had none of the strange reactions people talk about like the sleep driving, talking, or eating. Nor am I addicted. I do not take Ambien on weekends or anyother night where there is no work in the morning.

It did help me sleep, side effects for me were a bit of memory loss, feelings of being high.  After taking it for months, I decided to get off of some other drugs I was on, now I feel that ambien is causing some severe disorientation that is a terrible feeling.  The VA doctors should not be playing god with stuff they don't know about.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Pit Bull Rescuer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	8/24/2010 1:21:49 AM	I have taken Ambien 10mg (never tried the 12.5) off and on for many years.  As sleeping aids go, I think that this is the best drug there is.  True, I have experienced many &quot;sleep activities&quot; which I have little or no memory of -- especially after having been on it for a longer period of time.  I felt that it &quot;wasn't kicking in well;&quot; and continued to putter around the house instead of going straight to bed, as directed.  I do not think that anyone would have these episodes if we all followed the directions to the letter as far as taking the medicine on an empty stomach; and going straight to bed with plans to go straight to sleep.  The medicine does not make me feel &quot;high&quot; at all.  I really cannot tell that I have taken it, as far as feelings go.  However, I obviously know it worked since I was asleep through at least 4 hours each night.  I disagree that one will have all these &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot; if one abruptly stops the drug.  I have taken it for literally a whole year -- then stopped it suddenly.  The worst that happened was that a couple nights were fairly long and miserable due to lack of sleep.  There was no nausea, vomiting, shakiness, etc. as the warnings say.  This is not a benzodiazapine drug with dangers of seizures, etc. with abrupt withdrawal.  In fact, my OB-GYN says that she prescribes it to most of her pregnant patients to help them sleep!  I think that too much &quot;hype&quot; has been attributed to a fairly mild, but effective drug.  I highly recommend it. I have tried many others; as I have literally SUFFERED from lack of quality sleep over the years.  Nothing has really worked as well as Ambien for me.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	mercycakes, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/23/2010 12:42:48 AM	I've been taking Ambien 5mg for about 2months. So far, falling asleep has been pretty easy (taking about 30 minutes to begin feeling drowsy). I try to take around the same time so I can get 8 hourse of sleep, but I sometimes wake up dizzy and a little confused. One morning I woke up and couldn't remember the day it was and where and how I got into my bed. The longer I have used the medication though the confusion has gotten a lot better. These little side effects though are better than how I felt after several days without sleep. I can actually function.

I only take it when I know I can get 7 to 8hrs. of sleep...maybe once or twice a week. Well, last weekend I took it and found out I had sex with my husband...and i dont remember any of it. He told me things I said and did..How Scary!! Can anyone say &quot;date rape drug?&quot; I have thrown them away and will never allow a drug to control my body again.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	realcara, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	8/18/2010 6:50:24 PM	Be very careful of the side effects. They get progressively worse the longer you take it. I started out with conversations and progressed to cooking in my sleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/18/2010 1:38:09 AM	Been taking Ambien since my early 20's. Initially, gives you a feeling of being high, and once you put your head to the pillow, you fall right to sleep. Also has you do things you wouldn't normally do if you weren't on it...I would call people and talk total nonsense and not remember the conversation... slurred speech, desire to clean &amp; organize things, dye my hair, try AND do stupid things I wouldn't normally do if I weren't on it...one day I decided to reorganize my whole bedroom in the middle of the night, even carrying the t.v. from one side of the room to the other, I coulda broke my back! Went to sleep with white socks on, woke up in the morning with black socks-didn't remember waking up and changing them. I also developed a tendency to binge eat AFTER taking it. It also causes short-term memory loss.  My mother, who was taking it at one point, walked up the block to my house, fixed the air conditioner, walked around the entire neighborhood, went back home...and remembered none of this the next day! I thought she knew exactly WHAT she was doing that night as she seemed fully awake and aware while she was at my house, but turns out she was blacked out during the entire time. She had taken 20mg of Ambien, and afterward went outside and did these things without even knowing.  Her husband accompanied her because she INSISTED on going out and rather than have her go out alone, he went with her cause she was leaving regardless.  My advice to those who have problems sleeping, try natural alternatives, if not, use Ambien short-term with physician supervision. Make sure everything at home is locked, off, and you're in bed when you take it. I'm about to take and Ambien shortly to go to sleep...but after taking it for so long it doesn't work as well.  Going to ask the doctor to try something else. Good luck to new users!

There are better and SAFER drugs. Ambien makes you sleep walk and do things that are stupid. And if you have kids I truly don't recommend this.

To wean yourself from it is very simple. Wait till a weekend when you can sleep in the next day. Take a different, over the counter sleep aid like Tylenol PM. Take only half of one or you will be sleeping for two days.  And then get to bed. Don't sit around and watch TV until 2 a.m. You will not sleep as well, but you will sleep.  Keep sudden noises and light out of your room.  The next night, do the same. The last night (Sunday night), take nothing, or take just a plain Tylenol. You should now be weaned from Ambien.  If it doesn't work and you don't sleep enough on Sunday night, try it again the next weekend, and this time take the Tylenol PM two hours earlier each night than you did before and take two Tylenols on Sunday night and one on Monday night.I have kicked the Ambien habit at least twice, back in the day when my doctor wouldn't let me take it long-term, even though I was falling asleep at the wheel due to lack of sleep. My doctor now gives me 90 pills.  I ask for 10 mg and then snap them in half. 5 mg works just fine for me.  You don't build up a tolerance.  If it's not working for you, it's because you don't get into bed right after you take it. Don't fall asleep on the couch after taking Ambien, because when you finally get into bed, the sleepiness and cozy edge will have worn off and you will end up waiting a little longer to sleep.

I would take it in the evening and within 15-30 minutes I was out cold. I would sleep for 18+ hrs and still be tired. I would eat in my sleep and go through $100 of food in one sitting and not remember a thing. I would be asleep while standing up and had to have friends hold me up and walk me to my bed. My friends would put copenhagen in my mouth to try to wake me up but I would just swallow it all and wouldnt move. I was taken off it for awhile and was put on other stuff but it didnt work at all. I was put back on ambien and it didnt work at all. To this day I still have severe insomnia and sleep issues but nothing works. I still dont remember most of the time I was on ambien.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	7/24/2010 12:52:52 AM	Serious withdrawal is unlikely with this drug, but if you are one of the lucky ones it does strike please know that it generally last months, and tends to be worse then the withdrawal from heroin or cocaine. Symptoms can include seizures, depression, anxiety attacks, psychosis, nausea, and more. Also, please know that even if you only take the medicine as directed and as proscribed by your doctor you are still running a risk of withdrawal. Just because you don't feel addicted does not mean you are not physically dependent on it. I always thought I was safe because I didn't crave the drug, didn't want to take more then I was proscribed, didn't doctor shop, and didn't drink with it. I wasn't addicted, but my body was dependent. I have lost months of my life to this drug, so please be careful with it. 
Difficulty Falling Asleep	Johnboy, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	65-74	7/19/2010 7:09:45 PM	I started out with a choice of 5 or 10mg. The 10mg left me with a little hangover so dropped to 5mg. The 5mg takes me down very rapidly so I;ve dropped now to 2.5mg and that seems to be the right amount. My only concern is my dreams are intense, active, and very detailed. I find that I while I can quickly go to sleep and stay asleep for up to 6 hours the sleep is not restful
Difficulty Falling Asleep	seattlegradschoolbabe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/19/2010 4:06:30 AM	It's simple: If you have an addictive personality, don't take this drug. However, if you're a normal person with reasonable self-control and a healthy respect for the potential dangers of prescription drugs, and are able to adhere to label instructions, it's highly likely you'll be fine. I'm a grad student that occasionally has trouble sleeping, often because I had caffeine too late in the day. Ambien puts me right to sleep and I sleep till morning. I only take it on nights where I lie in bed awake for an hour or so and still can't fall asleep. If you practice self-control and only take it when you NEED it, it's very unlikely you'll become addicted. I was first prescribed it in July of 2008 and have gone through maybe 60 pills since then. Breaking them in half and only taking 5 mg usually works for me. Have never done anything crazy like eat, drive, or have conversations while asleep, but then I always take it while already in bed, like the directions say!! It works for me, and doesn't make me groggy at all the next day like Phenegran or even Tylenol PM does. If you are unable to follow instructions for potentially dangerous drugs, then don't take this drug or any other potentially dangerous drugs. If you're a responsible adult that can control him or herself then you should be fine. And TELL your doctor if you get addicted, for crying out loud!!! They can't help you if they don't know what's going on.

I get panic attacks if I am out of supply and quite literally FEAR I will not be able to sleep without it. Maybe it does the job a little too well...
Other	American, 13-18 Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	13-18	7/15/2010 1:12:07 AM	I am giving a warning to anyone thinking of taking more ambien pills than directed DONT I made this mistake and the consequences were DISTURBING and can only be described as severe sleeping walking, extremely intense feeling of well being, drunken episode, and blackout mixed together. All I remember of last night was that me and my father were cooking fish we caught and I began to blurt weird things out uncontrollably and I had no idea what I was talking about. I said things like we should open a restaurant for cooking Jamaican food and I also told my father of a strange nightmare I had. Even though it was a real dream I talked about it out of nowhere. I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROLL OF MY BODY OR MOUTH. It was as if my body was possessed and I was watching myself say and do these things and unable to do anything about it. I was somewhat concious of my brother in the kitchen but didn't realize he was shocked out of his mind. Today he told me I kept falling down and I acted looney (coming from a 12 year old by the way) I had no memory of most of what happened and this scared the hell out of me. To anyone wanting to take the tablet form of Ambien Cr I humbley advise you to be careful. If the circumstances were different, I could've been easily injured.

You are take ambien before you go to sleep (no stay up or do anything else) Ive been taking this medicine for about 5 months and it works great as long as you take it properly and follow directiopns. I have obtained the best sleep and wake up feeling great. I stopped taking the meds about 2 weeks ago to see if my sleeping patterns had changed and did not have any withdrawl sysptoms at all.

You can't just take it all the time &amp; yes I do have a lot of times I do not remember I have had conversations &amp; don't remember them please make sure you take this when you get into bed do something harmless like watch tv don't read because you might not remember!

To everyone who says that it causes problems/addictions: It's because you are taking TOO much on purpose, or because you try to stay active under it's effects and take more without realize it. If you take 1 tablet (while in bed, lights and TV off), you will either sleep fine, or it won't work, BUT you won't have to worry about all those negative side-effects that all these other people are complaining about. Misuse = problems.

After trying several drugs over a period of four terrible months, my doctor gave me Ambien at10 mg. I almost immediately cut it to 5 mg just at bedtime and sleep normally with no side effects of any sort. It saved my life. I've experienced none of the bad effects people have described. I've been on it only a month, and I hope it continues to work.

I should have read the user reviews b-4 I took 1 &amp; 1/2 dose. I took it earlier because I had to get up earlier the next day but it didn't seem to work so I took 1/2 more. Well it wasn't out of my system the next morning, as a result, I said and did things I would not have in my right mind and then had a hard time remembering most of that following day. Apparently, I said something bad enough at the ticket counter at the airport that they thought it was necessary to call a police officer; thankfully, there were no lasting consequences. I recall saying to the officer thank you for the gentle reprimand. That is something I would say if I were drunk. Im certain the officer knew I was on some kind of drugs.

Two years earlier he was prescribed Ambien for sleep problems and became dependent on Ambien. We tried telling him that since he was older he didn't require 10-12 hrs of sleep. Yet when he would wake up he wanted more Ambien to sleep another 10-12 hrs. He grew very depressed, anxious and anorexic and grew very angry when we would prolong giving him the Ambien. The last year of his life Ambien wasn't working anymore, with 20 mg. he was up all night reaching for things that weren't there, eating and chattering about things that didn't make sense. Although we reported it to his md, he said it would do my father more harm than good to take him off the Ambien. It was my mother and sometimes myself that were not getting a good night's sleep because we had to keep watch over him. He experienced 2 falls and ended up at the ER because of Ambien.

This is NOT my first bad experience with Ambien, I have driven, had sex, spent alot of money... so all I have to say is &quot;thanks ambien for screwing my life up&quot;
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/7/2010 9:54:22 PM	I started taking Ambien regularly when I was taking two or three different anti-depressant and my chronic insomnia became unmanageable without a sleep aid.  I now regularly take 5mg 5 or 6 times a week--usually at around 2am to fall back asleep.  The drug has had very few noticeable side-effects.  My doctor says that at 47 I'm too young to be on the stuff, but I'm pretty much hooked now.

It gave me hiccups every time I took it, and sometimes wouldn't make me go to sleep but just feel a strange high. It made me have bizarre thoughts and only helped me sleep for a matter of 2-5 hours. Melatonin works much better and doesn't make me have auditory hallucinations or have bizarre thoughts. 
Difficulty Falling Asleep	StaryNight, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/4/2010 9:42:35 PM	have had no side effects, but you can increase your chance of it working, and cutting down your dosing (saving money by using less - but small print: talk to your doc): 1) it has a VERY short half life so you wake up clear headed and no groggy 'hang over' so be READY for it, for me that window is almost exactly 20 min. and lasts about 10 min. After that the effectiveness of the drug falls off makeing it less effective, so if I'm watching TV, I take it about 10 minutes before I stop, and then turn on Radio BBC so I'm settled in bed for 10 minutes and relaxing before I know Ambian will peak in my blood.  2) You can use an herbal drug, Melatonin.  Take the Melatonin about 30 minutes before you take the Ambian. This will allow you to use less because your body is more receptive to accepting the Ambian. You can check this by using PubMed, a search engine for National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine.3) If you drink it with just a small glass of grapefruit juice, the Grapefruit juice seems to boost the potency of many of these kinds of drugs.  To help protect your teeth from what is called 'juice teeth' -- tooth decay caused by the acidity in citrus juices and the bacteria which eat the sugar found in all fruit juices, and produce various acids which attack many parts of your teeth, especially the enamel that protects your teeth.So, 1) take some Melatonin about 30 min. before the Ambian. This makes your body more receptive to Ambian. (2 MS's in Bio. Sciences makes me know this is not 'hippie medicine, that it has research showing it's true).2) make sure you have lights off, head on pillow 10 min. before the Ambian is going to be in high enough blood concentration to work, and 3) drink a small glass of Grapefruit juice, as this will increase it's ability to work. Rinse your mouth with baking soda (Bi carb of soda [not powder], Arm and Hammer is a brand name) 1 tsp in 1 cup water, and spit it out, this protects your teeth from acid and bacteria.

Don't thinks I'll ever take it again. When I took it just before bedtime, it generally took me about 45mins. before sleep. In those  45 minutes I completely did things that I do not remember. Got up one night and got on the computer and sent e.mails that I don't remember. Talked on telephone and  don't remember..

This only thing you have to be careful with is make sure you take it early enough (but not too early or you get that drunk feeling before you go to bed) and if you dont have 8 hours to rest, dont take it.

While it worked very well for me for quite some time, the last time I took it, I woke up the next day in the hospital. I had taken it the previous night, fallen to sleep, I had gotten up, got into my car, driven off, and rear-ended a car stopped at a stop light, all the time completely unconscious and unaware. I hit my head on the windshield (yes, I had my seat belt on)and completely shattered it and even that didn't wake me up. I was taken to the hospital by ambulance and kept there for 5 days because I was disoriented from a concussion. All this and I had only taken one pill, as prescribed. I also had a traffic ticket mailed to me for careless driving. I had spoken to the police, and had given incorrect information in the emergency room, and spoken with nurses and doctors without waking up until the next afternoon. Please take this as a warning- this whole episode happened without my having had any problems prior to that night. I believe this could have happened to anyone and probably has. So BEWARE!

You have to fall asleep like a mummy and not move side-top-side all night for a good 2 months (hip) and 3 for knees. Right after surgery I took a 5 mg generic - crap. Then I told my Dr. &quot;I want the highest legally allowable dose and make it time release.&quot;  That would be the 12.5 mg Ambien CR - horribly expensive, even at Costco, but one of these + a 3&quot; memory foam mattress topper - Sa-weeeet! I've recovered from 3 joint replacements in record time thanks largely to being able to get my rest. Don't tell anybody, but I wash it down with exactly 1/2 of a Bud Lime light - the solid rocket fuel that gets you into orbit.  Love it.

The only problem is that I've been getting a migraines the next day usually developing in the afternoon and not going away.  I've only been taking the Ambien for 3 days so I'm going to give it a rest to see if the migraines go away.

Was getting very anxious and asked my Doctor for help.  He prescribed Ambien.  OH WHAT A RELIEF IT HAS BEEN.  Never realized how sleep deprived I was although I hardly ever slept a full night.  Have been on it every since, 2 years and it helps me sleep through the night even though I am in pain most of the time, slipped disc, need new knee, arthritis, regular stuff.  It's been a life expanding drug, am fully over 4 surgeries in 5 years, can now garden for about 4 hrs, due my ceramics, make cards as well as the drudge stuff.  I love it.  I suffer no ill effects.  Only thing, I can never tell how long it will take to work, sometimes, about 15 mins, other times 1-1/2 hrs.

The Ambien is wonderful. It works quickly, I wake up about once a night, I have no problems falling back asleep, and best of all, I don't feel tired the next day!

I got 6 solid hours of sleep without feeling tired or groggy. Then I started getting eye pains. At first I thought I needed a new glasses prescription. It got so bad that I would come home from work and just lay on the sofa hoping the burning pain would go away. Tylenol, Advil, and Alleve did not help. I went to my optomotrist for evaluation but he found nothing wrong with my eyes. No dryness, no high intraocular pressure. My vision prescription only changed slightly in 5 years. All this time I am taking Ambien but now the eye pain is not going away at night. My nephew who is working on his masters in sleep disorders was visiting and I was telling him how great Ambien worked and mentioned my eye pain. He said Ambien was not supposed to be prescribed for long term use and suggested I stop taking it for a while. Bottom line is I stopped taking the Ambien and within a week the eye pain went away.

I have used different medications for sleep.  After a while they loose effectiveness.  I wish that Ambien came in a higher dosage, so sleep would come fast every night, instead of some nights.

Then I had gastric bypass surgery and started to experience sleeplessness that I attributed to stress on the job.  After a doctor's visit I started taking Ambien CR which was very expensive, even with my insurance, so I tried to take the non-extended release because it is a cheaper generic and could only sleep about 4 hours and then I was fully awake.  After taking Ambien CR for more than a year and initially experiencing no side effects I have routinely been eating afterwards and get out of bed to find food and have no memories of it the next day except for the missing food, wrappers in the trash, and crumbs in the bed the next morning.  I tried to stop taking the drug after running out of it and could not sleep even through other methods - alcohol, pain medicine, and muscle relaxers.  Although I wish that my doctor had only prescribed the drug for the short term, I feel that I may be dependent on it.  After experiencing weight gain, some insomnia, and worsening episodes of nightime eating I am going to try and &quot;kick the habbit&quot; with all of the knowledge of how to make yourself sleep, excersize after dinner, only go to bed to sleep, no TV watching in bed, and make a cool and dark bedroom conducive to sleeping.  After trying this I will repost to this site.  Wish me luck.

My husband was very sick for most of that time and did not sleep much having to get up and do things for him. After he passed away in July of 2007 I had trouble going to sleep and staying asleep. My dr. gave this to me after a few months and it does help me go to sleep in the afternoon. I do not think I would need this if I slept at night but since I work I do use it. I have not had any side effects from it and I do live alone.

Luckily no one was hurt, but I was arrested for driving under the influence of a substance.  This has been commonly occurring in the press as well, ie Senator Patrick Kennedy and Tiger Woods.  While this was a fairly effective drug to help me fall asleep, the risk of this dangerous side effect is not worth it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	RK Frederick, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	3/17/2010 1:39:23 PM	I had severe insomnia for 3 years. felt like I was on the verge of a total breakdown. Tried all otc medications and some drugs prescribed by my Dr. Nothing worked until I was finally able to get Ambien. I feel like this drug saved my sanity. It works maybe 85% of the time for me and I've never had the bad side effects others seem to have. One thing I'm beginning to notice is my hair is falling out. I seem to remember reading about others having this happen to them also while taking Ambien. Just hope I don't have to choose between sleeping and having hair. Anyone else notice this? It didn't happen until a year into taking it so I'm thinking maybe it could just be caused by other stresses I'm dealing with now. I don't want to stop taking it and go back to no sleep. It's really been a miracle that I finally found something that helped me.

And very strange dreams. The best thing to do is to go right to bed after taking it, otherwise you will do things and forget you did them. I have tried Restoril, Sonata and Lunesta and this is the best. Lunesta is also very good - probably a far superior pill but also much more expensive as there is no generic for it. I can fill Ambien generic for $6 whereas Lunesta (brand only) is $60.

The 1st two nights it worked great. After that, I was unable to sleep. I continued to take the drug and I began to have side effects, which became more severe. After 12 days I was experiencing sever shortness of breath, and fatigue. I stopped taking it and expierenced severe withdrawl symptoms.

I was on the generic ambien. Worked for a short while, then I started having issues not sleeping very long, or if I failed to take it then I was totally unable to sleep. Like a caffeine high. My doc switched to the ambien-CR. The CR type is a lot more costly cause no generic for the CR. BUT... the ambien-CR is A LOT more effective, gentle, and not addictive. You can go on - off it and not get messed up. I can get to sleep without it. But I only take ambien when I MUST get good sleep. The CR type is much more user-friendly. And you will not wake after 2 or 3 hours, tossing and turning like I did on the non-CR type.I work nights and sleep days, so that is why I need it, to get good sleep on my screwed up schedule. Ambien-CR works! The non-CR type DID NOT. There is a difference, a big difference, between the two types.

I have fiibromygia and was first perscribed Ambien in 1999 and have took it ever since. it dosen't work as good as it use to. I believe that my Dr. is going to stop giving me ambien in the near future. I am worried about what I will do with not sleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	snowkitty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	3/9/2010 10:39:48 AM	This is the second time in my life i've been prescribed ambien. The 1st time i was in high school and couldn't sleep, i would go days and only sleep an hour or two. I started out on 10mg and it worked wonders. I took it everynight about 20 mins before i was ready to go to bed. I would actually get a full 7-8 hrs of restfull sleep. Never had any problems w/most side effects, even when i came off the drug when i found out i was pregnate. However the 1st time i was on it i was young and unmarried. My daughter is five now and i have been put back on Ambien several months ago. I've always had trouble sleeping and have always been a very light sleeper, so light that my husband (someone i'm comfortable with) can walk into the room, silent as can be, and his just the &quot;feel&quot; of him being in the room wakes me. I'm not on 5mg as needed. I find that i have to take it during the work week or else it will be 1-2 am when i finally fall asleep. Which does not work well for me as i go to bed by 9:30 and am up by 5:20 &amp; i still wake up several times. The 5mg works well in putting me to sleep but since being on it for a few mths i find that i still wake up at least once through the night. When i go to see my Dr i will talk about taking the 10mg dose as it worked very well for me for years. My husband says that while on it i talk in my sleep and i will answer anything he asks me. Its a good thing i have nothing to hide b/c i would never have known about this if he hadn't have told me. I have had no other side effect tho, defenitly no sleep walking, eating or driving. I know many people who it doesn't work for and who have had hallucinations but it works wonders for me. It's definetly something worth trying but should be watched closely in the beginning. Oh &amp; my 5 yr old daughter has no trouble what so ever waking me up at anytime of the night while on the drug. I generally don't take it on the weekend having no work schedule to adhere to &amp; have no problems not taking it regularly.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	J, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	3/9/2010 6:41:59 AM	Perhaps a bit pessimistic, yet my review stands because I had a severe reaction. 10mg and 38hrs as I write this, I am still having residual symptoms.  I can't concentrate.  My eyes are unfocused.  Memory loss and incoherence.  Blackouts. I fell into the bath tub, not out of it. No water in the tub.  Sleep deprivation. Rapid pulse, racing feeling.  Eating and talking rapidly. Feeling like I am losing my mind.  I feel the urge to scream.  Anger.  Nervousness.  That's just to name the surface.  I called my Doctor and she took me off it.  I was on Trazadone.  I have a chronic nervoous condition as I am a disabled veteran. Plus I have sleep apnea.  I am glad this med works for those who can take it.  For me, it was like a very bad LSD trip.  I will never take it again, not even in a reduced amount. 
Other	DWitty, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	55-64	3/8/2010 8:15:38 PM	I have been taking the generic version (Zolpidem Tartrate) of Ambien (10mg) since mid Feb.  I works as advertised since I suffered from a condition called &quot;advanced sleep syndorone&quot;, where my body's timeclock was off kilter.  I'd get sleepy around 6:30PM, and awaken around 2AM every night.  End up sluggish with diminished focus beginning around noon.  Ambien worked by putting my sleep routin back into a natural rhythm.  Side Effects: extreme itching and rashes, causing me to come off of it for certain periods. No weird dreams/nightmares, and not odd behavior whil on it

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	lally, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/7/2010 3:18:38 PM	My daughter was prescribed this med for a chronic sleep problem she's had since she was a kid. The police called our house one morning looking for my daughter, saying she had been involved in a hit and run accident the previous night. We tried to call her but there was no answer at her apartment.  After a frantic drive to find out what happened, we arrived at her place to find her car parked outside wrecked with 2 flat tires.  We finally were able to awaken her and when she saw the car, she was shocked---she had no recollection of anything the previous night.  Luckily no bodily harm, but we did need to find an attorney to help us deal with the charges.  What a nightmare!  Please do not take this drug unless you absolutely cannot find any other sleep remedy and have a person who can babysit you the entire time!!!

I could not fall alseep and stay a sleep. I take it when I am laying in the bed ready for sleep. I am not up trying to do other things before sleeping. It has been a wonderful help to me. Just like with any medication everyone reacts differently. Get with your doctor and see what works for you.

It makes me very irritable as well. Some mornings after I take Ambien,  I wake up feeling refreshed,and then other times my body feels very heavy and tired. I like the drug, but I use it only when I absolutely cannot get to sleep and need the rest.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	3/1/2010 1:05:49 PM	I had been taking 5 mg. (1/2) Ambien for about 1 1/2 years, 2-3 times a week without difficulty.  Three months I had a cocktail about 5pm and took the 1/2 Ambien at 9pm.  I slept well, arose at 5:15am, took a shower, had a conversation with my husband and left the house for an appointment at 6am.  I remember driving about 1/2 mile away from home, on a neighborhood street and the next thing I remember is sitting in my car with the air bag deployed and people around me, including a fire truck and ambulance.  I had run into 2 parked cars.  I have no memory of this.  I was taken to the hospital by ambulance where I was checked, including low blood sugar, stroke, heart attack, etc.  All tests were negative.  Subsequently I saw a neurologist and had an MRI and EEG to rule out seizure disorder, which they did.  Even though it was 9 hours after taking the Ambien, the doctors could not attribute my accident to anything else.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/28/2010 5:05:52 AM	Ohkay I love and hate ambien.With this drug I fall asleep within an hour and a half of taking it and stay asleep.It is honestly the most effective sleeping pill I've ever taken. Now the drawbacks- like many others I have a &quot;blackout&quot; period. For about thirty minutes before actually falling asleep I do random things that I have no memory of doing. Ive had sex with my boyfriend, eaten things , danced, had nonsensical conversations ( talking about why there are so many monkeys on the tables here at the zoo) and went on odd shopping sprees. The first 5 or 6 times I took it I had interesting hallucinations. I didnt necessarily see things that werent there . I did however see objects doing things ie a windex bottle dancing and the walls were melting. I switched to elavil because I didnt feel comfortable doing all these crazy things with my poor roomates as my audience.

It usually takes almost 2 hours before it starts working, but does a good job after that.

Aside from that one experience, being able to fall asleep within a half hour of taking the medication was worth it all.

Initially, I took a 10MM tab sublingually at bedtime and I fell asleep in minutes. For a few weeks all went well and then I discovered that I was sleep walking and having &quot;nonsenes&quot; conversations with my wife that I couldn't remember.  Then I developed one of the nasty side effects of Ambien.  My arms and legs began to itch uncontrolably and then they broke out in blisters and sores, resemblng eczema, that did not repond to any medications.  Finally, a V.A. Doctor suggested that I stop using Ambien.  When I stopped the problems disappeared. Cause and effect can't be denied.

She lasted a few weeks, so I went from a happily married man in a high stress, highly demanding job to a widower with nothing to do. So, perhaps I am not the norm.  But insomnia was my first problem and a serious one. Tossing and turning until sunrise. Horrible. Doctor allows me one glass of red wine for high blood pressure. [I confess to using a rather large glass] I take the ambien with extreme caution, as I sit on the bed. Some times it works, and some times not. I will toss and turn for hours, even with the pill. But when it works, it's for almost exactly four hours. I wake up, look at the clock--yep, four hours, then finally doze off. At 70, I really don't fear addiction--I don't care. But I just wish they would work, and work all night. I know that losing my wife of 40 years is a major part of my problem, but there is nothing I can do about that. Grief counseling is comforting, but no real help.

I don't have as much pain during the night or even into the next day.

I only have trouble falling asleep, not staying asleep. It basically hypnotizes you and knocks you out. I get drowsy and start hallucinating, that's when I know it's working. However, it does lose its effectiveness when I take it longer than a few days in a row, so I only use it when I really need to.

I find it VERY scary. Last night was the worse, while he's had sleep eating episodes before this time he had made some food in a bowl I found him basically sleeping in it but the worse part was that he had turned the GAS stove on, for a food that didn't require a stove. There was a dishcloth a few inches away from the full flame and he stood next to it &quot;eating&quot; but not even looking at it. When I asked him about it he didn't even know what I was talking about. I turned it off, then he tried to put the bowl of food on the stove and turn on the burner again but then he just left the gas leaking!!  Best case sinaro if I hadn't of been there was he burnt his hands, worst case he could of burnt down the house with me and my children in it! VERY DANGEROUS. I video tapped him so he can see. Hes been on this drug for about 1 1/2 years and I HAVE to find a way to get him to stop. I'm the one whos not getting sleep out of fear.

Dr has to alternate me between that &amp; Lunesta. I have a very HIGH tolerence to medications. I'v taken as many as 4 2 &amp; 2 more after waking up middle of night. I don't walk in sleep or have any of those memory problems....maybe I do &amp; forgot. However I didn't know they where addictive till reading what other's wrote. Sometime I will take a shot of Nyquil w/ my 1st dose &amp; that usually does the trick. Don't know the dangers though. I'm also on antideppessants &amp; maybe people could be blaming the wrong drug for the forgetfullness. I switched to Pristiq...loving it &amp; found my memory is much better &amp; mood also.

Huh? Watch out and take these posts seriously. You can get hooked, you will do weird things and you will wonder how you can live without it.

Works only a few hours for me then I'm up in the middle of the night. I should'nt take anymore the same night but I do take 1 more if I happen to wake after 3 or 4 hours.What I like about them is they give a calm feeling in your body, unlike any other sleep med I have taken. Ambien is the only sleep med that I will take. If I happen to be out of them, I won't take anything else, I'll wait for my refill. I'd grade ambien a B- for sleep, and an A for euphoria

I just have so much trouble drifting off, ever since menopause,  it seems. It would get worse when I KNEW I would work in the morning- the sleep troubles! Half a tab helps me just SLEEP. And I wake up without that unrested feeling! I LOVE IT. I have NO side effects others say they have. It's a godsend.

I suffer from insomnia. It was to the point where my husband and I slept in different room due to his breathing keeping me awake. My Dr. perscribed me Ambien. It was great at first. Now it takes me 35-40mg for it to work. I have tried to stop taking it, but then I go 3-4 days w/out sleep. I have memory loss, I wake up to find the mess I have left from making food that I don't remember taking, I clean my home, I have backed my truck into our fence, and I have even taken baths. I have a large, deep jacuzzi tub. My husband came in to find me asleep in the tub and had to drag me out. Scary! I know it only hepls me sleep for about 2 hours, then I get up and take more. I have become so acustome to it that it's not till the next day that I relize how much I actully take. I have tried several other meds with no success. It stinks that now I have my husband hide it after I take my nightly dose so I don't take more when I &quot;wake up&quot; two hours after I fall asleep. It makes you do really dangerous things and I am greatful my husband knows to keep an eye on me. If you can find something else that works, use it. I wouldn't recomend ambien for more then 2 weeks. I wish I could get off of it (IT'S ADDICTING) or find something that worked as well or better.

Sleeping is nearly impossible without using extremely large doses of Ambien, and this creates additional emotional, physical and psychological problems.
Difficulty Falling Asleep	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	1/7/2010 10:18:12 AM	Ambien does help me fall alseep at night.  However, I have to take a full pill to stay asleep and that does not always work either.  Taking a full pill makes it very difficult to wake up - I want to sleep 10-12 hours.  Also, has anyone else experienced loss of appetite? I have lost 15lbs in the 6-weeks that I have been taking Ambien but that may also be due to the stressors that were keeping me from sleeping....

As time went on, I became more dependent on using it.  I also had many occurances of sleepwalking.  In my last episode of sleepwalking, I pulled the drawer completely out of the dresser and spilled its contents on my foot, including our handgun.  I'll never touch this stuff again!!!

My doctor upped my dosage to 20 mg.  My memory disappeared.  I have three college degrees and teach at the university.  Now I get lost half way through a lecture.  I cannot sleep without Ambien, I have tried,  S I am addicted to a drug that is stealing my memory and my personality.  Stay away from this stuff.

I only take half of my 10mg pill, which is plenty for me. Within 15 minutes I am asleep, and have had no crazy side effects. I don't take it every night, b/c I do not want to get addicted to any drug. I love being well rested, and not addicted.

My doctor prescribed Zolpidem.  It has worked well for me, but I have experienced frightening, bizarre dreams when I DON'T take it.  Also, I would wake up about every two hours if I didn't take it.  I've been taking the medication for a couple of months now.  I was only taking it a couple nights a week in the beginning but started taking 5mg dose nightly to avoid the nightmares and sleep interruption.  The work stress and anxiety has diminished, so I decided to stop taking the medication. Last night I woke up every two hours and experienced the same type nightmares.

I did find an empty ice cream box in the trash one day and thought my husband ate it. But, alas, it was I. I still don't remember it.

I have launched into tyrrades against my fiance that I don't even remember and it has scared me and him, he says he knows that it is not the real me that its the drug.I just try to be careful with it and I have started taking some supplements from the health food store such as 5HTP and Melatonin and I have supplements for Progesterone that is by prescrition (Bio-Identical Hormone Replacement therapy).I wish I had never taken Ambien, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go into some kind of treatment program to get off of it. I don't even know of one, any suggestions?

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	12/17/2009 11:53:49 PM	I have been using Ambien since 1999, after my Dr put mu on an antidepressant (Prozac)  and was going on 4-5 days at a time without sleep.  After a few weeks on Ambien my Dr wanted to ween me off to see if my insomnia improved and it didn't we tried various other antidepressants at various doses, I went on a sleep study, went to a psychologist,etc with no help.  So I have been diagnosed with chronic insomnia.  I have been on the 10 mg dose but at times it does not work like if I am under stress.  (I am in nursing school and I have more problems right before major exams etc.) So My Dr and I  have decided to up my dose, I take 1 -1.5 tablets normally which still works and 2 tablets max.  I like the fact that this drug has a very short half life 2 -2.5 hrs.  This meas after 2 hrs half of the drug has been excreted and at 4 hrs 75% is out of the system etc.  Which means even if I was up studying till 2 or 3 in the morning and have a 8 AM class I can still take the medicine and wake up pretty refreshed. I have not experienced the sleep walking or any other of the side effects even after 10 yrs.  As I will be a RN in 5 months I feel this is a pretty safe and effective drug. Yes there is the risk of physical dependency, but not addiction, and yes there is a difference.  I have had times before this drug had a generic form and was $120.00 a month that I could not afford to get it and things like Benadryl did nothing.  I never had the urge to &quot;get a fix&quot; or steal or what ever just to get my Ambien,  I did without sleep until I could afford it which was miserable at times.   As with all medications work with your Dr, and take it the way they say is safe and if you have bad side effects or allergic reactions stop and get help.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Lee, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	12/16/2009 7:05:36 PM	I started having trouble sleeping when my parents (who live 500 miles away) health started to fail.  I took OTC doxylamine at low doses (12.5 mg/night) for a while. But it made me loggy and also caused bladder problems (It felt like I'd go in to urinate on tuesday afternoon and not come out until thursday morning..)  So, I wanted to find an alternative. About the same time, I was diagnosed with early prostate cancer and was scheduled for surgery. Now, I REALLY had trouble sleeping. So, my GP gave me generic Zolpidem 10mg (Ambien).  I took it pretty regularly through my surgery (which was successful) and after about 7 months of regular use, I was ready to stop and go back to the occasional antihistamine for sleep  (doxylamine).  But you don't just quit Zolpidem like flipping a light switch. At least I couldn't.  I got major insomnia as well as chest crushing anxiety and shortness of breath. So, I'm in the process of tapering now with the help of Remeron which causes quite a bit of somulence.I'm down to a half a zolpidem (5mg)every 3rd night and plan to be off it completely in another 3-4 weeks.  So...  for me the bottom line on this stuff is that it is a great SHORT TERM insomnia remedy.  It knocks you out clean for 7-8 hours and you wake up chipper (at least I did). But it is a short half-life drug and it acts on the same receptors as the benzos like valium and xanax. If you are on it for very long, it can have a nasty hook and you may have to taper gradually to avoid some pretty nasty withdrawals. It's a very good and effective sleep aid, but I don't think any MD should write a script for longer than say a month, max and even that may be too long for some folks, in particular people who are in alcohol or drug recovery (as I am with 10 1/2 years sober).  Good stuff, but watch the duration of use. That's my view, anyway..

She sleep eats and does other weird stuff like mixing mayo into iced tea and microwaving stuff way too long while asleep.  Also she re-organizes stuff and falls asleep while doing it so I find her asleep on the floor, but the scariest thing is tha she is on pain meds and takes way too many without knowing it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Mrs D, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	12/8/2009 3:38:57 PM	Anyone who says ambien is not addictive at all is just wrong. Simple fact it is and its listed as one of the side effects. I was prescribed ambien by my doctor for sever insomnia that I have dealt with since childhood. It is easy to take and does work, but after being on it for over two years it began making me sleepwalk, and carry on daily activities with no memory of doing so. For people that experience this they should discontinue use as it can be dangerous. It is well known that people have driven a vehicle, cooked, and have done other things all under the influence of ambien. It did work to put me to sleep fast but with any other drugs your body builds up a tolerance and they begin to not work. A stronger dose is ridiculous as it only adds to the addictive qualities. I also began to forget taking the prescription and then take more thinking I hadn't take it at all. I would also advise people to be wary of overdose as this is common.

I still do wake up once or twice during the night but am able to fall asleep quickly &amp; wake up without a problem. Once I took the pill &amp; decided to go online awhile--a mistake since I vaguely remember going to bed but bathrobe was not in usual spot, etc. That scared me a little so now I go right to bed after taking this (sometimes I do read a little in bed only) so that all I have to do is turn off the light. Husband would tell if I got up &amp; did anything other than the potty so that's a good thing.

I also would eat and occasionally make phone calls, thank goodness, only to friends who would be kind enough to understand and just tell me to go back to sleep. It really helped me to fall asleep, but I still would awaken and do the above things with little to no memory of the events. Was imperative for my own safety and the safety of others when I drove to stop taking this drug. I now take Lunesta and have had NONE of these side effects.

One time I almost burned down my apartment trying to cook under the influence of Ambien.  I also tried to cook bacon in microwave in a tea towel and make cold chocolate milk out of hot cocoa under the influence.  I I was not aware of until the next day when the evidence was there.On one other occasion I took the Ambien by mistake as it looks exactly like my tramadol.  I hae no memeory of ambulance coming, paramedics, trip to hospital, stay at hospital, ride home in a Taxi and my being able to get into my home and going to bed.  All this happened while under the influence of ambien.  This is carey stuff and should be taken off the market!

However, I have taken it for a few years and take 10-20 mg. I have never driven my car, or done anything weird. However, I have fallen asleep in my chair watching tv if I am up alone.  Lunesta left a horrible metallic taste in my mouth, didn't like it at all.  Ambien CR was worth about one hour sleep at best. Hopeless.  Like any drug, this can cause problems but that's why I see a psychiatrist to get the RX.  I will admit that it does NOT work as good as it did the first 2 years.  I wake up after 4 hours now. But can go back to sleep usually and besides 4 hours sleep is a lot better than none! It's safer than some of the older sleeping medications. I am behind it 100%. I don't take it every night, but about 10 times a month.  I think it's pretty safe, compared to the older sleep meds and NOT addictive.

Difficulty Falling Asleep	EKW, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	11/10/2009 1:33:52 AM	I have only used Ambien for a month or so, almost every night to fall asleep. i have conversations, am intimate with my boyfriend, say things i wouldn't normally, get angry the next day, am depressed, and it is ruining my relationship with my boyfriend, and i even had a night where i didn't even wake up when my four month old was crying very hard, wanting a bottle. i never remember the first bottle i give her after going to sleep, and have memory loss effecting my work and college. i am trying to stop this medication, but i am addicted, and it is hard. when you cant sleep at night and there is a pill you can take to almost instantly put you to sleep, that honestly makes you feel like you are drunk and high, it is not easy to stop taking it knowing you wont be able to sleep. I would not recomend this to anyone. it is a horible medication.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	itsmesarahx14, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	13-18	11/8/2009 11:55:08 AM	I'm 16 years old and have PTSD and ADHD which both make it difficult to sleep. This works really really well, but I can't take it every night, only the nights after i have episodes (flashbacks, panic attacks, etc.) because i'm worried about getting addicted to it. Addiction runs in my family and so i don't want to risk it. I take it maybe 1-2 times a week (its getting less and less though because I'm taking Zoloft for my PTSD and Vyvanse for my ADHD) At first i had some little sleepwalking incidents where i made myself an icecream sunday and found it the next day in my dresser drawer (that was gross lol) but then it got worse. It can get very scary; one night i went out to my car at 3 am and started it up and then, thank God, my mama woke up and came outside and got me to go inside. I have no memory of that whatsoever. and i'm not a great driver anyways so i'm sure i wouldn't have been alive the next morning if i was driving in my sleep! So i suggest not taking this if you live alone or already have sleep walking issues. Now when i take it my mama has to take all the car keys (including my brother's and dad's) and lock them up for the night. It works, but i wouldn't suggest it unless you really really really need it to function.

Side effects- walking in my sleep, binge eating, talking in my sleep, texting in my sleep and having conversations which I have no memory of. I am definitely scared of reading what has happened to many individuals and am seriously going to get off of it.

I only take it Mon-Thurs when I absolutely have to get to sleep so I can do to work the next day. I don't have any of the side effects that others mentioned. It usually works pretty fast (30 mins or less) so I do take it after I have myself ready for bed.The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't keep me asleep more than 6 hours...usually 5-6. It's a deep sleep, but not longer than 6 hours which I would prefer. So if I take it at 10pm I am back up at 4am...ugh! I just alternate with over-the-counter sleeping pills when I have more time to sleep or need a really good night's sleep.

They've all worn off eventually, but I liked Ambien the best. Maybe because it was the first and when I got home from the doc later that night it was suuuch and a relief to sleep.There was another gentleman who said the name brand is better -- personally I found the generic Zolpidem to be better. Just depends on your own body chemistry. And they certainly did the job.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Betty, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	10/26/2009 8:26:50 PM	I've had trouble sleeping for years. Over the counter sleep aids do nothing for me. Before taking Ambien I've gone for days without sleep. I have tried both Ambien and AmbienCR. The only difference I found was that I felt &quot;groggy&quot; the next day after taking the CR. I fall asleep easily, but wake numerous times a night. NEVER sleep more than 5 hours. I have experienced a lot of eating while asleep episodes. Other memory loss as well. I've been taking this drug for over a year and wish I could stop! The memory loss scares me considerably.

However, the generics aren't nearly as effective consistently. Some mfgs. have products equal to Ambiens generic (Zolpidem Tartrate) and other mfgs have very ineffective products  - my advice- get Ambien and not the generic.

I have had a little bit of the memory loss. I have been taking it for about a year now and it isn't allowing me to sleep as long at one time as I should. I wake up several times at night, but am able to go back to sleep much more easily that before I was taking it. I'm concerned about the long term effects that it has on you. i don't know what kind of effects it has.

It works great for allowing me to fall asleep and stay asleep.  However, I know that it's addicting.  Not very long after I started taking it.  I neglected to refill it before I left town overnight for meetings.  I could not fall asleep the entire night.  I have been told that I full conversation with people, yet I have no memory of it whatsoever.  I noticed that after I had gastric bypass surgery that drug intensified.  I would caution anyone that is prescribed the medication to be very careful.  Make sure you take it while you are actually in bed.  It takes only about 10-15 minutes to take effect.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	4	3	Male	25-34	10/23/2009 4:45:21 AM	This medicine works very well, Yet only if it is used as perscribed!. I've had problems sleeping for about a decade and have tried out other methods and this drug works the best. YET,(some advice for the people who can't afford under the counter treatment) I find it very similar to over the counter sleep aids like unisom,Simply Sleep or the knock off brands that contain the same chemical. I've known of certain people who take this Ambien as a means to get high, and I can see why they do. It reacts to the body as if almost like a benzodiazepam- aka Valium,Klonopin and xanax in the fact that it delivers a very calming and warm feeling within 45 minutes of taking it. When people report being very &quot;Chatty&quot; and motivated that is the drug taking over your mind because you are in a warm and calm state. Take for instance when a DR. prescribes Xanax to a person who has social Anxiety, what happens? that person becomes more socialiable to his or her peers.Well the same thing happens while taking Ambien. The more calm people get, the more often they tend to let their guard down and engage in conversations that in a sober state of mind they normally wouldn't. So if you are prescribed this drug take it while you are actually in bed and turn off the T.V. or anything that u THINK will kill the time before the drug kicks in. Also make sure your kids or loved ones are also in the process of &quot;going to bed&quot; and try to avoid any potential distractionss of any kind while on this medication... My knowledge of this drug is based on experience and of practice.   
Difficulty Falling Asleep	Jane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	10/21/2009 9:40:10 PM	I have had trouble falling asleep for many years.  I have taken Excedrin PM for so long that I had to try something else.  I cannot take an entire Ambien, or even half an Ambien, because it gives me a headache in the morning.  1/4 an Ambien helps me get to sleep, but I tend to wake up at 3, 4 or 5am and not get back to sleep.  So far, I haven't really found something that works well for me.  At least some sleep is better than none.

I have had insomnia for many years and it's safe to say that i've tried everything else. It is very addictive though and if on it for a long time you end up taking more then you're suppose to due to building up a tolerance to the drug. Most nights i end up taking at least 3 pills. Sometimes i take more without knowing it. I have to count my pills each morning just to see how many i took the night before. I've never done anything dangerous while taking this but i eat, talk on the phone or clean my house all without memory of it the next day.

When I decided to retire at age 68, I could not go to sleep until about 4 a.m. each day. 10 mg of Ambiem did the trick, every time. I still use it every night. Without it I do not fall asleep until 3-4a.m.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Lloyd G, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	45-54	10/16/2009 8:20:49 PM	I have had difficulties sleeping for 20 years.  I had effective relief from trazadone but became accustomed to it and, rather than up the dosage, tried ambien instead.  It worked well initially, but after two months it had slowly but surely brought on serious side effects.  It continued to work as a sleep aid, but I was suffering during the day from confusion, nausea, abdominal pain, chest pain, tinitis, severe short term memory loss, headache and loss of ability to function.  Life had become a walking nightmare.  It took another month to finally associate the symptoms to the ambien.  The symptoms came on so gradually that I did not notice them until I was too sick to function.  I also suffer from chronic pain and I thought that was the cause.  I stopped the ambien two days ago and although I am again having difficulty sleeping I am starting to function again.  I can see that it will take many more days to fully recover from this poisoning.  This drug should not be taken more than once or twice a week.  I was suffering so badly, I went to the hospital with fear of serious problems.  It seems that no permanent damage was done but I will never take this medicine again.  Losing sleep is bad, but ambien is worse.

The first time that I know of, I took it with another prescription medication for a cough. I woke up w/ broken glass on my kitchen floor, bruises all over and dried food around my mouth.  Then another time I took it with my pain meds and when I got up food was gone and evidence in trash that I had eaten.

When I take Ambien (or the generics) I do not remember my dreams.  I have experienced my sleep as a black hole.  Having that experience does something to your perspective.  If you have other options try them first.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Bob, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	19-24	10/7/2009 7:48:18 PM	I have been taking Ambien and overall it helps me sleep. I like being able to go to sleep whenever I wish without having anxiety if I need to go to bed earlier then normal. I do have a lot of daytime fatigue and a strong headache if I don't get at least 7-9 hours. I do have an increased appetite and feel very strange after initially taking it. I also have trouble recalling things the next day near or around the time I had taken it the previous night. If you cannot get at least 7-9 hours of sleep you may feel it the next day. 
Difficulty Falling Asleep	Seriously Scared Witless, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/4/2009 9:54:28 PM	DANGEROUS, SELF HARMING, &amp; NOT WORTH THE RISK OF SIDE EFFECTS!!!I have had many a sleepless night since the recent death of my grandmother &amp; it has gotten worse since my grandfather is ill &amp; passing also. My endocrinologist gave me the script for Ambian with rave reviews, like it would be the cure-all drug for my sleepless nights. Well, I have to say that by nature I am easy going &amp; don't have a mean bone in me. But, that changed within 30 minutes of taking the pill. I became Aggitated, Aggressive, violent &amp; belidgerant all at once. I have no memory of a 6 hour span. Thank God I was home with my sisters &amp; neice. With their watchful eyes &amp; amazing control, they prevented me from self harm with kitchen knives, driving my car,  &amp; falling over the porch railing!! I even tried to smoke a plastic straw &amp; I don't even smoke!!! Not to mention trying to clean out the medicine cabinet with old, expired meds &amp; possibly taking them!! Lastly, I tried to wash sheets &amp; make the bed again with my sister in-law still in the bed! My family debated on calling 911 &amp; rushing me to the hospital to have my stomach pumped. I seriously think if they had doctors would have had &quot;just cause&quot; for commiting me to the insane asylum! Mind you I only know all this because the details were given to me the next morning. All I could do was cry. I was so scared &amp; embarrased. This medication is DANGEROUS, AWFUL &amp; NOT WORTH THE RISK!!!! I plan to add this medication to my list of allergies. I never want to have this happen again, neither for myself or for my family to go thru again. What if I had been alone or with friends who hadn't known what to do?

I always sleep through the night with no grogginess in the morning after taking a pill. However, my GP only prescribes 20 per month &amp; I have to go in to see him to get it refilled.

I dont feel like I rely on it to &quot;make&quot; me sleep or that I -&quot;have to have it...&quot; but it has definately helped me keep my sanity. It allows me to shut my mind down and get the rest I need, that I deserve. Its hard to remember what I had to do before this treatment. Unfortunately with my ex having issues with abusing MY prescriptions, I have to keep a watchful eye out even when he's here to spend time with our children. That's a sad but all too true situation.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	litekeeper, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/10/2009 11:41:04 PM	I have had insomnia for some long time, along with depression. The depression may have caused the insomnia, or the insomnia caused the depression. Either way, my MD prescribed a number of different sleeping pills for me throughout the years. Some of them I'd get &quot;immune&quot; to and have to stop taking, and some I was afraid to get immune to and stop taking them as prescribed. I take Ambien CR now, one each night, but have also changed my lifestyle - no computer, no TV at night, plus turning on classical music. Make it very cool and quiet at night and Ambien CR helps me mostly sleep through the whole night. I've had no real side effects except the occasional getting immune; when that happens, I take diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for a while and then go back to Ambien CR.

I've been taking this drug for 3 yrs due to post trmatic stress. I take a half of a 10mg never went to 10mg total. And I am addicted. Cannot fall asleep without it cannot sleep without. I am so disappointed in myself. I would of rather SUFFERED then to try to get off from this. Even at only 5mg! Keep away from this drug!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	8/30/2009 2:17:06 AM	This drug should be more strictly monitored.  Having been on it for 5 years it requires 6 pills to put me to sleep. My husband has to hide them and give them to me each night. After 2 I will turn violent to get more.  You will have no memory of after the first dose,yet apparently are Satan reincarnated.  I am the type of person who would rather take a piece of paper and let the spider ride on that to a safer place, then kill anything.  Yet for ambien I will get violent.  No one should take for longer than 2 days.  I promise it will ruin your life.  Think of a heroin junkie - it isn't much different.  It gives you an addictive high.  The first time I ever took it I watched my tshirts walk out of the dresser drawer and dance on the spinnning ceiling.  I have never done any drugs in my life or even smoked a cigarette.  But I can't imagine life of an ambien addict is any different that a crack addict.  They should restrict the use to hospitalizations only, or monitor the usage. I just call my prescription into my pharmacy whenever I want- they do the rest for me - call my Doc etc.  I've asked Doc for help and they tell me its not addictive.  Please believe me that it is.  Donn't take it please I promise you that you will regret your decision.  Here I am years later, dependant and can't get help.  Tried to stop and had seizures, yet can not get aa rehab facility to acknowledge there is a problem

I began by taking 1/2 10mg pill.  I was thrilled that i could sleep the night thru and get up refreshed.  Then about 2wks into my usage i began waking halfway to morning.  I flirted about 3 times now w/ a whole 10mg pill.  Last evening I apparently got up in my sleep and pulled out the pots and pans and cooked myself a meal ON A GAS STOVE!! I apparently ate it all and went back to bed.  I discovered it aroun 4a.m when i woke again and needed a glass of water.  As of today I will cease to use this medication as the tendency to arise and function in a sleep state is too worrisome for me. I only hope I can re-discover what sleep is.

Other	Abe, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	55-64	8/23/2009 11:17:49 AM	Because I internationally travel a lot, my physician suggested that I take this drug to regulate my sleeping patterns (and to get some sleep on planes). I wake up a bit groggy, and I have a fear that I am becoming dependent on it. When I consulted my physician about it, he told me not to worry about dependence. Still, I do. Indeed, I find my self worrying that I will some day not have it to help me sleep. My wife snores - constantly and really loud. This helps me sleep during her snoring, gurgling, and all sorts of other extremely disruptive nocturnal noises.

I used to take 1/4 of a pill and had trouble cutting it so I used 1/3.  It has helped me but.. 200 mg of 5 HTP at bed has helped more.  I also take 1 mg of melatonin.  I am having trouble with withdrawl in trying to come off the med.

I've tried it also with the same results.  I'm able to walk 35 minutes and have incredible energy.  I'm facing a knee replacement in Oct. and wonder what the compound is that would give these results?  I and my brother take 10mg. at night before we go to bed.  Ambien as a sleep aid has never helped me but as as osteoarthritis drug it's great.

For the first 3 days, it worked well. Then I returned to my old sleep patterns. I was unable to sleep throughout the night; only worse. After a week, I began to feel constant dizziness and was unable to concentrate during the day. Yesterday, after consulting with my doctor, I stopped taking it. Last night was absolutely horrible. It took me most of the night to get to sleep (I never had this problem before). That tells me I was addicted to it (after only one week). Take my advice; read the warning label and think twice before taking this drug.

I also suffer from major depression going on 8 months now. I have also had problems sleeping and waking up frequently. I do find that this &quot;wonder pill&quot; makes me feel absolutely great! I still can not sleep, but who the heck cares? right? It reigns over my depression with an iron fist. (I am writing this under the influence of Ambien. Can you tell?) I tell you, I feel as if there is not a problem or conflict in the world or in my life. I feel like a caged bird given wings. I feel happy for once in a long time. As long as I have Ambien in my system. I think I found my true soulmate...I would not recommend the drug for insomnia, however, I would without a doubt, recommed it for depression. ( and uh... don't leave the house while you have an ambien rush) Trust me.

Since childhood, I have suffered from chronic insomnia and have only been able to feel &quot;normal&quot; since using this prescription medicine.  I no longer feel ill from lack of sleep day after day. I no longer am a hazard on the road because of &quot;seeing double&quot; from lack of sleep as I drive to work.  I am able to get up at a normal time (6-7 a.m. on work days) and feel happy and healthy all day long.  I no longer lie in bed waiting to go to sleep until 4 a.m. only to have to wake up at 6.  Sleep deprivation - as a result of some type of organic (no stimulants ever!) insomnia has been very difficult to endure until now.  I am a teacher with many responsibilites, and I know that this prescription has improved my mental state; my memory and other mental processes function better than ever!  The stress of &quot;bad sleep&quot; has been eliminated.  I'm very grateful for this medicine as it has helped to improve the quality of my life and allowed me to get the rest I need.  Thank you.
Difficulty Falling Asleep	Lee, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	8/9/2009 8:16:52 PM	I was prescribed 10mg dosage and have used it over a three year period.  I would normally break it in half and use just 5mg to help me mentally shutdown so that I could fail asleep.Over the period of time that I was using Ambien, I started having erectile dysfunction issues.  I also noted that I was a more subdued personality than normal.  Things did not set me off as in times past.  I considered this to be a positive side effect.  Within weeks after ceasing the medication to determine if the ED was due to Ambien, I was back to peak performance, for a 42 year old that is.  If you have ED and are on Ambien, try going without for a month.

I even had my hair done once and wrote the lady a check with a $25 tip for a 20$ haircut and couldn't remember the next day what i had done!...i just want people to be aware of the &quot;memory loss&quot; aspect...i but it IS THE ONLY med that has worked for me to fall asleep (and i have tried EVERYTHING!)....if your parents are on this med, some people may say they have dementia but it may actually be the medication...make sure you know what meds your parents are on BEFORE someone makes a wrong diagnosis...and keep a list of meds you take in your wallet(in case of an accident or emergency)...Sweet dreams...

The first time was great. The second time I began vomiting 30 min before the plane landed, could not stop and ended up in the emergency room--could not make my connecting flight. The 3rd time I again threw up upon landing and was ill for the rest of the day. I won't take it again. Insomnia on planes is better than what I have experienced.

I still wake up when I use it, but for shorter periods. I once had Ambien CR and found it much more effective. But since I also have sleep apnea, it's probably not a good idea for me to take it regularly unless I am also using a CPAP or BIPAP machine.

I would awake in the morning so exhausted and my body ached even my muscles seemed sore. Initally the Doctor thought maybe I had limes disease or fibromialgia. When I explained to my Doctor my symptoms he said  lets try Ambien and go from there. The first night about one hour after taking it I fell asleep after 3 or 4 days of a good nights sleep and I didn't wake up groggy I couldn't believe it I was actually starting to feel like my old energetic self.I've been taking it for 1 month now and tonight is my first night without it and it's 2 am and I'm awake and I have no refills and the Doctor is on vacation.

However, I suffer from depression/anxiety and arthritis too and take prozac or Cymbalta and tramadol and Tylenol.  I recently changed to the Veterans Admin. for my healthcare.  They require a psych eval before dispensing any psychtropic drugs.  And here's why I'm telling you this;  The psychiatrist said Ambien is for short-term use only.  I said B.S. lady.  Then she gave me a list of symptoms re: Seratonin syndrome. She took me off Cymbalta (the V A simply does not provide it) and Ambien. Wants me to use Ultram as little as possible.  All the good sh#t. FYI I'm adjusting to Trazodon for sleep and depression it is a seratonin hep'er.  Ask your doctor.  I have not found anything on the web re: short term use.

The first few times I took it I hallucinated but that subsided. Also I do have blackout periods that occur about an hour before fall asleep. During those forgotten periods I never did anything harmful to myself or anyone else. The only reason i had to quit taking ambien was because my doctor wanted to put me on a drug thats considered less habit forming.

I wake up in the morning to a sink full of dishes and I have to go through the garbage can to figure out what all I've eaten.  It's a little unnerving to think I can prepare the food and eat it and have no recall of it at all.  I don't take it all the time, but whenever I do, there's always dishes (and pots and pans) in the sink the next morning.  And if that isn't enough ... the other night I took it and when I woke up in the morning I went to the kitchen and saw an assortment of dishes and cups in the sink.  Then I started wondering why the cat had not followed me out into the kitchen like he does every morning for his breakfast (he's never been one to miss a meal - he's an 18 pound Main Coon Tabby).  So I started going through the garbage and I find empty cans of cat food.  I'M NOT ONLY FEEDING MYSELF, I'M FEEDING THE CAT TOO!!!  It figures he'd be one to take advantage of the situation.  Why is it that the drugs that work always seem to have side effects.  Lunesta didn't to didly squat for me and Sonata is hit &amp; miss.

I have taken it, and 5 minutes later everything looked like it was melting. I sent my mother an email that I dont remember sending once. And I have heard crazy voices in my head. Stick with the over the counter stuff!

Ambien was great with helping me sleep and feeling rested the next day.  I did suffer large amounts of memory loss and found I can not drink alcohol or I get really sick for days even after only 1 drink.  I also suffered hallucinations, double vision, and a very drunk feeling within 15 minutes of taken the medication. I get so &quot;drunk&quot; I can't walk straight and fall into the walls.  One night I was hallucinating the my 11 yearold had grown an extra head and I was trying to catch it and pull it off.  Altough I remember knowing it was not real I was so &quot;drunk&quot; I thought it was funny.  I finally relized I was scaring my kids and got something differant from my doctor to try.  I asked for something milder, she perscribed Vistiral.  I don't know if it works yet, I didn't take anything last night and plan to not take anything tonight either.  I try to get through the weekends without chemical assistance.  Ambien did work for my, but the side affects are a big price to pay, one I am not willing to pay anymore.  Unless absolutely nothing else works, then I may try it again.

Love, love, love, this prescription.&#160; Most of my life even as a child I would hate bedtime because I knew I would be the one tossing and turning while the rest of the house was sleeping....Yeah!&#160; Now I'm the one sleeping...Thanks to Ambien...and I'v had no side-effects.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	tuffer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	35-44	7/9/2009 1:53:16 PM	ambien really does help me sleep all the way through the night, but there are a couple of things I do not like about this drug.  First of all, it must be kept on my bedside table.  If a take it at any other time than while I'm already in bed, I have been told that I will sleep walk, and sometimes not remember that I have already taken the medication and take it again.  The Ambien CR is not like that for me.  But Ambien CR has no generic and is not covered by my presciption drug plan.  Also, because of my weight and overall size, I have been prescribed 2 of the regular Ambien at night because I am larger and also because I take medication for ADHD.  I would much rather be prescibed 1 tablet of Ambien CR a night than 2 tablets of 10 milligram generic Ambien (zolpidem) per night.  But unfortunately that is not possible, as I said before, with my drug coverage. The cost of 30 tablets of Ambien CR out of pocket is over $100.00.  The cost for 60 tablets a month of generic Ambien (zolpidem) is only about $45.00 or $50.00 for my prescription company to pay and my co-pay is only a $1.10

I take 10mg at 10:30 Pm, awaken at 12:30 AM, back to sleep around 3:30 AM awake again at 5:00 AM back to sleep again and awake at 8:30 AM. THis pattern is repeated every night.

The benefits outweight the negatives.  I did order a vacuum cleaner one evening in an ambien fog.  Did not know it until it was delivered.The medication gently puts me to sleep, and I normally sleep for eight uninterrupted hours. And wake up refreshed.

The pills made me feel almost drunk, i was stumbling over things and light headed. I never had any weird hallucinations or anything happen while sleeping on the medication, but i did feel hungover the mornings after and then I threw up much of the morning also. I also didn't sleep much better.

Some nights it works and some it dont. But, in Oct 08 I was given a DUI for driving the following morning from taking the pill at 11pm. I was told it was against the law to drive while taking this med within 8-10 hours of taking it. Im still fighting this charge b/c when they blood work came back to crime lab said that I was not intoxicated to a level that would cause me to have recieved a DUI. It was what they call therapy levels in which a Dr has prescribed. So be aware of your states law before taking sleeping pills.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	6/26/2009 10:28:29 AM	I have had trouble sleeping my entire life, but when my husband was diagnosed with cancer, and we had to file bankruptcy, it became much worse. I was taking the 5mg dose at first, when it wasn't as effective, I moved up to the 12.5 mg dose. I was so excited to finally be getting some sleep, I started taking Ambien every single night. I never got up and ate without knowing it, but it did make me hungry during the day. I gained 10 lbs quickly. But the worst side effect: major depression. I was already stressed enough, but starting feeling suicidal after taking Ambien for over a month. I had never heard of this happening with Ambien, so I thought it was simply everything else going on. I decided to stop taking Ambien, and quit cold turkey. Within two days, I felt more normal, and didn't have the deep depression I was experiencing. I will never take Ambien on a regular basis again, it was scary how depressed and angry I got. I know this doesn't happen with everyone, but I want people to know that it CAN happen in certain situations, and to be careful taking this drug. I would rather not sleep than experience what I did with Ambien.

I do not want to have to use a &quot;sleep&quot; inducing medication but this seems to be the only way I am able to go to sleep.It is very unfortunate that my drug company and many physicians seem to feel that I should not be allowed to use any sleep inducing products.  It continues to be a very very, large problem for me.Yes, I am addicted but not an &quot;addict&quot;.Just a normal, for the most part, 72 year old female that wants to get some sleep!Ambien does help me fall asleep but I still wake up at 4:00am.  Sometimes I just get up and walk around the house or do little chores.  I still go to bed at my normal bed time of 10:00 or 11:00 pm.\Why must I contiune to suffer the anxiety of having a &quot;sleep medication&quot; RX renewed??

For this reason I recently discontinued and, as an aside, have seen an improvement in daytime energy. It may take some weeks to see if the memory improves.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	6/22/2009 11:59:03 PM	The regular Ambien is great - but the CR I don't like as it gives me a &quot;hangover&quot; where I have trouble waking, even after more than 8hrs. I use it rarely, so I have never built up a tolerance.  The only thing that bothers me is that it gives me hallucinations. I take one and then read a little until I get sleepy, and all the sudden I see the words on the page undulating. If there are pictures, I see them become animated and move. I also watched in amazement as my carpet began to undulate like waves on an ocean one night...I can live with these effects but they are very, very weird! 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Kak, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	6/22/2009 7:27:28 PM	I had been taking Ambien off and on for 3 years.  In the beginning it was very effective but I used it sporadically because I had a newborn to take care of.  Since my mother's death in July 2008 and other stressors, I became a very chronic insomniac and took the medication more frequently. I have experienced two sleep eating episodes that I was told about but had memory loss so there could be more. That was frightening to me.  I also was informed of crazy and embarassing things I talked about with my teenage son (I was looking for Moose and I was very happy that I had my very own pony). I also became agitated with him that he would not give me candy, so I must have gotten up and found some Skittles and shoved the hole bag in my mouth so much that I do remember not being able to close my mouth. I woke up the next morning hoping that what I did remember was a dream, only to get up and hear several Skittles hit the floor.  I would only use this medication when someone is there to supervise you in case something like this happens.  I did stop taking it because I really did not like the memory loss and that I wasn't in control of what I said or ate.

I have a chronic insomnia problem and was given Ambien. You do build a tolerance to this medication and wind up doing things you don't remember doing. This drug causes night eating, sleepwalking and driving when you are not even aware of it! I've been trying to get off of this med for awhile now and its a nightmare! Beware when taking this medication! No matter what your doctor says this medication is very addictive and getting off of it is very hard.

It worries me that I aparently got up in the middle of the night took a (larger) roll of cookies out of the fridge and baked them, and in the morning there were only 4 cookies left. I thought my kids must have come over and done this. But we had our alarm system turned on and the dogs did not bark. I will probobly quit taking this drug.

I have had several medical problems that all hit me at the same time 6 yrs. ago, so it was almost impossible for me to sleep--I was totally exhausted.  I finally asked my doctor for a sleep aid and he gave me this.  I still don't sleep all night, but it is an improvement over not sleeping at all.

It is good for about 4-5 hours of sleep.  No grogginess the next day.  Although it works, it has some crazy side effects.  I have conversations with my family that I don't remember.  I get up even though I can sense that I'm asleep (feels like sleepwalking) and play games on my PC, eat anything and everything, and watch TV.  I haven't driven or cooked anything.  I did upset my daughter when she spoke to me and I was incoherent and weaving while walking.  She thought I was having a stroke.  She began to cry and I was totally unresponsive.  She woke up my husband and he led me back to bed.  I don't remember any of it - needless to say, I put a lot of barriers between me and my bedroom door.  It causes me to realize that I'm up and I need to go back to bed.

In the past 15 years I have had a fair amount of difficulty getting and staying asleep. Because of my years of sleep deprivation my doc started me off on 20mgs of Ambien nightly. I experienced what I called &quot;noxious, nocturnal, noshing&quot;. I was making several trips in a daze to the fridge. This was evidenced by containers of melted sherbert, open jars of peanut butter and crackers, and half eaten fruit I would discover in the morning. My shape was rapidly becoming round. Without consulting my doctor I switched to 10 mg of Ambien with 2 mg lorazepam. It worked wonders insofar as I get to sleep within 30-45 minutes of medicating. Only problem is staying asleep and I am going to see if the VA carries Ambien CR as the secondary release of the medication might allow me to remain asleep. I think everyone needs to find their individual tolerance for this and all other medications. I used to take valium for muscle spasms with the bonus effect of drowsiness. It has an unacceptably long half life so it was not a good medication for me. I have made peace with the nocturnal noshing and no longer keep sherbert and other calorie dense items in my house.

I began taking Ambien about a year ago, but only took it when I knew I would have trouble sleeping - like the night before a job interview and such.  It seemed to work great.  After a while, I found myself taking it more often.  It happened slowly and I didn't realize for a while how dependent I had become.  Eventually, I was taking it almost every night. Over the past year, I have also begun to deal with some extreme emotional ups and downs and felt depressed, very depressed at times.  I didn't make a connection.  However, as I have begun to wean myself off of the drug for the past month (down to 1/4 tablet once or twice a week),it feels like a veil is lifting.  Not only do I feel much stronger, but my thinking is becoming sharper again. I am no doctor, but after listening to my own body, I have decided that this is a drug that DOES affect your brain functions and should be taken with great awareness of how it may be changing your thoughts.  Has anyone else experienced a connection to depression?

I may have thought I slept, but a lot of times, my wife would tell me of all the asinine things I did while on it.  She would tell me that I would go on for hours, and she hopelessly tried to snap me out of the trance I was in.The next day, I could swear up and down that none of what took place happened.  Although, I had some recollections, but just minute snippets of what took place.I would get back up and start cooking and eating and almost burn the house down.  Other times, I would say some nasty or weird things to my wife.I also would start answering SMS and emails with utterly embarrassing ramblings, stuff that would make Lewis Carrol blush.Sure the tranquility and calmness was nice, but it didn't work for me, and it caused a lot of problems both personally and professionally.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	5/31/2009 5:31:58 AM	I have been prescribed Ambien 10mg pills off and on since my husband was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor four years ago.  I was hesitant to speak with my dr about a prescription sleep aid in the beginning but with the constant traveling and stress that I was enduring, I needed help.  Ambien allowed me to sleep through the night and be ready for seven am meetings with neuro-oncologists.  Without the medication, I know I would've stayed up all night worrying.  I am a full time student once again and I know that Ambien allows me to shut down my excessive worrying and get the rest I need to graduate this spring and take care of my husband and daughter.  I definitely recommend this medication to those who have stressful life situations that are uncontrollable.  Life becomes much easier to deal with when you are getting the proper amount of sleep.  Just make sure you take it right before bedtime and lay down immediately!

You sleep well, you don't wake up in the middle of the night, and you don't oversleep. It's perfect. I just hope there is no long term side effects. I am on Dialysis have been for twenty years, and it's safe for us. Thank you for a great medication to help finally get some needed sleep.

If that is not scarry enough now I am having horrible memory problems, dizziness, tirdeness, general fatigue all the time.  I don't know what to do.  Should I stop taking all together or go back to physician for a different type medication?

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Lasky, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/21/2009 1:13:17 PM	I have been taking Ambien for about 4 years now.  The only side effect is a little midnight snacking (seems to take effect quicker with a snack).  Over time - 2 yrs or so - the drug doesn't take effect as well as it did before.  I have found that switching from Ambien 10mg to Ambien CR 12.5 helped.  Now I am going from Ambien CR back to the regular Ambien.  I do have to take a combination of Ambien and Benadryl in order to fall and stay asleep, but still no hangover in the morning.  I used to have chronic hives (no cause ever found - other than an overactive immune system).  I believe they may have been caused by lack of sleep.  I will gladly take this drug for as long as needed if it will prevent me from having to go through the experience of chronic hives again.  Sleeping is one of the healthiest things you can do for your body, so for me the benefit is worth it.

I was on nearly 2 years. It was sucking the life out of me. Oh, I slept fine, all the time. My memory got bad. Became dslysic. Constitpaton, blood in urine. Plus, I went from a size 2, 112 lbs to 162lbs. I think if I had taken it 1-2 more weeks I wouldn't be writing this. My lips felt numb. I was only taking 10mgs a day. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DRUG TO ANYONE, unless you are wanting to die.

It worked but I am also on an antipressant and the Ambien has made my depression come back big time after years of remission. I'm quitting the Ambien but have to do it slowly. Be very careful if you also have depression.

I take around 10ish at night within 10 mins im ready for bed.  I can see this drug being addictive I only have a 10 day trial just to get into a habit of sleeping.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	5/4/2009 3:50:04 PM	I advise if you really need this medication, take the lowest dose, 5mg and if you can break that in half, because of my experience on 10mg.  It is very addictive.It made me very aggressive.I would write emails, make phone calls and not remember doing it the next day.The worst side effect was eating during the night.  It made me very hungry and I gained fifteen pounds.I call this the Devil's Drug.  I understand the need for sleeping pills, but I strongly advise trying alternatives/herbs anything else first.

This medication was so helful to me after concussion. It has improved my immunity because I can sleep a normal amount without chronic wakefulness. It just assists my brain chemistry in connecting to normal sleep pattern. No adverse side effects. Have you looked at the studies of use of Ambien in people who have suffered seizures or had concussions? I am so grateful that my doctors recognize the importance of this mediction for me.  They were thorough in making sure it did not cause adverse responses. Please do not use my email address.

THAT MAN WAS ARRESTED FOR SEXUAL BATTERY AND ILLEGAL DRUG DISTIBUTION AND IS IN PRISON FOR LIFE. AMBIEN WORKED SO WELL I WOULD NEVER TAKE IT AGAIN. BLACKOUTS ARE CAUSED BY MANY MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND TOO HIGH DOSAGES OF DRUGS LIKE THIS ONE.  BE VERY CAREFUL WITH HYPNOTICS/SEDATIVES.DRUGS IN THE HANDS OF THE WRONG PEOPLE CAN ALSO BE KILLERS.  I AM LUCKY TO BE ALIVE WITH NO BRAIN DAMAGE.  NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF DRUGS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS. EVEN DOCTORS MAKE MISTAKES AND DRUGS LIKE THIS CAN DO UNTOLD HARM.I WILL NEVER TAKE THIS TYPE OF DRUG FOR ANY REASON. THE RISK OF BRAIN DAMAGE IS TOO HIGH.

It doesn't help me fall asleep, and its near impossible to get up in the morning.  I've started having nightmares that I link to it.  I have alot of other side effects that I recently linked it like my irritability and severe anxiety.  Nearly anything will send me over the edge and make me feel like I'm gonna lose my mind.  I'm going to try to find another sleep aid that doesn't make me go crazy. lol

I have awaken in the night claiming that I look like a man and spent twenty minutes grabbing at green things that did not exist. I also apparently told my puppy that I felt sorry for her b/c she had only one I that at the time I could not see. It is frightening to have no recollection of such events. I no longer take this pill, but even though I had hallucinations almost every night, it is the only thing that helps me sleep without feeling groggy the entire next day.

I take an anti-deprassnt that was keeping me up all night so my doc gave me Ambien. After the 1st week of sleeping I loved it... As time has gone I notice if I miss a dose I'm misreble. I honestly told my doc I was addictied to it and as for side effects well not remembering was the biggest and yet waking up was so easy! PLEASE anyone who thinks they are addicted TELL YOUR doctor immediately, there are others that can help you sleep without the addiction!This medicne is not a long term med it does have things that can affect you health wise.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/23/2009 1:15:03 AM	I have taken this medication for about 6 months now. I take it and in a matter of 15 minutes I feel loopy, and yes I can not remember a lot of things that happen afterwards. I would have to ask my husband the next day &quot;did we do anything last night&quot; He would let me know and slowly it came back. It does make you loose your memory, I havnt lost my appetite or anything like that. I feel like I have gotten addicted to it, I use to smoke weed just to fall asleep and I got use to it and would wake up at least 1 time every hour, so I mentioned it to my Dr he prescribed this drug instead of smoking. I am on 10 mg and I do not feel the hangover, just feel I can not go to sleep unless I take it now for fear of not sleeping through the night. I am a sleeping person, and do not like my sleep interrupted.

If I wake up just one time i'm up for the rest of the night. No bad side effects though and does not leave me feeling hung over in the morning. With this said I like that it does not cause me side effects but i'm going to ask for something to keep me asleep all night next month. O yeah plus my insurance would not cover this med. and was really expensive.

I lost 20 lbs. in 1 month on this medication. I was scared to death I was going to die. I have never felt so bad. I finally talked to my doctor and she said ambien is better for younger people. I wish I had known. I have had an upper GI, a trip to the ER, a colonoscopy, a CAT scan, an MRI and multiple tests run trying to find the cause of my poor health. I found it...AMBIEN! I know people who take it and do fine. It just didn't work for me.

If you take it and do things after taking it, you may not remember what you did.  You might drive, but have NO memory of it.  You have NO control over yourself after taking the medication.  I would advise anyone who takes it for the first time to be sure and have someone else there to monitor you.  Have them ask you questions the next day.  This may seem simplistic, but if you do something, you will NOT remember it.  It is as if it never happened!  I KNOW.

Sooooowhy are they getting us hooked .. are they getting a kick back ...also i requested a sleep study test to see why my mind would not slow down long enough for me to go to sleep ...hey her they come with an ambian and a glass of water ...who's getting the good out of ths med until someone really gets hurt  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/8/2009 7:43:05 AM	I suffer from severe insomnia and this medication has been the only one I get any sleep with.  I tried several other prescriptions before Ambien, I take the 12.5 CR version, and it makes a world of difference.  I would say at least 85% of the time I cannot fall asleep on my own and if I do, I never stay asleep for more than an hour.  Ambien provides a full nights rest.  There are side effects, minimal in my opinion, but for me almost anything is better than not sleeping.  I experience a quite hightened sense of hunger about 30 mins after I take it.  Also, I usually cannot recall my actions from about an hour after I take it to the time I go to sleep the next day. I also have seen a marked decrease in my ability to remember things.  Not so bad as to where I would discontinue use, but that only my opinion.  For people with SEVERE insomnia I would highly recommend this medication, if your situation is only mild to moderate I would suggest exhausting all other options first, it's always nice to avoid side effects when possible.

Falling asleep can take up to 1.5 hours.  Ambien at 5mg didn't work very well but I am now taking 10mg and I take it approximately 1 hour before bedtime and have no problem falling asleep and if I wake up in the night it is now only once a night instead of every 1.5-2 hours.  I'm very happy with the results of this drug.

I took 1/2 of a 10mg last night and will get off this stuff no matter how many nights it takes.  Do NOT take this drug lightly.  It is addictive.

I've had some slight memory loss but nothing of relevance.  I have to say to those that are taking any sleep aid and then getting behind the wheels of a car, crashing and then blaming the medication is a fool.  If you don't know any better than to take a pill and get into bed... you shouldn't be taking anything, not even an aspirin.  All medications have some form of side effects from mild to severe and truly does vary from person to person.  Bottom line for those who don't know better... learn to be responsible!

It is the only way I can fall asleep.  You must take it, get in bed, and turn off the lights.  If I try to read etc. after taking it, I might go to the kitchen to get a snack. I know I am snacking at the time, but won't remember it in the am until I see the plate next to the bed. I believe the part of the brain that would normally keep me from snacking is the first to &quot;turn off&quot;.  Also eating before taking it slows down the effectiveness.  Best taken on an empty stomach.

I had a few drinks one night, and mistakenly took an Ambien the next morning. I wonder if this could affect my alcohol level the next day 10hrs after my last drink?

The problem is I wake up about four fairly consistently. In the past, I also used Ambien CR and after lengthy usage, I had serious memory problems.I could not remember what I did the night before and at time when I was driving, I could not remember which exit to take. I do not recommend this drug for daily use but I think it's OK if you have breaks between doses.

I tried that because many times if I've had a glass of wine or a beer at night that I have trouble sleeping.  Although I sleep through the night, it has caused me to lose memory (I've answered texts and emails without remembering the next day, for example.)  I'd advise others to not take it every night, but maybe every other night or only when you are having serious trouble sleeping.  Also, be sure you are in bed when you take it.  I've gotten very dizzy and in a dream-like state if I'm awake on the drug.  If you take it for a week straight, you won't be able to go to sleep naturally as it is very habit forming.

I was rescued by the Police Department and taken to the hospital. I have no memory of anything until mid day the following day. I did several other odd things that I don't remember and will never taken the drug again.  I am surprised at how dangerous this drug is and is still easily prescribed and for long periods of time.  I have not taken Ambien for 90 days, still have trouble sleeping.  I think the drug should be removed from the market.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	overit, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	3	5	1	Female	35-44	3/11/2009 9:51:37 PM	My fiance has driven to a friends' house approx. 2 miles away, in the middle of the night with no memory of it the following day. This is an addictive drug, I am shocked at how doctors dispense it so freely and repeatedly for years, though it's supposed to be used on a short term basis. 
Difficulty Falling Asleep	TPruitt95, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/11/2009 1:24:13 PM	I have been taking this drug since Apr 08 (nearly 1 year) I have had some experiences.  Mostly eating when I don't know that I have until I wake up in the morning and see the bowl/plate beside my bed empty then I have a vague memory of eating perhaps cereal.  I did once pull my 8 year old daughter's tooth and not remember it.  Thank goodness I'm a female and I haven't tried peeing in the closet..yet. LOL.  It does, however, help me sleep and that is a big deal for me. It does make you feel weird after you take it.  This is a the main sign it is time to close your eyes and go to sleep.  As soon as you take it, please hit the bed...it only takes about 10 minutes for you to start feeling the effects of this medication. I can't fall asleep at night by myself.  My mind will not quit working for me to relax and do it on my own.  I take 10mg per night.  I started off splitting the pill but realized it wasn't working.  I would wake up usually around 4:00 AM and stay up the rest of the night.  That was aggravating for me to do.  Over all I like this medication and it helps me.  My doctor only gives me one refill so I call in every other month for a new prescription.  I haven't asked but I assume it is because this is a narcotic.

I have threatened divorce if he dont stop taking it. Talk about doing stupid things. He has got up and peed in our closet, all over the bathroom, sliced his toe almost all the way through, burned things in our firepit that were not meant to be burned and were not garbage either,  reached into the fire pit with his bear hands to flip the wood, burning him self, fell asleep sitting up in the swimming pool,  he act like a drunken fruitcake, he calls people in the middle of the night, ex. my sons football coachs wife whom we did not even know on a personal level.  so many more things and he dont remember any of it.  And since he started taking this medication his memory has declined dramaticlu.  I hate it!!!!

Difficulty Falling Asleep	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	2/24/2009 4:25:39 AM	I made a pretty big mistake when I initially started taking this pill. I was prescribed ambien 10mg, and I was nervous to take all 10mg, so I'd split the pill in half.As soon as I would take it, I would feel like someone hit me over the head... dizzy, exhausted, confused. Then, 4-5 hours later, I would wake up very, very alert. My warning is: do NOT split or crush the pill!! BIG mistake!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	RelitzM, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	2/24/2009 12:46:24 AM	While the medication had helped me to fall asleep in the first week of taking the medication it has proven harder to be effective here in my third month. I have come to notice side effects which are affecting my life in very complicating ways. One of the slighter side effects I am having is memory loss or trouble focusing thoughts. I will lose my thought nearly every sentence I speak. The most severe and disturbing side effect I have is hallucination. When I take my medication at bedtime and am unable to sleep immediately I begin to see things moving in my room. The closet doors open and close by themselves (not literally) in my mind. My plant will also sway back and forth and stretch itself longer and wider (again in my mind). The longer I stay awake, the worse the hallucinations become. In turn I become frightned and severly depressed in the night. Overall, I believe the medication to be very effective for 1-2 weeks. However, I have been taking it three months and my tolerance is built but dosage hasn't gone up so that is why my side effects are presenting themselves. While I was able to fall asleep quickly I was not affected by the hallucionations.
Difficulty Falling Asleep	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	2/23/2009 4:06:34 PM	I've noticed that I experience extreme ataxia and oftentimes after I take Ambien it is almost as if I am drunk. I do things that I have no memory of the next day. Also, it says that it is meant for 7/8 hours of sleep, but I'm still exhausted after 10.  I have absolutely no falling asleep though, and I don't wake up anymore, so it's doing its job I guess. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Marchia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	2/22/2009 8:36:24 PM	I have been taking Ambien (then the generic version) for about 6 years.  In the beginning it worked great. However, I now only get between 3-4 hours of sleep each night even with the drug and feel zoned out most of the next day.  I started taking Ambien because I was diagnosed with Rheumatiod Arthritis 20 yrs ago and started having trouble sleeping because of the pain from RA.  In the past couple years, I started having difficulty with my memory but passed it off as getting older.  I also started getting up during the night and eating without remembering it.  I now strongly suspect these issues are all related to Ambien.  I have tried to stop taking it cold turkey.  I have gone for two full days without sleep.  I start feeling so wiped out, I would go back on it.  I have read some of the other comments and plan to try weaning myself off of it by reducing the dosage by cutting the pills in half. I feel like I'm trapped in a perpetual cycle now and don't like it. I caution anyone to carefully consider whether the long-term problems are worth the temporary relief...and it is temporary!!

I started at 5mg for a month then went to 10mg now for over 3 years.  I've taken holidays from it for 3-10 days with extreme difficulty getting to sleep.  My MD said to take it with clonazepam but I haven't done that yet.  To scared I won't wake up.  I have noticed that I do have episodes of amnesia the next day.  My husband says I did this or that.  heck if I remember!  Thankfully it has never been driving or eating at night.  Mainly it has been conversations that he says that we have and I don't remember.  This medication does help me to loosen up for intimacy.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	LiteCol, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	65-74	2/2/2009 9:26:03 AM	I began with this drug 10 or 12 years ago, taking .5 mg for the first few years, then 10 mg for the last many years. During part of this time, I lived alone.  Ambien had such an amnesic effect on me that I would awake many mornings to find upon entering the kitchen that I had gotten up, cooked a full meal, and eaten it.  Even then I had no memory, and I would examine the cookware to see what I had cooked and eaten.  Usually, it was a big, full meal. Ambien caused me to be very hungry, and it had the amnesic effect. So why did I take it for so long? It WORKED!  With it, I was able to sleep despite my back pain. I found nothing else strong enough.  Why did I quit Ambien? Because during my amnesic state, I became ugly (not abusive) to my wife.  I spoke to her angrily, and I was very obstinate, I am told. So I weaned myself off Ambien over a two-week period and had no problems with withdrawal, neither physical nor psychological.  I just could not sleep.  I am retired, and I was accustomed to getting (with Ambien) about 10 hours per night.  That changed from 10 to as little as one and a half hours per night, but usually more like four to six hours, so that I hae a continuous sleep deficit which dulls me during the day.  Than at night, I cannot sleep.  Because the insomnia has gotten so bad, I am about to go back on some sleeping aid, maybe Ambien. Overall, I was happy with Ambien because it worked, but the  amnesia and becoming unlike myself and ugly to my wife really took a lot out of me.

I take about 1/4 of 10mg almost every night. Early on I noticed that I could not remember what I read the night before, now, I can remember. I still think that I suffer from periodic short term memory loss. I have gone weeks without taking it, using a sleep noise machine instead, but easier just to take a bite of a pill. I never did anything wierd while on it. I think it is great.

I am asleep within 5 minutes of taking it which is a good thing, but I wake up about 2 hours later to go to the bathroom and have a problem with going back to sleep. I do have very good sexy dreams on this, so no complaints with this side effect.  I have had a headache for the past 9 weeks and not sure if this is from the Ambien or something else. I've been taking this med for about 1 year.

I would take this drug to help with my insomnia.  However I never would sleep.  I'd end up in a weird 1/2 sleep state where i didnt remember anything the next day.  Id eat 1/2 of what was in my kitchen and not remember, i'd actually eat something finish it and not remember five minutes later so I'd go and get something to eat  again not knowing ive been eating.  I even tried to drive once, backing up into my mailbox not even remembering it the next day.  I was talking and interacting with my boyfriend fine, he was even in the car but i have no knowledge of this.  In fact we live together and at times we'd talk and 10 minutes later we talk again and i wouldnt remember the last convrsation.  He did not know what was wrong with me.  This happened for about 5 days straight.  I kept taking the medication because I actually thought i was sleeping on it! He didn't know i was on medication but the more continuous odd nights in a row and the worsening of the nights put him at alarm. He finally ended up recording me the last night thats how i even realised that i wasnt sleeping after all and this drug was having potentially serious side effects.  Just take with caution b4 you know how you react to this medication. Also let someone know that you are trying an new medication and the things they should be aware of.  Such as excessive eating, Saying something that doesn't make sense then kinda snapping out of it.(like you are 1/2 asleep but seem totally awake!)

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Michael, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	19-24	1/11/2009 10:20:09 PM	Users beware, many people may think it is rare to have Hallucinations while on this product but I can after doing many studies on this drug I have found that on average every 7/10 people will at one point have hallucinations.  Most hallucinations you will wake up and not remember a thing, for example a phone call or eating or in a rare case even driving a car (scary to think but it happens to some). But on average 1/15 people will have a full recollection of their hallucinations.  Best word of advise to people thinking about taking this drug is hide your car keys and fall asleep directly after taking the medicine.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	pama42, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	1/9/2009 9:02:29 AM	I've had trouble sleeping due to stress for the last 7 yrs. Ambien is the only thing that lets me sleep. I've tried weening off of it by taking 5mg insead of 10mg, but I just end up waking up and taking another 5mg in the middle of the night anyway. So I just go ahead and take 10mg, if I don't I don't sleep. I make sure I'm in bed before I take it. I have never had any of the crazy side effects I've was worried about, just some minor groggyness the next day. Don't play w/ this drug and don't ever take more than 10mg.

I am extremely addicted to, and have been on this drug for 6 YEARS! My dosage has gone up to nearly 20mg a night. I have fallen, gained weight, etc. At least I sleep now.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	kitty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	12/29/2008 9:55:08 PM	Ambien 10mg did its job of putting me to sleep, however it was the next morning that i had trouble with. After approx 10 days of use i began to have a lot of what felt like muscle pain behind my eyes. I felt like i was in a fog during the day, dizziness, fatigue. i though i had a sinus infection.  After and emergancy room visit the Dr gave me antibotics and a nasal spray to help with the pain in my face.  Nothing would relieve the pain. Until i decided to discontinue the ambien just to see. Ambient was the only new medication i had added to the daily meds that i take.  I have been off the ambien for 3 nights now.  The feeling in my head diminished immediately I feel so much better.  I feel like im detoxing myself, but the change is remarkable.  I dont think i will be taking anymore ambien. i will try the otc advil or tylenol pm meds..

This time I was put on Zolpidem and it DOES NOT seem to work as well. Also, since I satrted taking it, I have been having mild to somewhat severe abdominal pain. I have only been taking this for about a week now. I will make sure that I call my doctor today. Also, I find myself itching a lot, too. Wonder if it cantains a sulfur product.

It has helped a lot. I still have some nights that I don't get much sleep, but some is better than none. You do have to make sure that you get 8 hours of sleep when you take it or it will take a little while to get motivated in the morning. Strongly recommend for people that are having difficulty sleeping.

I was always  waking every hour or so. Now I fall asleep and stay asleep about 5 hours. I have had weird dreams toward morning. I feel a little groggy for the first 2 hours after waking. I took the 10mg. briefly but became very anxious and had panic attacks. MY only concern is now I feel like I cannot sleep without it. Don't really like having to stay on it to sleep. But don't like not sleeping either.

I am finally getting rest and feeling fully rested in the mornings.  I don't want up with a hangover feeling, but I do get so relaxed that I loose my modivation to get going in the morning, but the wears off in about an hour at the most.  Finally I'm able to get a full night's sleep with my husband in the same bed.  I was tired of moving to the couch every night.  I know I will have to get off of it eventually, but worry about what I can replace it when the time comes.  Yes, I have been known to buy stuff of ebay and other web sites that I don't remember, but my husband keeps an eye on my buying and just lets me do it.  THen tells me the next morning what i bought.

This stuff hits hard and your hooked after 3 days. After couple of tension filled nights without it I sleep better without anything and I'm trying to train myself to sleep without meds. Ambien leaves me to hangover and very depressed for about half the next day. It seems to me just something to use temporarily, not a cure. Don't use it every night. 
Other	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	65-74	12/9/2008 1:43:26 AM	Just before bedtime took one pill to aid sleeping with a CPAP machine. I lost all short-term memories from before I took the pill till about noon the next day. The ER Dr doubted that the Ambien could do that, but the coincidence is very strong and the list of symptoms includes lost of memory.My wife said I was confused at first and then somewhat scared as I realized there were more and more things in the house that I didn't remember. My wife was even more scared. About noon (in the ER) I started to be able to form short-term memories that I kept. But at first they were spotty. By the end of the day, everything seems to be fine.

I got dependent on it and couldn't ever sleep without it. It was a four-month nightmare of rebound insomnia. Finally, I quit for good. It took three weeks for me to settle into a proper sleep routine after stopping.    If you are the addictive type, AVOID this medication.IMHO, of course!

I tried to stop taking it but I start again. I don't get a full night sleep any more and sometimes have to take 1-1/2 instead of just 1. I am determined to stop taking it and I will now try weaning myself off it. Hope I can.

I didn't take it every night as I didn't want the dependency. I did take it for about 1 week just about every night. After about 4 days it took 2 (5mgs each) in order for it to work. My insurance company changed on how they pay for name brand drugs so I was forced into the generic. What a nightmare!! I took 1 (which I hadn't taken any sleep meds for months) on the first night; then 1 on the second night. It took forever to far asleep with the generic &amp; left me a complete zombie &amp; idiot!! I would NOT recommend taking the generic at all!!!

I love Ambien (I take generic). It not only helps me fall to sleep, but I don't get the vivid dreams and it even quiets my bladder.  Instead of getting up to go three times a night, I only need to go once towards morning. I can fall back to sleep pretty easily also. I don't take it every night though, I don't want to get dependent.

I was afraid to try it(I've heard all the horror stories),but after 5yrs plus of bad sleeping I did last night. I took it at 7:45 pm,  worked in about an hour. I slept about 5 hrs woke up a couple times was able to get back to sleep, woke up at 6AM, Lots of dreams, but not bad ones like I have with most sleep meds. My advice is take it exactly as prescribed otherwise your asking for trouble. For a hardcore insomniac like me this drug is whats needed, I would describe Lunesta like a rubber hammer and Ambien like a iron one. Respect it and it will work for you. Good luck
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	11/23/2008 12:14:21 AM	I have been taking Ambien for approximately 1 year.  Prior to taking it I was using 800 mg. Ibuprofen and Benadryl or an over-the-counter sleep aid.  When I first started taking it I got 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.  Now I get 5-6 hours but I do not wake up.  It has helped.  Twice I didn't take it and I had horrible nightmares.  I am afraid to stop taking it now. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	11/20/2008 10:56:25 PM	I've been on ambien for a little over two years now to treat my insomnia. you have to make sure you're IN BED when you take it and ready to sleep. for me, there's like a 10-30 minute window of time to fall asleep and if i can't relax before then i start to hallucinate. over the years i've cooked food, driven my car, gone to parties, sent crazy (&amp;embarrassing) texts, all while on ambien. once i woke up with bloody legs from scratching myself so hard. it definitely creates memory loss too. sometimes i'll take it and then forget and take another one 20 minutes later. just take precautions if you're taking this med.. be in bed, HIDE YOUR CELL PHONE!, and maybe have some one else monitor your meds.

This drug is dangerous and should only be given 3 to 7 pills at a time with no refills.

Do not have to take a higher dose, actually can cut back the dose. Maybe not sleeping without it is all mental, but don't want to take the time to find out and be tired while doing so.

It takes effect very quickly (within 15 mins) and if I'm in bed, I'll fall asleep easily every time.  If I stay up, it is somewhat euphoric and would be fun for an addict, but don't plan on sleeping well -- there seems to be a 15 to 45 min window where you can go to sleep.  There is very little tossing and turning and when I wake up, I feel rested about 75% of the time.  The only middle-of-the-night side effect I've noticed is a case of the munchies (you'll want to stop by the fridge on your way back from the bathroom and eat cereal, chocolate, etc.).  Sometimes I'll wake up after only 5 or 6 hrs of sleep, which is ok because my body is rested, but at 5 AM there's nothing to do.  Have mild fatigue/headache the next morning about 2 out of 7 days and it goes away by mid-day.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	10/21/2008 6:15:49 PM	I was on Ambien (and then generic) for almost 5 years. During that time I experienced hallucinations and MANY memory loss situations; often I would call/text people and say emberassing things in the messages...things I had thought while not on the drug, but would never want to say to someone.  Eventually, I did become tolerant to the drug (even though they claim to be non-habit-forming) and found myself taking more and more, or having a glass of wine before taking one (to increase the effectiveness)...although at the time I would have NEVER admitted I was addicted.  The nights I wouldn't have one, I couldn't sleep.  Finally one night I was upset over work and a fight with my boyfriend, so I took two 10mg pills &quot;so I could get a good nights' sleep&quot;  The next thing I remember, I woke up in the ER with my best friend (and roomate) telling me she had to call the ambulance because I took an entire bottle of extra strength tylenol, the rest of the Ambien (nearly-new bottle), and other over-the-counter meds we had in the house.  I was in the ICU for 48 hours because the doctors couldn't get my heart rate regulated from all the medications in me.  I had NO intentions of suicide nor have I ever been &quot;at risk&quot; for doing something like that...I just couldn't sleep!  I hope this drug is pulled from the market immediately because it IS addictive and it has SERIOUS side-effects that are potentially life-threatening.  Do not take, nor let loved ones take, this drug!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	10/17/2008 1:26:51 AM	This is the only sleep medication that works for me. I take 10mg, but it is only effective 2-3 times a week, with breaks in between. Because I had issues with memory loss and doing odd things while on it, I have to make sure I go to bed immediately and do not allow myself to get up. Sometimes I still get up and find myself having sent odd text messages throughout the night, which I have no memory of. It can put me to sleep like a baby if I take it and hop in bed, but if I take it and continue to stay up doing things, I will not find myself tiring, only acting strange.Also, this drug is addictive. I've found myself a bit addicted to the stoned feeling I have on it, and the fact that when I sleep while taking it I never remember my dreams.  (Every other morning I wake up with strange dreams from the night before and a headache. If another drug doesn't work for me, I will go to a sleep lab.)Overall, it's extremely effective... But there are many precautions I suggest taking while on it.

For the last six months, I am feeling depressed, no energy during the day, still can't get 7-8 hours of sleep.  Also, I am finding that I forget such things as &quot;did I take my other meds&quot;, or, remembering instructions both from reading them or remembering what someone tells me.

The first night I took it I took 5mg and I ended up ordering a lot of stuff online but couldn't fall asleep. The second night I decided to take the full 10mgs in hopes of going to sleep because by then it was well after 3am. My poor hubby had to work at 8 the next morning. After I took the pill and it had a chance to kick in I was started seeing black shadowy figures in my room. I told him to turn our clock radio on because they wanted to dance. Because he had to work he refused. After awhile of fighting over it because the &quot;people&quot; would get mad...I started singing at the top of my lungs at 4am so they could dance.  I remember it, but it was like a dream. Plus it made me more willing...I eventually got to sleep, but the hallucinations were insane.  My brother had the same problem with the hallucinations and a friend of mine was getting up in the middle of the night and driving to the stores and buying $100's of waffles, candy, and ice cream and wouldn't remember it, but would find it sitting on her kitchen counter when she woke up the next morning. Word of advice, if you do take it, hide your car keys and credit cards and make sure there is someone there to keep you from doing something you shouldn't. You could end up bankrupt. And watch for the hallucinations. They don't say much about those when you get the drug. Eventually though it helped with the sleeping....just had the other problems.

My dx was OCD and chronic insomnia. I am on 15mg and also use flexril for muscle spasm. I sometimes eat, dance etc, and have no memory of it. Unfortunately, without this medication, along with Cymbalta,and hydrocodone, I would not be able to get out of bed or work at all.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female		10/3/2008 8:21:56 PM	For people with a history of drug dependence ambien is a dangerous choice for sleep. Tolerance to this drug builds quickly, and taking to many can be fatal.  Ambien produced somewhat of a euphoric feeling, unfortunatly i liked the feeling so much i would take it at other times besides at night. I thought I was thinking clearly and rationally but actually acting very strange and out of character. Frequent morning headaches and blackouts occur when abused.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/30/2008 5:30:49 PM	I have always had trouble falling asleep and suffer horrible nightmares when sleep eventually does come. I have tried many different things and ambien is the only thing that has really helped. It helps me fall asleep fast and, although the nightmares arent completely gone, I can usualy sleep through them comfortably. I take 10mg once a night and the only side effect has been occational memory loss, generally when I forget Ive had a glass or 2 of wine earlier and take it when I shouldnt have.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/29/2008 11:42:45 AM	I was prescribed Ambien a couple of years ago, and have been on it ever since.  I am given the generic though, and have no issues, I would rather pay $10 than $40!  I take 5mg on some nights, and the full 10mg on other nights....I take it about 30 min. before bed.  I have experienced some memory loss.  I have ordered things online, cleaned the house, and had sex w/ the hubby and not remembering the next day...funny how that happens...overall, this drug has saved my quality of sleep life...I am a very light sleeper, and this is the only thing to keep me asleep...some friends make comments, but they don't realize how lucky they are to be able to lay down w/ their spouse, and go right to sleep...for the past year, in addition to Ambien, I have had to sleep in another room b/c the hubby's &quot;breathing/snoring&quot; has kept me awake, even while on Ambien!  This is a good drug, and I will stay on it as long as I need to :)  Never been sick, nervous, or any of the other side effects...just a little of the memory loss...

The best part is that I'm not groggy when I wake up.  I would recommend this drug to anyone who has trouble falling or staying asleep.  It's also not very addictive where I'm concerned.  I take it on days that I have got to bed early for school, and I don't take it any other time.  It helps me to get my sleep back on schedule. Ambien gets 2 thumbs up from this nursing student!

Although it helps me to sleep, I find that the dosage (20 mgs) does not seem sufficient for me to have sleep for more than 5-6 hours.

Be cautious if you are wanting to remember something- I would have gladly given up the good night's sleep for the memory.

Have had trouble sleeping since childhood, was diagnosed with a life-threatening (unrelated) illness and given Ambien to help sleep through the crises.  Five years later, I still take it, now nightly.  I have never felt better, it's amazing how quality of life improves with sleep.  Took 5 years to build a tolerance and need to raise from 5 to 10 mg.  Definitely can do things I don't remember if someone engages me in conversation (or otherwise) during the night, but have never done anything I wouldn't normally do and have dealt fine with minor nighttime crises (teenager waking, etc).  Never ever ever stopping this med.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	optichick, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/15/2008 1:02:24 AM	I took this for a while, found myself sleepwalking into the kitchen every night, making food. Sometimes i'd wake up next day &amp; find stuff in the microwave! My husband, soon to be X, was awaken by me every night!! I would go into the bedroom, wake him up &amp; start screaming @ him!  He wanted to kill me, as he has to be up @ 5:30 a.m.!!I would have no memory of it!! He didnt believe the fact that I couldnt remember! I would also fall asleep on the toilet!!  Wanted to put a lock on the fridge, &amp; a camera!! you will sleep, just not know what you do! I went back to taking melatonin, had to take 9mg., but it wore off due to stress. Dr. just put me on flurazepam (Dalmane) see how it works! Think I may have to go back to ambien 12.5 xr.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	8/7/2008 11:11:38 PM	I have always had trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep.  This drug worked wonders for me, and I never felt groggy the next day like I do with Trazodone.With 10mg I found that I was doing things I didn't remember the next day, but not so much with 5mg.  The 5mg still worked fine so I stayed with 5mg.  Better to take this before going to bed so you go to sleep otherwise it is more likely you'll have short term memory loss / doing strange things.Another poster said this drug is like a truth serum, and I agree.  It really makes you turn off the part of your brain that controls whether you should or should not do something.  I accidentally broke up with my girlfriend when she called me and woke me up in the middle of the night.  We were having some problems that I probably should have tried to work through, but I went straight for what was on my mind instead.  Another poster said they would wake up in the middle of the night and eat food, and i've done that too although I never ended up with a weight problem.Don't drive or anything like this when on this drug.  On 10mg sometimes I would lose my balance - another reason to use smaller doses if possible.Having said all of this, this drug worked the best for me.  I've tried for a few years to get on a better sleep cycle using natural methods with only modest success.  I worry about taking drugs for long periods so I am still trying natural methods.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping		4	5	2			7/25/2008 11:18:56 AM	I take Ambien CR and it really helps you fall asleep fast, but it seems to be addictive. I am not sure if I have a mental addiction or a real addiction. It seems like my body NEEDS it to fall asleep. Who knows if I am just psyching myself out though. When I took regular Ambien I would hallucinate so I switched to CR. I don't have hallucinations anymore, but I have found myself to do odd things like walk around the house looking for something to do. I would use caution when using this drug.

No weird side effects like those I've heard reports of -- I just wish it worked better.

I was seeing double, could not focus and thought I thought many people were in the room with me (I was alone). It was like an out of body experience.  Not sure why this happened.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	penguin, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/22/2008 10:08:52 PM	I've taken Ambien as needed for several months. It works great, puts me to sleep quickly and keeps me asleep for 6 hours. You do need to take it when you are going to bed. If you take it an hour before bed, you'll feel like someone slipped rufees in your 5th margarita at the bar. It is not physically addictive. Once I stopped taking it, I could still fall asleep. It IS emotionally addictive (because it works like magic), so you have to watch yourself. I once took this 4 hours after having a 3 beers and the next day I felt very disoriented, had a terrible headache, and couldn't put words together to make a sentence. I thought I was going to have a stroke. It taught me to follow the directions on the label. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping		2	2	1			5/17/2008 4:50:15 PM	This is the worst drug i have ever taking. It leaves me feeling tired the whole next day. If you miss a dose you become very dependent on it and cant sleep after that. It makes you see things and eventually doesnt even work after you start taking it. So its almost better off not taking anything at all to sleep if this one is going to drag you down all day anyways.

As long as it is taken in the correct dose right before bed, it works wonders. Keep it somewhere locked up tight so kids don't get it and have a nice bedtime ritual like reading or tv and all is good!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Danette, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	5/15/2008 11:20:15 AM	I have a had a dramatic event in my life and could not sleep at night or anytime.  I have used Ambien Controlled Release, but my insurance won't pay for it.  So, we shall see if the generic one works.

Other	eqizna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/12/2008 4:30:16 PM	I didn't have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, but I would sleep for 10hrs and be exhausted all day.  My doctor prescribed me 5mg of Ambien.  I cut them in half and take them in bed after I've brushed my teeth, changed, etc.  Within about 15-20minutes I'm out and I will sleep a good 8hrs.  I can still wake up to noise if I need to.  I haven't dreamt in over 2yrs and with the Ambien, I dream every night and wake up so refreshed.  Also, I don't take it every night to cut down on the dependence and losing effectiveness.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping		4	4	2			5/12/2008 11:07:29 AM	I have no trouble falling asleep with this medication, but I feel so groggy when I wake up and want to take naps during the day. I was taking Lunesta and it was wonderful, but I started having trouble with my insurance paying for Lunesta and tried Ambien. I would much rather use the Lunesta. I woke up much easier and refreshed.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	MJB, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/6/2008 4:18:04 PM	I am IN LOVE with this drug! I was at my wit's end - sleeping hours upon hours and never feeling rested. For years, I needed 9 hours of sleep in order to wake up naturally (without an alarm) - and I never really felt &quot;refreshed.&quot;  I got a prescription for Ambien and was a bit hesitant, so started with 1/2 a pill.  I have been taking 1/2 a pill each night before bed for the last 2 months.  I cannot say enough good things.  I am down to 6 hours of sleep with natural waking and I feel rested!  Can I sleep without Ambien? Absolutely, but the QUALITY of my sleep is SO significantly better with it.  I have NOT experienced any sleep walking or memory loss or anything else.  I love it!

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	natefp, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	19-24	4/27/2008 11:37:04 PM	At first Ambien was a miracle drug. I would fall asleep quickly and wake up refreshed 7-8 hours later without an alarm! After taking Ambien for the last 5 months however, I now find myself waking up multiple times during the night and hallucinating more and more - it makes magic mushrooms from college seem like nothing. If I mix it with even a tiny bit of alcohol (1/2 glass of wine or less), I have very vivid nightmares/ night terrors. The side effect that has bothered me the most however, is when I wake up occasionally and discover that I have taken 15-25mg more ambien without even remembering doing so. Short term, it's great, long term - not my favorite thing.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	leftoverkarma, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Male	45-54	4/27/2008 12:51:07 PM	I have had mixed results.  Sometimes it just wont get me to sleep at all and often when it does I wake up several hours later.  Last night something rather frightening happened.  I woke around 11:30 AM.  That is much later than I had planned.  I thought it funny that my bedroom light was on.  I went to the kitchen and found more oddities.  Apparently I had made myself a bowl of ice cream topped with Tabasco sauce and Ambient Sprinkles!  Im still feeling a bit numb at the moment (12:45 PM) and quite concerned.  I had had no alcohol the previous night.  What bothers me the most is that I got up (sleepwalking) and took more of the drug.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	claimsRus, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	45-54	4/26/2008 4:20:03 PM	My wife has told me it is like a &quot;truth serum&quot; that over the last 2 nights I have let out on a verbal tirade of sorts.  My counselor calls it the &quot;ambien defense&quot; but it seems more serious than that.  I can't think of any pent up emotions I against my wife, but still to find out the next day that I've said some things which were unkind is troubling.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	KB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/21/2008 10:45:05 AM	I have had sleep problems for years and the Ambien has really helped me. I take 5mg and usually fall asleep within 1/2 hour. I have about 4-5 hours of good sleep, then I'll sit right up and feel wide awake. Usually I can fall back asleep. I just wish the Ambien lasted longer. Do not drink any alcohol at all if you know your gonna take ambien that night. I would recommend you not take it until your already in bed. Don't get up again unless you really have to. I've taken it and then gotten back up and find myself banging into walls, and feeling very disorientated, almost drunk. I've occasionally had double vision while watching tv in bed. Alcohol can make you have really weird side effects so definitely don't drink at all if your gonna be taking this med. I had one experience where I drank one wine cooler around 9pm. I took an Ambien hours later, after midnight, and was acting very weird(according to my husband and sister). I was laughing over everything, and having odd conversations with my sister and husband that I barely remember. I couldn't stand without feeling like I was swaying back and forth. I was banging into everything, and felt almost like I was dreaming. Everything seemed like it was in slow motion. They told me I was standing in the mirror giving myself crazy hair dos and laughing at myself. I made some onion dip that I didn't eat and dropped pretzels all over the floor, made a huge mess. Very out of character for me. This only happened once and I believe it was the alcohol in my system, mixed with the med. Overall, the Ambien has worked great for me. Just take it as directed, don't drink alcohol, and stay in bed. I haven't had any side effects like trying to drive or shopping online with no memory like some of these other people. If only it lasted longer, it truly would be the greatest sleep med ever created. If your having sleep problems, I would definitely recommend this.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Katyinc, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	4/15/2008 8:50:12 PM	Took this pill one night and was up with a headache like I have never had and I only slept 2 hours. Had headache almost all next day, took the pill for one week and went off it, thought I was going to go crazy from the headaches and non sleep again. Went back to Rozerem and am a happy camper finally. Found the med that works for me. Who needs a med that may make you do crazy things in your sleep, that is so dangerous, especialy if left alone at nights, I do crazy enough things while I am awake, don't need added help. This was just not for me.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	4/15/2008 8:36:09 PM	Was on this medication for 7 years.  Would not recommend.  Now I take doxepin and sleep like a baby without all the crazy side effects and addiction.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	4/15/2008 11:30:01 AM	This drug has it's ups and downs... I have to be honest, I have found myself using this drug sometimes for the side effects more so than as a sleeping aid.It's highly addictive, and defintely will knock you out.  Although, if you don't go to bed instantly after taking it, you will experience hullucinations and poor judgement (attempting to drive, driking, taking other narcotics on top of it).I personally have experienced back pains (in between my shoulder blades) the next day, and that alone makes me not want to take it any longer.Definitely DO NOT take while consuming alcohol as you will black out and only intensify the negative side effects
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	4/14/2008 4:32:55 PM	I took Ambien for insomnia, both falling asleep and staying asleep. The Ambien is wonderful helping me fall asleep, but I wake up around 3 am and can't fall back to sleep for several hours! I also have experienced scary side effects, such as not being able to remember ANYTHING from the previous night! I actually bought some things online and didn't remember it until I saw my bank statemnet! This medication also gave me a terrible, piercing headache when I woke up! Definitely not for everyone. I tried Lunesta 3mg and LOVE it! Helps me fall asleep, stay asleep, and no headache!

When I take them with pain killers (oxycontin and percocet), they are unpredictable, wheather they will work as well from day to day.  Also, it makes me go into a kinda like black-out state, comes and goes.  Wish there was something more consistant and interacts better with oxycodoneAt times, it makes me fall out (sleep) for very short periods of time.  Even if I sit up, have a cup of coffee, smoke a cigarette, I awaken from these short &quot;black-outs&quot; with the cigarette burning on my lap or the floor and/or the coffee spilled all over the place.I know, sucks to be me.

Other		1	1	1			4/9/2008 6:46:49 PM	I have only takin ambien once and i slept so hard that i couldn't remeber punching my boyfriend in mouth.  But unlike me my boyfriend takes this drug frequently and is addicted.  when he takes it he never fails asleep. instead he stays awake and tries to drive and talks about some crazy things.  This drug has caused to accidents one which broke my nose.  It has also caused many fights  in our relationship.  When he takes the drug it is like taking care of a severly handicaped child.  i just found out i was pregnant and gave him a choice to stop taking th drug or i was out.  but he is so addicted that i just found out he is sneaking it behind my back! does anybody know what i can do to help him? 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	4/8/2008 2:21:41 PM	My doctor prescribed Ambien for my insomnia.  About the 4th night of taking it, I actually started hallucinating.  It was a lucid hallucination though.  I was fully aware that what I was seeing wasn't real, but it didn't stop the fact that I was seeing it.  It also did not help my sleeping habits.  I was still waking every 2 hours or so and unable to fall asleep easily.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/27/2008 8:03:36 AM	I am so relieved I found a drug that helps me fall asleep and stay asleep. I take this during the day (I work nights) because I was having a hard time sleeping. I had no problems. For everyone who says they took it and had hallucinations and stuff before they went to bed I highly recommend reading the directions that clearly state &quot;take at bedtime&quot; which means take it once you're lying in bed ready to sleep. Close your eyes and you should fall right to sleep. Avoid walking around. This is a drug that causes people to sleep so if you stay awake after you take it, you will feel as though you are dreaming. People really should read the fine print that come with drugs.....

I really don't remember much of that episode.  After that I have had no trouble with it.  It works great, and I fall asleep fast.

Then you feel so good you get up and start doing things that your normal state of mind wont let you do. like over eating, shopping, etc. YOU GET ADDICTED, and wait all day to take this stuff. and then I would break a pill in half for anxiety and use in the middle of the day and function. i am just a mess and dont remember a lot of what i do day or night (even taking extra pills in the middle of the night). And its the only thing my ins will approve, and then i go to another pharmacy and pay another 60. for another 30 days to supplement. what a mess this gets you into!

Other	Birmingham, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	3/23/2008 2:21:32 AM	My doctor prescribed this drug to me after I began having axiety dreams and waking frequently during the night while taking Lexapro for GAO.  I fell asleep within 15 minutes and slept soundly for 5-6 hours without memory of any dreams.  I have had none of the bad side effects described by some of the other posting, although I do feel a slight imbalance if I should get up for some reason during the night.I take generic Zolpidem (10 mg.) For some reason since my last refill a week ago, it is suddenly not working.  I lay awake for hours after taking it.  There have been no other changes in my medication or routine.  I've heard of counterfeit drugs getting into the supply of reputable pharmacy chains and I'm wondering if this could possibly be the cause.  It doesn't seem plausible that I would build up a tolerance to the drug overnight.

I did, however, not remember a few hours but I later looked on my computer log and found out I had gone to interesting websites and bought houndreds of dollars of stuff online.  I first got suspitious that something was up when guys started calling me.  I had an online dating profile that I hadn't been on for a while, but I found out that I had been talking to people on it.  I have no memory of any of this, but my computer log doesn't lie.  This drug didn't just not work, it also screwed with my life.

I was told by relatives to be careful after i take it, because it takes effect after about a half an hour.  That was not the case for me.  I t still took forever for me to fall asleep, and i was still waking up about 4 times a night.  I am now off ambien and still having trouble sleeping.  T aking this drug was a terrible waste of time and money. 
Other		3	4	2			3/13/2008 5:42:50 PM	I'm glad to see others have had similar experiences as I have with this drug.i thought i was going crazy! The first night I took it I swear when i looked at my closet my clothes were moving in a wave like motion it freaked me out so i turned over and my curtains were doing the same thing! when i got up to go to the bathroom i was extremely disoriented almost as if i was drunk and knocking into things. the patterns on the bathroom wall were swirling andd changing. i had a very disturbing dream that night and i woke up at exactly 3 oclock and couldnt fall back asleep the next night i had even worse hallucinations (smuges on my window looked like dancing people? ect.) i sent weird text messages that i have no recolection of and again i woke up at exactly 3 oclock and never fell back asleep. i wouldnt recommend this drug :/
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	LoLo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/13/2008 4:59:31 PM	Okay I thought I was alone. Ambien is very addictive. I recieved a 30 day RX for Ambien 7 days ago and my RX is gone! I remembered taking one pill before bed and falling right to sleep but my fiancee says I have called him and talked for hours about random things and he has even heard me taking MORE pills. I had 4 pills left before I went to bed last night and now I have none left. I went to the DR today and I got an RX for Seroquel...I hope I wake up tomorrow. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	19-24	3/11/2008 2:28:19 AM	My first night on this med resulted in me being semi aware with extreme visual hallucinations, including the curtains moving and sprouting faces that laughed, bowls from popcorn on the dresser becoming 2 bowl men fighting, a lamp becoming a dancing lady, and my wife having 4 eyes among other things, needless to say she was highly displeased and told me never to take it again(she's a nurse).  But I'm a stuborn man, I thought if i took it right when I wanted to sleep it might help(the night before I was up for maybe 20minutes before bed), and I had just as intense hallucinations, including watching television and carrying on conversations I don't remember.  I will not be taking this drug again, and I recommend discussing this drug's possible side effects with your doctor before starting this or any other drug.

I felt confused, &quot;unreal&quot;, could not concentrate, and began to feel jittery.  I had to call my doctor and stop the medication.  The side effects remained far longer than I would have thought.  I would never recommend this medication after these disconcerting side effects.  They frightened me badly.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	thoughtplum, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/2/2008 1:04:34 AM	I go between Lunesta and Ambien depending of when I go to bed and when I need to get up.  I sleep less with Ambien and it takes effect on me within 14 minutes.  I use it when I go to bed later and need to get up rested earlier (4-5 hours).  Lunesta takes effect within about 26 minutes.  I use this when I go to bed earlier and can sleep later (5-6 hours).  Love them both for a good night's rest.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	KT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/27/2008 8:14:11 PM	I've taken Ambien for 1 1/2 years.  Can not sleep without it, but it takes me 2-3 hours to fall asleep with it.  I have odd dreams.  I wake up in the morning to find that I have called people (my mother in law called me once to check on me because she didn't think I would remember talking to her) emailed people and shopped online.  I have no idea I'm doing these things until I check my &quot;sent&quot; e-mail, phone call log or bank account.  My daughter and husband have had to escort me to bed because I can't get myself there due to being unsteady on my feet.  I also have problems with my memory.  I take 15mg per night.  Ambien is absolutely addictive.  I worry and fret about my prescrition running out and them not giving me more.  I have never been addicted to anything before but I do find myself looking forward to Ambien.  I used to nap before Ambien but I can not even get 1/2 hour sleep without it now.

I would say it is highly addictive, since the choice of taking the pill and sleeping versus not taking and not sleeping (how many days would the &quot;rebound effect&quot; last?) is an issue I'm faced with.  I've taken the Ambien CR 12.5 mg for five years now.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping		4	5	4			2/21/2008 8:51:56 PM	well ive been takin ambien for a few months now and found that at first the drug worked great. see i suffer from migraines and anxiety along with depression. so like i was sayin at first it was heaven. then it got to being where i was waiting all day to take the pill at night because it got rid of my pain and actually gave me a tremendous boost of energy! so after awhile it keep me up all night! then i would have to break a pill in half to get some sleep. before you knew it i was takin the stuff during the day! i got up to 4 tabs a day and now i get these horrible headaches when i get up and feel lost all time. wakin up having sex and not remembering it at all. my gf loves it be its pretty crazy to not remember having sex. when i ran out of the drug i had tremendous side affects and was up for two days then finally i went to the hospital and got some more. i have a presciption for it and i really need to get off of this. this is the worst experience of addiction in my life any body else have the same problem?

I was subscribed this by an eye doctor after an accident. I was told to sleep sitting up and was given this to help. Well it didn't, the Oxycodone they gave me worked way better. It also gave me really bad stomach aches and caused slight RLS symptoms. I've had Insomnia for a while now and have tried every OCD med thats out there, nothing works. I've even tried the new one called Unisom. It actually worked until I got used to it. I've been given Lunesta to try now. Hope its better.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/12/2008 8:59:15 PM	I have been on Ambien for 3 years and sleep great with no side effects.  I was on Xanax before that and it took too long to take effect.  I had to take it 2-3 hours before I wanted to go to sleep.  Not with Ambien, I take it about 1/2 hour to an hour before I want to go to sleep then either read or watch TV in bed. I sleep a good 5-7 hours and wake up with no grogginess.

Enough so my wife took me to the ER. Slured speach, double vision, could not stand or walk, confussion, short term memory loss. Very scary for both of us. I had taken the Ambien exactly as prescribed by my physican.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	mrseyl2, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	2/5/2008 4:58:45 PM	My mother-in-law took Ambien for few years and was conerned about waking in the middle of the night,going down to the kitchen and eating. Then last May, during one of her episodes, she fell down the stairs, injuring herself, and after a four week hospital stay she required an additional 3 month stay in rehab. After convincing her Ambien could be the cause of her night visits to the kitchen we thought the first fall scared her enought to stop taking it. She started seeing a new DR and after telling him she had trouble sleeping he prescrobed Ambien. Last week she fell down the stairs again but doesn,t remember it.  She is in Intensive care and so severely injured this time it is likely she will not survive. I think this medication should be restricted to people over a certain age (?)She is 80.

But the most scary thing was I was going to work in this state and not remembering how I got there. I knew I needed to stop taking this when I set myself on fire and suffered 1st,2nd, and 3rd degree burns on my arm and hand, I look at the scar on my hand every day and thank GOD I no longer take this drug I hope that some day they will take it off the market..

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	ashy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	2/1/2008 4:25:48 PM	My daughter was prescibed this for insomnia.  They told her not to take it unless someone was with her.  Her bf came to visit her at school and in the middle of the night rolled over and she was missing.  He found her outside the apartment crunched up and asleep by the front door.  When he tried to get her inside she was yelling at him.  He got her into the living room and she finally woke up and did not know that anything had happened and was a little freaked out.  She was also very groggy the next day. She never took it again and her doctor just put her on Trazadone for insomnia.  I hope it works.  My cousin also took ambien and was walking around in the middle of the night eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and having to change her sheets everyday because she woke up with food everywhere. She stoppped taking it as well.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/31/2008 3:58:52 AM	This medication was just one other med in a cocktail trying to manage my (somewhat) uncontrolled bipolar disorder.  I am not sure if I had an idiosyncratic reaction or if it reacted badly with my other medications, but just one night of taking a very low dose sent me to the ER.  I had a hallucinogenic panic attack complete with compulsive suicidal behavior.  I wish I could find something to help my constant insomnia.

All in all ambien has been really helped me sleep and I find that anyone who takes the drug responsibly would agree. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	HipChick1961, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	1/30/2008 11:16:25 PM	I've been taking Ambien for about 5 yrs. for chronic insomnia and night terror/nightmares. It has been a lifesaver for me but it IS a tricky drug. Take it when you are actually ready to go to sleep and you are already IN BED. Don't get back up!!! or you will be walking around the house eating, having weird conversations with your significant other about things that you would probably not be talking about if you were actually aware of what you were saying. Ambien makes you really chatty! If I take it and don't go right to bed, I can override the window of opportunity to get to sleep and then Im just awake and weird. Also, hide your car keys or you may find yourself on a road trip in your nightgown. Seriously, just tie yourself to the bed with some duck tape on your mouth. OK, really seriously, its a great drug that WILL help you get to sleep fast, and gives me about 3 to 4 hours good deep sleep with no nightmares...but then most nights I'm awake again and need to take another one to sleep the rest of the night. I've found that I can take a 10mg pill and break it in half to get to sleep initially, and then if I wake up wide awake 3 or 4 hours later, I take the other 1/2. When the alarm goes off in the morning I'm not groggy and feel rested. Also, with 1/2 a 10mg pill, I will wake up if I hear something that I need to wake up for. With a whole 10mg pill, I'm out pretty hard. It does come in a 5mg dose, but I like the choice of sleeping harder or lighter, and its cheaper to split the pills. Unless you wander around without awarness after taking Ambien, it is a great drug to help you get to sleep fast and at least for me, with no nightmares.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/25/2008 11:39:39 PM	My doctor prescribed three medications for me on my last physical (12/13/07).  I had complaints of trouble sleeping, anxiety, mild depression. I felt I was experiencing menopausal symtoms.  She diagnosed me as such and prescribed Ambien, Zoloft and Xanax. I was previously on no medications.  I filled the scripts that day and took one of each medication before bed - Ambien 10mg; Zoloft 50 mg; and Xanax .25 mg.  The next morning, I awoke to my kitchen in shambles.  Dishes and pots on the counters, Red Hot Sauce smeared on the kitchen floor and cupboards, and a broken refrigerator shelf.  I had absolutely no recollection of whatever I did that night, and it frightened me as if someone (not me) broke into my place and made this mess.  Of course, I knew it was me.  I felt ashamed and confused for many days after that incident.  I feel my doctor should have given me proper instruction on taking these drugs and the possible effects of taking them together at one time.  I feel the Ambien gave me the &quot;crazy kitchen frenzy&quot; and have not taken it since.  I do, however, continue to take the Zoloft (gaining weight), and only ocassionaly take the Xanax at night which helps me sleep.  Be careful with Ambien.

It worked the first night but the next time I took it didn't have a very good experience. 20 minutes after I took it, it turned into a what I'd say was like an acid trip. My pillows and blankets were moving. But I slept fine.

Before Ambien, I went days w/out sleep. No side effects for me.My husband says my memory is fading but I believe that's due to aging. I know I can get a good night sleep/rest w/Ambien.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	1/25/2008 1:19:58 AM	Very bad experience with this drug.  I thought I fell asleep, but roommates, family, and friends have told me that it is as if I were awake.  I send out multiple emails that make no sense, send text messages, have conversations, and eat.  The emails I sent were to co-workers, and as someone in a supervisory role it was embarassing and compromised my position.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Laurel1nd, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	1/24/2008 1:03:35 PM	I have trouble falling asleep; 5 mg of Ambien didn't help so my DR increased the dose to 10 mg. I didn't just walk in my sleep; I ate, I made lengthy long distance phone calls, I placed orders on the Internet for things I neither needed nor could afford, and ordered things by phone, and I took other prescription medicines. All with absolutely no memory of the events. I was told by friends that I had called; packages arrived at my home -- SURPRISE!!! along with bills; and most frightening, I found all my medication bottles lined up on the kitchen counter next to a water glass one morning. I was groggy that morning, but have no idea just how much I took of any of my other prescriptions. After three nights, when I tried to stop using it, I could not sleep at all.  It took nearly three weeks for my sleep to return to the pre-Ambien status -- which isn't good or I wouldn't have taken it to begin with.

I have taken two pills not remembering that I had taken medication already. This is really bad I am unable to stop taking it I have tried and was woke for two nights before I gave in. I don't know what to do at this point it is night time and time to sleep so it is pill time, I have put on 20 lbs from the night eating...helpless and wanting a good night normal sleepI am afarid to tell my doctor because she will stop giving the medication to me cold turkey (thats the kind of doctor she is) and then I will be in trouble due to the fact I will not be able to sleep though about going into rehab for help to release  myself from this drug, memory loss is very severe worried about my job not functioning as well as I used to my life is going downhill fast and all I wanted was a good night sleep because I suffer from insomina, anxiety, please read and run if you are thinking about using this drug for sleep, try warm milk anything before using this medication for sleeping

Chronic Trouble Sleeping		4	5	1			1/22/2008 12:35:59 AM	I started taking ambien when it first came out and now I totally regret it. It is addictive and I recommend that anybody even thinking of taking ambien should try every other possible choice first. It is a really scary drug because you'll end up doing things in the middle of the night like cook, look for something you misplaced, make phone calls and a lot more and in the morning it will all be really hazy, in fact, you might not even remember doing anything. Ambien is TROUBLE!

I told my Dr of this &amp; he said to try Ambien CR. There is a generic for regular Ambien, but not for Ambien CR. A 30 day supply @ Walgreens cost me $143.00. Also, the Ambien CR makes me very tired in the a.m. even with 8-9 hrs of sleep. Like it hasn't &quot;worn off yet&quot;. I'm going back to regular generic Ambien, not because it's better, because it is cheaper &amp; I do not feel hungover the next morning.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	1/15/2008 1:30:05 PM	Worked very well for getting me to sleep.  Staying asleep after a few hours was the problem.  Supplementing with Benadryl seemed to help but dried me out.  I tried CR but it didn't work for me.  I did not find it addicting at all and I was taking it for over 2 years.  I could take it at any time in the evening and still stay up as long as I wanted.  I would fall asleep though the minute I hit the pillow.  One huge problem that many have suffered is the amnesia.  I would watch tv shows and not remember a thing about them.  I have a friend that ordered several things on Ebay without realizing it.  I had even been intimate with my husband and not remembered it.  Since Ambien wouldn't keep me asleep all night, I finally gave up on it.  It was extremely good at putting me to sleep though.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	murpmarie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/5/2008 8:05:17 AM	Ambien is a horrible drug. I took it once, 2 days ago, for insomnia. Prescr. by my family doc, 10 mg. Doc didn't warn me, patient info on the leaflet was vague but gave me no reason to worry; I've been under stress and needed to sleep better. Within 15 minutes of taking the pill I started to hallucinate. Was on the phone (don't remember this) w/my Mother, apparently told her I was seeing things and dropped the phone. Mom called my son on his cell, and he came and helped me; barely remember getting to bed, just that I was cold. I only remember tiny bits and pieces.  I am a small, healthy woman, sensitive to many drugs, my doc did not warn me. Please, all docs should be cautious and give the patient clear information about what it could do, and tell the patient to try a half or a quarter first. Shouldn't the drug be titrated to the size of the person?Bad experience and I am angry, and I &quot;fired&quot; my doc yesterday, as it isn't the first time he has been careless (he has been my doc since my 24 year old was born; I think sometimes long-term doctors are less careful than they should be).I'm a college professor, not an idiot, I follow instructions well. What a horrible drug, it felt like I had been poisoned the next day. Ambien could be used as a date rape drug.thanks for letting me vent...

Was not at all satisfied with this medication.

However, I discovered I was sleep walking and eating. The result was substantial weight gain.

Ambien CR has no generic (too expensive) and doesnt leave you feeling hungover.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	12/21/2007 8:04:04 PM	Very effective and easy to take, but my doctor had to increase my dosage from 5mg to 10mg and I'm now at 20mg just to get some sleep.  If I don't take it I don't get any sleep, so I HAVE to take it.  Very VERY addicting/habit forming.

It has been a blessing to be able to sleep and get the rest I need to deal with this life changing situation.  While my marriage is doing amazingly well, I continue to use the  Ambien (actually Zolpidem) due to his snoring which keeps me awake! I sleep right through the night!!!

I am trying to stop though, I do notice now that I have next day drowsiness all the time. I would like to try a different one that maybe does not cause next day drowsiness.
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	12/12/2007 4:18:51 PM	Works very well but I have gained over 30 lbs on this drug.  It seems I get up at night and extensively snack.  I have no recollection at all about these events but family have told me about my behavior.  Once I even changed my daughter's bandage and had a discussion with her about it at night and had no recollection of even doing it!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/11/2007 11:20:35 PM	I've tried other sleep aids and none of them worked.  Ambien works quickly and lets me sleep ALL night (on most others, I wake up after a few hours).  Unlike over the counter sleep aids, there's no &quot;hangover.&quot;  I'll take 5 mg to 10 mg when I need it.The highly publicized sleep-eating phenomenon is an actual issue but easily avoided.  Do not consume any alcohol the night you're going to take it.  Get in bed AS SOON as you take it and don't get up.  If anything weird happens, consider upping your dose--it seems to result from people being half-asleep (basically, awake but stoned), and taking a sufficient amount seems to help.And be sure to allow 8 hours after you take it until you have to wake up.In all, very very highly recommended, just use it with caution; it's a controlled substance for a reason.

The things I have experienced though are memory loss and headaches when I take it and not get the 7 or 8 hours of sleep it says to make sure you get. I feel uneasy when taking this medication and not getting the full 7 or 8 hours of sleep. When i do get the right amount of sleep it works fine

When I started taking this medication I would take one and be asleep within 15 min, and I was told I have held conversations with people and don't remember them. I feel good when I wake up in the morning and only feel groogy for the first 15 min after waking up. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping		3	4	3			12/5/2007 4:31:14 PM	I had two glasses of wine went to bed and then was told the next morning that I went downstairs, fixed a bowl of ice cream, watched a movie, held several conversations and can't remember any of it.  Also, make sure you are ready to go to sleep when you take it b/c you will be catching zzz's very quickly.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	12/2/2007 3:34:20 AM	Taking Ambien is a waste of money because it has never done anything more that an over the counter sleep aid has done for me, and that's nothing because i have Chronic Insomnia.  After I would take the Ambien, I would still be lying wide awake in my bed for at least two hours.  Ambien CR is not much better. When i switched to Lunesta it was as if a miracle was happening, I finally could sleep.  I would never,ever recommend Ambien to anyone, I'd tell them to get an OTC, it;s cheaper.

It takes anywhere from 30 minutes to one hour for me to fall asleep after taking the medication.  Never in fifteen minutes! Sometimes I still do not sleep after taking. Insomnia is a nightmare for me.   
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	11/18/2007 11:05:12 PM	The drug takes effect sometime between 20 and 60 minutes - there doesn't seem to be a pattern.

When the Doctor prescribed me this medication I was I little concerned because I have always been afraid of becoming addicted in some way of this kind of drug. But it worked nicely, and, the best of all, for me was the fact that even in the middle of the night if I had to wake up with my baby it wouldn't make me too drowsy. I was able to get up and attend my baby promptly. I used for less than a month (and not everyday). I recommend it.

Ambien is good for short periods of time.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	CA,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		11/8/2007 10:22:44 PM	Ambien is very effective however there are side effects like waking up and eating in the middle of the night and not remembering doing so.  Otherwise, it's great and you don't feel sleepy the next day.

I cannot sleep at all if I don't takeit--and sleep maybe 4 hours if I do.  Causes TERRIBLE memory loss, daytime sleepiness,I wish I had never started--Doctor told me it was perfectly fine to take long term--WRONG !!  STAY AWAY FROM THIS MEDICINE!!!!!!!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping		5	5	5			11/7/2007 11:33:15 AM	Ambien works great for me, you should take it on an empty stomach, go right to bed, and you'll ease off to sleep, the only thing is, it only lasts about 4-5 hrs for me, but really do not have a problem going back to sleep on my own.

My first time trying it, I was freaked out by the hallucinations- which also freaked out my son who slept on my floor that night because he was worried. I have gotten used to them and take the medicine and get into bed within 5-10 minutes of taking it. It works great! I get to sleep quickly, I sleep soundly all night, I don't think I sleep walk, and I wake up in the morning refreshed and not groggy. The bad part of this is that it has caused some major changes in my personality-I'm moody, grouchy and irritable. I had a perfect photographic memory, and now I find myself sometimes struggling to remember things that I KNOW I know. I have been off antidepressants for awhile, but now I am starting to slip back into depression. For sleep- it's great for me. For life... maybe not so much.

If I stay up, I begin to say things that don't make sense. Falling into a deep sleep is something I never did before Ambien. I have used it for several years and would hate to be without it.

(No, I don't have somewhere else I can sleep.)  I have taken Ambien, and then Ambien CR for several years.  It never works immediatley, even Ambien CR--it takes hours for it to kick in, and then I sleep too long and don't get things done.Lunesta did ZERO for me, natural things have not worked, OTC sleep/pain aids have not worked.  Medicine usually has very little effect on me--medicine of any kind.  I have tried taking Ambien different ways.  I really need sleep--otherwise, I always see the sun rising.  Is there anyone else who has a lot fo trouble sleeping for whom Ambien doesn't work?  What do you do?

Once in a while it does work well but that is very rare.  I take the 10 mg and it does not cause any problems in the morning.  Be sure you have 7 to 8 hours available for sleep.

If you are young and have sleep problems, switch to lunesta. When you get older, this drug will work perfectly. I used it in college and i missed a ton of classes. Effective, but a risk.

I fall asleep fast and stay asleep for 6-8 hours.  Ambien CR did not work for me.  Nor did Luestra or generic Ambien.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	jane59, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	10/21/2007 11:38:01 AM	Even when taking only half a 5mg pill, I have trouble the next morning coming out of a fog.  I feel a pretty strong Ambien hangover. It also causes drug induced sleep walking.  Both my husband and I have gone places (yes, in a car sometimes) and have no memory of the event.  I do not like this medication at all.

I cannot sleep due to work pressures and often stay up all night worrying about everything. With Ambien, i fall right asleep, stay asleep, but incredibly wake up early in the morning not sluggish at all and actually feeling wonderful! It has completely changed my attitude, helped with my depression---I think I was just not getting enough sleep...ever! 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	talkin1234, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	1	1	Female	55-64	10/19/2007 7:48:37 PM	I have been more depressed, with terrible thoughts of killing myself while on this medication. I know killing myself is not God's plan for my life, but I feel as hopeless as I have. I also don't remember things, like getting the car out of the garage and not seeing the neighbor's mailbox... and even more frightning...not understanding how I got out there in the first place. I am now trying to get off of Ambien and have not slept for 2 days in a row. I have also have cried all day for no good reason. I have to admit though, for the 2 months I was on it, I slept like a log. Best sleep I have had in years. But the thoughts and singing all night long is driving both my husband and I nuts! Good luck to you. I hope you don't have any of these symptoms.

I am getting up in the middle of the night and preparing food and eating it!  I am not taking it anymore.  I would rather not sleep than risk burning the house down.  One night I made cupcakes went back to bed left them in someone else turned the oven off after they burned!  Dangerous

Warnings: if you take it every night, it is addictive and it does cause some short term memory loss.

And when I have to try to take a nap before going in for a over night shift, it helps me fall asleep quickly.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	3	4	3	Female	65-74	9/26/2007 3:42:20 PM	Have only taken for one week.  I have multiple problems - getting to sleep, staying asleep, awakening too early.  Ambien gets me to sleep, but thus far has only ensured a 4-5 hour block before awakening.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/25/2007 5:09:00 PM	Never had a problem getting to sleep until about a year ago.  I was using OTC sleep aids, which sometimes worked, sometimes didn't.  Finally got fed up with not being able to either get to sleep or fall back asleep when awoken and spoke with my doctor.  He prescribed 10 mg, but said I could cut in half to 5 mgs.  I have been taking 5 mgs for a few weeks and it has worked great.  I takes about 20 minutes to put me to sleep and I can get to sleep again if awaken by pet or child.  Norm night sleep for me is seven hours and I have no problem getting out of bed in the morning. I am concerned about the possible &quot;habit forming&quot; side effects of drug though and will check with doc about a different sleep aid for long term use.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/25/2007 1:20:58 PM	Gives a good night's sleep with no hangover, as long as you have at least 8 hours to sleep. A lifesaver!

However, I take 20 mg at night.  I also sleep walk and sleep eat almost ever night. My short term memory is shot! Is there another sleep aid medication some one can advise me on? I tried Lunesta bit it didn't work.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/22/2007 4:31:26 PM	An effective &amp; fast-acting sleep aid. I had no side effects. Some ppl complain of amnesia and even hallucinations but I  had no such problems &amp; don't know anyone who did. It's the only sleep aid I've tried that has continued to work for my chronic insomnia. All the others I tried - benzodiazepines, trazodone, antihistamines like Benadryl and Atarax, Lunesta - either didn't work at all, or stopped working after a few nights, but I'm still taking the same dose of Ambien after several years, no tolerance. My only complaint is that it only lasts a few hours. I was not impressed with Ambien CR. Oh, also, the 10mg dose that is supposed to work for everybody, it doesn't work for me &amp; I know several others who say the same. So if 10 doesn't work don't give up on it, 15 or 20 might still work. It's most reliable if you take it on an empty stomach, so if you tried it after eating or with food, that might be another reason why it wouldn't work.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/22/2007 12:06:06 AM	IT IS THE BEST SLEEP AID ! NO HANG OVER DRUGED FEELING THE NEXT DAY.  HOWEVER, LONG TERM USE, ME ONIT FOR TWO PLUS YEARS, 20mg, MEMORY, WHICH WAS BAD IS SHOT. TAKE IT TO SLEEP WITH PAIN.
