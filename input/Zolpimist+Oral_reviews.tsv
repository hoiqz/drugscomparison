Difficulty Falling Asleep	Peaceout, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	4/13/2012 1:02:13 AM	I like it.  With hx of substance abuse I don't feel high or done anything unusual.  The bottle causes anxiety because I can't tell how much is left.

The taste, however, is the most bitter, disgustingly strong taste I have ever experienced! I need a glass of water or something to chase the spray down with to prevent gagging. If the medicine weren't so much more effective than pills, the taste would definitely ruin it for me! 
Difficulty Falling Asleep	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/9/2011 5:29:47 PM	Safety bottle is a little odd but i understand the need for it.  The product felt like i was taking anesthesia, i was out before i realized it so prepare yourself to go right to sleep immediately.  like others are saying...i had a very happy moment but it was not intolerable just funny effect 
Other	Doc, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/8/2011 4:16:08 PM	I tried Zolpimist following a flight from LA to Vienna. I started to get sleepy much faster than with Ambien (I was actually still Skyping with my kids when I started to make no sense at all). It worked well and I will use again.

However, being a spray must make this work a whole lot faster than the pill. My eyes seemed to get heavy within a couple minutes. And like the other reviewer, it put me in a very good mood like a light beer buzz or something
