Other	rypie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/7/2012 6:19:14 PM	My Dr. put me on this to try and solve my mysteriously swollen lymph nodes. The first day I started this antibiotic I immediately developed a sore throat that got pretty severe as the hours went by. I thought I just happened to be showing symptoms of my mysterious illness... the next day I developed a fever, and I didn't feel like eating anything, and my skin started to itch sporadically. Fast forward 6 days in, I woke up in the middle of the night, freezing cold, with a temp of 102, gasping for breath...my heart is racing and will not slow down. This morning as I was getting dressed I looked in the mirror and noticed a rash forming, splotchy and red, most intense on my upper arms, my face was straight up beet red (still is) and the rash spread over my entire body. Finally, I got ahold of my Dr. and he had me discontinue use. I didn't take my pill this morning and I haven't had a fever or sore throat...only this stupid rash. Overall this is the worst experience I've ever had with an antibiotic...I had over half of the side effects (mostly the severe ones) and had about 6 in the extremely severe category.

Skin Infection	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/19/2012 10:59:22 PM	I was prescribed Bactrim to take for 5 days because of a skin infection. After 1.5 days suddenly my face felt flushed, I got body chills, my heartrate spiked and I felt like I was having a panic attack. I also got very dizzy a few hours later and then the rest of my body felt numb. After talking with my doctor I discontinued the pills but even after the infection cleared and 2.5 weeks after stopping and I still have the original symptoms but with abdominal pains and muscle weakness to boot. The doctor did some bloodwork and turns out I have high free T4 levels so I am seeing an endocrinologist for possible hyperthyroidism, which would explain the symptoms. My heartrate was 79 before Bactrim and now it's a constant 90+. I have trouble sleeping and can't even exercise to stay healthy. I'm never, ever, ever taking this horrible drug again.

Diabetics are prone to this due to higher sugar levels in the blood.   It takes a diabetic a longer time to heal than a non diabetic.   I have been taking Fluconazole  ( Diflucan)  for the Yeast.

I had chills, a high fever, my eyes were red, and I had absolutely no energy-could barely get up. I later read that this medication isn't even used in England. I think it should be banned.

Skin Infection	concerned , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/9/2012 11:30:35 AM	First I would like to say thank you to all the users who have posted their experiences with this medication.  I normally do not post reviews but felt that my experience may help others as well.  My doctor prescribed this med for a skin boil that didn't respond to a previous dose of Amox/Clav.  On my second day of taking this, I experienced what I thought was too much caffeine from my morning coffee....rapid heart rate and sweating.  This occurred 30 minutes after taking it and subsided somewhat three hours later.  By day three, I experienced the same rapid heart rate, sweating, nausea, body aches, felt disoriented and an extreme panic attack.  This is when I decided to read about other reviews of this drug and found I was not imagining my symptoms and stopped taking it.  My symptoms gradually subsided 24 hours later but left me with a horrible taste in my mouth and despite the fact that I had taken this med with more than normal amounts of water, I was still extremely thirsty and developed an itchy skin rash.  Since I had experienced this over the weekend I contacted my doctor the following Monday and told them my experience.  They informed me that I was probably &quot;sensitive&quot; to the sulfa in this drug and prescribed Clindamycin which I have been taking now for three days and have not experienced any side effects so far.  My advice to anyone who experiences any extreme side effect from any drug to take charge and listen to their body!  Contact your doctor and tell them what you are experiencing and don't be afraid to let them know you want to discontinue taking what they have prescribed.  If a medication gives you more discomfort than the original problem you are taking it for then you should be given something else.  Everyone is different and can respond to or reject any kind of medication!  
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/8/2012 10:39:55 PM	I do not recommend this medicine at all.  I ended up with every possible side effect imaginable.  Diarrahia with blood, chills, vomiting, fever, nausea, sun burn effect, ended up in hospital twice (severely dehydrated), loss of hair.  This should NOT be on the market at all.
Skin Infection	ginna1225, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	2	Female	55-64	5/4/2012 6:53:20 PM	I was diagnosed with a celulitis infection on my finger, that created a red line from the point of infection half way down my arm. They gave me an iv in the doctor's office and that caused extreme itching in scalp and redness all over face and neck, they immediately stopped and gave me bactrim and told me to take two twice a day and watch for symptons. however I am leaving the country and my daughter is getting married and I am so scared after I read this site to continue this medicine. Some of the side effects seem to happen when your well into the doseage. I don't know what to do ? I am so anxious. I don't even want to pack. I am thinking the worse. I am wondering what I should take with me in case I develop severe side effects. I am not sure the Domnican Republic will have the sophistacation to deal with any problems. I will be there almost a week before the wedding starts. I hope I make it.

Sinus Irritation and Congestion	Jamie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	4/7/2012 10:50:58 PM	AVOID AT ALL COSTS. 8 days into this medication and there have been no alleviation of my sinus/skin infection symtoms other than what time fixed. I had never had a known medicine allergy until I took this sulfa drug, and am currently broken out in thousands of hives all over my body and am shaky/irritable. To make it worse, I'm on my Spring Break away from home and medical treatment. TERRIBLE. Just had to have the doctor call in an emergency prescription of Medrol steroids to hopefully kick this allergic reaction. DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. Please don't make the same mistake as I did! I even read these reviews beforehand and hoped that I wouldn't be one of these negative reviewers, but unfortunately, I am. Stick with a drug that you know will work for you, I'm sorry my doctor didn't listen to that wish of mine.

Urinary Tract Infection caused by Klebsiella Bacteria	crescendo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	3/21/2012 9:54:19 PM	I had UTI (Klebsiella)and at the same time developed a severe skin infection on my face (eyebrow).My NP prescribed bactrim.It worked on my UTI almost immediately, but effect on skin infection was visible only after about 3 days. I have celiac disease and scleroderma concentrating on my alimentary tract,I am underweight and overall I am not in very good shape, so I expected some problems due to bactrim. However the drug was very helpful. Aside of some diarrhea and feeling weak overall, I did not develop any serious side effects. I DID drink A LOT of fluids. Unfortunately I was prescribed this drug for only 7 days and my diseases although were barely noticeable at the end of this time, did not go away completely, so after about about 3 weeks my UTI returned in full blast. Also the skin infection looks like is not fully cured. This time I was prescribed cipro, but did not start it yet. I also help my body by rinsing my genitals after every time I go to the bathroom with very strong chamomille tea (old country remedy), which helps a lot. Also I take cranberry supplements. I wish my NP did prescribe bactrim for longer time.I know about side effects that Bactrim can trigger, but I did not experience almost any..However, after such treatment one has to repair his/hers intestinal flora, because it is badly affected and such dysbiosis can cause bloating, persistent diarrhea or constipation, pain, nausea etc. Probiotics  in large doses then for quite a while are a must after such treatment.
Middle Ear Infection	deeeceee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/10/2012 2:49:10 PM	This is the only antibiotic I've ever used that is both effective and without side effects for me. I just take it with plenty of water or juice and have some yogurt each day.I took bactrim for a sinus infection that gave me a raw sore throat, earache, and hacking cough. I also had clumps of icky thick mucous that I kept swallowing which only made me nauseous to boot. Well,within 2 days of my 14 day course of bactrim DS, I felt light years better!This stuff is great. I'm allergic to penicillin so I'm especially grateful that this is available.

After 4 days, I developed extreme fatigue yet couldn't sleep, a high fever of 101.7, dizziness, nausea, pain in my hands, a headache and neck ache, decreased urination and a rash on my arms, neck and back. I stopped taking it and 3 days later  I am still exhausted. Don't let your doctor prescribe this drug-make them give you something else!  I have never had a reaction like this to any other medications. I can see why it's partially banned in the UK.  It is a horrible drug!

I have a horrible &quot;sun burn&quot; to my chest, neck and face. My face and eyes are swollen. I feel sick, tired and wish the hell I NEVER had been prescribed this crap. I am usually very healthy and only took this for a burn on my arm, now I am burned worse. How long is this to last? NEVER will take this garbage again, nor will I recommend it to anyone.

Coli Bacteria	LynB, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	1/20/2012 3:46:34 PM	I have had a long term UTI and cultures showed the only antibiotic that would work is Bactrim. I had bad side effects after the 2nd pill. Fever,stiff neck, nausea, headache and couldn't urinate. I HAD to take this drug, since it was the only one the sensitivity tests showed that would kill the bacteria.I ended up only taking 4 pills the first time, and the UTI came back in 2 days. The next time, I tried taking it, I also took 1/2 Benadryl with it and the side effects weren't as bad. Just a headache mostly, with mild stomach pains. Took it  for 3 days and  the infection was back. I was supposed to take it for 10 days to begin with and now it was out of control. I think that by taking the small doses at first and  then the antihistamine, helped me to get through this. I am on day 9 and feel pretty tired and shaky but I only have one day to go. It was only taking one pill to clear the UTI (I got a bottle of test strips online) So I hope and pray it stays gone this time. As soon as I'm finished, I'll take probiotics, although I have not had any diarrhea. If it wasn't for this drug, I would have had to go to an infectious disease doc and  have IV Gentamicin, which has way worse side effects. glad I tried the Benadryl.

Sinus Irritation and Congestion	Momma Mel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	12/8/2011 7:42:17 AM	I am prone to getting really bad sinus infections and since I am allergic to pennicillins, doctors usually like to go with Bactrim as the next druf of choice to treat me. I usually tell them now that this drug isn't very effective for me in hopes they give me something else. I have recently had such a bad sinus infection that i had already been on antibiotics for nearly a month. After finishing up the last run of meds, I began to get ill all over again. I had some Bactrim left over from a previous infection and I decided to take the remainder of them instead of making another trip to the docs office. I now remember why I ask for a different med over Bactrim. This drug not only causes me to have sever headaches, but I'm very restless and find it difficult to sleep at night. I also experienced hot flashes and would break into sweats while i was just sitting. The most troublesome side effect I experience from Bactrim are the mouth sores that develop on the insides of my cheeks. The area feels almost numb and tingles with a burning sensation. Eating is very uncomfortable becasue if I chew on the side that that effected it further irritates my already raw skin. These are the things I am experiencing as of right now and this is only day 4 of taking the drug. After reading reviews and side effects from various sites, I will be tossing the rest of the medicine in the toilet. Hopefully I've taken just enough of it to rid me of the sinus infection but if not, I'll pay my doc another visit and I'll never forget again why I ask for anything else over Bactim.

By the night of the second day (4 doses) my back had turned into fiery red spots and patches. I also experience some tremors for a short time, vertigo and some lose of balance. If you are ever prescribed this drug use with care if you have never taken it before. 
Other	Murphy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	10/27/2011 5:01:31 AM	I was prescribed Bactrim DS for cellulitis on my hand following a grease burn which became infected. I had read all the negative reviews, and was very alert to my state of well-being. I have had no adverse reactions, the cellulitis began clearing up within 72H and I am completing the full 10 days of treatment without a problem.  
Skin Infection	dpaine, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	10/18/2011 9:20:10 AM	I had cellulitis on my finger.An I&amp;D performed in the ER. I was given IV Vancomycin then a script for Bactrim 2x a day for 14 days. It was a staph infection. Each day that followed my finger began to heal, but the rest of my body began to feel sick. First it was nausea, loss of appetite, weakness then by the 8th day I had severe head aches at night with a slight fever. Even my gait was off. I stopped the medicine on the 12th day. Immediately the headaches and night fever stopped. But I was still very weak. It took a good week to begin to feel better and more like myself. It really frightened me. I've never had a reaction to antibiotics...but this was the first time I had taken any antibiotics in ten years.
Skin Infection	VegasYooper, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Male	45-54	10/12/2011 11:51:09 AM	After reading all the posts about side effects, I figured I'd post my experience so far. I'm on day 7 of 2 tablets a day for 14 days for a sebacous cyst on my neck. I've been pront to cycts since I was a little kid, and I'm 53 now. So far, the only side effects I've had was horrible gas around day 4 which lasted about a day. I did go to the pharmacy and buy some of this bacterial supplement for the gut with billions of live cultures in it, and I drink this liquid probiotic called Kefir every day for irritable bowel. I think the bacteria supplements help when you take Bactrim, I just take them 6 hours or so after my last Bactrim dose, hoping some of the bacteria will survive long enough to help mitigate the negative digestive system effects. I am allergic to penicillin, but I've never had a reaction to any other antibiotic, so here's hoping. The cyst has gotten a lot smaller, but I 'expressed' it 2 days ago myself when it was back to being almost as large as when it first popped out. (I had it drained last week at the Dr's office too). I'll post again when I'm finished with the medication in a week.

No serious reactions. Dry-mouth, upset stomach if you don't take it with food (a full meal, not just a cereal bar or something.) First day I took it with just some milk, gave me a stomach ache. Pill is pretty big, so it's kinda hard to swallow. Pretty basic side effects if you ask me. Just took my last pill and have seen improvement although not 100% better yet.

I take 1 pill twice a day.  I did not sleep much at all after I took the drug.  I woke up with hives, blood shot eyes, headache, chills, swollen lips, swollen/painful legs and ankels.  I stopped taking it immediatly but the damage is done.  I feel horrible today and it is my birthday.  Plus, they are really hard to swallow. I will not be taking this again.  It seems to be a very dangerous drug after reading everyone's comments.
Skin Infection	nicegirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	9/13/2011 4:29:07 PM	I had a MRSA skin infection on my leg. After getting it lanced, drained, and cultured, they put me on Bactrim DS 2x day for 14 days. The infection cleared up immediately (within 24 hours) though I experienced loss of appetite and nausea. By the 9th day I developed hives. Still not sure if the hives are due to a possible Sulfa allergy or something else, but the doctors switched me to IC Clindamycin HCl for another 7 days (4x day). Now I'm done with my antibiotic course and hoping the MRSA won't return! Good luck to you all.

Other	Al, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	3	Male	45-54	9/10/2011 6:04:05 AM	Taking for a spider bite on my wrist that caused an infection to spread through lymph nodes almost to my armpit. I finished up 30 500MG Keflex (3 a day) yesterday and I have one more dose of Bactrim to take tomorrow if I can stand it. I've been fine for 10 days and all of a sudden I got hit with a severe outbreak of Tinea Versicolor. It came out of nowhere. I'm covered with it from my cheeks to my knees. I had a slight fever last night when the rash popped up and a worse one tonight with terrible shakes. Other symptoms I've had since day one: bloodshot eyes, nausea and starving at the same time, restlessness, thirst, acute anger, tensed abdomen muscles. It seemed to clear up the visible signs of the lymph infection in the first 5 days. I've never had side effects like this from any medication. I'll take Bactrim again if it's the only med that can save my life. Otherwise, forget it!

By the end of that day I had nausea, weakness, body aches, the back of my neck hurt so badly, chills and hot flashes. I have one more dose left.  I cant wait to get this stuff out of my system.  And I need to go back to the doctor...I dont think it cured the infection completely.

Middle Ear Infection	Lynda(ATL), 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/11/2011 2:53:50 PM	Upon the first dose (within 1 hour) of taking this medication, I was immediately affected by severe neck pain, muscle weakness, blurred vision, shakes.  Initially, I thought these symptoms to be more &quot;anxiety&quot; related, as I have allergies to other penicillan based antibiotics, and I've been very nervous about trying new drugs.  So foolessly I tried a second dose with a similar outcome.  At this point, I realized these were more serious side effects from the drug itself and I discontinued further doses.  My doctor switched me to Z-pac, which I was able to take without issue.  Be very careful in taking this drug, or any for that matter.  Always watch out for side effects and stop if your have suspicions.

I'd contacted my doctor, who seem to be less inform. About the side effect.

I was put on bactrim and the 5th day on it I developed side effects, bad enough I went to the ER. In a nut shell I was told I had to keep taking this med no matter what. Its the only oral med that MRSA is sensitive to, and if I didn't take it, I would end up in the ER again on my death bed. So scared, because I don't want to take the bactrium because of all the creepy side effects, my Dr. gave me xanax,to ease the side effects, like the racing heart, chills, and just an over all crummy felling. So I would recommend to anyone who has to take bactrium get a rx for the xanax while your taking it.

Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	2/22/2011 8:33:51 AM	Bactrim DS is a horrible drug. I was on it for 5 days before i noticed any side effects. Puking, all body aches, fevers, diarrhea, and shivers. Horrible flue type stuff. The worst thing also was it made my breath smell horrible for 3 days after i stopped, my own breath was making my food taste bad enough to stop eating. Tasted like rusty medal with every bite. Brushing, mouthwash, tongue scraper, nothing worked.

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	35-44	1/23/2011 10:00:16 AM	I am down to the last dose. I couldn't figure out why I keep having a fever,shaking chills (usually at night), and slight nausea. After looking up the side effects and reading everyone's comments, I now understand. For me, I think the medication did more to make me feel ill than the original infection/illness. I won't be taking this again.

Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	...gfhwsr..., 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	1/8/2011 1:06:30 PM	i have had a uti since may that has not responded to other antibiotics (cipro, macrobid, amoxicillan, suprax are others i've taken). i tried bactrim in early june after cipro failed and after taking 2 pills was up all night violently ill, vomiting, chills. i went off it and tried other antibiotics, but nothing worked. they sent my urine for testing and found the only thing that would kill the infection was bactrim. i took 2 pills yesterday and was fine during the day, then last night woke up around 330am with the worst headache of my life, my neck was stiff and the back of my head was throbbing. i took 2 aleve and when i woke up it was better but my neck is still stiff and the base of my head still aches. thankfully i haven't had the vomiting i had the last time i was on it. i absolutly hate this medicine and am only taking it cause its the only antibiotic that will kill the infection and 8 months of trying other ones and no solution has left me really with no choice. thankfully i only have 5 1/2 days of hell left. oh and don't forget to eat when u take it, apparently thats why i got sick.

My Dr. told me I was having a reaction and to take Benedryl daily and a steriod (40mg) for two days. The rash went away so I quit taking the Benedryl on day 4 (after the rash) now my cheeks are getting red again (my rash started there). I havent taken any more Bactrim since Thursday evening, it's now Monday afternoon, how long does this stuff stay in your system?

While this is nothing more than anecdotal, I also experienced strongly uncomfortable anxiety and finally had to use Xanax to balance the effects. In my case, I would not use Bactrim again.

I finally got to a doctor after trying home remedies. I was prescribed bactrim ds to take once a day for only 3 days. Literally after the first pill I felt much better! It was gone after the 3 days and I was happy to feel better. I felt as though I never had a UTI. However, It is now one month later and I am sexually active and I seem to have another UTI. I'm not sure if I was under prescribed the correct amount and it didn't get rid of it completely, or if I happened to contract it all over again on my own. I have no insurance this time around so I discovered a natural sugar called D-Mannose. It is used for uti's and most definitely cures uti's stemming from E. Coli. Hopefully it will work for me this time.

It has prevented infections rather well, I only get about one every other year. But on the downside my doctors recently found evidence of drug induced lupus, and guess which one is the culprit drug? That's right, Bactrim. I have taken my last dose of this &quot;medicine&quot; and I won't be looking back.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	11/24/2010 2:33:56 PM	I have been taking this on and off for over a year to try and treat a MRSA infection that I have been fighting.  It helped subside the symptoms but in the end has made my infection worse and even spread to another area. I am still fighting the infection and the medication is not helping at all.  I am very upset with the performance of the medication and even more upset with the doctors who keep on prescribing it.  If you must take it, take it with caution.  Do not take it for extended periods of time.  BE CAREFUL!!!!!

So far i'm experiencing nausea,slight chills, blurred vision and a slight headache. Not sure if i want to continue to take this due to the fact i work two jobs and can't afford to feel sick all the time. We'll see how this goes. But as of right now i'm not liking this medication.

I have been battling MRSA for about a year and have been to Immediate Care on numerous occasions. This is the only med that keeps the abscesses under control once they appear. I am just wondering what the long term affects are in taking this drug?? I have been taking it on the 10-day regimen for about a year..about every 6 weeks. Any comments??
Skin Infection	Barmei723, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	11/3/2010 10:27:26 AM	Just hours after first dose woke up with severe chills and fever.  Thought it due to spreading infection.  Continued with medication despite continued fever, loss of appetite, muscle aches, and chills.  Infection was clearing up significantly but after a few more days couldn't tolerate the fever and decided to stop medication.  24 hrs. after last dose was feeling normal again.  So now am sure what I experienced was definitley an allergic reaction.
Skin Infection	heather, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	10/25/2010 11:05:44 PM	I am taking this for my acne and rosecea. The first day I took this I had a headache. I also had a hard time sleeping. Now on the 2nd day I have severe gas and bloating. My stomach feels huge and full of gas. No other side effects so far. I need to take this for 2 months. For me, that seems a little long especailly to go bloated and gassy. On the plus side, my face already has noticable improvement after just 2 days. I think Ill just wait it out and see if any more side effects occur. If not, I think ill stick to it.

Sinus Irritation and Congestion	LindaMo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	10/8/2010 4:15:30 PM	I have been taking this product for several days.  Yes, there is some nausea and gas, but that is not my real problem.  ANYONE who suffers from SEVERE diarrhea,even after being off Bactrim for 2 wks or months, DO NOT take anything to stop it.  You may have clostridium difficile, also known as c. diff.  It is very dangerous, and can be gotten from broad spectrum antibiotics.  I know this is true, because I got it the first time from surgery last year when I got an IV of vancamycin for 24 hrs.  I had it for several wks and ended up in the hospital.  I got it 4 times in 4 mos because I was not weened off the med until after the 4th time.  My gastro doc did that for me.  I got it again after taking clindimyacin a few months later.  I will probably get it again after taking this drug since it is a severe side affect and I am now prone to this disease.  Please mention you took this drug and that they should test you for c diff.
Sinus Irritation and Congestion	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	9/25/2010 12:46:44 PM	This medication is one of the few antibiotics I can take because I am allergic to many others.  It works well, but you must heed the warnings.  The first time I took it, I went swimming around day 4, and ended up with skin blisters, even though I was wearing sunscreen.  I don't blame the drug for this - that was my fault.  It works quickly, and often by the second or third dose, I am feeling better.  I haven't had any other side effects except for loss of appetite, which is one I don't mind. :) But, as with any antibiotic, the instant you notice a severe side effect, call your doctor!

After taking for one dose I had a severe headache and nausea. I continued taking the drug but those two symptoms only got worse. On the seventh day I went to my Parent's house and had broken out in to hives. My Aunt who used to be a nurse advised me to stop taking the medication because I looked as though I was having a severe allergic reaction. I have been off the med for 24 hours but the hives have not lessened, my head still hurts, my chest is tight, I'm still nauseous. I am trying to contact my doctor with little luck. I would not recommend this medication to anyone. The MRSA on my underarm has appeared to clear up a little, doesn't hurt anymore, but has not disappeared completely.

I am prone to having boils and they've never been tested but I am believed to be a &quot;carrier&quot; of MRSA. This is a very strong medication. I'm taking 800mg 2x a day for 10 days. It works to get rid of the infections, but I have felt horrible the entire time I have been on this. Every time I go to sleep, I wake up either with extreme nausea and the shakes or in a panic and disoriented. I have also noticed that I am extremely sensitive to heat and the sun. Going outside in our 90 degree weather with 100% humidity has made me sick to my stomach every time. However, it does work to get rid of MRSA which is resistant to most other antibiotics. 3 days left and I can feel normal again.

Skin Infection	Ashbash, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/9/2010 8:00:59 PM	I was put on this medication because I had a spider bite that turned into an MRSA Staph infection.  I was supposed to take this 1 pill 2 times a day for 14 days.  I took this medication for 9 days without any issues, but on the 10th day, I started having fevers of 102.  I called my doctor and they put me on a different antibiotic.  Other than the fever, I didn't have any other side effects, but the bite still hadn't healed, so I don't think that this antibiotic is very effective.  Please be careful while on this drug and notify your doctor anytime you might even think something could be wrong!

I occasionally get sinus infections and take them very seriously because of MRSA. I developed another sinus &amp; ear infection and Bactrim DS was prescribed...by the 2nd pill I was feeling like I just might live! Now, I'm going in to the 3rd day and feeling much better...hoping I don't experience any of the side effects I've been reading. Wondering if some of these people didn't read the warnings...ie...avoid sunlight and drink lots of water when taking it.
Skin Infection	45-54 Male  (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	45-54	7/28/2010 1:04:55 AM	I took this medication for a boil that the Dr. thought to be staff infection. After 7th day boil drained and I started feeling better after the last dosage on day 10 I started having fevers. The fever, chills body aches lasted 3 days and fever was 102-103. I finally went to ER and was diagnosed with severe allergic reaction. Was hospitalized for 13 days. In that time I had fevers for 7 days and treated with tylenol and intervenious prednisone, benadryl, and vancomyacin. My blood pressure dropped to 90 over 50 at one point.  All my lymph glands were swollen so I had to undergo several CAT Scans and biopsy of a lymph gland in my neck for possible lymphoma. Had rash and turned red then almost purple on all of my body. After all of this it was determined I had a stage 3 allergic reaction to the Bactrim (Sulfa). After fevers subsided my whole body started peeling and peeled from head to toe. It has been 1 month since discharge from hospital and just finished Prednisone therapy and still have slight rash, peeling and itching. I also have developed some kidney issues and am going back to see DR. tomorrow. This has been the scariest thing I have ever been through. If you have to take a sulfa drug be very careful and pay close attention to any side affects. This drug almost killed me and I am still dealing with issues associated with this more than 1 month later.
Urinary Tract Infection caused by Klebsiella Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	7/26/2010 7:51:31 PM	After two trips to the urgent care, and one to the emergency room and no answers to what was wrong with me, I figured out after reading other posts on here that I must have had an allergic reaction to this medication.  I have a fever around 103 degrees, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, lump on my neck, sunburned-looking skin, swollen face/eyes, and difficulty breathing deeply.  I wish I would have looked on here before I racked up around $5,000 in Urgent Care/ER bills - especially when they never even considered this a possibility.

Skin Infection	Jim, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	55-64	7/23/2010 9:25:47 AM	Started taking this drug to treat a Strep B cellulitis infection on my leg that was resistant to Keflex and Amoxycillan.  This antibiotic seems to have helped with the Strep infection, but after 10 days I developed an alergic reaction that manifested in spreading hives, starting on the inside of my forearms and spreading to the back of my hands and legs. Serious itching, redness and bumpiness on skin. Four days after stopping the drug, hives are still there, but seem to be responding slowly to benedryl and hydrocorisone cream.  I have not been allergic to sulfa drugs in the past, but I know allergic response increases with repeated exposure.  I will not take this again.  After reading the other posts and comparing to my experience, it seems that itchy redness on inside of forearms is a dead ringer early indication of allergic reaction to this drug.  I concur with the post that suggests testing for allergic reaction to sulfa before taking this drug.  In general, beware of reactions to antibiotics, &quot;dirtiness&quot; in prescription drugs, the public health implications of misuse of antibiotics in animal farming,... and industry lobbyists.

Two hours after taking the pill my stomach was upset. Three to four hours after taking the pill I had chills to the point of shivering as well as a fever. Six hours after taking the pill I was lethargic, and also had confusion. Six and a half hours to seven hours after taking the pill my ankle, knee, and neck started to swell. I took two benadryl and then passed out about nine hours after taking the pill. During the night while sleeping I woke up NAUSEATED, fevered, and my muscles were aching. The next day during my first urination my urine was extremely dark, and I also had mild stomach pain for the day.My doctor and the pharmacist believe that I had an allergic reaction to these pills.

However it is helpful seeing the other posts that sound very similar to what i am experiencing.  There are also knots on my neck.Fever and chills , red sunburned looking face slighty swollen.It is now about 130 am and of course can not get in touch with the dr. that is why i was looking on this page, and it has been quite helpful i will try to suffer the rest of the night out and just call dr. in the am.

I took it for 8 days out of 10.  Went to the hospital to have my Surgery on the Cyst.  Because I am a Diabetic and taking Medician and I also have Alergies that I am being treated for with Medician the BACTRIM DS interfered with these much needed Medicians which the BACTRIM DS caused my Potassium to go thru the roof and in turn gave me Severe Renel Failure. I had to be admitted for what was supposed to be Out-Patient Surgery. I was released the next day and was told I was within a couple hours of DEATH.. When I returned home I immediately disposed of the rest of my Presciption of BACTRIM DS. I am,also, allergic to AUGMENTIN that with the BACTRIM DS I refuse to ever take again.

I am now Itchy all over with severe red rash that feels like my body is crawling with ants. I have only just started this drug 5 days ago for a small skin infection in a lesion on my knee and now my skin is worse than infected: it is swollen, red, sore, itchy, and painful!!! Also I have had a major headache and a fever of over 101 for 4 days and recurring sweats/chills every night. I am having diarrhea and I just noticed a small print warning stating diarrhea may last from weeks to months after medication is already stopped. WHY IS SMALL PRINT A LEGAL FORM FOR A WARNING? DO NOT TAKE THIS WITHOUT FIRST HAVING A SERIOUS UNDERSTANDING OF POSSIBLE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS!!! BEWARE: even those who have no allergies from anything else should be cautious. I have never had an allergy to anything... until now!
Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection	Erika, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/27/2010 8:58:54 AM	I had taken Bactrim DS before for my UTI's. This last time though, I developed a reaction to the drug. Only after 2 doses I begin to have some joint/muscle pain in my hands. By the 4th dose, every joint in my body hurt as if someone was injecting poison into my joints. Went to the ER, doc was not convinced that I was having an allergic reaction to Bactrim simply because I didn't have the classic sympton of a &quot;rash&quot;. Not only did I have joint pain/stiffness, but my fingers turned purple and then I had trouble swallowing. I was treated with steriods and doc changed my antibiotic to Cipro.  I started to feel better about 12hrs later.

Other	sg321, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	6/23/2010 10:18:50 PM	My doctor gave me this drug after I noticed a swelling of my left breast with fever &amp; did not know what the problem was, possibly a breast implant leak. I was to take 2 tabs a day and I had horrible stomach aches, was extremely tired &amp; moody. I usually take Keflex as I am allergic to penicillin, I think I will stay with Keflex or Zithromax!! Bactrim did not work for me, it made me feel worse.

I took the pills and notices on the seventh day I had developed a headache and a rash on my infected index finger and my inner thighs and inner arms. Still took the medicine.  Then on day nine I woke up to a full body rash from head to toe and a temperture of 102.3.  Headache lasted for three days straight and developed achey muscles, like when you have the flu.  Went the my doctor and after examing me was given a five day persription of prednizone and a five day supply of diphenhydramine for the itching and pain.  Although it cleared the infection of my finger I will never take bactrim ever again. This was a miserable experience.

Urinary Tract Infection caused by Klebsiella Bacteria	lisa, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/16/2010 7:06:34 PM	Since age 18, I have acquired numerous UTI's, (I am now 37). I have always been prescribed Bactrim DS 1 bid #14.  Recently I acquired another UTI, began Bactrim DS, and became incredibly itchy! No hives.  No recent lifestyle nor medication changes.  Took Benadryl liquids caps; itch subsided.  Can this happen to a person after taking antibiotic after 18 years, which is still effective in treatment?

After having chemo and loosing some weight I am still 163#. Just found this web site today.

The nausea scared me a bit, being a new symptom I thought it might be related to an spread of the UTI.  I was pleased to see others with similar comments.  I was so miserable with the UTI that I was willing to suffer any of the side effects of this drug.  My apetite has been impacted as well.  I'm trying not to complain about that part; I once wished for a trip to Survivor Island so I could drop a few pounds.  All of the contestants surely do!!  Best of luck to those of you taking this drug.  I hope this all ends well for me.

Threw up two times during the day, and also had diahrea. Have suffered from a major headache since the first day I started taking this medicine. AND I am not seeing results- I now have an itching that I did not have before taking this medicine. The nurse recommended taking yogurt with this pill to lessen the side effects. Haven't tried it yet, but hopefully that will work!
Other	Kel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/6/2010 1:20:55 AM	I started Bactrim DS on Friday. (MRSA) I went to the ER on Monday due to an alergic reaction. I started feeling worse every day. From a rash to the worst hot and cold flashes I've ever had. By Monday I thought I was dying! Pulse was 124, swollen glands, trouble breathing, BP at 160/100. I have no idea how this medication could possibly be still prescribed or on the market. For those few people it helped, thats great. If your a first time user, I would call your DR up and request something else. I have never had an alergy in my life until I started taking this med. Please read all the reviews on this med, it can be extremely dangerous...

It worked great to get rid of both, but on day 9 I broke out in extreme hives all over my body.  Dr advised me to stop taking it and to take Benadryl to help with the hives and itchiness.  I've been off of the meds almost 24 hrs and my rash seems to be worse.  We'll see what happens from here....just be cautious if you've been prescribed this drug.  I didn't realize that an allergy could surface after almost a week of taking it.

As the day progressed, rash and itching got worse and has moved to other parts of body.  Will call Dr again, and will not take anymore of this medicine.

Two mths after, I am still dealing with a bad skin rash on both hands.This drug is dangerous. Since my experience I have talked to many more people who have issues taking this ,than not. What really irritates me is the Docs could have given me another antibiotic(found out later) but refused to even believe I was having an allergic reaction.

The side effects are horrible. Fever 104, extreme chills, whelps, eyes swelled shut, lips swollen, chest pains, difficutly breathing and extreme redness over my whole body.  It has been days since I wound up in an out of state emergency room and I am still having problems.  If someone mentions giving you bactrim, run like the wind.  It should be taken off the market!!!!!

It was effective then (took for 30 days!) and it is effective now (10 days). My only side effect is diarrhea, which is bad, but not uncommon when I'm on antibiotics. I had hoped to have left MRSA behind, and was shocked because this infection didn't look or behave like the other one I had. It looked like exzema. I'm finding out, once a mrsa patient, always a mrsa patient. I have a lot of other health issues, but haven't had a bad experience with Bactrim at all. It really depends on the patient.

I have horrible nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, dry mouth and almost feel depressed! None of which I had before I started taking Bactrim DS.  I am seriously considering not taking it anymore to see if I can start feeling &quot;normal&quot; again.  Have not experienced the rash or itching that others have discussed..however, I do not want it to come to that either.

Skin Infection	Sheree36, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/26/2009 2:36:00 PM	I really can't judge it too much yet, but I do know I got my persription yesterday afternoon.  I was able to get my 2 a day before I went to bed, the 2nd one was about 2 hrs. before I went to bed.  I got 1 1/2 hrs. of sleep, woke up sweating, felt like I was going to vomit, but never did.  So, I tossed &amp; turned all night, not being able to go back to sleep.  Very frustrating, I read the literature before I took it &amp; it didn't say anything about insomenia.  That was a awful night, I recommend not taking them before bed if you want to sleep.
Skin Infection	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	10/17/2009 4:06:50 PM	My doctor prescribed Bactrim for a skin infection/cellulitis which started on the bridge of my nose and made my nose too tender to touch and caused my face to swell.  After 5 days on this drug, I developed chills and had an overall bad feeling. I felt nauseated and threw up a couple times in the early morning.  I retuurned to my doctor and they said to keep taking the medication and that I probably had just contracted a virus.  The next night my back started itching and then the next morning when I awoke I was red as if I had a major sunburn all over my whole body.  It was sooo itchy.  My temp was 102.4.  Very sick...  Went to ER, they said I was having a severe drug reaction and gave me a shot  of adrenalin and an IV shot of prednisone and benadryl.  The next day I am taking a perscription of prednisone and benadryl and still very red and very itchy.
Skin Infection	chris, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/16/2009 3:43:09 PM	I was prescribed the medication for a rash on my skin -similar to acne. After the first pill my throat, nose, ears, tongue started swelling. I had difficulty breathing and was taken to the ER. The next day I had a constant headache and muscle pain. I did not know I was allergic to anything until I took this medicine. I will not take it again.

Skin Infection	scd, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/7/2009 10:09:51 AM	I didn't want to take this medicine after reading the reviews, but didn't have much choice because the cellulitis was not getting better on its own.  I was nursing a 3-month-old at the time.  Neither of us suffered any adverse reactions due to taking this medicine.  It took a week for the skin infection to start subsiding, but it did finally go away and hasn't returned (two months later).  
Sinus Irritation and Congestion	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	9/28/2009 8:02:40 AM	I am writing this review for my wife b/c she is still in bed after a week.  The side effects of Bactrim DS are horrible!  She has had a minor to moderate fever (100 - 103 degrees) the entire time, she hasn't eaten much, just about her entire body has broken out in a rash, no energy, headaches, etc.  The worst thing is we called the doctor that prescribed it and he just called in a 2nd prescription for Tamiflu.  I guess he thought she was coming down with the flu even though he tested her for the flu and it was negative.  It's a wonder more doctors aren't out of the office and in the court room.  I was slightly relieved when I found this site and more people had experienced what she is.  We were both extremely worried about what she has.  Now we know...stay away from Bactrim!!!

Chronic Bronchitis caused by Streptococcus Pneumoniae	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	9/25/2009 10:35:23 AM	The first night after taking this I had terribly chills/sweats.  My skin hurt, my head hurt, then I felt contant waves of nausea.  I then began vomitting.  I also felt like I was not breathing right.  Like gasping for a deep breath.  Since, I have felt incredible fatigue.  I called the Dr. and they did not think these symptoms could be from the meds.  Once I read the other reviews on here I believe it certainly is!  I will not be willing to take this anitbiotic again.  
Skin Infection	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	9/23/2009 4:46:16 PM	first i want to say, everybody reacts differently to meds, but is good to know possible side effcts/reactions, be very aware of your body while on med, call dr. with any questions. that said, i just finished last day of med, was on 2 pills 2 x a day for 10 days for infected cyst. had upset stomach and LOT of gas immedately, about 4-5th day started feeling like crap, tired, NO energy, weak, but still able to somewhat function(it just sucked). by about the 6-7th day, my feet and ankles started itching, HORRIBLY, thought maybe from walking in grass barefoot, until the next day when my legs started itching, then slowly up to my abdomen and arms. now the itching is even worse, no rash just intense itching. BUT, my infection is gone. would i take it again? if i HAD to.

I had taken this for 7 days and with no major or minor side effects to report. I was also given another for of antibiotic so it might have helped in controling the effects. Overall the med worked and I am begining to feel like my normal self again. The only complaint would be that I had to avoid being outside for long periods of time while the sun was out.

Skin Infection	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	25-34	8/25/2009 10:42:27 PM	I have been taking this medication for 7 days and it has cleared the infection significantly.  However, I have now developed a rash on the posterior part of my forearms.  I am also anxious all the time.  I have blurred vision shortly after taking the medication.  I will continue taking this medication for the remaining 3 days as prescibed by my doctor.  I am also using this in conjuction with Fluticasone Propionate Ointment which has made the itching subside, not only on the original infection but also on my forearms.

Scared the crap out of me.  I quit taking it and I still have the anxious and woozey feeling when I try to drive.  I wish I knew how long it takes for the side effects to subside.  I only took three pills for heaven sake. Have never had a reaction to medication before and I never want to again.

Skin Infection	dallastxgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	8/1/2009 10:57:43 PM	I've been on this medication for 3 days now for a staff infection.  The only bad side effect that I seem to be having is itching.  It's not listed as a side effect but I think it should be.  I was beginning to get a little freaked out by all the itching that I was having so I'm glad I turned to WebMd and read some of these reviews.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	45-54	7/20/2009 9:09:47 AM	I took Bactrim DS for an infection on the back of my head. My doctor said it was precautionary, so as to not get a staff infection. Neither he nor the pharmacist warned me of the side effects. I, unfortunately, did not notice the minuscule sticker on the medication that said to stay out of the sun. I was only in the sun about an hour one day and then in and out of my car a little during the day. On the 9th day of a 10-day prescription, I broke out in a terrible, itchy, red rash all over my body. I am now on my third day of the rash, which has also included mild fever and body aches. All I have done for 3 days is rest and sleep, which is completely out of character for me. I feel extremely weak. The medication did get rid of my infection wonderfully, but I'm not sure the side effects weren't worse than the infection. I could have possibly avoided these awful side effects had my doctor or pharmacist taken the time to tell me about the possibility. I am usually good at reading up on medications I take, but was overly tired from taking care of my husband, who is having health issues. If you take Bactrim DS, just be aware you MUST stay out of the sun. The side effects can be serious.

Skin Infection	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	7/18/2009 3:52:11 PM	I was prescribed 7 days onf this medication for a cellulitus staph infection on my arm. I was terrified to take it after reading reviews similar to the ones found here. However, I took it for seven days and had mild upset stomach, gas, and was only slightly more lethargic which I contribute to the fact that I am normally working out and being active and I was just laying around all today in order to rest the affected area. I did drink plenty of water and was not on any other forms of meds at the time. I think that most of these peoples experiences are the result of allergies as opposed to side effects. Also I feel that some people do not thuroughly read the instrutions given with this medicine such as eating before taking, drinking a lot of water, and staying out of direct sunlight. If we were to listen to everyone who had allergies and avoided things based on that, no one would eat peanuts, milk, eggs, wheat, or anything for that matter. Almost any material in existance has someone that is allergic to it. I do however feel that an allergy test should be requested before taking this due to the severity of reactions associated with this medication. It has been one week since I took my last dose and I am indeed alive still and with no aparent side effects remaining or appearing.

It really cleared up my symptoms.  Side effects were mild, a bit of stomach cramps.  I am only writing because vast majority of reviews are bad, I want to be the positive voice.  I wonder why most reviews are negative.  I am sure there are many many more people who have taken Bactrim with no problems, they just don't write reviews.  Too bad!

Been on keflex for 2 months then went off it and developed Cellulitus in my leg after swimming in a pool 3 months post op. ER doc gave me keflex again and this new drug Bactrim in case I had traces of staph in there. Ughh I took it 2 times a day like instructed for 2 days, all I could handle.Bactrim made me freak out, Felt like I did speed, coffee, crazy diet pills, had twitches and shakes. Felt like I had a constant blood sugar crash for an hour to 2 hours after taking the pill. I got very aggressive and had symptoms of extreme PMDD/PMS when I haven't had PMS in YEARS. My husband got nervous I was close to being violent. horrible drug and hope the keflex continues to clear up this infection because I will never take Bactrim again.

I was to take it for 10 days. By the 7th day, it cleared the infection up, but gave me severe hives. I had to go to an Urgent Care Center for help as I developed a fever and the hives kept coming on even after discontinuing the drug. The physician and pharmacist both told me they had never seen such a bad allergic reaction. The itching was incredible; my face is still beet-red and has now begun to peel. This was the worst experience I've ever had and I am encouraging every one I know to say &quot;NO&quot; when offered this medicine. I am still recovering and hope I don't develop scars from all the scratching I've done.

My 6 year old daughter took the medication two weeks prior for a staph infection and went through the same thing. This medicine could have killed us both.

I looked at another website that gives interactions and I noticed that there is an interaction with this drug and Potassium (which is in milk). I realized that right after I took this medication and right before I broke out in hives, I had a small glass of milk. I took two anti-histamines and hopefully the hives will go away soon.

First night I took it 2 hours before going to sleep, that night was without a doubt the worst night of sleep ever, I had terrible stomach pains, severe hot and oold sweats and insomnia. After sleeping maybe 2 hours the whole night I woke up and my muscles were extremely sore like I had run a marathon and a headache that made me think I was having a migrane. I tried to take it again the next day but conditions persisted. I have never had reactions like this to any drug, will never take Bactrim again and don't advise anyone to try it.

I  went to my family doctor this morning well, yesterday morning now because I have a boil on my hiney. They tried to pop it but nothing would come out. Before I went in it was about an inch wide and now it is (under the skin)bigger than a golf ball. I ate a sandwhich and took my first bactrim and a loratab 5mg. I started getting a headache so I thought it was the pain pill causing it. I took my second dose 12 hours later with food and I didnt take a pain pill. About 2 hours later I started feeling really nausuated. Has anyone here ever heard of a doctor giving bactrim for a boil?
Skin Infection	mer904, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	3/10/2009 5:43:57 PM	On bactrim 2x a day for 14 days along with Doxycycline for Staph skin infection. Don't know if it was the Bactrim or the Doxy but had stomach cramps &amp; nasau if I didn't take with food. Even with food still felt a little quesy. Aslo on day 7 developed a headache, red extremely itchy rash and fever. By day 9 the fever was 104.8 and the Dr. swapped the Bactrim out &amp; put me on Cipro which I cant start until the red itchy spots go away. The staph infection on my chin does look better. I think it's from the HOT salt water soaks I've been doing 4x a day not all these antibiotics that make me more sick.

But due to UTI persistent symptomps, dr put me on Bactrim 2x day for 10 days. I have been taking it about 1 hr after a meal or with a yougurt and lots of water. I took the 6th pill last night (day 3), with just 1 bite of a cake and water and this morning I woke up at 4:00am feeling extremely light headed. I checked my blood pressure and it was 165/115. Noticed that the whites of my eyes were cloudy and i could not focus my vision. I almost called 911 thinking that i am having a blood pressure attack. but my bl pressure came down after a while. I also feel lethargic and tingling in my feet. I noticed yesterday that i woke up feeling like my cheeks were heavy. i looked at my hands and feet to see if i am retaining water but i'm not - just in my cheeks.I am discontinuing this drug, too bad because it seems to be helping my UTI symptoms but the side effects scare me.

I thought I was dying! The pains in my neck/throat/&amp; back of my head was wrenching!! I've never had a side effects to any antibiotic like these...

I finished taking them knowing how crucial it is to finish your antibiotics. Now its the 11th day and the red rash his pretty much everywhere and it itches. So, probably not gonna be taking this one anymore.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	1/28/2009 3:29:42 PM	I began taking this antibiotic for treatment of acne.  About 2 weeks into it, I began getting severe headaches and stopped taking it after about 4 days straight of head-pounding.  Then, about a week after stopping the med, I broke out into a horrific rash on my legs, back, hands and feet and also experience some swelling of the face and lips. The itching kept me up for nearly 4 days!It is a shame the side effects were so severe because it was really helping with the acne problem.

Skin Infection	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	12/9/2008 3:57:58 PM	I was given two antibiotics for an ingrown toenail infection. I had taken one of the antibiotics in the past. I only took 1 dose the first day so I fell pretty sure the other antibiotic was not the problem.The side effects increased each day. Several hours after 1st dose I felt tired &amp; cold. The 2nd day,I had a head ache. On the 3rd day I had trouble thinking clearly. On the 4th day the headache became a migraine &amp; my tongue was very sore. On the 5th day I had nausea. Later that day I flet like I had the flu &amp; my ears were ringing.  That night I had hard shaking chills &amp; my temperture went over 103.  I never broke into a sweat. After taking tylenol it slowly came down.  After 7 hours it was down to 99.4.  I saw my doctor that morning &amp; he told me I had a drug fever reaction &amp; to never take it again.  He also said I could have more drug fever reactions for up to a week after I stoped taking the Bactrim DS.
Sinus Irritation and Congestion	 on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1			12/7/2008 2:41:52 PM	I took 1 pill and got horrible side affects. I felt warm and dehydrated all day. After I went to bed for the night (about 6 hours after taking it) I woke up shaking, just chilled to the bone and my heart pounding out of my chest. I managed to get a little sleep and when I woke up in the morning I was burning up and just hurt everywhere. My head felt like it was going to explode it hurt so bad. My stomach hurt so bad that I was doubled over in pain. I never took another dose. I called the pharmacy and they told me that those weren't &quot;known&quot; side effects. I will be calling my doctor in the morning.

Sinus Irritation and Congestion	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/25/2008 2:41:09 PM	Treated for severe bacterial (unknown) sinus infection (chronic sinusitis) with inflammed sinus, nasal passages, and one ear passage. Generic SMZ/TMP DS 800-100 TAB..2x/day for 14 DAYS.  This medication definately works, but was accompanied by extereme sickening nausea, some vomiting, extreme loss of appetite, weight loss (lost 6 pounds in 2 weeks), migraine level headaches, throbbing in head and behind eyes, dehydration, fatigue, faintness, light headedness, vision loss, insomnia if taken too late, hot flashes, joint aches, kidney aches; and on top of all this I was directed to take it with Mucinex-D 1200mg...oh my God. Bactrim/combination makes you feel worse tjan dying. My last dose is at 7 pm tonight. I have had not hives or rashes, just flushing of my skin and putting off heat. I am 10,000x better than before taking the medication, but the extreme nausea is still killing me. It might take me a few days to get used to being off the medication. I will never take it again, I will stick with the Z-pak.

However, after that point, the side effects kicked in.  No appetite, severe dry mouth, worsening of Bronchial symptoms, shortness of breath, and I was unable to sleep.  Have continued to take the medication in hopes that the full regiment might resolve my lung infection, however, with three and a half days left I am some what skeptical.

Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection	JenniferInTexas, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	11/14/2008 4:55:15 PM	I am hesitant to take any prescription but I really needed to get rid of my UTI. So my Doc put me on 2 pills a day for 3 days. With the first pill I noticed it clearing up and no side effects yet. Second pill I noticed I woke up in the middle of the night a lot and was hot on my face and neck. Third pill in the AM continued red face and still hot like a mild fever but I had no fever. Forth pill in the PM same thing as the night before waking up and still hot. Fifth pill I noticed my face even redder than yesterday I was irritable due to being hot on the face. Then the headache kicked in. I didn't take the last pill I didn't want to see what the next side effect would be. The headache though was the worst side effect, throbbing like a high blood pressure headache. I also noticed being in the sun made the red hot face worse. All though the Bactrim cleared my UTI successfully I don't think I will ever be taking this again. I'm not allergic to anything and that just scared me.

Skin Infection	Heather, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	9/24/2008 11:31:17 PM	I was prescribed the Bactrim DS twice daily for 10 days after a large abscess on my leg was drained... I took it for 9 days. It caused the first and only migraine I ever had in my life, and I was given a shot of imitrex to relieve it. I had hide grade fever between 101 and 102, and now, after taking the last pill about 4 days ago, I have experienced hives every day since the last one I took. I have found that claritin and benadryl help suppress them, but I am just wondering when the heck they are going to stop coming!! I have already been seen in emergency for this, but this medicine has done a lot of damage to me physically and in my professional life. I'll never take it again.

I then had severe stomach cramping to the point I couldn't stand up straight and my body began to shake. I continued to have the absolute worst kidney cramping of my entire life for 7 hours. Be very aware when you take this product. I read on another website that 40% of the people that take this medication have bad side effects.

I have also seemed to have extra energy during the day, almost frenetic.  Most worrisome has been a difficulty with breathing that I experienced when exercising on a rowing machine--I found it hard to draw in enough air and had to consciously try to make my chest relax.

The boil has cleared up well; but as of yesterday, I began to experience hives, itching, indegestion, and a sharp pain at the right side of my head above my ear.  The itching and indegestion is pretty bad at present and wondering if I should call doctor or go to emerg.  The other reviews that I have been reading are pretty scary and hope my symptoms clear up soon.

Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/3/2008 11:57:56 PM	I was told i had a severe uti infection. I had chills, no appetite, throwing up. After two doses i was in EXTREME pain. It seemed to intensify the the pain i already had with the infection. It gave me crazy anxiety and i was CONVINCED i was going to die and was having panic attacks. I had insomnia and intense diarrhea. I then broke out in a rash and a high fever. Also had weird symptoms like my teeth hurting and i couldn't eat anything. I spent the night shaking, rolling in pain, wanting to sleep, and praying for the medicine to kick in so i felt better. I saw doctor in the morning and she sent me straight to the hospital. At the time i thought it was my infection that made me feel this way, because i had never had a reaction to any medication before, later the doctor said it was a reaction to bactrim. That was the worst night of my life, i would never advise anyone to take this medicine ever!!!

After taking the medication with milk and food as directed, I still experienced nausea and vomiting.  I attempted to take it for two days of a three day regimen and cannot take it without severe side effects.  I am in the process of asking my obgyn for an alternative antibiotic medication to try. I have never experienced side effects from antibiotics before.  This was a terrible experience.

Not good news for me. But I am going to continue taking it and hopefully it will kill this nasty bug!

Skin Infection	Dottie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/9/2008 11:50:01 AM	I suffered a SEVERE allergic reaction that was almost fatal and left me hospitalized for ten days. My symptoms were extreme joint pain and nausea as well as fatigue. I began taking the medication as prescribed on a Monday, by Thursday evening I was feeling ill, and hospitalized the following Monday. My bone marrow stopped working and I had an almost ZERO white blood cell count. I realize this was a rare instance but anyone experiencing joint pain while taking this medication should notify their doctor. Headaches and nausea occurred but the joint pain was prominent for me.

Skin Infection	Allergic Reaction, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	35-44	6/20/2008 2:24:35 PM	AS we all know different medicines affect different people in different ways. After readiing other peoples comments, there were more bad than good. Which leads me to my comment. This is my second time taking this medication, each time for a staph infection. The first time I hade no side effect, and I guess it helped. The second time I had a savere allergic reaction and had to be admitted into ECU. I had only been on the med about three days and wasn't taking the full dosage prescribed. It started with the palm of my hands itching, then a few hours later my whole body was itching. I broke out in a red rash and hives all over. My feet and hands swole and my knee and elbow joints ached. By the time I got to the Dr. I was very faint and my blood pressure had dropped dangerously low. He gave me three injections, cortizone, predizone and one other I dont remember. He admitted me to the ER by way of ambulance during the ride my pressure dropped again. I was given an IV. The ER Dr. monitored me for about three hours and determined that it was an allergic reaction to Bactrim. He stabalized my pressure and heart rate and decided to discharge me with a prescription of predizone and over the counter benadryl. It has been 24 hour and only minimal improvements. After taking the predizone the rash got worse again, this time evan behind my ears. still have rash and itching. The swelling of the feet has went down. I guess it will just have to run it's course.

Middle Ear Infection	ClassicRox, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/17/2008 6:51:21 PM	This medication nearly killed me.  Almost every classic reaction I had.  After 2 days of taking Bactrim, I first had nausea, then vomiting, then muscle cramps, then heart palpitations, sweats, then my muscles froze, mostlty in my fingers and stomach.  After reaching the emergency room, i had a rash all over my legs and arms then my tongue swelled to twice its size.  It took 2 shots of benedryl and 2 shots of prendesione for my reaction to go away.  It took almost a week for my tongue and speech to return to normal.  Never again!

Sinus Irritation and Congestion	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	5/25/2008 11:37:02 AM	I was prescribed Bactrim DS for 10 days to treat a chronic sinus infection (3 months). I am on the third day, and I have had no side effects. Reading other reviews, I noticed that it took quite a few days of use for side effects to occur. However, I have taken Bactrim before with no problems so I doubt I will develop any severe reactions. My symptoms are improving steadily and that's a very good thing!

Not impacted tooth, doctors couldnt figure me out.  Dosed me with 1gram of Azithromycin at the ER and gave me Bactrim.  Only side affect was constipation but whatever it was cleared up in 72 hours.  Good medicine and very affordable as i do not have insurance.  $400 to sit in the ER through, is a different story.
