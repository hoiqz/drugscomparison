It works well with no intolerable side-effects or long-term toxicity (I've taken it for over 8 years), &amp; I'm able to remain a productive professional in large part because of it.My only wish is that an inhalable, fast-acting version be developed ASAP.

But the price of it is unbelible for 60 pills at 10mg cost over $1200.00 and its just THC copaired to the other 2 I mention the 1st one isunder $90.00 for 180 and the 2nd one at 30 mg for 200 is about $180(opets) so why does it cost so much? And its less dangerios and not as addicting as the other2.Lucky I live in a state that its legal to grow or buy it.But I can't cause of my kids.Smoking it works alot better that any pills cause it works right away. It just sucks I finel found a medicane that works but can't afford it.So I have to wait another 15 years plus to get any use from it.But if you can get it do so it helps with alot of other stuff that has been mention like migraines,leg,arms,backpain along with depression and so much more. In my opinion its better to take 4pills ady of the same meds than 25 pills that are 5 different kind of pills that sometimes make you feel sick or can take up to 1hr to work.And with marinol or pot it works alot faster better and doesn't make you sick

Marinol has helped bring back the joy of food! I had to play around with it a little. I don't think it works well if only taken as needed, because it takes too long to kick in. I find it much more efficient to regularly take 20 mg/day; divided in two seperate dosages. 10 mg in the morning and another 10 mg again later in the evening. Although, I did have side effects when I first started taking the med, they have all since dissapeared. The ease of use for marinol is less than other meds, as the high price of this medication makes it hard to find a pharmacy that regulary keeps this med on hand unless ordered, which takes anywhere from 2-3 days. On top of that, the medication is supposed to be kept refridgerated.
