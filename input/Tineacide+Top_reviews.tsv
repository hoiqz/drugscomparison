I was reluctant based on what I have read about how ineffective topical treatments for toenail fungus were, but I decided to try it since she reported a 97% success rate.  Well, it's been three months an there has been absolutely no measurable improvement.  So, that 97% was probably unfounded or skewed.  Probably didn't hurt that the doctor was also a distributor of the product.
