Stuffy Nose	Pepper, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	9/16/2012 9:07:01 AM	I become incredibly drowsy/sleepy after taking just one norel sr (substianed release). I had just slept 9 hrs. and then I took one norel tab yesterday morning after being awake only 3 hrs. I then slept ALL day long and straight through the following night for a total of being asleep 28.5 hrs. out of 32.5 hrs. This is the 3rd time norel has done this to me. I won't take it again. I was not taking any other meds. Typically I can never sleep more than 9 hrs. and never nap. A lot of meds make me super hyper or drowsy. The bottle says to take one pill twice a day for congestion and I had only taken one. My doc had said to try taking half or a quarter of the norel to prevent this extreme drowsiness/ sleepiness. I did this earlier this wk.but out of desperation and frustration with my allergies, I eventually took a whole pill. But even a whole pill hasn't helped my symptoms. If it did, I was too zonked to know it or care. I had no other side effects.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	6/9/2010 2:07:49 AM	The cost of medication is outrageous. I have strep and some sinus drainage. I could purchase tylenol and a cold pill for under $50.00 and still have money left.

Norel SR is supposed to be a pain killer. I thought Vicodin was the lowest brand pain killer you could be prescribed until I had this stuff. It's like tylenol, I took one, and i still had a migraine an hour later, so I took another and then I got dry heaves. I'm a professional pill-taker. I never puke. I still didn't sleep after the second one though. This stuff sucks.

I had excess nasal and throat discharge.  The doctor gave me a prescription for Norel and it worked fantastically.  Unfortunately, my insurance paid for 30 days but refuses to pay for any more.

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	1/7/2009 5:34:12 PM	After only one day of treatment, my stuffy nose and head were almost non-existent and my breathing was much easier as my chest was not as tight. The whole pill was too strong for me and after taking half of the pill (which is scored) I no longer had the stomach upset yet still had relief.
