Colon and Rectal Cancer that has Spread to Another Area	anxious, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	2	Female		6/20/2011 6:55:11 PM	In Feb 09 I was DX with colon cancer that masticated to my lungs first and then to liver.  I have been treated with various chemo drugs with out much effect.  In Jan 2011 I was started on IV Chemo Drug Camptosar IV with Erbitux.  I have experienced all the skin rash side effects listed in all the above reviews.  However my CAE had been stabilized around 6.6 - 8.7.  However, since being on Exbitux my CAE has increased dramatically over the last 4 months from 6.9 to 24.5.  So far my Oncologist has not been able to determine why this is happening.  Some reviewers above experienced just the opposite effect of Erbitux on their CAE numbers.  This has me very concerned.

After a short ambulance ride from the cancer center to the hospital, he was stabilized in ER &amp; is now in intensive care &amp; feeling better.  They are concerned that he might have had heart damage &amp; are currently doing a blood test every 6 hours hoping his level will stabilize or decline. Other than his oral cancer, he has been very healthy with no known allergies or other medical problems.  Very scary.

Onc adjusted dose and that helped a lot. Still have rash on chest &amp; back and some on face/neck, but very tolerable.  The extremely dry skin and the splitting of the skin on fingers, toes, feet and legs is less tolerable, but my CEA has dropped in 4 months significantly for the first time in 1.5 yrs. It's worth it for me!

Cancer Involving the Head or Neck	dw, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	11/18/2009 2:05:19 PM	I am am Male diagnosed with phase 2 throat cancer in the tonsils. First few weeks on Erbitux were fine and then the acne kicked in. Doctors prescribed minocyline and it mostly cleared up. But by week 4 my gut was unable to take solid foods (lost 40 lbs during treatment) after treatment my gut was still bad and tests showed H.Pylori so this may have been present all along but early treatment would have made my conditions much less severe (Erbitux targets all mucosal cells). If you have stomach problems do not let your doctor ignore them as a course of Losec would likely have kept the H.Pylori and tender stomach at bay long enough to finish treatment. 4 weeks after Erbitux and radition are finished my gut is just starting to accept solids (after treatment for H.Pylori)though my mouth has taken this long to start to heal from the radiation. Still suffering from extreme dry mouth though this from what I was told before treatment is a result of damage to the salivary glands done by the radiation treament. The surface skin on my neck healed in record time likely due to a mixture of skin lotions and one in particular seemed to work wonders (called Natures Aid). I only wish I healed internally as quick! Going for a follow up CAT scan in 3 weeks so keeping my fingers crossed.      
Other	Anang, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1	Male	25-34	9/22/2009 5:08:07 PM	There is another drug called Nimotuzumab that does the same thing as Erbitux, but does not cause any rashes or other skin conditions. The drug doesn't have to cause a rash to be effective.Nimo has not yet been approved in U.S. (going thru trials), but was just approved in Mexico. Already approved in India, China, and about 20 other countries. Just search for it on any search engine, you won't have trouble getting more info.

I have experienced extreme dry skin and acne on my face.  Antibiotics and over the counter Proactiv seem to be helping and my face is getting better.

Other	Dave, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	5/17/2009 7:49:06 PM	Because the caregivers felt that the tumor in my lung had actually started in the head/neck area this medication was prescribed. After four weekly injections a chest x-ray revealed the tumor was larger and the side effects included an ugly red rash from the waist on up, extreme acne which prompted a trip to the dermatology department,  a numbness on the soles of both feet, a chronic dry mouth condition and changes in bowel movements. As this was going on it was getting more and more difficult to breath.  The doctors made no mention of stopping this treatment and allowed it to continue for five more weekly sessions.  Another chest x-ray showed the tumor was even larger than before and it was then that I said NO MORE ERBITUX!!!  This medication messed up my body with no benefit whatsoever!!I am now
Other	JaxTastic, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	4/15/2009 10:31:44 AM	I am taking Erbitux for NSCLC (lung cancer), am 30 years old. Not sure how effective it is, but if effectiveness is gauged by the severity of rash... this stuff works. I have rash all over my back, face, head, stomach and my skin is awfully thin. This is my maintenance drug so hopefully will not be on it forever because yeah it's kind of nasty on the fingernails/toenails. Besides that I look ugly and people think I am weird... compliments my baldness.

I've been taking Erbitux for about 1.5 years.  I have experienced severe skin problems: swelling of my hands,many fissures on hands and fingertips, Hair loss and much DRY skin which flakes off everywhere.  I don't know how I have any skin left!  I've tryed just about every lotion and cream,OTC and RX with little relef.  Now I wear surgical gloves at home 24/7 which seem to protect my poor fingers alittle and allow me to do chores. My fingers bleed and are really painful so I also use New Skin liquid as a barrier over the open areas.  That stuff really burns when you first put it on but it is a good protective barrier once it drys. Hair loss seems to be very common- I buy wigs from the cancer society and have fun changing hair styles. I have fairly recently developed severe acne-type sores primarily on my head. They are very irritating, itchy and cause nasty exudate. I've tryed calamine lotion to dry it out, oral antibiotics work well and I'm now trying topical antibiotics--I'll see how it works. Well, you know...it's ALWAYS SOMETHING!

After liver resection in 7/07, was put on erbitux along with Irenotecan and 5 months post op, the liver is growing back healthy with no signs of cancer.  The acne appeared on my face after the first treatment then on the neck later.  Skin became severely dry and a month after treatments ended I am having problems with finger and toenails ingrown because the skin is so thin.  Also started losing my hair in the last few weeks.
