I have been using it for the past three months and 100% satisfied with the results. Before , I used to be worried about checking my diabetes. I used metformin with glyburide and lantus injection. The results were unfavorable. Now I am not afraid to check my diabetes since the reading is where I wanted it. Great pill. I am so pleased. Now, Health First told me that they do not cover that pill. and so I discussed it with my doctor. If I have to scrape the last penny to buy it, I will keep on using this pill.

The first week was pure torture, as it tends to give you the runs.  After that it eased up.  One bad side effect is the weight gain.  I am working on that aspect, but if I cannot start losing weight, bye bye Prandin.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	IMREA, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		9/17/2010 4:32:26 AM	I HAVE BEEN TAKING PRANDIN FOR 16 YEARS WITH EXELENT RESULTS. STARTED WITH 1+1/2MG AND INCREASED TO 3+1/2 OVER TIME. ALL OF A SUDDEN I STARTED TO GET LOW BLOOD SUGAR REACTIONS.[GLUCOSE LEVEL ~60] NOW TAKE ONLY 1 PILL OF 1/2MG AT DINNER, EAT ANYTHING AND MY BLOOD ALWAYS READS GOOD. ARE THERE ANY RECORDS OF DIABETES CURING ITSELF LIKE THIS? COULD SOME OTHER MEDICAL CONDITION BE EFFECTING MY BODY'S INSULIN PRODUCTION? IS THIS A MIRICAL?

I had lows at odd times of the day. With Prandin I could have more self controll.  Now since I am on diuretics, and unable to exercise, I find my blood sugar going higher than normal. I am going to see my doctor to raise the dosage. I don't want to lose the ability of self control.

I haven't seen a reading like that in a very very long time.  I felt jittery so i ate a small snack.  I am eager to see how this medicine will do in the next few days.

Other	AAW, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	6/25/2009 2:21:33 PM	Have taken Prandin for the last three months with each meal and it has been very effective in reducing blood sugar to below 100. However, it makes me a little jittery that I am slowly tolerating. I have reduced Prandin intake to just breakfast (my biggest meal) and that seems to be the best compromise.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	?, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	11/20/2008 3:36:13 PM	After having a stroke lost a great deal of weight and endocrinologist prescribed this and I got off insulin. Took Prandin for six months then lost more weight and stopped. Two years later put back on 20lbs and started taking Prandin again it helped me get A1C down to 6.3 from 7.0. Love the ease of taking before meals but sugars tend to fluctuate greatly from low 60's to over 200 depending time of day and amount of activity. I have noticed onset of neuropathy type symptoms and recently strong pains in my arms since restarted Prandin use. Went to cardiologist regarding arm pain though heart is still pretty healthy found it interesting that someone else noted the leg and arm pains... I had a great deal of leg muscle difficulty which I attributed to Crestor but now am wondering if it could be the Prandin? Have been diabetic 18 years and have good eye sight and good kidney health so I will continue Prandin as long as the Dr. says. Easier to travel with than insulin though that worked well while i needed it too.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female		8/27/2008 8:12:51 AM	My doctor has me take different strengths of Prandin depending on my meal size. Used to be on Starlix-it wasn't helping my sugars at all but Prandin seems to be keeping me under control very well.

I get very listless and have arm pain when I attempt to lift them.  Also. the neuropothy seems to have if anyting increased as my hands and feet feel a &quot;tingling&quot; sensation associated with PND
