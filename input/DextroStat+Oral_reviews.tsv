Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/1/2010 3:07:38 AM	I have been on this medication for only a few days and so far I really like it. I take 10 mg in the morning and another 10 mg at lunch time. I was on Methylin for years taking 20 mg twice a day and I had bad anxiety and I was irritable but I could concentrate. The doctors switched me to dextrostat and I can concentrate, complete tasks, and not become overwhelmed with multiple things in front of me to complete. I don't have the anxiety or irritation and I seem to be in a better mood throughout the day compared to when I was on Methylin.

Once in high school, but I discontinued it because it made my arms shake.  I take it now, 14 years later, and I really like the obvious results. It is a bit difficult to remember to take it as often as I should.  Also, I tend to forget to eat, when I'm on it.  I learned early not to drink soda with it, as my heart beat felt too fast.My short term memory is much better when on this medication. I forget less words and pay attention to conversations better. I feel motivated to accomplish many things. That last one was why I wanted to treat my ADHD again.  I found I wasn't doing anything.  I thought it was my personality, lazy, until I researched the disorder again, for my son's ADHD.

My problem is I forget to take it every several hours.  I take it along side prozac for depression.   If I take too much I get sleepy. It is not good to drink alot of coffee.   There are times when I go off back to typical add behavior .   Taking  this drug has spared me alot of pain of add.  They make you feel like a criminal at the drug store since it is considered a class A narcotic.

It truely gave me my life back.  Now, Shire discontinued making the Brand Dextrostat and the Generic made by BARR is not even close to the same thing.  Not only does it not work, it makes me anxious and really raises my blood pressure.  So, I have these awful side effects on top of sleeping all day.  It really is not worth it and I am afraid I will have to stop taking it and go back to having no life at all.  I am angry that the FDA has let this happen.  A Generic should be EXACTLY the same medication, with the EXACTLY the same ingredients!!!  Please, if you have the same problem, report it to the FDA so something can be done about it!!!  This is too important!  Thanks.

I believe ADD/ADHD is under diagnosed in adults that were not diagnosed as children. All my life I have had to live by making myself notes for everything from Dr's appts to what room I was goingto clean the nest day. I donthave to make notes for my life anymore when taking this medication. I think I am on to low of a dose though. Does anyone know what the proper dose of this medication is?Thanks, Ambe

It was being taken for Chronic Fatigue.  I could do most of my work at home which we have several businesses being run from my home.  He claimed too, they are taking brand name Dextrostat off the market and you can only get generic.  He did then claim to raise the mg. to 15 mg. from 10 mg.  It is a brown and clear capsule and it did curb my appetite, but left me so weak, I could take one to go to sleep.    I sure would like to know if it is truly what he said it was.  I do know, I am going to have to go to a different Doctor just to try and find something that will work.  I am going to have to baby sit this weekend and it is impossible for me to take care of myself, much less two small children.  I am 62 yrs. old.  I was on Dextrostat 10 mg. for about 10 years.  Maybe even longer.  My Doctor left town this whole week and I cannot get anything called out and it has left me in such a bind.  I sure wish you guys could help me!  I know that is impossible, as this is just a survey.  The brand name was a yellow tablet and that is the one that worked for me.  When he switched over to generic, it only made me sleep.  Are they truly taking this off the market?(Brand Name?)

I experimented with dosage and found a very low dose once in the morning kept me from eating disorders and sleep loss.  For me 5mg a morning made a life altering change for the better.  However due to high blood pressure and heart they took me off six months ago.  Now I'm 50 pounds overweight still have high blood pressure and am contantly depressed and definately living a poor quality life.  The weight and inactivity itself will prob due me in at the end.  When will doctors wake up.

Dextrostat-- Dexedrine along with an antidepression med,  changed my life.. However I have heart problems and the Dr's are wanting to take me off the amphetamines, but, I wont have  the mental quality of life I have had in the past 5-6 years and I   do not want to go back into depression..  Between a heart attack and Depression...  I'd rather bite the dust than to spend one day in the depths of depression!!!!!!!!!
