Diarrhea	MrsVega, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	7/13/2012 6:11:15 PM	I've been taking two tablets, four times daily, for over a month to control diarrhea. I'm being tested to see what is causing the diarrhea (the doctors can't figure it out). The medication is hit-and-miss. One day it will work then it won't work the next day. I've had terrible heart burn while taking it so I have to take an OTC heart burn medication with it. Drink lots of water and remember to take it before you eat or it's useless.

Diarrhea	JennC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	1/12/2012 7:42:58 PM	I was put on this medication to help treat my diarrhea predominant IBS.  It worked wonders and allowed me to have a somewhat normal life.  However after about 6yrs of using this medication.  I noticed that I had no energy amongst other issues, and I was clearly addicted to it.  I detoxed off of this medication, a week of hell.  Since coming of this medication I have been feeling a lot better, and my IBS actually is better now off the medication then when I was on it.  I would say to use this medication as a last resort, it does work for what its intended to do, but is highly addictive.

Diarrhea	D1958, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	5/2/2011 4:17:39 PM	After 30 years of suffering with Crohns disease and a re-section 25 years ago, I had been taking other medications (Cholystyramine).  Lomotil is helping but I cannot seem to get the dose right.  I continue to have accidents at night during my sleep, and at times run to the bathroom during my work day.  It also causes horrible nausea if taken on too much of an empty stomach.  I never know if it is going to work or not, and this causes me great anxiety.  I am taking 4 tablets per day and my pharmacist told me I can take up to 8.  After experimenting, taking it on an empty stomach makes no difference at all as opposed to eating a light meal (recommended with my experience).

Unfortunately a section of my colon had to be removed, also. I suffered with extreme diarrhea during chemo but thought it would stop after chemo was over.  That has been 4 months ago and still having extreme diarrhea. I would not be able to go anywhere without this drug much less enjoy a dinner out.

The only side effect that might be attributed to this drug is a bit of recurring vertigo.

Then my PCP prescribed Lomotil and it was a miracle for me.  Over time, the effects have diminished somewhat, but I would recommend it to anyone with IBS-D.  It has very little side-effects and it's not overly expensive either.  So go ahead men &amp; women too, don't be afraid to ask your doc to prescribe Lomotil to help yourself.

Other	anonymous, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	3/22/2009 6:39:26 AM	It is the only medicine that works. I have Chrons. IBS. The reason it has to be prescription is there is something addictive in it. Otherwise, over the counter it wouldn't work as well as it does. Atropine would be taken out completely. And I wish the atropine was over the counter. Maybe one day ,it will be untouched and over the counter. This drug works perfectly and Immodium for me doesn't work at all. Anyone with diarheaa, don't hesitate. Ask your doctor.

After surgery for Crohn's over 30 years ago, I had severe and chronic diarrhea. I began taking Lomotil at that time.  I've taken 4 pills a day since then.  I eat anything I want and have controlled bowel movements twice daily, morning and evening.  I could not have continued working without Lomotil.  I wish they would deregulare its use.  The generic version is almost as expensive as the brand name, but it's worth the cost.  My doctor told me I was probably addicted, but I feel it's like insulin.  I need it to have a good quality of life.

I spoke to my doctor about this problem and he prescribed Lomotil for me.  I cannot believe how quickly it works.  I only have to take one pill and my stomach and intestines are all nice and quiet.  It's a miracle drug to me!!!

That is when I started taking Lomitil (2 pills 3x per day) I have been able to eat anything I want. Without it I have 24 hour diarrhea, which is not an option. that is almost 10 years since the operation and I have not had one problem.

I took it at bedtime and the next day I was fine.  No 4 or 5 times on the toilet before going to work.  Very effective and I just use now as needed.  Not a cure, but it will give you fast relief.  Excellent drug.

Diarrhea	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/25/2008 9:51:00 AM	My (former) doctor first prescribed this for a bout of gastroenteritis, then gave me a prescription to take as needed for IBS with diarrhea. Extremely effective, with no notable side effects. Supposedly Imodium is just as effective, but not in my experience.
Diarrhea	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	7/22/2008 4:42:17 PM	I was on Lomotil for 1 1/2yrs. The dr started with 2/day. When I was taken off because it wasn't working at all, he had me taking 1500/per month - that equals 10 5x/day. When I changed RX stores, the new pharmists flipped out!!! He was the only one that seemed to be aware of the damage Atropine could do to ones eyesite.  And he was right.  When I was started on this med I had better than 20/20 vision. Now I can't see anything with out contacts or glasses on at any distance. Everything is very blurry ALL the time with out them.  And on top of that, my chronic diarrhea from medical resectioning did not improve at any doseage!  If you value your eyesite, please be careful.  Be sure you have regular vision checks so you'll be aware if its changing and can make adjustments.  Although, by that time you may be to late, like I was.

Diarrhea	Pat,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		11/18/2007 1:27:11 PM	I've tried Imodium, Pepto bismol and other products. Lomotil is the only that controls my colitus. It's very frustrating to me that it is classified as a controlled substance and available by prescription only. It may create some dependence but that is better than the alternative, which for me is being pretty much housebound. I'm hoping someone come to their senses and make it an otc drug.

Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	10/14/2007 8:14:25 AM	I have been taking a cortico steroid (Endocort EC) since this past June 2007. I have microscopic colitis and IBS. After going off the Endocort and replacing it with Lomotil I am surprised and very pleased. Lomotil is working to keep my colitis in remission and also helps for stomach pains when I have a IBS flare-up. Lastly, Lomotil is far less expensive than Entocort which is important to me since I am retired and get only social security and recently joined a AARP plan to cover what Medicare does not.

I have not taken it every day for that long, but my physician alternated between Lomotil and other drugs meant for treating diarrhea.
