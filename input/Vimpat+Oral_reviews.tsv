Note it was hard to get use to side effects were apparent at each increase, but if you stick it out they do disapear. I have been siezure free (at least grand mal) for 4 months now and started this medication 8 months ago. Now the only side effect I can report is the dizzeness and that only lasts 20 minutes or so then goes away, I call it my kicking in stage. I really encourage those starting this med to stick it out and the side effects will lessen dramatically once you are on it long enough and reach your proper dosage. And do not DRINK on this med, I did once at a friends birthday at the begining and it was uphorea at first then ill and then siezure. If I had not had acholhol I think I would have been siezure free for at least 6 months. Otherwise side effects were managetable on increases of dosages. Looking foward to 1 year of siezure free so I can Drive again. I had a trama related leision and developed Complex Partial Temporal Lobe Epilesy with secondary Grand Mal. Inoperatable I might add as leision is to far into brain, medication is all I have to help and the guiney piggen I endured affected every aspect of my life. This by far has been the most effective and longest lasting. We are (my entire family)watching me closly for the complex partial temporal lobe epilespy, so far it appears now the my other drug Tegretol has been adjusted that I am not experiencing blankness and stiffening as much. We have been marking it on the calender and I month has past including my menstrual cycle - Yeah. Eleven months to go, geting my life back thanks to a great persistent Neurlogist and Lacosimide (Vimpat).

Makes  you  dopey, uncoordinated, like drunk.  Head, room spinning, NOT good for my elderly father, as makes him more likely to fall.  Keeps him awaks all night, and tired next day, once again, more likely to fall.  Does control partial seizures; however, when on this, he has no short term memory, can find words to say something, has no appetite, and way too tired.  If you are elderly, DO NOT TAKE this drug!!  Dilantin will control partial/comples and petit mal seizures as well as convulsive, grand mal seizures!  Going back to Dilantin.

Right now this medication is horrible for me i sweat all day regardless if im in air or not, just sitting around the house, it is horrible. I am really moody and im taking two anti depressants, i get chest pains, my anxiety is getting bad again, i would stay away from this medicine if possible. But everyone is different, it worked okay for me in the beginning after getting my dosage right but now its like its stopping for me. I am staring off all the time and having muscle tremors to where i drop things, my neurologist says im fine but those are types of seizures. i really hope that will help others and there decision on being on vimpat.

Onset was birth.  I am currently on Vimpat 600mg/day and Klonopin 1mg/night to help control noctournal breakthrough.  I also take Buspar, Zoloft, and Xanax for depression and  anxiety.  Vimpat has been very successful in controlling my seizures.  While I have still had the occasional breakthrough, they have been significantly less severe, and have not progressed to complex-partial.  When I first started taking Vimpat, my weight went crazy - Up and down, and I was struggling with focus and irritation.  My Primary Physician added Zoloft 100mg/day at that time and 90% of side effects from the Vimpat vanished.  Depression is a potential side effect of Vimpat, so use care and seek treatment if necessary.
Additional Medication to Treat Partial Seizures	Jenny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	4/7/2012 9:57:15 AM	I started taking Vimpat 1 week ago along with my other medication: Keppra, Celexa, Synthroid, Gabapentin, Camila. The dr started me on just 50 mg, twice a day, and already I am feeling the side effects, a bit of confusion, word retrieval difficulties and depression. I'll be increasing the dosage up to 100 mg, twice a day, next week. Will these side effects go away over time?I also am going to slowly stop taking Gabapentin the week after next. I haven't had a seizure since I started taking Vimpat, but I wasn't having seizures daily. I usually have about 7 a month. I hope this new med stops my seizures, but I just don't like the side effects I am experiencing already. Has anyone had similar difficulties as well that improved? Thanks.

There are some muscle spasms and I find myself stiffening out at times, like a seizure would.  My big concern is the feeling of withdrawl if the next dose is a bit late.  You feel the need like a heroin user would.  I guess this is good as a way of reminding you that it's time for your meds, but still a bit scarey. For the first time in my life, I find myself in need of a nap during the middle of the day, and problems concentrating at times.  This may be increased due to the fact that I take five additional anticonvulsants, but may have found a medication that my seizures respond to.

I read all these bad reviews and was scared to try it. I am amazed I have had no real side effects from the drug and could not be happier.

I have a VNS which helped tremenously, but was still having about 6 seizures per month.  Now I am having 1 seizure per month.  It can cause side effects of other medications to come out. I was taking it along with Topamax. It caused side effects of the Topamax to come out, and all but debilitated me. My doctor cut back on the amount of Topamax, and the side effects disappeared. When my doctor increased the Vimpat to 600mg per day I was seeing double, and feeling drunk. He quickly dropped me back to my original dose. Two weeks ago I dropped the Topamax altogether. Have had 1 seizure, but that is what I expect.  Time will tell if increasing my dosage, or adding the Topamax will be needed.I love what Vimpat has done for me!

It did not give me stomach problems like others have said, I was able to tolerate taking it physically, it just took a lot out on my body emotionally and it didn't work.  it was also very expensive with no generic and my neuro. doesn't wan't me using generic, insurance doesn't pay for the &quot;real stuff&quot;.  good luck!

Neurontin, Dialantin, Depakote, ect. only helped so much for so long.  Keppra was a death pill.  That stuff kept me in bed over 22 hours a day.  Topamax and Lamictal worked so so together but after upping the Lamictal to high it almost killed me.  Now having Topamax and Vimpat together I seem to have a little more energy and not always tired.  But I did break out sweating more.  Needed a new script for facial clensers for my face to get rid of the rocky mountains because the Proactive and Biore did not help.  Hopefully this will keep the seizures well under control.

She went from having seizures every 5-10 days and being on 4 medications at the same time,( Keppra, topamax, depakote, and vimpat) to gradually being reduced to Keppra and vimpat. After less than two months of adding vimpat, the seizures have stopped. It's been 1 year now since the seizures have stopped and she's living a normal teenage life, no side affects, full of athletic activities....Thank God!

I have had more seizures and problems after starting this drug. I dont know if my Dr. needs to increase the doses or if this drug just doesn't work for me. This medicine also is very expensive, my insurance refuses to cover it.

His partial seizures seem to be under control but he is now having grand mal seizures more often now that he has been taking the Vimpat. No medications have been decreased or taken away.He is currently taking Lamictal, Trileptal and the Vimpat. The plans were to remove the Trileptal slowly but now wondering if that would make things even worse! Has anyone else had problems with the Vimpat increasing seizures?

After a bit I feel extremely tired, and I feel very calm, but not very energetic.  It feels like my volume button has been turned way down.  The sleep part is nice because I was having a hard time sleeping before I just have to remember to take it later at night.  If anyone experiences the same or has advice to help that would be nice.

I'm concerned with what I've read re suicidal behavior with all these meds (let alone a combo of them).  Since taking vimpat, I've become more easily frustrated, lack energy and have thoughts of taking my life.  I can't attribute this all to the meds I'm on, but more to a decrease in quality of life.  I also suffer from poor balance, muscle weakness, a perceived decrease in cognitive ability, continued seizures and occasional double vision.  I'm a burden on my family and co-workers.  It seems that these feelings have come to the forefront since I've been on Vimpat.

I started about 4 weeks ago. My dr originally had me to increase up to 200mg/day, but it made me very lightheaded, constipated and fatigue. I decreased back down to 100mg/day and it has actually decreased my partial seizures by 50%.  I also noticed that I'm not as irritable as I was when on Keppra alone. So far I like the interaction.

I see no difference in coverage to Lyrica, but I have found benefits: my long-term memory has improved and I feel more alert. For dizziness, I recommend taking on a full stomach (after a meal)and take 12 hours apart. I haven't decided if I will continue with Vimpat or return to Lyrica. Note to englishbonnet: shame on your husband.  ALWAYS take your medicine on time.  NO EXCUSES for missing a dose.

I missed my medication one night and the following morning and that evening all Hell broke loss. As soon as the Hospital shot me up with extra Dilantin I recovered o.k. The worst was, The hospital had no Vimpat to give me and no Pharmacey ina 50 mile radious had a supply either. Everyone said the same thing. It was to newso no one carried it untill it was proven better. My recomedation is STAY AWAY FROM IT. ITS NOT PROVEN YET. IT ALSO HAD BAD SIDE EFFECTS. MAINLY DEPRESSION AND ADDITION TO IT. I WAS LUCKY I GUESS, AFTERMY 3RD GRAND MALL THAT NIGHT I RECOVERED WHEN I WAS PUMPED WITH DILANTIN. SO I NEVER TOUCHED VIMPAT AGAIN.  I've only had one Petite seizure in  thelast four months thanks to a Christian man that was their and did hands on prayer.  Jesus is  the True Healer.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	10/13/2009 5:24:35 PM	A few months ago I was prescribed Vimpat for neuropathic pain in my feet/legs due to a severe ms exacerbation (I could not take Lyrica or Neurontin because it can cause swelling of the feet). I started taking 50 mg, then 100 mg and finally up to 150 mg. of Vimpat. However, after just a couple of weeks of taking Vimpat, my body started to shake often throughout the day and sometimes had very strong tremors. Also had serious memory problems. I have always been a person who finishes other people's sentences but when I was taking Vimpat, other people were finishing my sentences for me (very frustrating). A new mri of my brain proved there were no new lesions so my doctor suspected that Vimpat was the likely problem. After I stopped taking Vimpat, my body stopped shaking, the tremors stopped and my memory is back to normal. I took Vimpat for a total of three months and it never really addressed the pain. NOTE: if you do take Vimpat or need to get it, you can go to www.vimpat.com and click on &quot;Get your Savings Card&quot; on the bottom of the home page where it says &quot;Vimpat Savings Program&quot;. After you sign up, you can print a coupon that gives you $30.00 off each Vimpat prescription/refill for up to a year. I have very good insurance but it still cost me $80.00/month without the coupon. These days every little bit helps!

He has been on it since a July video EEG at the hospital. I thought it was helping. His seizures come approx every two weeks for one night and usually he only has about three. It seems that accidentally forgetting just one dose of both medications induced five seizures approx an hour apart and then one when he was at work. He's forgotten a combination of previous medications before and never had this reaction to it. I think the Vimpat might have increased the number of seizures he had when he missed his dose. It has caused severe depression and huge mood swings, paranoia and a feeling of poor self-worth, dizziness, and a general loss of memory. We are not that happy about this. We will be seeking advice and a possible change in medications again.
