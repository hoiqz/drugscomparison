I went to the eye doctor for a routine exam mainly wanting to get new glasses. At the appointment some of the questions the doctor was asking I thought was a little strange but it was things that was happening to me and I was just ignoring the symptoms. Losing my vision when bending over, dizziness, and headaches. I started with the tests MRI (which was normal) Lumbar Punture (36) and blind spots in my field vision tests. It was confirmed I had Pseudotumor Cerebri. My next mission was to find out, why did this happen to me? No doctor could tell me why so I started my own research. I'm a CPhT at a hospital so I had alot of info at my fingertips. I came across birth control and thought this could be a cause, since I had Mirena IUD inserted in October 2010. All the literature on Mirena does not say anything about Pseudotumor Cereri but Norplant does. They both have levonorgestrol as the active ingredient. So I took this to the many doctors I was seeing at the time. To my surprise no one wanted to hear what I was saying. When I found out this info I made the appointment to have Mirena removed! I am currently taking Diamox 1500 mg daily and it's been 5 months since having Mirena removed. Other than the side effects from the Diamox (tingling sensations,ringing ears,tired all the time) I am getting better. No one is going to tell me any different that Mirena was not the cause of Pseudotumor Cerebri.

Increased Eye Pressure caused by Another Disease	Damien, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/22/2011 4:06:09 PM	In 1991 I was told I had sudo tumor and would have to have a spinal tap with in 48 hours to relieve the preassure in my brain causing my headaches.It was a relief to finally put a name to what had been causing my extreme headaches for over 5 years. I was put on Diamox 1200mg. a day and for the first 2 weeks it seemed like I lived in the rest room. On the up side was the fact that I lost 12 lbs. in 2 weeks of fluid. I saw the doctor weekly for vivion field test for the first year and then monthly for a year and then every 4 months for a year. I'm down to once a year now and have been in remission for over 7 years. I found that a LOT of certain foods will still trigger headaches so I'm very carefull about what I eat. I had suffered the headaches for over 5 years and had been to tons of doctors who kept telling me I was making the headaches up just so I could get pain pills and that there was NOTHING wrong with me.How many of you had heard the same thing ? THANKS to Dr. Derman at Baylor College of Medicine here in Houston, Texas I was able to finally see the right doctors and start my road to recovery.My vision is normal and as long as I stay away from the foods that I know will set me off I.m doing ok. I also figured out that extreme heat will cause my headaches. Not good when you live in Texas in the summer..lol. Hopefully this will help others to know there is a light at the end of the tunnel and if I can be of help or just someone to talk to you can reach me at badboy05443@yahoo.com. Damien

Increased Eye Pressure caused by Another Disease	a.g., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/20/2010 4:39:59 AM	I have pseudo-tumor and have been on 500mg of Diamox two times a day for almost a year. I've shed a few pounds due to the fact that anything carbonated doesn't taste well and it's helped the excessive fluid levels I had. I did have a lot of nausea in the beginning but found it was due to low potassium levels so I took a supplement and all was better.

BEFORE I WAS DIAGNOISED I SUFFERED TERRIBLE MIGRAINES THAT LAST FOR DYAS AT A TIME AND MY EYESIGHT WAS GOING DOWNHILL FAST; ONCE I STARTED TAKING THE MEDICATION THE MIGRAINES HAVE BEEN FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND MY EYESIGHT IMPROVED. I HAVE BEEN ON THE MEDICATION FOR OVER 2 YEARS (SOON TO BE TAKING OFF THE MED.), I STILL HAVE TINGLING HANDS AND FEET FROM TIME TO TIME BUT I'LL TAKE THAT THAN THE MIGRAINES AND POOR EYESIGHT ANYTIME!!

FOR THE FIRST SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS IT WORKED GREAT. I HAD THE TYPICAL SIDE EFFECTS LIKE THE TINGLING IN HANDS AND FEET AND NO BEING ABLE TO DRINK CARBONATED DRINKS. BUT AFTER ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS IT GRADUALLY STOPPED WORKIN BRING BACK ALL OF MY SYMTOMS, VISION PROBLEMS HEADACHES, RING EARS, BUT I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HAVE IT WORK SO WELL AT FIRST. I GUESS IT JUST DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK FOR EVERYONE
Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	9/2/2009 5:53:50 AM	I took this drug for pseudo tumor a few years ago.  I'd had constant headaches for 4 months with no relief, and my vision was going downhill.  After about 2 months on this drug all symptoms disappeared.  The side effects though are HORRIBLE.  Tingling in my hands and feet, and most annoying was the fact that any carbonated beverage had no sensation of carbonation (for lack of a better way to describe it).  It was like drinking flat soda - you could &quot;feel&quot; the bubbles, but you couldn't &quot;taste&quot; them.  Overall, I'm satisfied and would gladly take the drug again if needed (no soda is a small trade).
Increased Eye Pressure caused by Another Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/20/2009 10:43:21 AM	This medicine is making me function again!  I have been on for a little over for 3 weeks.  I had an opening pressure of 46 for a lumbar puncture and was diagnosed with psuedo tumor.  Since I started taking this medicine, my vision has improved, my had does not feel like it's splitting in two.  The only side effects are the tingling in my feet but I eat a banana and it goes right away.  I also cannot drink soda but I don't need it anyway!  Very Happy!
Altitude Sickness	Ave Maria, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/24/2009 10:48:03 PM	I've taken this medication the last 2 times we went skiing in Vail and was so pleased with the results! Because of altitude sickness, I was afraid I couldn't go to Vail anymore, but Diamox/acetazolamide really helped prevent the headaches, nausea and sleeplessness.
Other	EJK, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male		6/5/2009 11:54:48 AM	Given after cataract surgery 500mg SR, then proceeded to go into total renal failure.I am a cardiac patient, who has been on wafarin therapy for many years with no complications, until I was prescribed Diamox. I would question if this medication is really needed when used profalacticly to prevent increased eye pressure following uncomplicated cataract surgery!!!!!

I started on generic acetazolamide which I had to take 4 times a day so the sequels are a joy in comparison, I get to sleep more than 6 hrs a night. I've regained all my eyesight and no more headaches, and that 'whoosh-pound' noise is gone. I've gotten used to the carbonation effect but I do miss my sense of taste. Ask your doctor if it's ok for you to take some vitamin D because that really seems to help me with the tics and tingling/numbness. I take a calcium plus D every night with my multi-vitamin, so it's not alot.
Other	thickcutie1982,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		9/23/2008 12:13:29 AM	I used this medicine for a sudo tumor. The only thing I disliked about it was that it prevented me from consuming drinks with carbonation. But overall it worked well and sheads a few pounds.

First 2 weeks on Diamox I had nausea and was short of breath, but that soon passed. Side effects - some weight loss and frequent potty trips. Diamox saved my vision and keeps me from getting wicked pressure headaches.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	11/19/2007 5:52:35 PM	I was prescribed Diamox Sequels, 500 mg, 2x daily for my intracranial hypertension.  The drug has been a miracle, my eyesight has returned as well as it can.  I am able to perform all of my daily duties, and live a complete, happy, full life.
