Difficult or Painful Urination	Powelltnt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/3/2008 11:48:19 PM	I had a horrible bladder infection over the last several days and I drank lots of cranberry juice, took tablets, and lots of water to flush. I went to the doctor today because my symptoms worsened to the point that I was actually crying from the pain, I got an antibiotic from the doc and a recommendation to use uristat for my discomfort and I sure was surprised at the effectiveness of this over the counter medication. Thank goodness for Uristat without it I would have been one hurtin' unit!

Now I take Uristat immediately upon feeling the symptoms and it doesn't worsen into a full blown infection.  Great stuff!  I always have some on hand

It's normal. The drug does help relieve symptoms, but still make sure to check in with your PC incase antibiotic's are needed also.
Difficult or Painful Urination	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/15/2007 12:00:00 AM	I developed a bladder infection on a Friday afternoon so I used this for symptom relief until I could go to the doctor on Monday.  It helped immensely!  It made urination less painful and relieved the urge to urinate constantly.

I was pregnant at the time and my doctor approved its use.
