I do get tired easily and did gain a few pounds, but to be rid of the daily chronic hedaches - it is worth it! I am worried about the many side-effects.

I went to my dr to be weined off the drug since I had read that it could be harmful to just stop taking it.  I have been off for about a week and since then I have been having BAD headaches, BAD pain in my stomach and constipation, and these weird &quot;nervous&quot; muscle twitches in my hands, arms and legs.  I don't know if this is due to the &quot;withdrawal&quot; from the medication or if these are signs of something else but it seems to be a bit difficult to stop taking either way.

I had to stock up and gum and mints just to make it through the day. I was a bit dizzy after first taking it but that side effect has  since worn off. I have been taking it for about 7 months.

What I found out is when you stop taking it even at a low dose I got really sick very bad stomach pains and was really tired. I went to my regular doctor and he had given me another prescription because the pain was so bad I couldn't get out of bed. It helps me stay calm but then there are days I have no energy and I am way too calm.

It does have a good sedative quality helping me to slow down and calm my anxiety generally. I am still under investigation with my doctor. I don't know if it's post herpatic neuralgia or infection of liver or kidney or bladder infection. These tablets are having some effect in calming my abdomen.

I have to take 150 mg. and it sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't. I don't like the daytime drowsiness and increased appetite.
