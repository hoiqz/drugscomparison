Almost immediately improved depression.  Dramatically improved sleep and I was anorexic then. So the weight gain helped. I can tell if I forget to take it.. can't sleep and feel depressed.Would like to lose a little weight now.  ? menopause.  Most effective antidepression medication I have tried and it seems like I have tried many, many of them.

Immediately went from sleeping 4 hrs a night, to sleeping 8 hrs a night. Helped my appetite some. Definitely glad I found this med.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	7/26/2012 7:35:35 PM	I suffer from mild depression but I have horrible anxiety. The anxiety seems to cause the depression in my case. I have been on the meds for about a year now, I gained weight (which i needed) and I've been pretty happy. I have been able to travel overseas and I took a very large course load in college this past Spring! I haven't worked since I've been on this particular pill, but I am working with my therapist to get to where i feel confident again. I highly recommend this to people who are underweight, it increases your appetite to a normal appetite level, so you are actually able to put on (and keep on) weight if needed!!

I take it at night, then usually read for awhile. About an hour after I take it, my finger joints all begin to ache and feel as if they need to be cracked. I also experience what I might call restless legs and feet at the same time.  Just  antsy.  I have to get up and do something; I can't lie still.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	Fitnesswoman, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	6/24/2012 11:53:35 AM	I have been taking this medication for 2weeks and it really does make you want to eat just about everything but with working out i think i will be okay plus i was underweight so the gaining of a few extra pounds is okay for me.The one bad side thing that i hope goes after time is the horrific nightmares OH MY GOSH those dreams are awful and i do mean awful a few times i woke up crying because the dreams were just that horrific.I will ask my doctor if those bad dreams will go but apart from that it stops my constant worrying.Of course i still worry about the normal things in life but i am able to sleep about 8hrs a night rather than 2hrs a night like i did before.My doctor put me on 30mg and told me to take half for the first then told me to start taking the full 30mg after a week.But when i took the whole 30mg the dreams got more horrific so i just take half which is 7.5mg.It's important to be careful what you buy when getting your groceries or you will gain a lot of weight while taking these pills but overall i think they have helped me with less worrying.Peace to you all and hope you all have a happy life :)

Depression	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	65-74	4/28/2012 4:25:28 PM	I went to an ER because of a racing heart 6 years ago. My blood pressure was 180/90 which was very high for me. The ER doctor put me on .25 mg of xanax and I felt fine. My primary dr continued me on the med. March of 2011 I was treated for pylori and had a difficult time with the medication. I lost weight, and energy level was very low. One day while out alone I had a &quot;panic attack&quot; and needed to call someone to come and take me home. Went to my doctor and he put me on Remeron .30 mg. because he thought I was depressed and increased my xanax to .50.  With my doctor's ok I have tried cutting the dosage in half and had trouble sleeping for a full night's sleep and felt a need for a xanax. Went back to the full dosage of remeron. I feel fine with both of the meds but do not like the weight gain and don't feel depressed. Work to stay active and try to lose weight but have not been sucessful on the weight side. I have consulted with a psychologist and after 4 months of bi-monthly sessions she felt I was doing fine. How long would I have adverse affects if I went off the Remeron? Tried cutting it in half for 2 weeks but had to return to full dosage. Am I addicted or am I really depressed?

Depression	Lucky, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	4/25/2012 10:43:20 AM	i have tried the medication before &amp; it worked, However i was worried(Alot) about side effects!  I was worried about weight gain, brain damage &amp; other rumors.   I believe if you don't increase your appetite you'll be fine; All antidepressants slow your body metabolisms down! They do that so you feel better &amp; the medicine works with your serotonin.  i did gain weight the last time, but i'm highly suicidal!  i need help &amp; Zoloft was no longer working for me due to insomnia &amp; other side effects!   i've tried everything,(almost) and i believe the drug very, helpful if you place the effort into yor treatment! 
Depression	almostdied, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	4/17/2012 8:23:58 AM	This drug made me suicidal.  By the 3rd week on this drug I attempted suicide twice.  Thank God there was a friend here the 2nd time-I actually put a gun to my head and almost pulled the trigger.  I put the gun down and told my friend.  She immediately took me to the ER where they admitted me to the psych unit.  I had been telling the doc how weird/strange it was making me feel by the 2nd week.  They said i needed to stay on the med for at least 6-8 weeks for it to get in my system.  PLS tell ur doc if you immediately if you have suicidal thoughts on this med!!!!!!

I tried many other meds. before this one and this is the only one with no side effects and actually made my suicidal thoughts go away. I've had to adjust the dose up and down over the years between 15mg and 45mg, mainly staying at 30mg. I've been using it for 11 years now and I can't convey enough how it has changed my life for the better.

After that though I crashed, thoughts raceing, insomnia, anxiety, worry, paranoia, suicidal thoughts massively increased. I am still on this med, I am in week 3 on 15mg. No change Doctors trying me on 30mg on week 5. I had tried prozac before this which had the same effect. Fingers crossed it kicks in, if not will just have to keep trying different dosages and meds...
Depression	University person, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	19-24	1/25/2012 3:22:29 PM	Remeron (mirtazapine) made me very drowsy for about two weeks at 15 mg. This aided sleep, however it the drowsiness lasted for part of the next day, coffee helped.Thankfully the drowsiness tends to disappear after a while.I am now at 45 mg, and it only seems to give a good antidepressant response when combined with prozac (fluoxetine). Neither agent alone works very well, but together they form a potent antidepressant that works for me.Weight gain not an issue, I exercise regularly.

Have severe anxiety after three major losses.  Tried paxil and zoloft and had allegic reationc.  Remeron worked wonderfully for my anxiety.  first two weeks were hard, couldn't get up in morning and i gained 10 pounds.  Needed the weight, but can't control cravings for sweets and food in general. never feel full.  Have got weight under control but can't have anythign sweet in house and have to really watch what i eat and go to gym.  if i miss gym for a week, weight piles on.  Tried going off by slowly tappering got down to half of 7.5 was only taking 11mg.  Starting to feel anxious again.  Think i will go back to regular dose.  Peace of mind more important than weight.

I gained 40 pounds within 6 months, and have since shaved most of that weight off (gained because mix of medication, horrible western ny winder, and depression). I feel that my depression still lingers, more than I like to admit, but I will not increase the Remeron because the higher the mg the less it helps you to sleep.  
Depression	anxiousdepressed, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	9/4/2011 6:54:16 PM	This medication worked very well for my depression, anxiety and social anxiety, however, it increased my appetite so much that I gained 10 lbs in 6 1/2 weeks, so I discontinued taking it. Now, 5 months later, I'm still trying to lose the excess weight. I took it knowing of this possible side effect, but I thought that I might be able to control the weight gain, but I was not prepared for the incredibly voracious appetite that the drug created. I thought about food constantly, and I could not feel when I was full until my stomach actually hurt from overeating. I probably would have gained 100 lbs. had I continued taking the drug. I would never take this medication again unless I planned to commit suicide and no other antidepressants existed.

Started with 15 mg and moved to 7.5 mg after a 1 1/2 years due to &quot;hangover&quot; symptom.  Have been on it for about 5 years now and just now reading reviews.  Weight gain has been the problem for me, after blowing my knee out from cycling.  But, now it is just the motivation factor that I need to work on in the future.  You have to be conscious of the foods you are buying and what you are eating.  I know this from experience and know what needs to be done to render it.  The sleep that I have gotten has been GREAT! After not sleeping for more than 3-4 hours a night for 4 years, I average about 8 hours a night, setting two alarms to get up by in morning.  Also, 5-hour energy shots have been a life-saver without adding calories. Now that I know others are having problems with the weight gain, I can focus more on my eating habits...

Depression	Leslie A, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/10/2011 5:33:23 PM	I've suffered from depression and anxiety for years.  I had taken Zoloft for quite a few years and it helped with depression but did nothing for the anxiety.  I had to white knuckle the anxiety and use xanax for panic attacks.  Last year, Zoloft quit helping with my depression and I was suffering.  I tried a few alternate anti-depressants with no success.  However, ffter taking Remeron for 2 days, I was back to my old self and able to sleep.  The most amazing aspect is that I have had no anxiety or panic attacks at all.  I've had anxiety for so long that I had forgotten how peaceful I could feel.  I love Remeron but it does make me sleepy during the day.  My MD, is going to up my dose to 45mg from 30 mg. to see if that will help with the sleepiness.  I haven't had any weight gain or food cravings.

At the time I really needed them, I had no access to them. I called my dr. and he was on vacation and the dr filling in would not give me an emergency prescription. I nearly lost it...mentally! My husband was released in six days and is doing great. Better than expected, but that night, I took my remeron, and regained my sanity overnight. I slept like a baby.

I have tried all of the over the counter and prescribed medicines and either they worked once, I got used to it, they didn't work at all or I had an allergic reaction/severe side effect to it. I actually get a full nights sleep now! The only negative thing about remeron is that if you dont go to bed soon after it kicks in is that you want to eat. I mean a lot! So, I go to bed before I start eating everything in my fridge or cabinets.

Other	Diane, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	3/19/2011 6:35:44 PM	I was prescribed remeron to help me sleep along with current medication (trazodone) which stopped working. Remeron is the generic form of Mirtazapine. I was told by my old psychiatrist who is also a dr of pharmacology that GENERIC MEDICATIONS ARE NOT CHEMICALLY THE SAME AS THE BRAND NAME. An example I lived thru--I was on Prozac for many years which became generic.  I bombed out at an all time low on fluoxetine (gen.Prozac), lost my job cuz of it, went to my psychi. who said all her patients bombed on on the generic and all had to be changed to either the brand name only or an entirely different anti-depressant.  GENERICS SUK, if you can afford the brand name, I suggest you stick with them.  That's probably why remeron didn't work for me.

I was allergic to most foods and got migraines from wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, about everything that you can eat that makes life worth living, as well as the usual environmentals. Except for chocolate which is instant, Food allergies are easy to miss as triggers. You eat something with flour in it (the crouton the waitress neglected to pick out of your salad for example) and 2 days later a crippling migraine comes over the hill.  By the time I was at 30 mg I started to notice I was getting a pass or maybe only a mild episode where I had every right to expect worse. At 45 mg I realized I was experiencing the change we were looking for for 2 years of drug experimentation had arrived--in a drug the dr. had not event expected to work. I actually loved the dreams.  He kept asking me about depression and I would say &quot;no more than anyone having a migraine 2 or 3 times a week.&quot;  But I have always liked what was in my head and even if it was scary or horrifying, I had the capacity to wake up in the morning and say &quot;boy am I glad that was just a dream. don't get me wrong. I have had anxiety issues for which I had to take zoloft (now citalopram, the cheaper version).I would like to go down on the remeron, simply because I do not want to be an &quot;uninsurable&quot; with a previous condition which migraines are if they are under control with more than 3 drugs. I still have rescue meds and topomax. I still have allergies, but the food ALLERGIES  DISAPPEARED WITH REMERON. Or rather as my doctor put it, th e part of my brain that interpreted that as pain disconnected from the pain source--I guess that would apply to depression too.

I also take Buproprion and Lorazapam and Temazapam the Lorazapam and temazapam when needed.

It helped me sleep, but I felt hungover in the morning. Couldn't tell that it helped with the depression since I'm also on Cymbalta, but the weight gain is a severe con to taking this med, 10 lbs in two weeks. Also, it caused me to have horrible &quot;brain shocks&quot;, imagine being inside a huge bell &amp; someone hitting it with a sledge hammer. I feel every noise I hear, and it vibrates down from my brain throughout my entire body. It's horrific! I have been off the med for two days now and am still having this awful side effect, although my appetite is back to normal. I'll never take this med again.

It worked ok for depression and sleep for the first few months, now I've &quot;plateaued&quot;. Worst side affect is ravenous appetite. I hear it is really hard to get off this drug. If you have just started treatment with remeron, I suggest you talk to your doctor about trying something else as soon as possible. I don't feel the side affects are worth the risk. Good luck! 
Depression	Katrina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	1/31/2011 7:22:13 PM	I started taking this drug in July and it was very effective, although it made me ravenously hungry. The drug did not have any sexual side effects like other anti-depressants that I have tried, but I got so fat while taking it, that I didn't feel like having sex anyway. I weighed 134 lbs in July, and got on the scale in early January and I weighed 166 lbs. I have been off this med for 2 weeks and my doctor and my family have been helping me monitor my mood. My appetite is back to normal and I've lost about 4 lbs since stopping. I guess I'd rather be thin and depressed for now. I am working on making healthy lifestyle choices to try to combat the depression. I am so sick of pills!

Other	Big N, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/16/2011 3:52:30 PM	I have anxiety (mainly related to work, lots of stress) and and as a result I became an insomniac for a period of over 2 mths, it was terrible.  I started having panic attacks and had total loss of appetite (nervous stomach). I lost about 15 lbs. in 2 mths.  My dr. prescribed Remeron, I started taking 7.5 mg (1/2 tablet) about a month ago and it was helped immeasurably. Anxiety is much improved (although at work I still get heart palpatations, etc.).  My appetite is much better, stomach feels fine and most importantly my sleep has greatly improved.  Now that I've gone through a long stretch of sleep problems I know how vital it is to having a good frame of mind, energy and a positive outlook.  I can't underestimate how important getting a good night's sleep is.   I will say the only side effect I don't like is at times I feel a little dizzy and light headed.  On a couple of occasions I skipped taking it for a day or two and I immediately noticed I didn't have the dizziness.  I highly recommend Remeron for anxiety and insomnia.  I don't have depression so can't say how well it works for it.

Before, I was prescribed a 150 mg daily dose of trazodone before going to bed to help me sleep.  I usually took 75mg to 150mg.  However, it didn't seem to work at all for sleep.  Just okay for depression.  First night of Remeron didn't help at all, either.  Took a couple of hours to feel drowsy and had light, broken sleep afterward.  Still hopeful, though.  I could take an Ambien CR 12.5 mg but I'm trying not to take them that often as they are expensive.  Time will tell.  Not sure of how it will work for my depression.

Pros:  The drug works. It really does. I tried Lexapro and Pristiq with no success. Third try was Remeron and it worked!  I sleep all the way through the night. No waking up every few hours because it knocks you out.  I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to conquer my day without being depressed.Cons:  I gained 10-15 pounds in the first few months.  Not to defend this side effect, but if you know in advance that you will gain weight, then start eating healthier and exercising. In my case, since I was no longer depressed, I had the motivation to exercise and lose it.  Between month 3 and now, I've since lost all that weight.  Another con was feeling drowsy for the first week.  You should start to feel very normal after the first few days.  Just plan to start taking on a Thursday or Friday so you that you spend your weekend being lazy.

I fell asleep after taking it right away. But after one week I just couldn't stay awake. I could be talking to someone and aI would pause, close my eyes and was asleep. Then my ankles and feet swelled up, This is something that never happened to me. I also got severe neck and shoulder pain with rigid stiffness. the back of my head, neck, and shoulders were very painful. I felt like I wanted to vomit constantly.. I went to my Dr. and was told to stop medication because I was havoing an allergic reaction to it. This is the 4th day and I still don't feel better, I don't have the neck pain is all.

I'd been through nearly every anti-depressant you can name, and though a not so pleasant experience at Kaiser P - even some anti-psychotics as my Psych told me &quot;it's not that your psychotic, you just have some delusional thoughts...&quot;.  I used to have terrible anxiety and depression - my &quot;delusional thoughts&quot; were my thinking that everybody in public was staring at me and knew that I was &quot;crazy&quot;.  I became agoraphobic - and nothing Kaiser tried was working for me.  When I had lost everything (job, home, etc.) - I went to a low/no income health care center, where I finally got a GREAT team of doctors.  My psych put me on Remeron, first at 15mg/day and then up to 30 - that's when my I finally started gaining control back over my life.  Remeron is by far the best solution (IMHO) for Major Depressive Disorder with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  It abolished the depression, decreased my anxiety to the point that my anxiety medication was finally strong enough to do its job.  I went from not being able to leave my home to getting a good job, having a much more enjoyable marriage, and loving/living my life!  If you've been through a similar experience or have the same diagnosis and can't tolerate the side effects of SSRI's - I would highly recommend giving this medication a chance.  It's so amazing what the right medicine can do for a patient who has been through all the wrong ones.  There should be more press coverage and certainly more patients on this safe and effective medication.  SSRI's - killed my sex drive.  Wellbutrin - gave me a grand mal seizure. Remeron - saved my life, and my marriage.

First script was Celexa and it worked wonders for me mood wise, unfortunately it caused severe insomnia so I was switched to remeron. It helps me, not as much as Celexa but I can sleep well now.  I have gained 10LBS seems like it's all in my stomach and am having issues with water retention (4 lb difference between morning and night)but I'm not positive if the edema is the remeron or not as I also take other pills. I no longer feel on edge and tense and it seems people find it easier to approach me at work now, least I hope!
Depression	PRP-IN, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	9/10/2010 5:49:39 PM	I started using Mirtazapine, it has helped how I feel. I've been taking this med for a little over 5 months, everything seemed to be going well until recently. My dosage started at 15mg and then increased to 30mg after a couple of months. Since the increased dosage to 30mg, I have been having some balance problems, and now blood tests have shown that my blood counts are low and I have a iron deficiency. Dr. lowered med from 30mg to 15mg and told to eat more foods that have iron. This med keeps your mouth extremely dry and you need to carry water with you where ever you go. I have noticed that my feet and hands have swelled and I've gained 25lbs. Dr. said she would probably have to change my meds. I am also taking 2 - 20mg generic form of Paxil per day also. Prior to the mirtazapine, I was taking Paxil CR 75mg per day. I really hoped that this med would be beneficial to me, which it has been. But now it seems like it has made different medical issues arise.

It was a God send, let me sleep which definitely helped with getting clear of constant depression.  After 2 months, I began having very jittery legs at night, for 2 hours, keeping me awake then, but after that, would sleep soundly again.  I found that by cutting the dosage in half the jitters stopped and I still slept okay. Also, remeron gave a bothersome weight gain on abdomen and gut which I hate, can't get rid of it.  After 6 months, I very gradually went off remeron, was off 2 weeks, but now the inability to stay sleeping has returned.  So, I guess I'll have to get back on it, which makes me sad as I don't like to be on drugs, especially something that puts on unnecessary weight.  But, sleep is extremely important, so I guess I'll just have to live with a pot belly. Another reason I wanted to stop remeron is because it made my muscles and joints feel stiff and achy.  I felt older than I am.   
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	8/25/2010 1:14:54 PM	I have found that Remeron has definately helped with my appetite which I needed and have learned that I had to start taking it at bedtime as it does make me sleepy.  The downside is that the following day, It makes me feel groggy and tired.  I need this drug for my appetite, but don't feel that it is very effective for ambition.  Does anyone know if it would be safe to continue Remeron and take Prozac to counteract that.  I have taken Prozac in the past, but the side affect for me was lack of appetite and more anxious, but did get things done.  Would it be safe to combine the 2, Remeron at night, Prozac for daytime
Depression	glendola, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	8/25/2010 9:19:52 AM	I have been taking this medication for approximately 4 weeks, and I have to say it is the only medication that I have taken that has made any difference whatsoever.  The only downside, if it is a down side, is that it makes you lethargic.  But that is obviously positive at night time.  I recommend this drug highly.

I have strugled with ptsd, anxiety and bipolor. I have tried prozac, zoloft, welbutrin, lexipro, and they all made me either sick or spaced out. When i got put on remeron i had just lost my father and hadn't slept in 6 months, i couldnt eat , didn't talk to anyone. I was close to a mental break down. I weighed 99 pounds.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	19-24	7/19/2010 9:40:21 PM	I took 15mg per day for depression, and it has been the ONLY antidepressant that has helped my mood, PERIOD.  It also helped with my insomnia.  The only problem is, I gained 25 pounds in one month (and I am a fairly skinny person normally). I felt like I couldn't stop eating.  Of course I have stopped taking it, but I really wish things had turned out better.

Depression	dmcatlett, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/28/2010 1:31:59 PM	I have been taking 30mg at night for 4 months now. Have never fell asleep as fast and slept so sound in YEARS. Depression or Negative thoughts have lessened to the point to where I dont dwell on the negative and notice increased POSITIVE thoughts and energy. Increased appetite is a factor, but exercise will power for the first month or so and your weight gain will be minimal, if any. I actually am at a lower wieght because I feel better and am more active now. Can't speak for all... but its been a life saver &quot;litterally&quot; for me.

It definitely promotes sleep!  Now menopausal symptoms have kicked in, so my doctor has added lexapro. The potential side effects of that drug worry me.

I've been on it about 7 months and now I feel like I'm losing touch with reality.Becoming agoraphobic, having blood clots in my legs. i bruise really easily.Never had this before taking Remeron. is there any drug for depression that is not worse than the disease? I'm thinking of just giving up!

Depression	Hopeful, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	45-54	5/27/2010 3:59:46 PM	I started on this med 8 days ago in addtion to the Luvox 150mg I am taking --all to combat panic/anxiety that was holding me hostage. The ruminations went away and I feel like I have my mind/life back. However, I am experiencing edema--swelling of my ankles/feet and some hands/face and wonder if I will need to go off this med which I am taking at a low --7.5mg dose at bedtime dosage. The luvox seemed to have been little to no help with my GAD/panic. The remeron has been a blessing with that. Definitely feel increased appetite which is a concern if it continues.

Depression	bev, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	5/19/2010 9:10:20 PM	Welbutrin worked for me but we kept having to up the dose, as it seemed to &quot;wear off&quot; and I was back in the soup again.  So now I've started 15 mg. of Mirtzapine.  The first night I took a whole pill and slept all night and all the next day--it was awful.  But my doc had warned me and said to take half, if that happened.  The half pill works, but after about a week (today) I'm going to try taking a whole one again.  I'm an artist and a writer and haven't done any creative work in a year...the only thing Welbutrin didn't cure...but this week I've been painting AND writing, so I'm excited about this combo.  I just hope it doesn't wear off.  No bad dreams.I am eating a little more, but a very stubborn dieter when I begin to put on weight, so I'll fight that.  I think this might work for me.

Depression	hughdoosh1, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	4/2/2010 1:36:08 AM	This is an excellent drug. Great for depression and anxiety. It really helped me a lot. The best part is it makes you happy and sleepy, so u just take it when you are ready for bed in the next half hour or so.It also has antihistamine properties, so I no longer take allergy pills. Very little in the way of side effects.  A little bit of nightmares in the beginning or  when adjusting to a higher dose. Before Remeron I tried different SSRI's and SNRI'S but they killed my sex drive and made me super constipated. I started at 15 mg slowly went up to 30mg after a while. Truly a wonder drug for me. Don't give up on antidepressants until you've tried Remeron!
Other	Darin, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	3/30/2010 5:18:09 AM	I have taken Remeron for about 2 months now for insomnia. I take the 45 mg. dose. It helps me fall asleep pretty quick but, before I fall asleep, I get muscle twitches. There have even been occations where I have kicked my wife in my sleep. I also take Vicodin ES for a disk I had replaced in my neck, Buspar, and Prozac. I'm not sure if the twitches are from either of these or the Remeron, like some have reviewed in the past. Overall, other than the twitches and kicks, I am pretty well satisfied with Remeron.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/22/2010 9:30:34 PM	I have been on 30mg of Remeron for almost 2 months and it seems to be helping. In the beginning however I did NOT like the side effects. The first night I took it I woke up feeling like  zombie. I could barely function throughout that first day and I couldnt eat enough food to fill me up. I swear I ate for hours at a time. I have always been a skinny person and I never had problems with gaining weight in the past. I have noticed now that Ive been on this drug that I have put on a few pounds. However the crazy side effects I experienced in the beginning are not really an issue for me anymore. Im glad I didnt just abrubtly stop after taking my first dose because I realy did need to let my body learn to adjust to this medication. So as of right now I can honestly say that my anxiety is a small fraction of what it used to be and Remeron does seem to be helping.
Depression	fmlksd, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	13-18	3/19/2010 11:10:32 AM	Ive been mad depressed for as long as i can remember. i was finally diagnosed a few months back. when diagnosed they began many drug regiment non of which helpped without the side effects outweighing the benifits. then i got remeron or whatever you call it a month ago. take it, fall asllep, insane nightmares,cold sweats, shortness of breath...ive pissed my bed twice since i been on it and i havent done that in about 13 years... (im 18). then when i wake up mad draging, zombie like feelings, im about to get fired from my job which was hard enough to comeby because i cant complete my job all zombied out, mad anger ill go off on anyone for anything (ive already shown violence toward another person, racing thoughts like a muh.... in my opinion dont take this drug unless you wanna be a functionless souless dead individual
Other	none, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	3/19/2010 2:44:12 AM	After taking remeron a few years ago with limited effectiveness but no side effects my doc prescribed it again after trying other anti-depressants. I do suffer depression but also anorexia and PTSD type of symptoms/anxiety. I take 45mg of it along with 10mg diazepam at night. I am having horrific nightmares, waking 4 or 5 times a night and am exhausted but too afraid to sleep despite the diazepam. I asked the doctor if it could be a side effect of the drug at the last apt. and he shrugged and said 'possibly' but its not serious. When I looked it up I was shocked to see how many others have had similar reactions (some not so severe)and I have just phoned the doc to ask him why he didn't tell me and why he isn't listening to how seriously this is affecting me (just when I was starting to recover). He has suggested simply taking 15mg of DOrmicum (for insomnia) so I sleep! The whole plan for me has been to reduce medication gradually (I was taking a number of different medications) and replace them with remeron. TO simply 'throw' more meds at the problem seems so wrong. I was doing fairly well on FLuoxetine, he doesn't like giving it because he's afraid I'll lose weight but as anyone with anorexia knows it isn't appetite that will cause weight gain or loss. I have had no change in weight with increased appetite from remeron or decreased appetitie from Prozac. I have agreed to give the sleeping tablets a try for a few days to see if the nightmares stop but if not I will refuse to take this medication anymore and will have to review it anyway as I don't want to remain on sleeping tablets and have already been taking remeron for long enough for this side effect to have subsided if it was going to. It is pulling me back into worsening symptoms and suicidal thoughts. I am thankful to have a husband who is aware of what is going on and can keep watch!

I have very odd dreams though. One time I dreamt I saw two black woman trying to push a black girl to her death, I reached over the woman to pull the girl to safety. Than I had a gun in my hand and was shooting at the woman as they ran away. I could see the bullets flying threw the air almost slow motion but never hitting them. I woke my self up and had a big headache. All my nightmare i wake with a big headache.I also some times have spots in my fore arms that will start to spasm to bad that I shake my arm and than the spasms stop and than reoccur this lasts maybe 5 minutes. I also take an over the counter herb called Valerian Root I'm hoping that isnt interferring with my meds.

There were times that I just sat and stared for long periods of time, not realizing until something would happen to catch my attention.  Not a good drug for me.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	2/10/2010 12:47:49 PM	Been on this drug for about a week and having a hard time adjusting to it. I slept well the 1st night but felt out of it in the morning. I was in a zombie state throughout the rest of that day. i ended up having major mood swings and couldnt eat enough food to fill me up. Im not sure how much longer I can take this stuff. I dont suffer from much anxiety as a result of being on it but im tired of feeling drugged and out of touch with reality. Do these weird feelings go away eventually?
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	35-44	2/2/2010 4:00:15 AM	I took this medication for 2 years for severe anxiety (30mg). It helped with generalized anxiety quite a lot, but did not help with social anxiety. I didn't notice much antidepressant effect. Even though this medication did not feel generally activating I developed agoraphobia and experienced panic attacks while taking this medication (which improved upon cessation). This may have been due to the norepinephrine effect. It helped alot with sleep, weight gain, and appetite. There were no sexual side effects and I found it easy to discontinue the medication. Overall, I was unsure how useful the medication was and suspected it may be worsened some aspects of my condition.

I have been on it since 2000 after being diagnosed with depression and OCD.  I was off it for a few years because I had no health insurance and opted to take Paxil for my OCD.  When I was given financial assistance from family, I started taking this med again.  It battles my depression and if very effective.  Very easy to take and affordable even without insurance.  Very happy my doctor prescribed it.

It induces drowsiness about and hour after I take it and sleep well. I have not experienced any of the side effects. My dreams are more vivid but not abnormal. After trying sertraline and experiencing horrible side effects, my doctor switched me to this.

Depression	kidsnkats, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	1/13/2010 11:21:28 AM	I was prescribed this drug in addition to 100mg of Pristiq and 3mg Xanax XR. I only took Remeron one time. After taking the pill I was nodding off on the couch within 15 minutes. After sleeping for 2 hours my husband woke me up. I was very irritable while putting my 4 year old to bed, very unlike myself. All night long I'd sleep for a few hours and wake up in a panick. I was extremely groggy the next morning and I took the medication at 7:30pm the evening prior. Then, the next day I was eating EVERYTHING in sight. I'm a size 4 and don't have an unusual eating habit, but I ate so much that day (three trips to the office vending machine), that by the end of the day my stomache was very distended. And I was still hungry. Needless to say, I will not use this drug again. The side effects outweigh the benefits in my case.

Depression	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/6/2010 8:01:09 PM	After taking Remeron RD 30 mg at bedtime for two and a half years,it pooped-out .Now I feel worse than when I started but the only good left is a good night sleep. I must admit it worked well at the beginning and I gained a well needed 20 pounds which I have lost along with my appetite after it &quot;pooped-out&quot; two and half years ago. My psychiatrist wants to add another anti-depressant but I refuse and he will not hear of it. Tried Cipralex 10 mg and it made me feel awful: burning sensation in digestive tract,sore belly,nausea,no appetite. I stopped after one pill. I feel  angry,frustrated,inadequate,I hate myself and I hate to get up in the morning to face another day of misery. My anxiety level is at a record high and I feel that my life is not worth living. When you feel better,are you not supposed to stop taking those mind -altering drugs? I am beginning to think that psychiatrists are only drug pushers. I want out and be my old happy self again before I got depressed!!!I cannot make important decisions and I am totally overwhelmed by any little problem. More drugs will not benefit,of that I am convinced! Psychiatry is not a science. On top of that,I have developed a stage 3 chronic kidney disease and have to check my creatinine level every 3 months and I blame Remeron for that! Thanks Remeron but no more!!!!!!
Depression	DaveL, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	1/4/2010 7:01:55 PM	Simply put. This drug made me zombie-like. In the morning I could barely function. My head was in a extreme fog at work. I could not function. I even cut them in half, then in quarters, Still the same exstreme drowsiness. I was taking no other meds to cause this condition. I had to discontinue it. I've been on 5 five others since and finally found relief with NARDIL an MAOI.

Depression	Ahmad, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	12/11/2009 2:18:29 PM	I have suffered from depression and social anxiety for about 6 years now..through this time I have been to many psychiatrists and took many SSRIs,tricyclic antidepressants and even antipsychotics!none of those really helped me with the symptoms..I was at like end-stage depression...quit my job,abused drugs and I even became suicidal..In a desperate attempt I started back a previous prescription but I increased the dose of mirtazapine from 30 to 45 mg..and fluoxetine from 20 to 40 mg...within 3 weeks I surprisingly experienced a great mood improvement and a marked reduction in my social and general anxiety..I feel like I am the same guy that existed just before I got depressed!!I attributed the efficacy to mirtazapine since I took the fluoxetine before without improvement...The side effects that bothered me were the most were the dry mouth and the too vivid dreams and frequent nightmares,not to mention that treatment was expensive for me..But that is nothing compared to the cancer of the soul;depression and I am grateful that I found the right treatment for me..God bless you all people!
Depression	punky_shoester, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	12/9/2009 2:53:25 PM	took first dose before bedtime and noticed a difference the very next a.m. used to have anxiety attacks as soon as i opened my eyes in the morning, this med stopped them almost completely. Depression is improved as well. My doctor put me on Remeron because depression caused loss of appetite (lost 25lbs in 6 mos) and it also fixed that problem almost immediately. does make me tired, take at night and sleep better than i can ever recall. do have some minor body aches, but i'll take them over crippling anxiety and depression any day. 
Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	55-64	12/9/2009 11:26:25 AM	I'm on Remeron (actually generic Mirtazapine) for depression, sleep issues and anxiety in the aftermath of a prostate cancer diagnosis (which has been successfully resolved by surgery).  Additionally, my p-doc put me on it to help me taper from low level doses of Valium and Ambien, which I started when the cancer diagnosis was made.  The quantities of valium and ambien I'm on are very low (3mg/day and 5mg/every other day respectively), but I'm also a recovering alcoholic with 10 years sobriety and my addictive personality was giving me trouble in getting off these drugs now that the cancer-associated anxiety is somewhat less.  Anyhow, I'm in my 4th week of treatment and I take 15 mg. Mirtazapine nightly.It has been a significant aid to sleep and Iam now about to taper the Ambien to 2.5 mg every other night.  The Mirtazapine has brought a general, but significant lessening of my anxiety. So far, its effects on my depression have been less, although also noticeable. I may need to ramp up to 22.5 mg or even 30, but need to discuss that with the doc first, of course.  There has been some weight gain, perhaps 3-5 lb. so far and it takes a while to wake up in the mornings and become lucid. Maybe this will pass with some time.    Over the years, I've been on a number of different meds for depression and anxiety, including Zoloft, Luvox and Lexapro. As well as combined Lexapro/Buspar therapy to also address anxiety. None of them have ever done much for me. Low levels of valium (no more than 4mg/day) have been the only med that has ever helped my anxiety.  This seems to be changing and Mirtazapine may be &quot;the&quot; med that best fits and addresses my combined anxiety/depression issues.  That's good news.  I'll need to do some dose tinkering in consultation with my p-doc as the valium and ambien go away. But I'm pretty optimistic that we may finally have found the wrench that fits my bolt head...:)
Other	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	13-18	12/5/2009 7:23:39 PM	I take it for sleep deprivation. My mom recently passed away from brain cancer and I have been having some issues with sleep and slight depression as of recent. This has helped me tremendously. I can actually sleep at night and it is a deep, relaxing sleep.The only down side to it is that if someone wakes me up in the night by calling me or not waking me up completely, I kinda sleep talk. I don't remember even being awake. I have also written some pretty deep poetry in my sleep. I am not a writer, so it is a little out of the ordinary, but it is all good.I highly suggest it.
Depression	New2this, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/5/2009 11:24:56 AM	My husband is newly diagnosed with Manic Depression, borderline agoraphobia, all stemming from high Anxiety.  He is in the treatment facility right now and this is the med they are giving him.  I can NOT believe the difference in his personality, interaction, and conversation skills.  He actually has EMOTION on his face now (before his face was just blank), he is interacting WELL w/ everyone in the facility (before he would have just stayed in his room), and he is actually having LONG CONVERSATIONS (before he would sit in a corner and rebuke anyone who attempted to engage him in coversation).  They have him on a low dose, but it seems to be working.  The doctor is talking about increasing his dosage just to see how he does, but I'm going to tell him to tell the doc that he is HAPPY with the current dose.  He is not having ANY side effects at all.  We were on our way to divorce before he sought this help.....this medication may just give me the man I always thought I'd married.

I can't tell you how many different meds I've been on, honestly I probably wasnt always taking them properly.  Im very happy with the Remeron and it is also a great sleeper, which is another thing I struggle with.

Other	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	11/12/2009 8:00:51 PM	I was actually started on a low (15 mg.) dose of Remeron, along with 12.5 Ambien CR, for chronic insomnia. This combination works great -- I get 8-9 hours of good quality sleep, and this is after almost giving up hope after trying everything on the market with poor results (Lunesta, Sonata, regular Ambien, trazodone, even chloral hydrate). I also take 300 mg. of Effexor XR each day, and my doctor said that the combination of Effexor and Remeron is known to be a potent one in fighting depression, so she raised the Remeron dosage to 30 mg. I thought the sedative effects would go away with the higher dose, but I'm still sleeping peacefully almost every single night. I'm really hoping that the higher dose will &quot;kick in&quot; and relieve me of this horrible depression that has plagued me for so long now. That would be wonderful indeed.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	13-18	11/9/2009 10:44:31 AM	I have only been taking this medication for about a week, but in the first 3 days, i did nothing but sleep; i would wake up a few times and not even remember i had been awake, almost as if i was sleep-walking; and when i wasn't sleeping i would only be awake for maybe 10 minutes at a time and the only thing I would do in those 10 minutes was eat. This medication is supposed to be helping me with my PTSD but every time i get into a deep sleep I am often awaken due to the nightmares of the flashbacks I would get. Still, even 7 days after that I am afraid to take the medication because I do not want to experience those flashbacks.I will agree that the weight gain has been tremendous; I am only 16 and already before taking this medication, i was overweight. now i am 13 pounds heavier than what I was a week ago. my experience so far with this medication has not been pleasant, and due to my age, i don't have much say in whether or not i am to take this medication or not.

I switched from trazodone to Remeron permanently in 2006 since Remeron also could control my sleep issues (I had excessive REM) and gastroesphageal reflux as well.  I'm really surprised at the high rate of people getting vivid dreams from this drugs.However, getting the &quot;munchies&quot; seems to make sense to me... as it improved my GERD, it sent my appetite through the roof (causing weight gain) until I identified the fact that the weight gain was coming from the med and that I could reverse it w/(a very high degree of!) willpower.

Depression	Pixie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/8/2009 1:07:56 PM	Remeron was probably the worst drug I took during my three year depression. I was hung over all day, and sometimes almost fell asleep during my long expressway commute. At work I was flat, no anxiety, but no affect, almost like a zombie. When I told my psychiatrist he increased the dosage, telling me the side effects of flatness and weight-gain would go away. Although this sounded counter-intuitive, I was so desperate that I agreed. After 8 weeks on it, I began to notice another problem: it interfered with my gross motor skills. I kept stumbling and falling down. That was the end of Remeron for me. I asked my doctor to put me back on Zoloft, which had made me feel like myself, but had the side effect of insomnia. He put me on Ambien Controlled Release and Klonopin (Clonazepan) for sleep. This has worked very well and I am still taking them, including 50 mg. of Zoloft. I did stop taking Zoloft for a while, but my anxiety and depression came back slightly---though never as dreadful as when I felt suicidal---and I am coping w/my life. I am an older student getting a second post-grad degree, and I was able to do all the paper-work to get into a top-notch school.This is in high contrast to lying in bed unable to sleep or take care of anything in my daily life. Oh, I did have to resign from my teaching job after coping w/depression for a year on numerous drugs, which didn't work. 
Depression	okcitykid, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	9/8/2009 1:03:54 AM	I experienced back aches the first week of using this drug.  While I was very sleepy from this drug, I could not sleep because of my back ache which would eventually go away and I would fall asleep.  The first three days I was sleepy all the time and hungry most of the time for the first three weeks.  I did not experience nightmares, but dreams that weren't nice, sometimes waking up feeling depressed, but after getting up it would go away.  Lots of thoughts would race across my mind causing me to feel all sorts of ways after a week and a half, but after the third week, I was mostly normal.  I'm my second month and I think this drug is helping me work things out in my head, realizing that everyone is not going to like me or agree with me. Even those I love might not like me, that's life, that's the way it is and I can accept this where as before I just wanted to kill myself.

Too much of a good thing- be aware that you should call your Dr. if you have these adverse effects.

Depression	Anon, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	9/4/2009 4:07:16 AM	This was probably the most effective antidepressant I took. It's older, but it worked better for me than the newer SSRI's everyone raved about. They were terrible for me. The only odd thing about Remeron was that it made me very sleepy in lower doses, but not in larger doses. Took it in conjunction with Wellbutrin, which was okay too, but probably should have just stuck with the Remeron. Can't even remember why I went off it. Doctor's recommendation... The worst part of beginning or ending anything was weaning myself off the previous one, waiting a week or so, then titrating up on the new one until at a therapeutic dose...and suffering in the meantime. Docs are only available by voicemail. Sucks.

I have gained an enormous amount of weight and have experience auditory hallucinations (voices, phone ringing. This med does help me sleep, but the side effects worry me! I want to stop taking it, but don't know how -the doctor (psych.) who initially prescribed it is no longer around, and my family doctor has continued to prescribe it w/o monitoring my treatment. How do I stop taking this med.?
Other	rodlang, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	5/11/2009 4:17:28 PM	I've had anxiety and related issues and have taken Remeron, Celexa and Zoloft over the years.  I would say that Remeron worked the best.  Calmed me down and ahhh, getting some good sleep was nice.  After awhile, you do get sluggish and sometimes on weekends, will take long naps.  Celexa and Zoloft gave me gastric/intestional problems and Zoloft also gave me headaches.  Whenever you stop taking any of these meds, check with your doctor and get off SLOWLY.  The slower the better to avoid withdrawal sysmptoms.  Best of luck!

Other	Sam, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/6/2009 11:38:18 PM	I had a challenging life event six years ago that left me with insomnia, depression and anxiety. I have taken most depression meds for depression, most benzodiazepine meds for anxiety and most hypnotics and non-hypnotics for insomnia. Non of them will gave me or will give you the beneficial stage 3 &amp; 4 recuperative sleep that you need. Lexapro for 2.5 years fixed the depression and anxiety but the insomnia never went away. My doctor put me on 15 mg of Remeron and after 2 weeks I felt as though I was 10 years younger. The great sleep I now get makes me feel fantastic during the day. It does take 2 full weeks to kick in though. It is the only med I have taken that dramatically improved my sleep architecture, meaning that I now get to stage 3 and 4 whereas previously I hadn't attained in about 5 years. A great nights sleep also helps keep any depression and anxiety away. I wish that this was the first med I was prescribed, it would have saved me a lot of wear and tear on my mind and body. If you have trouble sleeping I urge you to ask your doctor about this med. It has changed my life.

For me, Remeron has been a life changing experience, literally.  I still take zoloft along with Remeron but feel the Zoloft does little.

I was finally sleeping 6-8 hours a night straight through.  However, I was hungry ALL the time and I gained 20 pounds and my cholesterol and triglycerides skyrocketed.  My doctor took me off of it and I haven't had a decent night's sleep since.  Nothing else has worked.  Currently on Zoloft and I sleep 3 hours a night and can barely function during the day.

I started suffering from depression and anxiety which started to become severe. My 7 year relationship with my girlfriend also ended suddenly. Now I stand to lose my house because of the seperation. I started taking 15mg for 6 weeks, then increased dose to 30mg. After initial adjustment, the medication has helped with sleep, depression and anxiety. I have had no panic attacks, and anxiety levels have returned to normal. This medication has helped get me back on track after some extreme stressful situations. I believe this medication can be beneficial if the individual also makes a concious effort to improve quality of life.  YOU CAN DO IT!                     
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	berkeleymike, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	25-34	12/12/2008 8:26:29 PM	I have to say that I have suffered with the anxiety and low mood related to PTSD for years and I was on Paxil once for two year which was really great but I could not have some sexual side effects.  All of the SSRIs had the sexual side effects on me and Wellbutrin had no effect on me.  When my doctor first prescribed this I did not really have much faith and I was nervous from all of the negative reviews on here.  On the first day I was sooo tired and sooo zoned out that I could not function.  I was on 15mg so I went back to 7.5 and I was fine and then a few days later I was up to 15mg again and I felt the low mood and anxiety diminish which was amazing to me.  It was effective for me almost 3 days after starting it.  Now, the reasons I only have it 3 stars for my satisfaction level is because I gained 5 lbs in this first two week period.  I have to say that I eat ALOT of fried sugary food and so as of today I am going to buy a scale and try to eat healthier and see what happens.  I really like the effect because it has really diminished my obsessive thoughts...I hope I don't gain 100lbs :)

I still feel a bit anxious and have had a few minor panic attacks which is what Im taking it for, but it has helped a lot. As far as side effects go I just feel a little foggy and sometimes have a little bit of a head ache.No sexual side effects at all, no Brain Zaps, no dry mouth etc etc

After taking the first dose I had trouble getting to sleep and felt like I had restless leg syndrome.  After that subsided, I began to have really strange dreams, was constantly irritable, moody and developed a left eye twitch.  At times, I also felt like I was seeing things in a surreal way.  I also felt like I had no emotions.  I felt like a zombie. It did help me sleep through the night but I couldn't appreciate how it made me feel during the day.  I called my Doctor after being on it for about two weeks and requested to go back on Zoloft.  After this experience, I think I can handle the side effects that at first I thought were difficult to deal with (hair loss, waking up through the night).

Also, abot 2 weeks after I began using Remeron, I began to forget things. This appeared and worsened over a period of a few days, culminating in one terrifying evening of confusion and short-term memory loss so total and debilitating that I stopped taking the pills immediately (which in turn caused a withdrawal syndrome characterized by dizziness, mania, and a general sensation of surreality about everything. Lasted for a few days then subsided). Remeron was a hellish experience.

It made me a total zombie. I could barely complete sentences the first 2 weeks. It made me very tired and I could NOT STOP eating! Higher doses supposedly give you less side effects, so I went up to 30mg. One night I forgot to take my meds so I took them at 5 am. When I got up at 8am, I fainted in my bathroom. It was really scary!!!! Also, I have gained 10-15 pounds over the last few months. However, after the first few weeks the sleepiness and fogginess subsided.Yes, I feel better, but I also take Celexa. Also my anxiety has lessened, so there's less to be depressed about. I am going off of Remeron nowmostly because I can't stand the weight gain.You can read about my memoir about anxiety disorder here: ww.samanthaschutz.net
Depression	s, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	9/8/2008 2:11:09 PM	I don't like taking depression meds AND i FEEL THIS MED WAS NOT RIGHT for me. maybe I didn't give it enough time to work.
Depression	KittyB, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/22/2008 7:20:55 PM	I was prescribed Remeron when my late husband was diagnosed with Cancer and he has been gone for over 6 years. It was and is a Godsend for me. I have recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and my Dr prescribed Lyrica. The combination of Remeron and Lyrica proved to be dangerous for me - I passed out and fell into a chair, while trying to get back to bed after going to the bathroom one night about 2 weeks into taking both medication. I lay where I fell for about 1 and 1/2 hours. Turned out I had broke all the little bones in the upper part of my cheek on the left side. So my Dr changed my medication for depression to Elavil. I will be talking to my Dr to change me back to the Remeron, as I can not take Lyrica of Cymbalta for my Firbo. - I am one of the 15% who gets increased paing on these meds. I much prefer the Remeron, as it also helps several other symptems of Fibro. ie; IBS,anxiety, Also Elavil caused me to crave sweets and carbhydrates and I have gained 15# and my LDL Cholestrol and Triglycerides have risen a lot. I never had these problems on Remeron. and see from reading other articles on this site, Remeron helps with these conditions also. I also slept MUCH better on Remeron! I really like how I feel, and how I sleep on this med. and would recommened that you give it a try if you have any of the deseases it helps treat.   
Depression	Roses, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/20/2008 6:31:06 PM	I tried several other antidepressants, none of them helped at all. I have been taking Remeron for about 4 years now.  I would not even consider changing to anything else. I only experienced side effects the first week. 
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	8/17/2008 8:24:16 AM	Initial 15mg dose had to be increased to 30mg after a month as it was no longer as effective. Just started on 30 mg which helps the depression but causes extreme muscle weakness and pain. Also having difficulty sleeping.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/14/2008 10:24:10 PM	Remeron was a life saver for me, literally.  I was in a severe depression, tried several other medications (that were not effective) and finally took remeron.  I felt better within a few days of taking the medication.  The only adverse side effect was that I gained weight taking the drug.  However, I have since stopped taking the medication and am losing the weight.  
Depression	Jane, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	13-18	8/3/2008 11:58:09 AM	Remeron has been the only antidepressant that hasn't caused major negative side effects in my case. I take it in addition to Vistaril, and though the effects are very sedating, I think it's a plus in cases of severe depression. I could only see this being used for less severe/mild depression in very low doses, since it knocks down your energy level. Even after eight hours of sleep, I would still be drowsy throughout the day. I have been on Remeron for over a year, and since then (and with the Vistaril) my condition has improved. After time, the drowsiness begins to wear off and it was about that time that I was prescribed the Vistaril in addition. Has not affected my appetite or weight, and was also used in addtion to therapy (psychiatrist). Again, I've been on many different types of antidepressants and have only seen positive results with this drug, though it varies with different people. I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety disorder. Started treatment at fourteen years old, went on Remeron at sixteen and am currently 17 and have begun tapering off medications. Not 100% better, but have reached position where I am able to move on.
Other	Liz, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/31/2008 3:43:30 PM	I was prescribed Remeron about 7-8 years for insomnia.  I would either go right to sleep and then wake up and not be able to go back to sleep (toss and turn) or I would not be able to get to sleep until the wee hours of the morning, then it would be time to get up.  I started taking Remeron for insomnia about 8 years ago, I guess, and it has been a godsend.  I take it about a half hour before I hit the sack and sleep (deep restful) for 8 hours.  I am not drowsy when I wake up and do not have any dizzyness, lightheadedness or any side effects mentioned.  I am a much more productive and not-sleep deprived individual since being on this medication.  Not too much in the information about helping for insomnia, though.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/28/2008 3:59:14 PM	I am taking this medication for depression, to help me sleep, and to get my appitite back.  It makes me restless when I first go to sleep but when I get to sleep I am out.  I think it is a really good drug.  I have been on it for about a week now.  I can already tell a difference in my appitite, which is good I guess cause my family gets onto me about how skinny I am all the time.  But overall I think it is currently doing its job.
Depression	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1			7/16/2008 10:29:21 AM	It finally allowed me to get some sleep - fifteen minutes after I took it, I would be dead out for at least twelve hours.  If I woke up any earlier, I'd still be dizzy and disoriented.  Its effects on the depression symptoms were hardly noticeable, if at all.  Besides knocking me out cold for half the day, the only other thing it did was give me an insatiable sweet tooth (and a constant craving for oreos of all things).

Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Male	19-24	6/2/2008 2:39:54 AM	My doctor perscribed Remeron for my depression/insomnia. the first night I took the drug i slept for 20 hours straight  i woke up late in  the evening the next day, so i took my second dose and went right back to sleep.  I cant tell if the drug is working or not, but trying to stay awake to do my normal routine is difficult.  all i want to do is sleep, and I could easily do so. 
Depression	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	5/11/2008 11:57:58 AM	Was prescribed Remeron after I lost my appetite (couldn't stand to smell food cooking) and had insomnia. The Remeron kicked in after taking 15mg for a short while, and my appetite is great. I sleep very well at night. I also take a .25mg of alprazolam twice a day to curb the anxiety. I am doing very well now. 
Depression	BIZZYNTWIGGY, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/6/2008 7:13:27 PM	It has mellowed me out whenever i was faced with an upsetting situation and has helped me be more cheerful.  I really liked it.  It had no adverse side effects to me.
Depression	brianaosb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	4/19/2008 1:02:15 PM	When I started taking this medicine, I was on a low dosage and felt like a zombie.  My doctor increased the dosage because she said that it is more sedating at lower dosages.  It helped a lot with my depression at first, but I am finding it less effective now that I have been on it for about 1 1/2 years.  I also have had a lot of weight gain and am having a hard time getting it off.
Depression	Abbygirl, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	4/13/2008 2:02:20 PM	I have been on Remeron for 3 mos.  I had severe anxiety which has ceased. I still feel depressed but mine may be partly due to circumstances.  I sleep like a baby however I dream and have night sweats.  I also wake up groggy and feel that way most of the day.  Also, I have an insatiable appetite and I'm gaining weight.  So, I guess there is no perfect solution to depression and still deal with it daily and need more encouragement.
Depression		4	5	3			4/11/2008 10:33:39 PM	Really hated that the anti-deps I've taken wiped out my libido.  This one doesn't.  Its a magic carpet to sleep as well.  Put on about 10Ibs and all on my belly.  First time in my life I've got a pot belly!  So I'm ambivalent about the meds.  I'll probably stay with it though.

Depression	Saved by Remeron, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/5/2008 10:52:21 PM	To all of you who are thinking of stopping the medication because of weight gain, feeling like a zombie, those terrible nightmares, lack of sex drive, etc... I too have had all of these side effects. Before starting treatment on Remeron coupled with Lexapro (after trying every other drug on the market and suffering for 5+ years) I truly was ready to die. I had no will to live, I was angry at everything! I truly/sadly was Suicidal and Homocidal.  I would fall asleep within 5-15 minutes of taking it (the reason you take it before bed) no matter what I was doing, EATING, talking, painting my nails. I would also get this feeling of bugs crawling up and down my legs, which was discerning and extremely uncomfortable. And, I too had that INSAITIABLE APPETITE, 30lbs in the first 5months of treatment. That passed. ALL the side effects passed. My appetite is healthier now, but I'm not eating 5 candybars at once now, followed by a couple more! No terrible nightmares, no creepy crawly feelings, no more zombie girl, and I haven't gained any additional weight since the initial 30lbs. I have returned to earth! I have earned my bachelors degree in nursing and have been practicing for 1+ year. I've become married, bought a house, and am excited to live again! The last 4 years have been the best I'd had in a long time. The benefits have far outweighed the temporary side effects. Isn't your happiness worth it?!

HUGE HELP!  only prob is my new INSATIABLE appetite.  at first i thought it was just that my moods were improving (when you don't feel like living, eating just isn't that interesting) but it got worse (CONSTANT thoughts of foods in the fridge, cravings for anything and everything-luckily i also crave raw veggies) &amp; my clothes felt tighter...i believe i have gained 15+ lbs in these last 3.5 weeks...ugh!  i hope the appetite settles down soon, as i don't want to have to stop this med and spiral back down mentally...but i also can't continue putting on weight...how to balance mental health with physical health (weight,etc.)??? overall, though, i am very thankful for this med.

Depression	NoMoreWorries, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	3/20/2008 4:26:28 PM	This medication has done wonders for my depression, anxiety, and sleeplessness.  I currently take 30mg with 150mg of Zoloft, and I feel great.  As for side effects, even when I'm full.  Some people complain about being tired the next day, but it's nothing compared to the exhaustion from not sleeping at all.  Overall, this medication is extremely effective.

Dreams arent worse or more frequent than before, but hubby says I talk alot more in my sleep. sleep is better with much less waking in the middle, but tend to oversleep through the alarm. No grogginess during the day. Already have high triglycerides so I'll have to keep an eye on that. So far so good, depression &amp; PTSD improving. will update any changes.

Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	casey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/1/2008 12:42:02 AM	I took this med for situational and i needed to eat, i now know why my dr. at the time, chose this medicaiton for that.This medication worked very well for me. I have been taking it for-wow didn't realize-6 or 7 yrs. now. The truths are the weight gain. I gained weight and excercise didn't seem to help that much. However, after awhile on the medication, my body must have leveled out and i started to lose the weight with regular excercise. there is a drug they can give you to counter act the weight gain, but it also has it's side effects. I have also experienced hair loss. I did'nt relate it to the drug at the time, or maybe i did but it was working so i shrugged it off. My hair, 7 yrs. later, seems A LOT different. First there is a lot less of it, and second the texture seems to have also changed. I am now also experiencing muscle pain. Which, i also didn't relate to the medication until today. My dr. knew i was on it and I went to him for the pain, and he didn't even mention that it could be a side effect, he just wanted to put me on another med. and deemed it restless leg.. and I KNOW IT IS NOT THAT, but he couldn't figure out what it was. I just read on this website that muscle pain could be a side effect. Doesn't mean it will be and if the remeron is what is causing that, it took a very long time to happen. I am not on a high dose either, only 15mg. So, maybe it is time to get off and /or go to an even lower dose. It also took seven years to make really do a job on my hair. It did work for me, i didn't have any of the sexual, or numb side effects that other people complain about with other meds. I still think it works great. I  still feel without being depressed for abnormal lengths of time. I still get depressed / i mean sad or whatever, but it is manageable and it lasts about as long as sad feelings should (whatever that means). Anyway, i think dr.'s need to work on their diagnosing  skills. My dr. should have related the muscle pain to the drug.

It does help me with my sleeplessness and I do get into a deep hard sleep, which is good, but the next day I am so tired and spaced out.  I haven't noticed an improvement in my overall mood yet, maybe it is too soon.  I haven't had any crying spells for a couple of days but I feel like I could at any time.  I don't have any energy or desire to do anything.  My fuse is short and I get upset or angry easily.  I don't have any increased hunger yet so I guess that is good.  I hope all of these symptoms get better or I will have to stop this med. and try something else.

It will put you into a &quot;fog&quot; when waking up for the first 1-2 weeks, then that side effect wears off.  I have found it more effective than any other anti-depressent but only moderatly effective after all.  It will put you to sleep upon taking it, if you don't sleep you will feel like you took about 4 tylenol PMs.  I don't sleep very well and this drug seems to make me dream, but sometimes the dreams are full of anxiety.  I would suggest trying this drug if you've found that none of the standard drugs have worked.  I settled on 30mg after much experimenting.

My kids would cry, and I didn't care or comfort them.  I stopped taking the drug, and am feeling emotions again.  The med decrease the anxiety,  but the side effects outweighed the bennifits by a long shot.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	11/14/2007 9:43:22 PM	At first, the side effects were not so bad. I always felt like I had an insatiable appetite and snacks were good enough to minimize it. However, the drowsiness began to greatly affect me during the morning even when I took it early at night. I could not function properly because all I wanted to do was sleep. My thoughts were always clouded. It also made me feel numb. Overall, it did not help me unless feeling numb and stuffing myself is its purpose.

It helped me come out of a deep depression when other, more common medicines didn't work.

When it was combined with another drug I started gaining weight rapidly.  I don't know if it was weight alone or fluid retention but I became very uncomfortable when I tried to breath.  I felt has though something was pressing against my lungs or I had just competed in a marathon.  It works well, I think I had used up all my luck with this particular drug.

I take 1 30 MG tab at bedtime. My sleep has improved as well as my overall mood. I have not had any weight gain (could be because I am on Adderall as well). I have not had nightmares, or actually any dreams that I can remember.

I have suffered weight gain, chronic tiredness and my hair falling out.  Also I would feel like I had to throw up often.  I was on it for about five months and just recently got off of it.  I do not feel very well so far.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/14/2007 5:46:43 PM	I am so drowsy most of the day that I am unable to complete the simplest of tasks.  If there is any type of confrontation I am a screaming witch.  I am also on Effexor and feel like I belong in a wheel chair in an old peoples home, just staring at nothing all day.

Now that I'm off it, I have finally been able to control my weight and lowered my cholesterol.
Depression	cappy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/12/2007 8:39:40 PM	Happily, I have not experienced weight gain, however I have noticed I experience more frequent bouts of hunger.  My husband says I don't snore as much since I started this medication, and I noticed I don't sneeze as much as I used.  My sleep has been riddled with dreams.  I've always had vivid dreams, now the dreams are extraordinary.  Thankfully, no nightmares.  I would be interested to know if others have experienced a relief in respiratory symptoms, and with an increase in vivid dreams.

I've been taking this medication for 1-month and not one night has gone by that I have not had bad dreams.During the daytime it is helping me tremendously.  taking this medication has increased my appetite.Overall, because of the nighmares and increased appetite I am discontinuing this medication.
Depression		5	5	5			9/26/2007 4:31:56 PM	i switched from lexapro to remeron and i am very pleased.  the difference is amazing. i feel like a real person again. :)
Depression	Nate Dogg,  Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male		9/22/2007 12:08:22 AM	Phenomenal for improving sleep architecture - getting into &quot;deep sleep&quot; stages 3 &amp; 4.  Great for anxiety as well. No sexual dysfunction but potential for weight gain in first 3 weeks due to increase in appetite. Inverse relation to dose and side effect means to dose higher to eliminate side effects.  This occurs as in the lower doese the high affinity for the H-1 receptor site triggers appetite increase.  By dosing higher the more robust increase in Norepinephrine helps counteract this and somnolence.
