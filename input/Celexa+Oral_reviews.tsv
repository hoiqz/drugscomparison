Other	Pay attention, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/30/2012 5:51:07 PM	This drug almost killed me!  Yawning, and was having irregular heart rate , weird dreams. Dr said would go away after 3 wks tried to trust her. After this medicine gets into your brain it creeps up on you and makes you like a mummy but you don't realize it or you don't realize side effect bc it gives you serious memory loss. Went back to dr check up told her had more memory loss lack of focus. She increase dose from 20 mg to 40 mg and I questioned her she said trust her if didn't help cut it back down. With in 48 hrs . The life struggle began  I had break thru bleeding that was worse than after giving labor for 7 days on top of that diarrhea, flu like symptoms jaw clenching , horrible sweats cold and hot, nightmares, so I thought I was going to die. I went with my gut feeling to survive and thought it couldn't get worse quit it cold turkey. Been 14 days feeling better but still have serious hangover symptoms. Head spinning, feels like morning sickness all day Dramamine tablets help tremendous. Good news is have emotions can laugh, cry, ect. Memory is much better can remember if locked door or not. Actually can feel my sexual organs again.  This was the worst experience ever in life.

I was put on this medication to help these problems, and the tiredness just got worse. I took 3-4 hour naps every day unintentionally. It did help lift my mood after about three weeks. I noticed I always felt much more alive a day after I missed a dose, but had some withdrawal effects after I stopped for good. I also had loss of appetite. Ate nothing but oatmeal for two weeks.

Depression	Sarah, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	7/31/2012 8:40:27 PM	I was on Prozac (quit working) then Lexapro (worked great) and then my ins. raised the price and I was switched to Celexa. I am better on it than off, of course, but I am noticing that while I'm usually pretty optimistic and content when medicated, the Celexa is making me less likely to get furious and sad, but not really making it go completely away. I know that there should be a normal amount of not-perfect feelings in life, but I have a major rage problem and also major depression, and when I am experiencing it, I know, and I just feel like Celexa does only about 80% of the job.

I can see subtle changes in my moods, thus far. I've had anger, anxiety, and erratic mood swings most of my life.  Side effects that I've noticed, is a mild to moderate headache, loss of appetite(which is not necessarly a bad thing) and I get extremly drowsy when it gets close to my next dosage.

Panic Disorder	ChristyLynn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/30/2012 12:20:27 AM	I have been on 40 mg of Celexa 10 years for anxiety and panic attacks I developed as a teenager. I once tried to wean off of it with the help of my doctor when I was in college (I felt great and didn't think I needed it anymore) but the panic attacks returned so I've been consistently taking it and feel like a normal person! It originally took me about 2 weeks to fully adjust to the medication and help relieve my anxiety. Unlike what some people believe, I still have emotions! I cry, I get stressed, I feel joy, etc. I just feel like a normal person and that's all I could ask for. I did not gain weight either. The only side effect I have is occasionally I get &quot;brain farts&quot; which I like to call them when I have trouble remembering a fact or something! ha! (I've read this is a side effect of celexa) I can live with this because I feel like me and if you have had panic attacks you know how horrible they can be! My doctor says as long as I feel great I can take the drug as long as I want! :) Hope this helps anyone who is on the fence about celexa.

I recommend taking this along with counseling, as it has helped me get my life back. I never thought I'd get out of the dark, ugly place I was in, but I'm happy to say that I feel like myself again, and I enjoy life to the fullest.

The affect of helping my depression was great. Although you have no real emotions, when i quit taking it I started to cry one day and realized that I haden't even had that emotion in my body for two years. Thats great if you want to be a zombie and have no real feelings anymore. It felt sooo good to cry, I had missed it. I'm the type of guy that doesnt ever cry, and it was wonderful! I would not recommend this drug to anyone, unless you have been through some serious trama that you need to get through. Like I said you become like a zombie (no emotions)! You feel good all the time no matter what has happened in your life. If you want that, then this is the drug for you. Side effects were loss of sex drive totally!! My girl didnt like that at all!

Panic Disorder	sleepfan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/4/2012 6:36:57 PM	Been taking Celexa on and off for about 4 years now. Also taking during my pregnancy, my OB said it is safe for pregnant women. When I don't take Celexa, I become agoraphobic and cannot drive in the freeway or leave far from home. With Celexa I have no anxiet throughout the day like I used to. I do not know why I developed Panic Disorder, suspect I got it from my father. I made the mistake of weaning myself off Celexa last year, only to have my Panic and anxiety disorder come back. After I REstarted Celexa again in March, it took 2 and a half weeks to be able to come out of my home after being housebound for two weeks. When it starts to kick in, it takes about two to three weeks, and it didn't stop me from worrying about having a panic attack. I had to test the medication by forcing myself to drive alone around the neighborhood. After one week on it, I didn't get a racing heart, but could only drive 3 blocks. After two weeks on it I was  still hyperventilating a little bit when I drove 3 blocks. But after 2 and a half weeks on it, I was symptome free physically. It did not stop the mental thoughts of &quot;what if I get a panic atttack&quot;. Those thoughts did not fade away until I drove around a farther and farther away from home a little everyday. Then after that, I didn't have worrisome thoughts after. Overall, I highly recommend it for Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Agoraphobia. I am taking 20 mg. But will like to raise it to 30 mg if I find a job where I have to communt ten miles each day.

I was given, paxil, trazadone, and other drugs. They did not take the panic attacks away. I've been taking Celexa (well generic) for several months and havent had a panic attack AT ALL. The only downside is that it gives me restless legs and I have to take a sleep aid because of it.

After about two months this side effect increased along with loss of libido and trouble sleeping.  My thoughts became racing and my memory was decreasing each day.  My doctor tried increasing my dose, but eventually decreased my dosage then discontinued.  The Celexa alone worked better for my condition.  I was told that Abilify compliments the effect of Celexa when take together.

About the 4th off this drug I started having pressure and 'buzzing' in my head plus anxiety and neck stiffness.  Anyway, long story short, I restarted Celexa today- 20 mg.     
Depression	joya, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	5/10/2012 9:36:06 AM	Depression/anxiety issues run in my family. After nearly 20 years of talk therapy --and a very toxic work environment --my new MD prescribed Celexa (I'm on generic form). It worked almost immediately for me --my anger, anxiety and apathy lessened, and my obsessive worries are nearly gone. Only side effect has been headaches and increased appetite (salty carbs and sugar). I can't drink any alcohol on it (that's fine). The benefits far outweigh the side effects! I wish that I had been less averse to taking medications; my anxiety &amp; depression has been a constant battle since age 19.

The first 2 days were complete hell as I was getting sick. After the nausea and vomiting passed, I felt ok. Now, I have a headache. It's not a horrible headache, but it is persistent. Wondering if this side effect is temporary, or if I should consider cutting my dose in half?

But over the last several months, I can't stay asleep and my memory is shot.  I feel like I can't think as fast as I used to; it takes me a long time to focus and complete a project. I gained 17 pounds in 10 months. (No sexual problems at all, though).  I'm going to see if cutting my dose helps.

Caused really bad withdrawl symptoms. When I tried to stop taking it I was very disoriented, dizzy, and bad headaches. Overall It works, but be prepared for the roller coaster when you want to get off.

Depression	Nurse101, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	55-64	4/15/2012 8:25:25 PM	I started out 20 mgs Celexa in 2002 and did ok until about a year later I moved, forgot to take it for 2 weeks and I then tried to commit suicide. I was put back on it at 40 mgs had another episode wanted to commit suicide so I was given med too. Took celexa 40 mg plus this other med until this year. I realized that I had spent this year way too depressed so I weaned myself off both meds slowly and I am doing fine, no depression no thoughts of suicide. I think Celexa did help my depression but when I accidentally stopped it suddenly it did cause me to try to commit suicide.

Other SSUI's that I had tried gave me head zaps, increased appetite/weight gain and didn't really work. The only real negative effects from this one are bad/angry dreams, occasional night sweats, and the elimination of any sex drive. The trade off for OCD/depression/anxiety relief make it worth it to me.

Depression	heart604, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Caregiver) 	2	5	1	Male	65-74	4/7/2012 4:27:25 AM	My wife has been on Celexa since 2004 and it helped with her depression till about 2008. She was started on 20 mgs then 40,then 50, then 60 and he wanted to take her to 80!  About 1 1/2 years ago I notice a change in her behavior.  My wife of 47 years was getting more distant and showed little or no affection.  Our relations are 0 now and we had always had a very affectionate and warm relationship, and that was gone.  The day it came to a head I put my arms around her in the kitchen one morning to give her a hug and she stood there like she was a robot with no feeling.  It hit me so hard for the rest of that day I though I would die of a broken heart.  This is when I started to to use Web MD to look into the meds that she was taking and found our what was going on because of the Celexa.  I talked to her Psychiatrist and he told me in so may words it wasn't any of my business and my wife was his patient.  &quot;What the heck about our marriage&quot;?  I trusted these doctors and I feel they have made a bigger mess of my wife then when she started her treatment for depression.  I am glad after we had talked the doctor has changed her to Lexapro with Wellbutrin and the fog seems to be lifting, but she has a long way to go to get back to her normal self.  I feel that before our spouses are put on these medications the family members need to be brought in, and helped to understand what they need to do to be the support structure for the depressed member.  If the member getting the help loses the love and support of the spouse it will make things much worse for the for the marriage an relationship. I would like to see the family member have several sections together and maybe work through the depression if possible before the SSRI medications are prescribed,  I feel that the patient becomes addicted to these medications.  I love my wife very much after all of these years and I wish I would have been included with the therapy that she was being prescribed and not pushed on the side.

Depression	Glen, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	35-44	3/30/2012 5:18:01 PM	I have taken celexa on and off for the past ten years.  I can't say that I find it especially effective, but I've taken many other ssri's, and none seem to be effective.  This time I've given it two months to gauge its efficacy, and I think I'm going to ask my MD to prescribe me abilify, which is an adjunct to celexa.  Perhaps that will be the magic cocktail that will ease my depression/anxiety.

Depression	kayscooter, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	3/3/2012 12:21:14 PM	I've battled depression my whole life, went to see a dr &amp; they said no you have bipolar put me on depokote which made me a zombie and he said that was the only med he could put me on, then went to a mental health clinic &amp; they just wanted me to take stress management classes which didn't help. Finally went to my family doctor and told him what was going on and he put me on 20mg celexa &amp; .5mg xanax 3 times a day. Though the first few days I just wanted to sleep due to I never slept before longer than 2 or 3 hours, I know am feeling lots better on the celexa, I don't feel the depressed like I did and can deal with my anziety &amp; panic attacks and myself. Though sex drive is some what lesser than before my husband and I have figured out how to get my sex drive up again. I'm glad I'm on this medicine it has changed my way of thinking and I'm the most positive that I've ever been in my whole 37yrs of life. Though I also have acid refluex &amp; asthma it doesn't bother me now as much since I've only been on this medicine for 5wks now.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	ISAMMY, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/17/2012 2:59:13 PM	I ahve been on this drug for about 4 months. I was having a lot of anxiety problems which I could not control (started w/the death of my Dad). I was warned that I would gain weight and lose my sex drive and maybe have upset stomach. None has happened. This drug has been great for me. I do find that there are times it seems more affective than others. I have also heard that with women, anxiety can creap up on you based on changes in hormones. I am a 53 yr old female and post menopausal. This maybe is why there are times where I feel a little less under control - but this happens pretty rarely. I do not want to stay on this drug forever. I am a little nervous as to what happens when you get off of it. So far so good. It has helped a lot!

I had very bad vivid dreams but it worked.  Then one day out of the blue it just totally stopped working and had a major panic/anxiety attack.  I think it originally did it's job but things changed, not sure if it was my chemistry or the presciption itself changed.  I would say that you have your doctor keep a close eye on you and do a medication review.  I went to the doctor every 3 months and I didn't have a warning that it would no longer work.

I took myself off it. I went from 30 mg to 20 to 10mg to none. I was happier and could handle the stress of my job much better on Celexa, but I was fat. Coming off I have headaches and dizziness . Not sure what to do now.

Depression	Veeco, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	25-34	2/2/2012 2:55:02 PM	This is only day 2 of taking this drug (20mg) but I wanted to share with the community how it is making me feel so that it may help others make an informed decision. I am a male, 34, weigh 195lbs, with a very high metabolism. Diagnosed with GAD back in 2001 after a panic attack / excessive sweating (Hyperhidrosis) / general feeling that something bad was gonna happen (post 9/11?). Anxiety / Depression are in my family history. I have been taking .25mg of xanax as needed during this period of time with good results. After getting a new (and very stressful) job in May, it didn't take long for my anxiety disorder to intensify and lead to a higher level of depression, with the first ever suicidal thoughts coming over the holiday break. The stress of the ridiculous unrealistic expectations of my employer combined with the responsibility that if I mess up our soldiers lives are at risk was too much to bare. I began double dosing my xanax just to get thru the work day and drinking heavily after work almost daily. Mood swings were out of control and I would just cry. Decided to go on LOA and spoke with my PCP about my issues. She prescribed the Celexa and asked me to go back to taking the .25 xanax as needed instead of daily. I also began seeing a counselor who agreed with the PCP about trying Celexa. After my first dose yesterday I almost instantly felt some side effects. Nausea, stomach pains (mild), light-headed, excessive yawning, dry and bad taste in my mouth, shortness of breathe, and sweating of hands / feet / underarms is on a new level. Also feel lethargic and like a zombie. I will post again in a few weeks once I have more experience with the drug.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	emmaemma, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	1/25/2012 7:20:21 PM	 I started taking Celexa about a week ago and so far I am just &quot;okay&quot;. I suffer from a generally panicky and anxious mood(which is usually almost all day long) and low grade panic attacks when I have to do oral presentations(which is almost every other day). I've noticed that I do not feel as anxious as I used to; I can now eat breakfast and lunch which I was unable to do before because of my anxiety. I can say that it is a major improve over what I was experiencing before.  The first day I had really bad nausea(maybe or maybe not because I was anxious about taking the SSRI) and now I'm just exhausted. I yawn constantly and feel drowsy in my classes; I'm also sleeping more than I used to. But I'd rather be drowsy than hyped  up and nauseated on nervous energy. So overall - I'm hopeful about the drug. I also have had loss of libido. No depression. No suicidal thoughts.

My dr started me on 10mg &amp; by the 5th day my anxiety/panic was worse. I did some research &amp; found that the med can cause an increase in these syptoms until you adjust to the med whcich can take up to 6 weeks, so I cut 10 mg in half and will try that for the next week or two to see if it makes any difference. Im not giving up on the med I know from past experience it does work it just takes time last time I was taking Prozac &amp; it ended up working GREAT for me!

Thru trial &amp; error I figured out that i would stop the med for a day or 2 if me &amp; hubby wanted to have sex. Then I would start it again and I never had any ill side effects from doing that.Wish I could still be on this cuz it worked great..now on Lexapro &amp; figuring this med out...

I recently went off of it by suggestion of my doctor and went on Pristiq..this was not good, after 6 months things started getting worse until by 1 year I was back on full blown constant panic attacks, starting very strong when waking and slowly diminishing until evening I felt good before going to bed. This was debilitating. I requested to go back on citalopram and I am doing better again, although I am not back to where I was yet(8 weeks). I was using it for a good 8 -10 years (not sure when I went on it) and had no problems, I felt perfectly normal again, I don't know why he switched me. If it ain't broke don't 'fix' it...goes through my head.

Then it slowly came crashing down to where I couldnteven get out of bed. My dr put me on celexa 20 mg. I took half a pill for a week and then the whole pill. I took it at night becuse the first day it made me too sleepy to take in the am. I feel like my body is alive again. It doesnt make me feel like a zombie and I love to laugh again. I am so thankful that this med gave me emergy and my zest for life back. I dont think I will ever get off it! It has been 1 month but I felt a huge difference in a couple days.

No sexual side effects at all.  I think, though, I may need an increase in the dosage as I am finding the effects of the med wearing off too soon.

At about 33 it took control and i needed help.  Crying jags were happening daily yet i couldnt identify anything that was &quot;wrong&quot;. My physiological symptoms of anxiety were taking over.  Went to an amazing psychiatrist who spoke with me for 2 hours. Prescribed 20mg and within 3 days felt human again. Sex drive took about a month to return but has been dulled for sure. Overall, this drug made my life 1000 times easier and ive had the ability to learn other ways to cope now that my body isnt working against me.

Initially, I found myself nauseous, yawning and absolutely exhausted for about a week, but I felt an improvement to my mood almost immediately. I did experience trouble climaxing, but that, like the nausea yawning and extreme fatigue, went away after about a week. I really have no gripes with this medication, and feel a hell of a lot better and it hasn't even been 6 weeks yet. Time will continue to tell, but so far, so good.

It seems to work better than a lot of others I've been on. This drug has sexual side effects, though. If you can find a dose you can live with and be happy, stay on it.
Depression	Stephanie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	12/5/2011 5:17:31 PM	I was taking Lexapro for a few years before switching to Celexa due to insurance.  I had some unforseen circumstances that had me getting really depressed, unmotivated, and lack of energy, so my Dr. had increased my Lexapro from 10 mg to 20 mg.  When insurance became an issue I switched to Celexa 40mg.  When I had increased my Lexapro dose I found I was almost emotionless, and I found myself being forgetfull.  I also was experiencing a decrease interest in sex.  When I switched to Celexa those side effects disappeared.  I found myself being more motivated, feeling happy emotions again, and my sexual desire went almost back to normal.  I did notice when switching to Celexa that I experienced frequent yawning, but this went away after a month or so.  I have noticed that I have gained a bit of weight since I switched to Celexa, but I have not been on it long enough or gained enough weight to know for sure if Celexa is the reason.  I haven't had any change in my diet or activity level (I eat very healthy and i'm pretty active).  Overall I am very satisfied with this drug.  Although I was doing great using the lower dose of Lexapro, the Celexa worked much better for me when increasing the dose.  As with all anti depressants you have to wait 6-8 weeks to see the full effects and really know if it's working for you.

I plan on stop using this medcine and hopefully I can have a &quot;normal&quot; sex life again. It will make you quite tired but it doesn't completely change your mood. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/26/2011 7:38:28 PM	I have been taking this medication for S.A.D (Seasonal Affective Disorder) for the past year during the months of October-March. This will be my second year taking it. I do feel a lot better when waking up in the mornings; more determined. I take the medication at night because it does make me tired. DO NOT STOP USE. I did forget to take it one night and I woke up with a cloudy head that lasted all throughout the day.
Depression	Barbara, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	11/25/2011 9:02:12 PM	I started on the Celexa (20 mg) about a month ago.  It has definitely helped my depression, but I felt really tired from late afternoon until bedtime for the first 4 weeks.  That seems better, but my stomach has been upset a lot lately.  The the only other sympton is probably a deal breaker--loss of ability to climax.  Think I'll ask my doctor to try something else.

I'm so irritable and getting more emotional. I didn't experience any other side effect other than the sexual side effect which just adds to the depression.  SSRI's just aren't for me I guess.  I'm off to try Wellbutrin.

The doctor switched me to Celexa (citolapram) and I've been on it for about 2 years now for my depression and it has been working fin.  But like a dummy, I felt so good that I took myself off without speaking with my doctor and now I'm back to being depressed and had to be admitted to the hospital. They put me back on Celexa. Just been 2 weeks and still depressed. they told me that it will take about 4 - 6 weeks to be back. Hope so, for my sake and my family's. I'll never do that again!

Dulled me to everything which made it seemingly do it's job.  All the problems come after tapering off which was a little rough going but the problems of persisting heightened anxiety (worse than before the drug) and post ssri sexual dysfunction for over a year now. I really wish I never tried it.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	10/30/2011 11:26:14 PM	I was prescribed celexa 2 months ago for severe anxiety and mild depression. I started off with 20mg for 2 weeks...no noticable difference with my symptoms. My dr. bumped it up to 40mg. Ive been on the 40mg for about a month and i can tell a big difference as far as the depression goes. The anxiety has lessened some. However at my next appt. i am definately going to ask about other medications due to the fact that i CAN NOT stop yawning. It is literally driving me insane. I feel as if i need a nap every few hours and with the incredibly busy lifestyle that i lead, it's just not working out for me.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/29/2011 8:40:22 PM	I began taking celexa due to depression and anxiety that controlled my life. I started at 20mg with great results for about 2 years then the anxiety started creeping back so I was bumped up to 40mg. So far so good.  Only thing I hate is that if I miss a dose, the electric shock like feeling.

Depression	Phenenna, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	65-74	10/25/2011 10:35:38 PM	The side effects are severe and disabling. Ten years of disabling diarrhea, episodes of such profound weakness and tiredness that I was brought to the ER.  Many, many tests and visits to specialists because of the digestive problems. Not a single one of these various physicians connected my distress ti citalopram.  For a few months now I have not taking this drug (yes, without the guidance of my doctor!) and for the first time in ten years I can leave the house without worrying about bathrooms. This class of drugs addicts slowly but surely and you will find it almost impossible to get off of it.

After about a year my depression seemed to overwhelm the drug and the doctor increased my dosage to 40mg, with seeming success so far. Only side effect I've noticed has been some ejaculatory delay and/or occasional ED, but that may also be attributed to one of the many other medications my condition requires. Good luck

Depression	Rick, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/12/2011 12:44:07 PM	After the death of my teensge son in 2003, i began using Lexapro due to a lot of anxiety and mild depression.  I fought through the earlier side-effects (jitteriness, clenching my jaws, some suicidal thoughts but not intense) and then began feeling better (more relaxed and not dwelling on particular negative thoughts).  After a couple of years, I reduced dose from 10mg to 5mg.  After 3-4 years at 5mg, I then weaned myself off over a six month period.  Within a few weeks, I felt very irritable and a little out of control, emotionally.  My wife sent me back to the doctor and was prescribed Celexa 20mg.  It helped immediately.  I've taken it for the past year without any noticable side-effects.  I'm 58 and very active.  I do go to the local YMCA about 5 days a week and run about 15 miles a week on the treadmill as well as using other exercise equipment.  I am a big advocate of using exercise to treat anxiety and depression.  Celexa and exercise has been a good combination for me.  I had always been fit and trim before my son died.  I gained about 15 pounds and had trouble being focused to lose weight.  During the past year I have lost 15 pounds and feel much, much better.  I won't give Celexa all of the credit, but I think it has helped.  I would recommend it for mild/moderate depression and anxiety.

Panic Disorder	TheThing, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	10/4/2011 8:18:44 AM	I was prescribed Celexa and Ativan for panic disorder and depression about 4 months ago.  The Celexa has been helpful for my depression, but has not done much for my anxiety/panic attacks.  Combined with the Ativan it reduces the panic attacks, but I still have a lot of anxiety just from anticipation of certain situations.  I wanted to write a review to address the issue of weight gain.  Before taking Celexa I was very active, mostly with weight lifting and mountain biking.  I was in pretty good shape and had 13% bf at 195lbs. I don't think Celexa causes weight gain.  What happens, at least in my case, is that I got so tired that I lost the motivation to  go to the gym and after about 3 weeks I no longer went to the Gym at all.  So for 3 months I have not exercised at all and have gained some fat weight.  My weight on the scale is about the same, but my body composition is different.  I think after awhile your body gets used to the chemical and you are not so tired.  I have just recently started back at the gym, so maybe I can get back in shape while on Celexa. Another topic I wanted to hit on is anxiety.  Celexa does not do much for anxiety. I think that it can help you  break through some depression which might help you to get motivated to do something about your anxiety.  This is how it has worked in my cause.  Unfortunately I think anxiety is something  I will have to struggle with forever.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/21/2011 10:37:12 AM	I have been on Celexa for four years and it has saved my life.  I had horrible anxiety.  My mind worried constantly every day and I could not break the cycle.  Therapy helped control the worrying but it took me hours of soothing myself before my anxiety would start to decrease.  I was on blood pressure medication as well since my anxiety was so high.  This went on for 3 years.  Since taking Celexa, my mind no longer worries endlessly and my blood pressure is back to normal.  I have regained my life and it is a miracle.  I would highly recommend this drug.  Before I had no quality of life and now I feel very happy.  I was up to 40 mg. at one time early on but found that if I took a nap, I was down for hours.  I was sleeping very deeply.  Now that I have cut back to 20 mg. my sleep is better.  I do have some of the strange dreams, which is a side effect, but that is minimal compared to the tremendous relief that has come about in my life.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	brittanyjade, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	9/20/2011 4:10:23 PM	I started taking Celexa about a month ago. I was dealing with the stress of getting out of an abusive relationship, school, and work. I'm 18 years old, and I live by myself. Have hardly any friends because of the abusive ex boyfriend. I was going through A LOT. I had panic attacks. suicidal thoughts. the whole nine yards. I finally went to the doctor, and he diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety. so he put me on 20mg of Celexa, and it has worked wonders. I have moments where i'm down, but they're not as severe as before. i don't cry as often. and i don't think about ways i could kill myself and make it look like an accident. i'm such a happy person now. it's great. everyone enjoys being around me. and i can actually carry on a converstion with someone. the side affects were crazy at first. i was so sick to my stomach, and i yawned so much. but those are long gone, and i would highly reccomend anyone to take this anti-depressant. (:

Side effects suck, caused more anxiety than it cured. Made me sleepy during the day and no sexual desire. Gave me tremors and weird brain freezes where I couldn't think straight.  I slowly filed the dosage down over several weeks and have finally stopped using it. I didn't experience withdrawal symptoms too bad.  New research found it caused heart problems at &gt; 40 mg.  Never take it again.  I don't care what the doctors tell you.  These pills are poison, they may relieve your sypmtoms for a while, but when you try to get off them it's like a psychotic nightmare.  The doctors have no idea how horrible the withdrawal is from these medications.  Some people never return to normal after stopping.  Before taking any depression meds have your doctor give you several suggested ones to review before you select one. Try to find one that doesn't cause horrible withdrawal symptoms or have side effects worse than being depressed.  Good luck.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Janet, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	9/6/2011 6:29:08 PM	I normally take Lexapro 20 mg for generalized anxiety disorder, which the therapist said is what triggers me to have bouts of depression.  I ran into a jam &amp; ended up running out of my Lexapro and was unable to pay the $85 co-pay for my 3 mo. supply so was put on 40 mg Celexa temporarily, as it's WAY cheaper.  Other than feeling a bit zombiefied, it definitly keeps me calm, but I also take Xanax XR 1mg at bedtime so that may have something to do with it too.  I've also noticed I dont have as much energy on this medicine and have a tendency to space out more than with the Lexapro. Had a dr. appt today and we both agreed I should get back on the Lexapro as soon as my finances permit.Overall, the Celexa works...just makes me kinda feel like the lights are on, but nobody's home.

I lost all motivation for the things in life that made me happy...excersise and sex. Sex was non-existant and excersise became so dreadful. i still had anxiety and depression. gained 15 pounds during this time. i think i will stay off meds period. this drug scares me away from any others. p.s. comming off this drug SUCKS!!! thoughts of suicide and hoplessness.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	8/29/2011 10:47:20 AM	Terrible side effects. I only lasted on it for 11 days, not long enough to feel the benefits but I'd rather deal with mild depression and take something else for anxiety than deal with the horrible side effects. Excessive sweating, I feel miserable even on a nice cool day, agitation sometimes, very bad nausea, although it went away after 4-5 days, constipation, blurred vision, and very intense jaw clenching which causes me bad tension headaches. My jaw and even my whole mouth hurts because I am clenching my teeth unconsciously. I had similar side effects with Zoloft, but not nearly as bad. Celexa is terrible! Makes me extra tired, and the yawning is annoying. I would never try it again!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	AllieKat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/26/2011 11:48:30 PM	About a month ago I went to my clinic for extreme anxiety. I talked to the psychiatrist and he prescribed Celexa. I was hypervigiliant, thought about suicide all the time, I ate constantly, and I was so anxious about everyday life I couldn't concentrate.Started off with the half a pill for seven days. I woke up with gloom and doom thoughts, rapid heartbeat the first two days on the half pill. On the third day I woke up, calm, with a normal heartbeat. I finally felt like myself. Went on the full dose (40 mg) four days later, but I could tell it was too much. I felt dead inside, just like I did with the Paxil I took two years ago, so I went back to the 20 mg dose after two weeks. I feel a little anxiety, but nothing like it was before. I feel like I can handle life now. I do have to remind myself to drink a lot more water because dryness seems to be a minor side effect. My appetite has also decreased. I eat when I'm hungry, not when I'm worried.  
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	8/26/2011 1:36:54 PM	Celexa is often prescribed in lou of Lexapro to patients whose insurance only covers generic medications, as there is no generic Lexapro. Celexa, although chemically similar to Lexapro, is certainly no Lexapro, nor as effective.
Depression	Mojo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	8/26/2011 8:26:40 AM	I have been taking 20mg Celexa for two days now, and I can't say this will continue. After reading 500+ reviews, the positives just don't outweigh the negatives. Before, I felt significant improvements in my mood after two cups of coffee or wine. I think I will stick to that. Decreased sex drive and weight gain are a girls worst nightmare!! (Not to mention, I haven't slept in two days and am horribly fatigued.)

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Mainelee51, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	8/25/2011 1:31:38 AM	In 2008 I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and PTSD after I began experiencing severe panic, anxiety, social anxiety disorders, and having attempted suicide more than once. I was first placed on 5mg of Citalopram (twice a day)and 18 months later my dosage was increased to 10mg (d.i.d.) and I seriously doubt I would be alive today had it not been for Citalopram. I am now on a combination of drug therapies including Citalopram (10mg b.i.d), Buproprion XL (300 mg q.i.d.), Lorazepam (1mg q6h), and Trazedone (100mg at bedtime). I doubt I will ever return to what I consider a normal life, but I am at least able to leave my home now and go to the drug store and grocery store. I still have a great deal of trouble with social events, but that is also due to the fact that I have stage-4-COPD and am on oxygen 24-7 which has taken a huge psychological toll on me. This is not including the physical ravages that past HIV medications have had not only on my physical appearance, but my mental state as well. I was infected with HIV in July 1985, but not diagnosed until February 1986. I have suffered from severe wasting syndrome, lipidystrophy, and lipoatrophy due to the toxicity of the various medications I was on from 1986-2006. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/24/2011 10:52:40 AM	I've had social anxiety my entire life. My doctor started me on celexa nearly 3 years ago, and it worked wonders. I finally felt like the person I was meant to be. Although, my doctor has had to add ADHD medication from time to time, because celexa makes it hard for me to concentrate. However, recently, I have noticed that my energy levels are extreme - if I'm not staying busy, I freak out, I think maybe I need the ADHD meds again; I have absolutely no interest in sex; and I'm beginning to feel more anxious. Maybe I just need my dose increased, I've been on 10 mg this entire time.

I'm not sure if the weight gain is related to the meds or the improved mood inscreasing my appetite.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	MattttG3,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male		8/19/2011 4:10:07 PM	Originally I told my doc that I was having anxiety attacks(I was 17 at this time) so he put me on celexa 20mg. From day one I felt almost depressed but I read other peoples reviews and saw others experienced this aswell. After 4 weeks I went back to see him and by then I was in a worse mental state than I started with! I was completely deppressed and that isnt like me at all! I told my doc that the anxiety kinda went away but I was sweating soooo much, had a headache everytime I woke up and it messed up my sleep so much. He increased my does to 40mg and thats when I quit it cold turkey. Withdrawl was terrible for about 4-7 days(too many syptoms to even bother writing) and even after that initial 4-7 days went by, I was depressed far more than I EVER had been prior and this lasted about 2 months. This drug literally turned all my emotions off and I lost alot of time because of this drug. If this even helps one person then it was worth it. God bless

Depression	MelJas, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/10/2011 3:23:19 AM	I'm in my late 20's and have been dealing with major depression since I was about 25. This has totally changed my life for the absolute better. I can control any mood swings I have, people notice I'm happier, I feel happier and more satisfied with life. I do get major headaches if I forget to take it more than 2 days in a row (I guess that is a good reminder to take it). I take it at bed as it makes me VERY sleepy and thus it helps me sleep. The only side effect I have is that I started talking in my sleep after I started to take this and the talking in the sleep has only gotten worse. I do not know I'm doing it but the ones who are around me notice that I'm doing it. It has killed my sex drive which I understand happens with a lot of anti-depressants but it totally took away my suicidal thoughts so I do not mind the loss of sex drive one bit. I'm happy that I found a doctor that put me on this and helped me find the right dosage so that I could return back to the land of the living.

I went into a deep depression,my anxiety went up worse then before I started, shaky hands, irritable, heavy night sweating, loss of appetite and zero sex drive and thoughts of suicide on a daily basis. I havent been able to sleep and when I do get an hour or two I wake up and cant fall back asleep and end up sobbing for hours on end. In 4 days I am go to see a psych therapist because for me this drug has been my own personal hell. I'm hoping she will get me on the right meds cause myself and my family cant take much more of this.

I feel more interested in things I used to enjoy and that &quot;dark cloud&quot; that was following me around is gone.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	7/20/2011 12:54:48 PM	2.5 years of Celexa and Wellbutrion combo-due to severe chronic pain,depresstion,PTSD,severe anxiety and panic attacks. Somedays are good, somedays are bad. Thinking of asking dr. to change anti-d's. I know Wellbutrion wasn't enough to stabilize things but, I really don't know if the Celexa is doing anything. I am always extremely honest at the dr. (you have to be,they are not mind readers) I am fortunate to have a wonderful caring dr. who I feel really cares about me,I don't feel like another # &amp; I don't feel rushed. This helps me a lot. I am also on other med's and I find it embarrassing. Sometimes when I pick up my script or med's I have anxiety attacks were I can't breath, shaky, numb hands&amp;fingers, racing heartbeat and I am SO afraid I will pass out (&amp; pee my pants) It's so asinine of me. I sympathize with all on this board.

I use it for anxiety due to job stress and being a single mom (very overwhelmed) and on a very low dose.  It has taken me to a new prospective on life and calmed me to where I m not as aggitated.  I recommend trying it.  Its not for everyone but it worked for me.  It does decrease sex drive but with such a small dose, its not excessive.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	7/18/2011 3:42:25 PM	I have been on this for almost a year. I've told my dr that it does not work for me &amp; instead of switching me back to Prozac or another medication she just increases the dose saying it will eventually work to help with my depression and anxiety. Also, she's the one who writes for my xanax which has tripled since taking Celexa! I'm trying to switch dr.'s now since she obviously isn't willing to listen to me about how unhappy I am on Celexa. Do Dr.'s get paid for writing for certain drugs? Very frustating!!

I don't have any side effects except for a slight panicky feeling early in the morning.  Otherwise, it has taken the edge off of my anxiety.  I am no longer irritable and panicked, and I can think clearly.  I have tried increasing the dosage but found that more than 20mg was too much.

Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	19-24	7/14/2011 10:47:32 PM	I have been taking celexa for almost a month and a half, but have not really felt any effect of the medicine. I started with 20mg and bumped up to 40mg and felt no change at all. To me the side effects, though not severe, have outweighed the medicine itself because there hasn't been a significant change in my mood, level of energy or motivation. Sexual side effects have decreased a lot since I began taking the medicine, but I have felt some effects on my stomach and bowel movements and also my general short term memory.

I'm on 20mg now for a month, and i still don't have the get up and go!after reading the reviews I requested to take this I was on Prozac for years!I was disappointed in the no sex and being tired, and no it's not thyroid or any other thing I've had all the blood work done, I enve thought I might have mono again!
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	5	3	Female	45-54	7/13/2011 3:07:34 PM	Had been on celexa 10 and 20mg several yrs ago and had excessive sweating and could not achieve orgasm. Did not like the sweating at all with already being overweight and starting menopause. On it again after prozac effectiveness decreased. Hope for good results with depression and no more sweating than I already experience with hotflashes. If sweating increases (or I get a boyfriend) I will have to go off of it again.
Depression	bypolarbear, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/13/2011 12:43:26 PM	Celexa made my depression and symptoms worse, almost to the point where I began to feel &quot;schiz-type&quot; symptoms. Too exhausted to even work, much less enjoy or do anything. Doctor took me off after a month and a half.

Depression	captain, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	19-24	7/10/2011 10:44:31 AM	I was prescribed Celexa for symptoms resembling depression/anxiety disorder and the drug actually made me feel worse. I constantly felt an uncomfortably warm tingling sensation running throughout my entire body and the Celexa made it extremely difficult to relax, especially while lying in bed. Celexa only worsened my symptoms. It did absolutely nothing to alleviate my symptoms.

Depression	Kim Wright, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/9/2011 7:44:31 AM	My life revolves around my own pain management. I thought living under a dark, gray cloud was just my lot in life. When I told my doctor there were times that I was so disappointed I was waking up to another day all I could do was lie there and cry, he prescribed Celexa. What a world of difference! Now when I must stay still during a &quot;big pain&quot; episode, it's no longer anything close to the end of the world. I'm happy now. I feel joy. I sing and (carefully) dance. Life is lovely from my eyes once more.

Depression	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	7/7/2011 2:56:29 PM	I was experiencing severe depression and my provider prescribed Celexa, with a beginning low dose. For several months, I had been limiting my food intake to lose weight and my protein levels were probably low.  I did not share this with my provider as I did not know that it could impact the effects of Celexa.  I took the medicine for 1.5 months, starting with a low dosage. I developed a severe skin rash that has been diagnosed as an rare skin disorder.  The rash is still present on my back, arms, legs, and in my hairline.  The itching is unbearable and predisone did not relieve it.  In reading these posts, I read one from the woman whose sister committed suicide while on Celexa and that Celexa had become toxic because she had been dieting and her protein levels were low.  I believe that the Celexa became toxic in my system. Tell your doctor if you are dieting prior to taking this drug and be careful.  Celexa also made me like a zombie.
Depression	Amylein17, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	7/7/2011 10:53:18 AM	This is a follow up review from July 2010. I took generic Celexa for 9-10 months. I gained about 10 pounds and was sleeping excessively. I would sleep 8 hours each night and still felt like I needed a nap every day. I went off this medicine to try ibuprpion to help me quit smoking. That was a failure-felt like a witch and it wasn't very effective at helping me stop smoking. After I went off ibupropion, I tried not taking any medicine, but rather supplements. I took 5HTP (for depression) and valerian root for anxiety for about a month. It helped a little, but not like AD medication. So I told my doctor I wanted something that made me feel like Celexa (happy, no worries, emotionally awesome), but that wouldn't make me hungry and sleepy all the time. She prescribed generic prozac which I've been taking for a little over a month. I really like it so far-normal appetite, sleeping ok, and feel good emotionally. I have noticed a bit of vaginal tenderness/inflammation, but I presume that is happening due to decreased frequency of sex. Other reviewers of generic prozac have said they've noticed it as well. As with Celexa, my libido has decreased, but that has actually helped since my partner has a weaker than libido than I did before depression hit. Overall, I'm very satisfied with generic prozac. Will follow up in the future if anything changes.

I am back to being me. I take mine at bedtime so I do not notice being drozy. Things are much better. If I understood my doctor correctly my body was depressed, and if I hadnt noticed something wrong she says it would have been worse. It has worked for me and I havent any of the side effects.

Negative effects are that I sleep for about 12-14 hours every day, dream patterns are really sparatic and strange, and after a while i became like immune to it or something and so they had to double my dosage.

Depression	Funwithsharps, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/14/2011 2:58:35 PM	This drug made me gain over 60lbs and lose all of my physical strength.  I was tired all of the time.  It made me feel high while it made my body rot away and become really weak.  I was encompassed by an all powerful apathy.  When I finally came to enough to ween myself off of this crap-it was like awakening out of a coma only to find yourself in another person's body.  I never had a weight problem before taking celexa.  I did not eat a lot while I was taking celexa, in fact it made me lose my appetite.  Exercise did not keep the weight off-it was a nightmare.  It has taken 4 months after stopping usage to get to a point to where the weight is finally coming off.  I was a very active dancer before usage-it destroyed the last thing that made me happy, MY BODY and my PHYSICAL STRENGTH.  It was not worth it.

Anyone know of a medication I can take that won't cause these side effects. I am suicidal at times.

At first I was tired all the time but once I figured out what time of day was better for me, I was fine. I have not gained or lost weight and I'm not overly happy either. I am me again. I was on zoloft for about a  month before and I felt no different at all. Within the first week I noticed a difference on celexa. Now I have no signs of depression. I still have periods of sadness but that's to be expected when you experience 3 deaths within a few months of each other.

Still have mild anxiety at times but it is much easier to handle and control with the medication. I did not realize how bad my anxiety was until I started taking celexa and realized how clearly I could think. I am very thankful for this drug.

I no longer experienced mood swings and overall seemed happy about everything.  I have been off of it for 3 months due to the fact that it wasn't working anymore.  I started to become more irritable and mood swings were present once again and have since spoke to my doctor about switching me to something else....she prescribed Pristiq.  I am only one week in and feeling better so far.  As far as Celexa, if and when you want to ween yourself off, doing so cold turkey will not work.  You will have to cut the pill in half or in 4's and get off that way.  I tried cold turkey and experience the worst side effects ever.  Vivid nightmares, electrical brain shocks, severe headaches.  Its not worth it.  Go slowly when getting off this med and know that it may take you up to 8 months as it took 6 months to get off in my case.  Good luck!

Husband quit smoking 2 packs a day, cold turkey and was IMPOSSIBLE to live with...mood swings, irritable, not sleeping...Suggested he see our doctor and was put on 10mg celexa...What a difference!!! He is so much more like himself, relaxed and sleeping well and as of now is 8 months smoke free after 40 yrs.... We both are extremely pleased with the results in our daily lives with no side effects!!! Highly recommend!

I had my dosage increased and decreased often and still nothing. One day my insurance company said they wouldn't pay for it anymore so my dr. put me on clexa. He told me many drs. prescribed it years ago until Lexapro was marketed. Lexapro made me tried, gain weight and didn't help my mood. I've been on celexa(generic) for 2 months and feel like a new person and I'm even losing weight. I think this pill keeps you even in mood and when things do pop up and get me down, I'm able to handle the solution calmly.

However I went from 127 lbs to 170, although I also quit smoking around the same time. I also had no sex drive, and it just stopped working enirely so I was then fat and depressed with no libido. I switched to wellbutrin and have already lost weight and I've got my mojo back :) Celexa did help me through one of my darkest times of my life, I just wish it didnt have so many side effects for me.

However, the longer I take it, the less effective it seems to be. I've noticed mood swings, anxiety, irritability, and difficulty sleeping in the last couple of weeks. Overall, I would judge Celexa to be exactly at par; not very good, but not that bad, either. A good start when trying to find the right antidepressant.

Depression	marge32, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/15/2011 11:00:49 AM	This medicine helped me a lot was in Nursing School and under a lot of stress along with taking care of a family don't know if I would have made through the year without it there was sexual side effects that got better over time, took about a month to see a dramatic change, get headaches in the beginning and go to the bathroom more often at times when I forgot to take it I was a little irritable. It helped me get out of bed and play with my kids again while looking at stress as decreasing day by day it goes from looking at a mountain to a regular hill. I'm glad I tried it as I feel myself again as I was against using medicine in the beginning when my doctor recommended it with therapy, I am on a low dosage of 10mg daily and don't want to increase it would like to cut that in half and eventually stop taking it. Good luck, its a good medicine helped me concentrate more, stay focused and calmer when dealing with anxiety driven situations.

Depression	Tegan, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	13-18	5/13/2011 1:20:18 PM	   I am a seventeen year old male and was perscribed Celexa after being on a different antidepressent called Zoloft (which also did not work for me). I have been taking the medication for about two months and felt the drug working very early on. I can personally say that the drug has made me feel even more depressed at times. My anxiety has also worsened and have since developed a major fear of panic attacks (which have occured in the past). I have experienced feelings of hopelessness and the feeling that I will never have another happy experience again.    The drug has also seemed to have a negative affect on my sleeping patterns. I often wake up many times throughout the night and sometimes have trouble falling back asleep on account of sad or depressing thoughts and feelings.    My experiences with this drug has proved to me that all antidepressants do not work for everyone. There is still a chance that the drug will worsen your depression. 
Depression	OneDayAtATime, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/13/2011 11:36:22 AM	I have been on celexa for 12 weeks and I can't even begin to express honestly how much this has helped me in my life already. The first 3 to 4 weeks there were alot of side effects. Sleeping all the time, absolutely no energy, no appetite and yeah it sucked but my doctor told me it would probably happen and he said I won't see any difference for 4 to 6 weeks. But now going onto my 13th week I am so glad I did this and I would recommended people to step up and not be afraid to see a doctor. The first appt I was so nervous and afraid cuz medication is not one of my favorite things. But I can now do and take steps in my life with no anxiety or doubt. It's my life and now I am just taking care of my personal issues, dont relay solely on the medication.

Depression	MoGo, 25-34 Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	5/4/2011 3:05:34 AM	I started out on 40mg a day, caused suicidal thoughts. I was paranoid and could not go outside at night. Was unable to stop crying, constant blurred vision, dry mouth, extremely tired all the time with non stop yawning, shakey/jumpy hands and feet/legs. Felt like i was stoned all the time, had to admit self to hospitol for a 1 month stay while i detoxed from it. Brain felt like it was getting electrified at random and head would twitch at the same time i got shocked, very annoying and confusing. Was not sure if i was delusional or it was real, becuase i was so far spaced out on it. Psych confirmed that i was not lying and that it can indeed happen, to my relief! Cause if symptons could be due to fact that i had taken Welbutrin, Celexas and Effexor all within a 3 week period.

I had been on the Lexapro for about 5 years before the change. My anxiety came back with a vengeance and I even developed depressive symptoms where I had none before. Impulse control went out the window. Two dosage increases later the doctor decided to try me on Cymbalta with no change, but anger control was now an additional issue. I was coming unwound! Finally went back to the doctor and insisted that she put me back on the Lexapro with a pre-authorization for the insurance company. I am gladly paying the $45/mo. co-pay...my sanity is worth it. I am currently on Lexapro 20 mg, 1 tab daily and Effexor XR 75 mg, 3 tabs daily and am finally stable with my anxiety.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	sueppy, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/30/2011 8:04:18 PM	I have been on celexa for over 5 years. My doctor had to beg me to start it,even though I suffered from severe panic and anxiety attacks. At the time I did not know what they were. I was going to the emergency room almost weekly. I started on 10 mg then a couple of years later increased to 20 and now I am on 40 mg. This drug has been wonderful. It has changed my whole life. No panic attacks!

Normally a happy person I was lost. After a period of time of mourning which I consider &quot;normal&quot; 4 such devastation,I really improved w this med. It was a God-send. A little upset stomach at first but quickly cleared. I highly recommend it. Have recommended it to a few friends and their dispositions really improved. Actually I can really tell when they miss a dose. Cannot recommend it highly enuf. Do yourself a favor and try it.

I suffer of mdd and at some point my children got scared just to talk to me because of my bad mood. I tried some other antideppressants but it was worse, until my doctor prescribed me celexa. Now I feel much better, and when I get angry for something(which one in a while I think is ok), my children ask me &quot;mom, have you taken your meds today&quot;? that makes me laugh!!!! ;P
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	4/14/2011 3:11:24 PM	After a tragic suicide, I began to experience horrible anxiety, OCD and depression. Citalopram (celexa) was first prescribed to me in 20mg, but later proved to be too much (caused me MORE anxiety than i began with) and I dropped down to 10mg/once a day. *Sometimes, going up in your dosage is not always the right answer!* This medicine has worked wonders. At first, the side effects outweighed the benefits but I stuck through it. I gained about 10-15 lbs. in 2 months. But I'm happy, and hopeful. Took about 4-6 weeks to fully see benefits. I've been on it over a year now and continue to take it, no side effects anymore. Be patient to allow the side effects to wear off AND allow the full potential of the medicine to show through :)          - about 6 months after being on celexa (citalopram) my doc also prescribed Bupropion (generic wellbutrin) 150mg/once a day. I feel amazing! And i've lost the weight I put on from celexa!

Terrible crying episodes, no appetite, very distant from my husband and friends.  Just didn't feel like myself.  Over the last 7 years my doctor has increased my dosage from 10mg to 40mg and that has solved my issues.  I had been taking wellbutrin for a short while; that made all my problems worse than ever.  Clexa has definately worked for me.  No side effects at all.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	3/27/2011 1:46:55 PM	I have been on 20mg for over a year for anxiety and depression and feel like I need to up my dosage.  I don't feel much different now than a year ago.  I have problems with my bowels as well. Most days I just want to sit in a corner and be left alone and I can't stand when too many people are talking at the same time to too much backround noise is going on.  Should I up my dosage?
Depression	Mrsham923, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/27/2011 12:30:21 PM	I have been taking Celexa 20 Mg. for 8 weeks now, and can't imagine going off of it.  Has made me feel like a real person again.  No depression or anxiety.  Sex Drive is down but you make that want you want it to be.  Overall very happy I started it.  Haven't gained weight like others have said, but get great night sleep.  I can finally turn off my brain and sleep.  Overall very happy I started it.

Depression	goodlife1, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/15/2011 2:27:38 PM	I was on Wellbutrin for 7 years.  Added Celexa about 4 months ago.  I have felt so much better withdrew from WB over 3 wks.  I feel really normal again.  No depression.  I did not like the way I felt on both so it was good choice to go to Celexa.  Also Blood pressure has gone way down.  don't know if WB had anything to do with that or not. 
Depression	Luckykats, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	3/14/2011 7:47:52 PM	I have been taking Celexa, combined with Welbutrin for 10 days.  I stopped on day 11 because I had a severe allergic reaction including facial swelling, hives everywhere, hands and fingers swelling.  It was horrible!  I'm still itchy despite being on 2 Rx and 2 OTC's for this reaction.  This combo cased me to gain 8 pounds in a week.  Also very groggy feeling.Has anyone else had an allergic reaction like this?  I'd be interested to know if the Celexa/Welbutrin really caused this because you'd think it would show up sooner and not wait for 10 days.  I didn't eat any new foods, no new soaps or lotions, no new fibers in clothing, nothing out of my ordinary routine.  This has got me so puzzled!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/13/2011 10:26:34 AM	My physician advised me that I wouldn't notice improvement in my depression until I'd taken the medicatio for 3-4 weeks. I was thrilled when I saw a marked improvement in 1-2 weeks. My friends and family say that I have never been happier. I started taking this medication when my depression escalated to suicide attempts. I've done a complete 180* and I can't imagine how I could be happier. I've been on this med for 8 weeks and have not experienced any side effects.

Depression	giveandgo, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	3/8/2011 12:00:52 PM	The first week was pretty rough, (IE - stomach problems, shaky hands and anxiousness), but a little more than a month into the treatment I feel beeter than I have in years. Generally more laid back and focused. Road rage and constant worries have subsided. Sex drive has gone down, but when I do get the urge...my performance actually increased! Still some stomach issues every now and then...but I like the way I feel and think that it's worth the trade.

We moved to MT and I was depressed and it helped with that. But now I am so exhausted it's ruining my life! I can't do anything and it's hard to take care of my kids. I've also had weight gain. I'm thinking of getting off of Celexa but the withdrawels will be terrible. 
Depression	nonprofitgal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/5/2011 10:41:31 PM	I have only been on Celexa for leass than a week at 20 mg. I will increase the dose to 40 mg at the end of 7 days.  My doctor prescribed it due to the current stress I am under (graduate school, a divorce, coming out).  So far I have not experienced the side effects my doctor told me to possibly expect during the first few days (flu-like symptoms). I noticed a difference 3 days into the treatment. The major mind-racing I used to experience is diminished and I feel more positive about my future and life in general.  So far so good!
Depression	km114, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	3/4/2011 11:57:49 AM	Celexa really helped with my anxiety and depression.  I was on it for about 5 weeks and if it weren't for all the bad side effects I would definitely still be on it because it worked better than Prozac, Paxil,and Lexapro.  But the nasty side effects included nausea, fatigue, nightsweats, muscle aches, no libido, itchy rashy skin and big red dry blotches all over my face.  It also caused me to have short term memory problems- I couldn't even remember what I had cooked for dinner the previous night.  I have never experienced so many side effects and stopped taking it three days ago.  Now I'm having withdrawal symptoms which are no fun either.  :(

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Gary, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/19/2011 12:16:09 PM	Depression and anxiety attacks gradually crept into my life. The last four years saw a random like up swing, first in anxiety attacks and then finally sudden and deep depression. I have been taking celexa for almost three weeks at the time of this writing. Day two I was on the treadmill watching tv and I caught myself laughing at the comedy show. My wife ran into the room and stood amazed it had been that long since she heard me laugh. My high school students even noticed that I was smiling and laughing in class. It is little things like this that show me how far I had slowly regressed over the years. I feel alive again. Social gatherings that used to be painful, due to fear of anxiety attacks, seem to have disappeared. It's like I keep waiting for the anxiety to take over, but it doesn't. So I am still adjusting to the new me. The first few days I had really bad headaches and dry mouth. Headaches are gone and I sip water, especially at night. I can't believe that little pill has changed my life in such a positive way. I thank God and my doctor every day. I don't know when the anxiety and resultant depression started. I had testicular cancer 30 years ago, maybe that was the trigger. All I know is that slowly over the last 30 years, I was ever so slowly changing for the worse. So I am learning to love life again. Take heart all of you who know what I am saying. I feel young again.

Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/16/2011 3:36:49 PM	I suffered from posttraumatic stress syndrome and depression. Was feeling hopeless, worthless and low self esteem. Celexa helped me begin to turn my life around. Began with 20mg, then 30mg, now on 40mg. This was just the start, I began to workout again, and enrolled in a variety of self help courses. I take multi vitamin supplements, 5-HTP, meletonin(sleep), DHEA(memory) and amino acids. Celexa is the most important part of my daily routine and the additional of supplements and self attention has increased it's effectiveness. IMHO. Only side effect is drousiness, so I take it 2 hours before bed. I still have bad days, don't we all, but I can snap out of them much faster than before celexa.Good Luck.

I haven't seen any improvement, and feel worse than I did a few weeks ago.  Extremely tired (wanting to sleep 10-12 hours daily), yawning, dry mouth, and still want to cry daily.  I feel like I do when I haven't taken any meds at all...off-balance, un-focused, and just in general crummy.  Can't wait for my appt. next week to get something different.

I stopped celexa and still felt really bad. I experienced a lot of side effects when taking this. After stopping it the side effects went away. But I still felt really bad. Thats the only drug that has had that type of negative effect on me.

I may be wrong, but Celexa seems to have been the answer.

Celexa has been the best. I feel that I function in society normally and my family and friends see a huge difference in me. It also helped me lose 55 pounds. I feel wonderful and I started out taking 10 mg and now take a 1/2 of a pill to get thru the days.  I love this drug!!
Panic Disorder	jessikachu, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	2/6/2011 7:37:04 PM	I have been using Celexa 20-40mg for severe general anxiety disorder for 7 months. It has taken away every single anxiety symptom I had! No more physical pain, stomach issues, migraines or racing thoughts. However, I have gained 35lbs. I exercise 6-7 days a week and eat less than 1600 calories a day so, this was excessive. The only other side effect I've had would be waking up in the middle of the night starving 1-3 times a week. I am currently in the process of switching to Prozac due to the excessive weight gain. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this drug for anxiety issues. Its a great drug to try first. My weight gain is just a freak thing so don't be scared off. Trying it won't hurt! Also, if this is your first drug, as it was mine, give it at least 1-3 months to fully kick in. It did ease my physical anxiety symptoms immediately, but the racing thoughts didn't cease for at least a month into it. Good luck!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	mike, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	2/4/2011 12:59:57 PM	Started 3 weeks ago for anxiety after heart problems were ruled out(similar symptoms).  The first week was in a fog and yawned alot, but could tell right away, the medicine was helping.  Basically I had the same 'lifes problems', but did not get near as upset about them.  One common side affect for men is cannot ejaculate as easy.  For a guy this is somewhat of a benefit.  I can last a lot longer than I used to, which makes it good for my wife, but tends to tire her out. I had ED before taking and continue to take Viagra, so am not sure how this RX affects erection quality.

This was my second medication for depression and i feel like a different person. it did take a few weeks to notice the difference, but my family noticed before me. After a few months i felt like i was not responding to medication and after talking to doctor, my dose was increased and in a matter of a few days, I was myself again. just wondering, how many times they can increase the dose if need be? I'm happy with the results and have no side effects

He was having a hard time coping. He was perscribed this along with regular counseling sessions and he has totally gained control again. He is a BRAND NEW KID. He has never been so happy. He also has become more involved with our church. SO I do not know if Celexa is to get all the credit, It surly helped. Because depression runs in the family, they The Doc, counselor, and my son have decided to stay on it. He is taking 10 mg a day- very low dose.

Panic Disorder	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/20/2011 4:26:49 PM	At around age 30 I was hit with mass amounts of anxiety/depression symptoms. I felt as if I was going crazy and was going to get committed to an institution. I even went to the emergency room because I thought I was going to die. I did not know what was wrong with me. It wasn't until my doctor told me what anxiety/depression can do to a person. I was against taking medication so I went a year without taking any form of medication, and what a mistake that was. Worst year of my life. I finally gave into my doctors recommendation and began taking Celexa and after about 5 months, I was feeling great again. My self confidence was back, my anxiety and depression symptoms had subsided it was wonderful. I realize today that some of us just have a chemical imbalance that needs to be treated with medication. Please give Celexa a chance it worked wonders for me. I will continue to take it.

I am always tired and have horrible headaches. I cannot focus in the classroom and have a harder time focusing because I am so tired from it and cannot stop yawning. This has also caused large weight gain which of course lead to me actually feeling worse.

I find that if I miss even one dose my mood changes drastically. When it is time for my next dose I have excessive yawning. And Sex....What's that? I have no sexual drive! Overall I try and not complain, my anxiety is just about non existent. Other side effects I have had Include dry mouth, nervousness, and a lot of weight gain!

It was somewhat effective for that but I discovered I no longer have anxious dreams and I certainly sleep more soundly.  Also the generic one does not work as well for me.   I have continued it long after I no longer needed to take the the Arimidex/Tamoxifen.  When I go off it, my  nightmares return.  I take one pill every evening.  It is my miracle drug.

I think this may be what is causing weight gain in folks. I also felt &quot;flat&quot; so after 8 months, I cut my dose in half and was feeling great with a bit more emotion returning. I just cut again to 5 mg and wow nelly, wild dreams are back with self doubt etc returning in full force so heading back up to 10mg.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	12/31/2010 1:06:45 AM	I took Celexa for only 3 months following a difficult breakup and family issues to treat my anxiety attacks and constant crying due to a depressed episode. I noticed a change about two weeks in, I felt better with more energy, had an easier time getting through the day and had no more anxiety attacks. I only had to go up to a 20 mg dose and after the three months was weened off and havent had any major issues since. The only downside was some nausea in the first month but overall it was very effective and I would recommend it for people with similar issues.

I've had both ever since i remember, but my social phobia got significantly worse in 9th grade. I woke up in the morning dreading the day and thinking of any excuse to give my mother not to go. During the summer i didn't leave the house or shower for 2 months and rarely ate. I read 24/7 to get my mind off depression. My mother got worried and sent me to therpy. I was diagnosed with social phobia, but kept my depression to myself. I was put on prozac for about a month. I got really hyper and woke up energized. I could not stop talking. My anxiety got better, but unfortunately my depression did not. I started self injuring and had trouble falling asleep. I've had suicidal thoughts before but i've always had a little bit of hope. One night i coudn't sleep and felt totally hopeless and started planing how i would kill myself. So i told my mom my medicine had kept me up and i needed to change it. I told my theripist that i coudn't sleep and that i felt hopeless the whole time on prozac. He told me that was impossible. Yeah, alright. They put me on celexa first on 10mg but that did nothing. They put me on 20mg and i take it at night because it makes me tired. I had no side effects. It has helped with the general feelings of anxiety. Like when i wake up in the morning i don't have to make excuses not to go to school. I can go to parties with my parents and can handle being around adults better, but once someone talks to me the anxiety lasts all day. So i'm feeling kinda bittersweet about it. I might have to up my dose or something. It hasn't helped my depression at all. I hope someone finds this helpful, haha.

After more than 1 month, I can't deal with this drug's side effects anymore - they are making me feel more depressed! I'm exhausted all the time to the point at which I can't keep my eyes open and enjoy my family's company. I also gained 8 pounds despite eating much less (and exercising the same amount) and my sex drive is nonexistent (just peachy for my relationship)! The last straw has been headaches, which started recently. So I'm going back to my doc to try something else. The SSRIs are NOT for me!

I am on a low dose (10mg) and find myself dealing with stress/transitions easier.  My friends and family have noticed an overall shift in my attitude and outlook on life.  My sex drive has decreased, but not so dramatically that it has impacted my relationship. I did get terrible headaches when I first began the treatment, but they stopped after about 2 weeks.

It has really been the best and I  have been on them all. It helps my depression, I take it in the morning, but now, unfortunately, due to some challenges coming up, so I NEVER go backward, I think I will be increasing it to 20mg, the therapeutic dose. I suffer from severe depression, but 10mg has helped so much, medication doesn't cure my disease, but it helps me to &quot;cure&quot; my reactions, my gifts and talents to people, those I love, and all I have to offer to this world. GREAT medication! I also take Klonopin and Seroquel for sleep as I have Bipolar II tendencies, I actually just think I am moody and there ain't nothing wrong with that! But...I am definately have the 'genes' of depression, and Celexa makes it easier.

Started on 20mg Celexa with 20mg Buspar' in Oct. 2010 felt better in about one week but not 100% after 6 weeks. Doctor increased dosages; Celexa 40mg 1x daily, Buspar 10mg 3x daily. Finally feeling like myself again. No major side effects. Really helps with sleep, I worry less, deal with life better and my positive attitude is coming back. Celexa helped me to accept what I can't change and gave me the push I needed to work on the things I can change.

It has worked wonderfully on my depression. I have more energy and stamina. I want to get out and work, as well as play. It has worked well for me.

I tried so many things before Celexa, and never thought I would ever feel better and less anxious. I feel wonderful now, and haven't experienced any side effects. It does make me very sleepy, so I take it at night. My relationships with everyone in my life is so much better now, and I am a much better mom. I started feeling a difference within the first few days. I definitely recommend it!

The medication has been a great help at relieving my depression, however, one of the annoying side effects is a constant ringing in the ears (tinnitus).  I tried reducing the dosage to 10mg a day but this did not stop the tinnitus.  One of the beneficial side effects has been increased stamina and endurance during sex.  My wife loves it. Before Celexa, I was on Zoloft.  There was no tinnitus with Zoloft, however, the constant diarrhea was awful.

Once you are on it for awhile, make sure you taper off slowly and dont miss doses - withdrawal can have some pretty hefty side effects.  I will have to agree with memememe down below - works great but forget about ever having another orgasm unless you and your partner are very athletic or have serious stamina. I prefer Lexapro but this drug has roughly the same benefits/side effects and is MUCH cheaper!!  Another unpleasant issue seems to be the feeling of being absent minded.  Over all the side effects are better than the disease itself and I have managed to cope for a few years now.  If you are very sexually active you better skip this one....
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	11/30/2010 12:35:47 AM	I only took the medication for about 4 weeks and was at the lowest dose since my doctor wanted to work me up to the effective dose to try and help reduce side effects. But even on the lowest dose I felt terrible on it. It didn't do anything for my depression, which the doctor said I wasn't at a high enough dose or had it in my system long enough. But I suffered from extreme nausea, had an extremely dry mouth all the time, and felt very tired on the medication. I had to switch from taking it in the morning to taking it at night. I'm now on Paroxetine which does not give me any side effects as it is an extended release so it's less harsh on your stomach. For me, this one was a no go. The side effects were just as horrible as my depression.

I take 40mg each night, because I feel like a zombie if it's taken durring the day. Celexa keeps my mood swings under contol. I am no longer having extreme highs and lows. However, the side effects are very hard for me to get use to. Some of which include, feelings of absent mind, sweating, blurred vision, and forget about ever having an orgasm again! I guess you should really read up on the side effects and weigh your option before taking.

When I skip doses I notice I get moody and anxious.  But when I take daily (before bed) I find I feel the best and VERY under control and happy.  It has helped and become a medication I'll have to take the rest of my life due to chronic imbalance of serotonin in my system after childbirth. I'm ok with this because it helps and everyone around me from family to coworkers notice a positive change in my attitude and behavior.

It took about 4 years to work throught the roughest part. During that time I took Wellbutrin and then prozac. For the past 8 years I have taken Celexa and have had not a single anxiety attack. It has worked very well for me. I will say that my libido is non existant, however, I am still happily married and do enjoy sexual relations, I just don't &quot;feel&quot; what most feel.

I was consumed by anxiety which has been a lifelong problem since I was a child, resulting more and more in physical symptoms as I get older (frequent &quot;adrenaline rushes&quot;, indigestion/IBS, chest tightness, prolonged pounding heartbeat and, recently, mild panic attacks that were interfering with my sleep and ability to function). 5 years ago at age 22, I first started taking Celexa 10mg. At the onset of my treatment I was very stressed out and nervous. I got a number of moderate side effects: heart palipatations, heart &quot;skipping a beat&quot;, and one episode of very rapid heartbeat that was scary because I was not prepared for it. I stayed on the medication and within a week the side effects went away. 10mg was eventually reduced to 5mg because I found that 10mg resulted in too much of a relaxing effect (carelessness, lack of motivation). 5mg improved this considerably.  I stayed on 5mg for over a year and eventually went off the medication altogether at the direction of the doctor because my symptoms were under control. 2 yrs later, anxiety symptoms returned amidst new life changes and stress.  I went back on 5mg celexa to mitigate the physical symptoms I was having.  My latest bouts of anxiety prior to taking Celexa were very distracting and were affecting my body. I saw a cardiologist because my heart was constantly pounding, blood rushing in my head when I tried to sleep. They ruled out any physical cause so I started taking 5mg Celexa again. Have been very pleased with the results. This medication almost entirely eliminates the abnormal anxiety that I have experienced recently and at other points in my life. I am on a very low dose, which is enough for me to respond to, and I do not experience any negative side effects.  The medication does prolongue sexual performance even at this low dose (consider that to be a positive side effect not a negative one).

I'm still on 40mg, and not really sure how much it helps.  It gives me the most crazy insane dreams yuo can imagine and I take it in the morning, also trouble sleeping (not sure if that's the cause or not)

Additionally, I didn't know not to drink and had two cocktails...that is something you definitely do *not* want to do. Drinking while on this drug gave me panick attacks and urinary problems in that I could not urinate at all. Otherwise, I have found a drug that is great for me. 
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	Turner, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	11/8/2010 1:00:12 AM	I had taken this med for 11 yrs for depression/gerneralized anxitey.  Worked o.k. but can hardly climax during sex.  Recent stressors of ended relationship caused always slight problem with contamination osd to go off the charts.  Was increased to 80 mg/day for last 13 wks with no imporvement.  Problem is getting worse.  Not working for me and I am not willing to give more time.  Obsessions ruling my life and suicidal thought present regularally.  Sure it works for some but the continuing of the OCD is going to lead to loss of job(and possible life).  Probably going to try prozac.  Had been on prozac for 7 yrs prior to Celexa.  It seemed to work good but I stoped it myself for no good reason and ended up crashing and burnig and put in hospital in 99.  That's when they put me on Celexa.  I still remember a distinct shift in my attitude after about 3 wks when I  starting prozac.  I never did have that feeling with Celexa.  I think it may have never worked that well for me.  It may work for you.  Good luck to you all.

Depression	red, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/3/2010 5:38:39 PM	I was prescribed this medication after many months of depression and suicidal thoughts.  I have stopped the medication on several occasions because I felt I was better.  Each time, the symptoms return and I improve when I take the medication.  This has definitely been a life saver for me.  I hate to think what would have happened to me without it.

My headaches are gone, guess I was living with a TERRIBLE side effect for 2 years!!!

Depression	Omega1697, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	10/31/2010 1:45:42 PM	I started taking Celexa 20mg (generic citalopram, its a lot cheaper) The first week of August this year. I was diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I take it once a day at night (with food to diminish any possible gastrointestinal side effects). I am feeling 100% better than I did just a few months ago. I could not be more satisfied with the outcome. Before, I could not sleep or focus on anything. I was nauseas and exhausted all of the time and I even felt so dizzy I couldnt drive or go to class. I am now falling asleep without the help of sleep-aids. I have energy again; I no longer sleep 8 hours and wake up feeling more exhausted than I did the night before. FOR ME this was the correct medication. NO MEDICATION IS CORRECT FOR EVERYONE. There are several negative reviews from individuals; take them with a grain of salt. Yes, the first week can be miserable on a new anti-depressant (you have serotonin receptors all over your body, including your brain, blood vessels and stomach. While your body is adjusting to the new levels of serotonin, you will probably feel nauseas and have a headache). You have to be patient though! After a week I could feel a difference, and after a month I felt great. I feel like my old self again. The only downside I can find with the drug is that I cannot drink AT ALL on this drug. As with most SSRIs, alcohol renders the medication ineffective because Alcohol occupies the same receptors in your body. Massive panic attacks came for an entire week after drinking moderately. I would happily give up alcohol for the rest of my life to NEVER feel the depression and anxiety ever again though. There are also sexual side effects, but for me they have been positive. I can now maintain an erection and have a healthy sex life. I also have no problem with having orgasms. Do not rule out any drug because of the reviews on here. Eventually, you WILL find the right drug for you :). HANG IN THERE!!

It's worked wonders for my anxiety/panic attacks! The side effects I have experienced have been a lose in my labido, weight gain and fatigue. I will be talking to my Dr. to see if she could put me on something else or maybe decrease my dosage. Other than that, it has helped me a lot.

It &quot;balanced&quot; my anxiety and feelings of anger. Curiously, I get full-blown erections during the day while at work. Not only is it embarassing, but now I'm experiencing premature ejaculation 2-3 times a day, even at office meetings! I'm sure most would think this as a gift, but I have to always carry a briefcase to cover myself along w/ extra pair of underwears and pants. I even think penis width has increased due to constant erections. They last 5-10 minutes only though. 
Depression	Rob, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	25-34	10/27/2010 2:49:26 PM	Was prescribed this after a long period of depression and anxiety when I finally broke down.  After a few weeks it definitely worked and helped with the symptoms of anxiety and major depression.  The most prominent side effects for me are excessive sweating and sexual problems.  I have no problem being aroused and performing, however I almost feel desensitized, it's harder to reach orgasm, less intense when I do, and semen production is drastically reduced.  Keep that in mind guys.

Since i have been on it i feel better than i ever have in my life.

Now i can sleep great and i just feel relaxed, my mind don't run in circles over and over anymore.

It has improved my life greatly. I dont stress about the things I can not change anymore. Im able to let things roll of my back a llittle easier now and has improved my relationships with family and friends more than words can say. The only thing negative is my sex drive has gone down a touch....but weighing the good and bad, i would recommend this to anyone who needs it.

I don't really like taking medicine but agreed to try it.  I was very happy with the results.  It feels like I can live my life again!  It made me realized how much I was missing out on when I had the anxiety/ social phobia.  I am very satisfied with Celexa.  I feel like a normal person again.

My brain felt numb.  I started on 10mg Citalopram and increased to 20mg. recently. Thinking is much more clear, but depression and anxiety are still a problem. Will try this dosage until my MD thinks it should be increased.

It just goes to prove that no one med is right for everyone.  I had mild depression and have been on it for a little more than a year.  My doctor prescribed 20 mg.(the lowest dose in pill form) and I do split them in half so I take 10 mg at night. I have not had any adverse effects and have noticed an all around better feeling.  No bad effects while &quot;getting used&quot; to this drug.  Within a week I was feeling better.  And the generic is easy on the pocketbook.

I, as well as my family, have noticed a significant improvement in my mood, and the way I handle life in general. There were side effects at first, but if you hold on for a few days, they will go away.

Celexa is wonderful, though my dose is slightly higher than the recommended maximum dose, little to no side effects (some nightmare issues and sleeplessness).  It took me from sitting in a corner of my room for days on end, with heavy insomnia, to being a normal functional person again. I love it!

For 6 months, the Celexa was not very effective, and I had to move up to 40 mg.  Then, I rapidly gained 35 lbs.  My doctor quickly took me off Celexa and put me back on Lexapro.  My husband's experience was the same.  We don't mind paying for the Lexapro now.  It's worth it.

I found this medication to ease my anxiety related to the incident and the panic attacks are almost none, two years later. The only side effect I have noticed are about a 20lb wieght gain and very vivid dreams involving odd situations. This drug has not made me &quot;super happy&quot; , but made me feel like myself before I had PTSD, in other words normal.

I asked my dr about my situation and she suggested this drug.  I was so skeptical because of the stigma attached to being on an anti-depressant.  It took me about 6 mos to decide then I couldn't take feeling the way I did anymore.  I can tell you that I am on 10 mg for about 9 mos and after the initial couple of weeks I don't have any side affects. I also feel like a normal person for the first time in a long time! Now I tell close friends about it who may have similar symptoms and I rave about it.  I used to cry for no reason and now I don't anymore but I still feel like myself.  I can honestly say that this has really had the most positive affect on my life.  I know everyone is different but it really has worked out so well for me!

Have lost weight on it, but scared now as I have to take Arimidex as I didn't want Tamoxifen. Reading not so good reviews on the Arimidex. Hoping the Celexa will counteract some of the side effects. Very scared that I'm going to go backwards after putting up with the side effects of Celexa. I don't want to lose the quality of my life for a pill. Have to take Adavan to sleep and have decided it might be better to take that and the Arimidex at night and Celexa in the morning. Sometimes it seems the pills are scarier than the cancer. It has been a long 4 months and not looking forward to 5 years of this.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	35-44	9/22/2010 8:57:29 AM	Warning. Do not take Prilosec while starting out on celexa 20mg. On the 3rd day became very nervous, sick to my stomach(vomited)extreme anxiety,and almost passed out.Prilosec deceases the bodies ability to process and eliminate celexa, thus compounding the side effects.per pharmacist.Please tell your Dr. or pharmacist about OTCdrugs that my interact with your precription meds.
Panic Disorder	Snuggles, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	9/22/2010 6:09:40 AM	I have been on Gen. Celexa for about a year now. My first week I felt wasted drunk the entire time but it tapered of and since then I have felt great so long as I remember to take it. When I forget to take it the withdrawal symptoms are cripling; headaches, out of body feelings, tremmors, etc. The constant negatives I have experienced are constant fatigue, loss of appetite (lost 25 lbs in the last few months) sometimes I get irritated for no reason but not frequently. I really have not had a loss of sex drive which is unfortunate mine could stand to go down a bit. Overall Im very happy with it I feel more level and on the ball. I did try to take myself off of it at one point but was unsuccessful the side effects from quitting are unbarable severe nausea and dizziness crippling depression suicidal thoughts I could not summon the will to do anything I was physically and mentally destroyed they were enough to make me want to take it for the rest of my life. Do your research do not start this lightly it is a commitment and can really hurt you if you arent careful. The risks are worth the rewards if it works for you though. 
Depression	John, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	9/21/2010 3:00:14 PM	Celexa is great. I have been on it for about a year and continue to feel better. I had some side effects at firt but they went away. Give it time. Things often get much owrse before they get better when adjusting to a med.
Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	joy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/19/2010 1:23:43 PM	In treatment for PTSD, Social Anxiety Disorder and Panic Attacks.  First diagnosis prescribed 20 mg. after about 4 months, efficacy wasn't sufficient, prescribed 40 mg.  I was doing better on this with less break through of anxiety and panic attack, until about 5 mos. Now not helping much at all.  Hydroxyzene and Amytriptalene added still have ill effects, and hives from anxiety.  Need a new product that will be more efficient, so that I can feel more balanced, and have less skin outbreaks, especially on torso, hands feet and neck and around eyes, and inside ears too.

Panic Disorder	Dan, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	19-24	9/16/2010 12:36:43 PM	I started taking Celexa a few months ago for panic disorder.  The side effects were bad, to say the least.  The second day especially.  I was in a state of panic all day long, I couldn't sleep and felt jittery and drugged, my jaw was sore from clenching my teeth so much.  After three months or so I felt substantial relief from my attacks and stupidly I discontinued use (other reason for stopping was the complete lack of emotion and libido during sex).  Then two months later I was in the process of getting a new job.  After a call from the new employer I had an intense attack which was so bad I had to leave work early at my current job.  I immediately filled the prescription and started the painful first week adaption process again. This time I'm staying on it no matter what, every side effect is much better than panic attacks.

I don't think I had any side effects until I was tapered off of it. Then I went through withdraw. I had vertigo, nausea, and crying spells. I would cry 4 times a day for no reason and it was hard core crying. I am still going through withdraw and I have been completely off of it for a week. But the vertigo and nausea hit me a week before I was completely off of it. Hope it works for ya.

Depression	aliasa40, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	9/11/2010 7:32:48 PM	I have tried a few anti-depressants (moderate depression) on and off for 20 years.  I always gave up on them, finding no results whatsoever. This past year i started having panic attacks, feelings of doom, and just a general lack of hope and despair.  As I am reluctant to take pills everyday, I fought my doctor putting me on this medication. He encouraged me to give it a chance before giving up. I am 10 days into the med.  At first upon taking, I thought I was &quot;going crazy&quot;..for two days after starting I had the worst panic attacks ever and insane insomnia .  But now all of sudden, I am sleeping through the night(albeit bizarre dreams), I do not feel the dread or doom, have lost 5 pounds, and feel optimistic about life.  I urge everyone to give it a chance.  It may not be for all, but it is already helping my life...will write again at 20 days out to report.  P.S. I have less desire to smoke, which is a GREAT plus!!

I am doing much better at coping with my depression since beginning this medication and have seen drastic changes in my mood and behaviors since I started this. I believe that Celexa is a great product and should be considered as a treatment product for people. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	45-54	9/6/2010 5:04:58 PM	Took the generic(20mg) for first week and could not handle the side effects(anxiety) and stopped using it. Then after two weeks off it, I started at 10 mgs. and after 2nd day my mood improved and no anxiety attacks. No side effects and my sex drive even improved on 10mgs. Will try 10mgs. for one week and up the dose to 20 mgs. This drug could be taken gradually in the beginning (10 mgs. for the first week).

Depression	john, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	9/5/2010 9:47:35 PM	This medication almost caused me to wreck and drive my car off of a bridge.  Within one half of an hour of taking it, I could barely breath and started vomiting. My doctor told me to take this medicine in the morning and I should be fine (the problem is, I had an hour long commute to work). That was my fault for not trying it on the weekend.  For two days, I felt suicidal and more anxious than ever. I had a similar reaction to Paxil.  I WOULD NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE EVER EVER AGAIN!

It has been wonderful, i have no more panic attacks and feel much happier. I just recently got bumped up from20mg a day to 40 mg a day, but i dont feel as happy as i did on 20 mg, ironically, so im gonna see if my dr can put me back on 20 mg. I have no side effects though and would recommend this antidepressant to anyone!

I didn't think I was depressed.  The doctor put me on celexa and immediatley life changed. The severe anxiety went away, my sleep improved and i was much less agitated over daily events.  It made a major change.  If I try to go off it, I end of taking it because it really helps even out the highs and lows of life.

Panic Disorder	Gracie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/26/2010 4:55:39 PM	I have been on this medication for 3 years now, and it has changed my life.  Within days I felt better.  After a full 6 to 8 weeks the panic was gone.  My biggest triggers for panic are social situations.  If I know I am going to be facing a trigger situation, I take my rescue medicine Klonapen (spelling?)and did just fine.  I've only had to use that maybe 3 times while waiting for the full effects of the Celexa.  The only negative side effect for me is excessive sweating.  Nothing uncontrolable, but during hot weather I could tell an increase.  However I'll take a little sweating over a panic attack any day!!

I tried taking it in the morning, but it made me really sleepy so i switched to taking it before bed and it actually helped me sleep. I wake up refreshed. I know others that take it in the morning and dont have any drowsiness. So figure out what works for you. I have gained some weight, but with exercise it'll come off
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	cooper, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	8/23/2010 10:09:06 PM	This medication has helped calm my anxiety and made episodes more managable.  I have been taking 40mg for a month.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is also helpful in changing thought patterns.  The only side effect has been decreased sex drive and inability to orgasm.  This has caused major issues for me in my marriage, although my husband is very understanding.  Very disappointing to have to trade a satisfying sex life to be able to manage anxiety.

I was having panic attacks throughout the day non stop. They have been on &amp; off for 2 years &amp; finally after having a my 1st baby I had to do something. I've actually been able to travel,shop &amp; eat out without running to a bathroom. The only side effect I have is dry mouth &amp; loss of appetite. I'll take that over an attack everyday. And it hasn't interfered w/my love life w/my husband. It's nice to be able to smile &amp; have fun again:)

I felt so much better within weeks. I went off it in 06' and did very well until jan of 09' when my dad died and i started seeing symptoms again and asked to be put on it again. it has helped my mood, my tolerance, and my over all attitude. i have not had any side effects at all and i would recommend this for depression over any other drug on the market. (i have tried other antidepressants and had horrible side effects)

Hated all the side affects.I quit taking anything for a couple of years then went into the worst depression ever.I was so close to suicide and could not function at all. I started on 20 mg of generic celexa and was very sleepy but kept taking it because I was desparate. The sleepiness subsided but I still needed a little more help so the Doc upped my dose to 40mg a day. Now that the side affects have passed, I feel happier than I have ever been in my life and can now cope with everyday stress. I feel like a normal person for the first time.

I've also taken Abilify and Risperdal with it, which makes it work even better.

I noticed a difference in my mood pretty quickly and it has remained effective since I began taking it.  As far as side effects, I noticed a drop in my libido, but not a significant drop.  I have not noticed any other side effects.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	mommacat4, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	8/8/2010 8:59:32 PM	Started taking after being on Paxil 20mg for 1 1/2 months because the Paxil was not working.  The Celexa has brought me out of that paxil &quot;fog&quot; and not be tired all the time. The side effects were Very minimal because I had already went through them when starting the Paxil (and they weren't that bad anyways--)It has helped more then the Paxil did and has less side effects. I had dry mouth but drank lots of water and chewed gum-it only lasted about 4 days. Yawned alot for about a week but then  it was gone. Cloudy (Paxil) head was gone within 2 days and now I can really put things into perspective compared to before. I feel stronger emotionally and more in control of situations. I feel human again.Have ringing in my ears still(which Doc says is unrelated--BUT I disagree--it is dealable though if this pill is going to work then I can deal !! Have been on it for 3wks. I haven't been as depressed and so far my anxiety hasn't bothered me. If anything it has made me realize I needed the help and am glad and proud of myself for getting it and the will-power to get more help if needed. Will continue to update.It is important to know that most people do NOT have bad side effects to antidepressants..They can however talk themselves into it by being so nervous of a side effect..I tried to look at it differently..I kept looking for all the good the pill is doing and making me feel rather then any thing possibly bad,which like I said was very minimum and dealable. Give it 1 1/2 wks. and see if it works for you (after all if you have the FLU you are sick that long also so take the pill and wait a week to decided.

Depression	ladypixie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/6/2010 11:59:11 AM	I have been taking this med for 3-4 years now with doses right up to 60mg/day. I didn't find that 60mg was any more effective than 40mg so have stuck at 40 for most of the time I have been taking it. I was prescribed this drug after taking many other anti-depressants which failed to help my mood, and as anxiety and panic were becoming more prominent in my depression we decided to try Celexa (citalopram). It has helped but only very slightly if I'm honest. I think for people who have mild-moderate depression it would probably be much more effective.As it turned out I was diagnosed with Bipolar early 2009 and this is probably the reason why it hasn't been so effective for me, but I can confidently say that I have had no bad side effects with Celexa, and have found it one of the easiest SSRI's to tolerate in terms of side effects. Even though I have said I haven't noticed a massive difference from it, I have noticed that when I have tried to withdraw from it than my anxiety has become pretty bad again so maybe it has helped slightly more than I give it credit for! Regardless, I plan to continue taking it for the foreseeable future.

This antidepressant has made a significant effect on my outlook of life. I feel a sense of euphoria at times even. The only bad side effect I had was when I forgot to take it for a couple days my body becomes twitchy and I can't stay focused.

Bipolar Depression	fullspectrum, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	8/2/2010 6:37:30 PM	i was first diagnosed '96 with schizo-affective. '99 major dep. Then '06 with bipolar depression. have tried numerous anti-depressants. Celexa 40mg seems to be the most tolerable by my metabolism. very low side effects. the nausea subsided after about 5 or 6 days. before taking my once a day dose in the morning i make sure to eat something to counteract the chance of nausea. my metabolic type is similar to my mother's whom is also on anti-depressants. we were both on zoloft 50mg for about 4 years. and both of us can not tolerate wellbutrin, paxil and especially prozac as they make us very jittery. i was initially started at 20mg once per day taken in the morning. however, i started with 10mg (half dosage) for for one week and upon second week added the other half to achieve full dosage. i am a survivor of two serious suicide attempts and the most important thing i can tell u besides seeking help (which is all around if u just look and ask) is to never, never give up on ur worth as a human being. best wishes and regards.

I could tell a definite improvement in my mood and I haven't had anymore 'bad' days where was completely turned off and thinking of suicide or I didn't care about anything. Hopefully it will continue to work. I did have a little heartburn starting out but thats the only side effect so far.

I was sceptical at first and doubted the medication would work but beyond words, this one has saved my quality of life.

My insurance company was changed and my prescription went up from $30.00 to $135.00 per month.  I could no longer afford it.  I tried to slowly take myself off of Cymbalta but it was almost impossible.  The nightmares, out of body sensations, mind spinning, fever, nausea and flu-like sensations were too much to handle.  My doctor placed me on generic Celexa (Citalopram) 40 mg. per day instead.  It has worked beautifully and I have had no side effects whatsoever.  It costs less than $10.00 per month.  I'm happy with it!

Depression	beth, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/16/2010 11:51:11 AM	This medication has been the only drug that has ever even touched me for the better. I used to think Paxil worked because I didnt know how much better it could be with celexa but almost immediately I felt like a new and improved girl. I never had a major depressive episode just an underlying dysthymia(low level depression)since high school. I always thought that I was just unhappy and that was that. About 6 years ago I started taking celexa after lexapro made me have zero improvement. The rest is history. The most wonderful drug in the world. Did gain about 10 pounds but that was the beginning and I would rather be 10 pounds heavier and happier then 10 pounds thinner and miserable. Now Im the thinnest I've ever been. I came to the conclusion that when you start taking the celexa you relax and arent as crazy about being a half a pound more. I always thought the other drugs I took(paxil, prozac, zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, buspar were working because I used to talk myself into the fact that I felt better when I felt no change. Celexa changed my life and showed me that its ok to try different drug and treatment modalities until something works because this is your life. You are worth it. Being happy is something we all(or at least I)was willing to give-up because I thought something was wrong with me because I never had much of an effect from anything. Take care people and take the time to find something that will help you!

At first I noticed an increase of appetite, but that subsided after 3 weeks. I had to experiment with the time of day that I took the medication due to yawning and drowsiness and found that around 9 pm works best for me. I am very happy with the drug. I have improved concentration, am not tired all the time, the negative thoughts have stopped and I laugh again. Life has improved greatly since I've started taking it.

Couldn't understand why I would swing moods, even a friend of mine commented and ask &quot;why are you always talking about death and dying? It made me think.  Now I have been on celexa for one year and my life has turned completely around. I don't pay people or their negative comments any attention. Had a compusive order to think about bad situations over and over in my head but now free of those repeated thoughts. Feel like living, not dying. There are those that don't believe in depression or that the symptoms are not real. But I am here to tell you that if I was not on this medication I would not have a job, friends or continued my education. Celexa gives me no side effects at all. I feel there is hope and I have finally really made long term goals. My daughter has recognized the change in me and I realize that this medicine is needed to function properly. Recently have had to increase it because body got immune to same dosage in my case. But it still has that wonderful affect on me. Back to my pleasant self again. After being ashamed to admit the problems in my life God has created a medicine to help those that truly need it.People love being around me now ....can't get rid of them!!(smile).
Depression	nevadared, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	65-74	7/14/2010 4:58:34 AM	The reason I didn't grade Celexa is because I restarted the drug 2 weeks ago. I first started taking Celexa over 10 years ago. Within 2 weeks of starting, I felt great, almost euphoric. Over the years, this effect gradually waned until it had no effect and switched to other brands. No real effect. Ended up on Zoloft. No help. after being off Celexa a few years, I have started again, hoping for a return of the old magic. Started at 20mg for 2 weeks. Am now on 40mg and will increase to 6omg next week. So far, no noticeable improvement. Will keep it up for a few months. Don't know what I will do then.

My anxiety was relieved and my total mood was uplifted.  I felt better than I had for a while.  Now that I'm into my second year,I'm beginning to experience a return of bouts with anxiety. Current dosage is 20mg. My overall experience with this drug has been positive.  I have had NO side effects.  I would personally recommend it.  I judge it to be safe and effective.

Depression	Piece of Work, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/3/2010 11:33:38 AM	3 yrs ago in the midst of an event-induced depression &amp; anxiety, 1st tried Zoloft; no help. Then citalopram (generic) at 20mg.  Almost immediate relief (but event soon concluded, too).  That said, the spiraling, out-of-control despair, dread &amp; nausea stopped.  With citalopram, it felt like I was blocked from obsessing about the recent unendurable concerns (I'll get cancer like my mother, the world is full of incomprehensible suffering, even if things are good for a time they won't last, there's no joy...)-- either I couldn't focus on them anymore or I was on a track where I could not derail into despair.  At the same time, sexual interest declined and even when aroused, I couldn't climax.    BTW, husband has urged me NOT to go off drug.  He said he'd rather give up sex than have to go through my being depressed again!  Dr suggested reducing amount to 5 mg/day.  Sex now is usually better but still infrequent.  Realize menopause could be responsible, too, not to mention boring old routines of a 25 year marriage!  Weight gain-- a little.  Could be menopause, too.   Then again, if the effect of citalopram is to prevent focus on the negative, it stands to reason that it would prevent focus on the positive (sex, getting things accomplished).  There are always trade-offs.

Each time i increase dosage it gets harder and harder to come to  fruition, sometimes thats a good thing most of the time not. The main issue is that i dont feel sadness or happiness, more of  a freeky limbo of non-compliance.

The low dosage I'd been coasting on for years did stop working, however, and the doc had to increase the dosage. My only dislike is the sexual side effect. I understand that this is fairly common for antidepressants, though. It hasn't been debilitating enough to discontinue usage, but it certainly makes things difficult sometimes.

Depression	Clrbrook, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	6/20/2010 1:13:30 AM	No significant side effects, although I'm beginning to wonder about weight gain being related. It's seemed effective and easy, so I have very mixed feelings about ceasing the med and going back to my &quot;dysthymia&quot; (mild up and down depression symptoms, in my case worse in winter- so some solar affective disorder in there.)
Depression	AnnieFanny, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	6/19/2010 9:01:34 PM	Its not fair at the moment to rate this drug.  I barely began taking it --- 20 mgs a day.  I heard it makes you gain weight.  Is that true?  If it is,  I won't be taking it long!  Gaining weight is depressing enough!  Anyone out there had that experience?   My daughter and my younger sister have been taking this drug for a couple of years and seem to have great success --- my daughter is as skinny as a broomstick,  and my sister is heavy-set and swears she's put on more weight.  Her weight issues began long ago,  and with many different antidepressants.

I take it for extrema anger over little things.  Since taking Celexa I have not had an anger outburst.  The side affects for me were a little annoying at first but quickly went away.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	6/17/2010 11:05:53 AM	I was on Zoloft for many years and never fully came out of the fog.  Within just 2 weeks of use, the world felt much brighter with Celexa.  For the depression and anger, Celexa works great.  Major side effect, though, is absolutely ZERO desire for sex.  This is creating a significant issue in my marriage of over 9 years.  Will be seeking an alternative.

O I take one half of pill (10mg , cut in half so I take 5mg). If your doctor prescribed it try it every body is different it might work for you or not so just try it Good Luck!

I've just started talking the generic version of Xanax i'm hoping this one works better.

The temors in hands weren't bothering me so reported &quot;no change&quot; and started building back up with a week on 10mg a day then 4 days at 20mg and hand tremors came back big time - shaking when attempting to hold newspaper, book or plate.  weaned back down and tremors reduced substantially -now off and trying Lexapro

I don't worry as much about going out with friends and what i'm going to say or whats going to happen. I still sweat a lot when I have to go to work. I'm also having headaches,memory loss,and day dreaming. I've lost my credit &amp; debit cards,and work badge. I have no memory of where any of it might be. I'm going to contact my Dr, the slight benifits are not worth it.

Originally was on Prozac for years but recently discontinued it and went on 150mg Wellbutrin but became more agitated I thought. I cut the Celexa dose to 10 mg. and that does help some. Very tired, draggy, somewhat lethargic and jittery.  I guess I need to give it more time.  Does anyone take these meds at night or is it best to take them in the morning?
Depression	beautifulblackme, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/5/2010 6:14:22 AM	I used to think that taking meds for depression was not for me because of side effects other people told me about.i finally started feeling so bad that I talked to my doctor and he prescribed the 20mg pill.  It has truly worked wonders for me.  I find myself being in a general better mood all the time.  I smile a whole lot more and even feel like dancing with joy sometimes.  I have not noticed any negative side effect with this med so I will probably be taking it for years to come.  It works well for me and I would recommend it to anyone!

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	6/4/2010 1:31:09 PM	I started Celexa because I was having problems sleeping due to night anxiety. This has done wonders! I didn't think I was depressed, but this has made me feel normal again. One side of effect for me though was increased engry (I was hyper for a month straight) and some problems concertating.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	6/3/2010 9:03:01 PM	I took Celexa for about a year and a half. At first I thought it was helping. I had been depressed for so long I don't think I knew what not feeling that way felt like. When my depression is bad I kind of feel like I have blinders on and there is blackness surrounding me, so the fact that that feeling was better I thought the Celexa was working. The longer I took it though, the more I began to realize that was not enough. Plus I wanted to sleep ALL THE TIME.  I would literally sleep all day and still sleep at night. I have back problems and my doctor had prescribed Neurotin and Buspar. These meds made the sleepiness even worse and did little for my back. After yet another fight with my husband about the fact that I was never in the mood for sex I begged my doctor to change my meds. She told me to wait another month and see if the sun coming out more now would help. It didn't so I got her to put me on Welbutrin which has helped with my depression and sex drive, but the side effects are really bad, so the search continues for an anti depressant that works and won't hurt my sex drive and doesn't have terrible side effects.

When I first started taking it I felt so much better. It wa a long time ago, so the only side effect I recall now was nausea. I was feeling better and wheened myself off of it. Well I have been having a tough time lately and my counselor told me to start taking it again. I dont feel that its working for me anymore, not really sure why it worked before and now its not... I feel that it is making me really tired and sleepy, no energy, dizzy and faintyat times. I think maybe I just need to try something different. But a year ago it worked great...

Anyone switch from lexapro to celexa?  please let me know.  impulse129@yahoo.com
Panic Disorder	Blessed, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/3/2010 10:20:38 AM	I have been taking Celexa for just over 3 months now and I feel wonderful!  I also see a Psycologist for behavior modification.  The psycologist taught me how to regognize my early warning signs at the begining of a panic attack.  She also taught me a few relaxation exercises to calm down before I lose total control of my anxiety and go into a full panic attack.  Celexa has made me sleepy however, that is not a bad thing; I was unable to get a full night of rest previously.  Now when I wake up during the night, I am able to fall back asleep quickly.  My Dr is going to slowly take me off of Celexa at the end of six months.  I feel so great, I'm kinda afraid to go off the medication.  With God's help and the behavior modification I have learned, I will continue to feel great after stopping the medication.

But nobody else seems to have that problem! Iv been on Prozac, Wellbutrin, Trazodone, &amp; Zoloft, and so far Celexa has been the best thing that has happened to me!

The addition of the Celexa has made a world of difference in my mood.  I have more ambition now and even more importantly, feel more at peace.  
Panic Disorder	brihappy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/28/2010 2:39:05 PM	I love this medication. I have had OCD, depression and panic disorder for years and didn't want to take meds, that was until my divorce. I felt positive effects from this medication starting with a low dose within a couple weeks, however I have gained 30 lbs! I feel normal and can function again, but hate the rapid weight gain. The Dr. said it doesn't cause weight gain, but I have not had a problem with my weight before and it came on suddenly after starting the meds.The weight gain is my only complaint, otherwise this drug has been a miracle. I feel human, normal and smile once again...
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/28/2010 2:27:46 PM	My anxiety started as a pre-menopausal symptom, exactly like my Mom who many years ago was prescribed Valium and could never get off it until the day she passed away.  I was prescribed at least 4 different antidepressants which all made me feel worse.  Than I was prescribed Celexa, I've been taking it for many years, 40mg day.  If I have to go without it while I'm waiting for my prescription by day 3 all of my symptoms are starting to come back.  However the generic Citalopram is useless for me.  I must have the brand.  My insurance pays $2 toward the brand and I end up paying about $220 for a 3 month supply.  Obviously if I could take the generic I certainly would.  This also helps (not completely) to control my hotflushes as I can not take hormone therapy because of having high BP and a slight stroke in the past.
Other	Aman, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	19-24	5/28/2010 5:30:46 AM	Celexa was a Very Negative experience for me. I experienced severe agitation(I literally could not stop pacing for weeks), weight gain(40 pounds), muscle jerks(these remain two years after discontinuing celexa), odd electric like sensations whenever I turn my head or eyes(these remain two years after discontinuing celexa), sexual dysfunction(this remains two years after discontinuing celexa), short term memory problems(remains two years after discontinuing celexa). Withdrawing from this medication caused to drop out of school. Psychiatric medications should only be used as a last resort.They can cause serious last side effects. PLEASE talk to your doctor about phisiological causes and alternative treatments for depression and anxiety before you experiment with drugs. Get some exercise and focus on your nutrition. 
Depression	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/27/2010 12:16:13 PM	Before Celexa I couldn't even function.  Getting out of bed didn't happen for me.  After  a few weeks on it totally change my outlook on life.  I feel &quot;Normal&quot; again.
Panic Disorder	Allybug, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	5/26/2010 4:19:53 PM	This medication did not help me at all. It had sexual side effects so if you want a healthy sex life I don't recomend this medication. I have had GAD and OCD since I was age 10. So far the only drug to help my GAD is buspar I highly recomend it! and I've only been on buspar a month. So far nothing has helped my OCD.

Could only sleep about 3 hours each night.  Not really tired afterwards.  I went through a divorce, and found out my husband had been put on the med also.  We are in the process of reconciling.  I see a MAJOR change in him.  The only problem is the sexual side effect.  He cannot seem to reach orgasm.  Not really a problem for me, but I worry that it may be a lasting effect on him. 
Depression	Janice Lee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/25/2010 6:28:20 AM	Episode of diaphoreseis &amp; dizziness 2nd day I stated taking that lasted approximately 30 minutes. On 3rd day I had insomnia due to gastric pain, went to to work &amp; had to leave because I has having weakness, gastritis, nausea, hyperactive bowel sounds, epigastricc pain &amp; heartburn. I had black tarry stools for at least 10-12 hours.The only thing I could eat or drink was ginger ale &amp; crackers. I had to take Maalox at least every 3 hrs due to the burning heartburn &amp; gastric pain. On the fourth day I considered stopping celexa but the doctor was not in her office so I gave it one more chance. I ended up not going to work again due to diarrhea, gastric discomfort not as severe but I'm not eating nothing but crackers, taking maalox every 3 hrs &amp; drinkink ginger ale.

I started due to problems in my marriage, so I can't speak the effects on sex. I know that my concentration is much improved. I feel better than I have in years. More energy, means better and more enjoyable workouts. I have lost 15 pounds since I started. Much of this is inconsistent with other reviews, but it has changed my life in a relatively short period of time.

I have been on Celexa for over 10 years and the weight increase is horrible.  I tried getting off because of the weight gain but the fat was better than feeling depressed and irritable.

I have always watched my weight carefully and this is a big issue for me.  I know it is the drug but I'm not sure it would be a good idea to stop taking it.  My weight continues to creep up.  Does anyone know if I stop taking it, will the weight come off?  I'm a little scared of both situations.

Depression	rocky, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	5/16/2010 3:57:47 PM	I have been taking this for about 2 weeks and noticed immediate effects. I feel like I am thinking clearer and am more relaxed. A few side effects though - having trouble staying asleep so I am tinkering with the time of day I take it - early morning seems best, dry mouth and a slightly diminished appetite. Nothing to bad though. These seem to be getting better as I go on though. Overall, I'm taking the 20mg pill and it is definitely working.
Depression	GJ58, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	5/16/2010 9:08:12 AM	Celexa gave me my life back.

Only 10 mg's made a huge difference.

Depression	Ricardo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	5/14/2010 3:36:23 PM	This medication has been very effective in relieving my depression and anxiety symptoms. These symptoms became lighter and lighter within 10 days of use.  After 2 weeks, both my anxiety and depression symptoms were completely under control. The only notable side effect has also been the most difficult to deal with. This drug actually prevents me from reaching climax during sexual intercourse. As orgasm approaches, I can literally feel myself hitting an emotional ceiling which prevents me from ejaculating. The amount of direct stimulation required to achieve orgasm greatly exceeds the capabilities of the female vagina; therefore, intense masturbation is the only way for me to achieve orgasm. Even then, the process can take several minutes and often, up to an hour.  This problem started within 10 days of starting my Celexa regimen.  Even when I take only half of the tablet, the emotional barrier is not diminished, and still makes orgasm/ejaculation extremely difficult to achieve.

I find it works, but it can be very subtle. I find it to be a little too weak for my mood swings.I still don't feel almost content most of the time.I wish it uplifted my mood more. Another effect is that I have a hard time climaxing about 1/2 the time I have sex. I feel it takes me too long to climax. Some weeks are worse than others.

I react differently to people,my patience level is higher,I'm more tolerable to be around, my husband was the first one to notice. That let me know it was working.

I still have mood swings, but they're not nearly as severe.  And this particular drug doesn't make me feel numb, like some of the other antidepressants I've been prescribed.  I feel 'normal' again.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	sandspur, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/6/2010 9:43:24 PM	I've been on this for 10 years and find that my anxieties are MUCH less stressful. When I've forgotten to take it for a few days....EVERYONE asks if I've forgotten it!  When friends and co-workers can tell the difference....it works!

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	5/4/2010 10:03:20 PM	My problem has been more of a mood thing. Irritated easily, angered easily.  Now that I take Celexa, my moods are more in control, but I still feel blah.  I know that there is no such thing as a 'magic' pill that will miraculously make me happy 24-7, but I was looking for a little pick-me-up.
Panic Disorder	Calebsmom06, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	5/3/2010 7:34:34 AM	It is day one of taking the celexa. I am currently on Zoloft,and it just is not working anymore. My doctor wants me to start off taking the celexa with my zoloft for about a week and after a week come off of the zoloft and stay on the celexa. I have struggled all of my life with severe anxiety and panic disorder... I hope this really works for me.
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/29/2010 4:56:07 PM	This medication caused me to have horrible side effects. Panic attacks, horrible bruising, intestinal pain and diarrhea, muscle spasms and blurred vision. I have Chron's Disease and this medicine had some pretty brutal consquences.  Beware.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	rocky75, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/20/2010 5:42:28 PM	I started taking the geneic brand of celexa 3 months ago. I had anxiety and depression. I have had no side effects except decrease in sexual desire. I have currently changed from 20mg to 40mg. I have had insomnia for years. I'm hoping the increase dose will help me sleep. Maybe I'll try it at night. Overall i feel great. I excercise and have lots of energy. I definitly feel better.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	qwackers, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/19/2010 5:21:02 PM	About a year ago I noticed that I started getting anxiety and depression symptoms. I didn't like feeling like this at all. Sometimes I would yell without just cause and just start crying.It was getting out of control.  I went to my doctor and prescribed citaloptam ( 10 mg) which didn't seem to work so he increased it to 20 mg and boy........I feel alot better.  I, also, have M.S. and take several other meds but this one agrees with me and with all the different meds I get no side effects. Thank Goodness !!!!

Depression	LA1969, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	35-44	4/12/2010 12:19:48 AM	Was prescribed Citalopram for aggitaion/ depression. I started taking the medication a week ago at night, but have stopped due to side effects. I would wake up during the night with a rapid heart beat, numbness in my hands and arms, eyes dialated, chest pain, and burning in my stomach. I felt like I was going to faint, but was able to shake it off after splashing my face, head and arms with cold water. These symptoms only lasted for about 10 -15 minutes, but I felt as though I was having a heart attack and decided to stop taking the meds. They did improve my mood/ calm me down, but I would rather be aggitated than to put my life in danger.

Bipolar Depression	Paige, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/5/2010 3:38:12 PM	I am bi-polar with occasional bad manic episodes.  I was taking paxil which made my manic episodes severe enough to cause severe panic attacks. When my doctor switched me to celexa, I felt so much better, no more panic attacks.  This also &quot;kills&quot; my appetite which may or may not be a side effect.  It also gives me an extra &quot;umf&quot; during the day, it is the best antidepresant ever for me but, be warned, this is just a personal testimonial.

Depression	EmeraldFire, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/25/2010 12:15:28 PM	Because I've been on so many drugs over many years that had bad side effects, I was scared about this one.Despite my fear, I tried it. That was a year ago and I've had not problems - no side affects, no moodiness or quick changes in feelings. At that time, that was the only drug I was taking; however, a month ago, I needed to go on another drug and there has been no contraindictions between the drugs. I expect it to stay that way. I think the MOST important ingredient in my getting beterr day by day is being truly honesy (oh, how painful) with my doctor!

It has helped me to take back control of my life instead of being at the mercy of my anxiety.
Depression	Lindsey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	3/22/2010 6:10:37 PM	Lexapro does not have a generic, so my doctors switch me to celexa when I cannot afford Lexapro because it is the closed generic match. Lexapro has worked wonders for me, but Celexa does not have the same effect. If your insurance forces you to try the generic instead of Lexapro, fight it.

I have been taking Celexa or the generic ever since.  I wish I had known about it when I was younger.  It has improved the quality of my life 200%--no anxiety, no outrageous fears, and a strong faith in God and belief that everything will &quot;be ok&quot; no matter what happens.  Although I have gained some weight, that is a small price for the peace I have found in my life.
Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/19/2010 10:40:52 PM	I prefer to take Celexa over its sister medication, Lexapro. I tend to have less issue w/ sexual desire while taking celexa. It does seem to cause me to be a bit sleeping though. Overall, I good medication; it definitely helps w/ the depression &amp; anxiety.

I take 20 mg at bedtime and it does not make me sleepy then, when I wake up in the mornings it is really hard to get up and get going.  Driving to work and trying to work is difficult due to being SO sleepy.  I am considering coming off of it completely.

It took about 4 months for it to work on the depression, and it's very effective.  I was up to 60mg a day to help with the anxiety, and it didn't work for that.  I'm being switched to Effexor and have had to add Buspirone.All in all, great for depression- not so great for anxiety.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/13/2010 8:42:45 PM	I have been on citalopram for 2 mo now for anxiety/depressing from work stress and family issues. Took 10mg 2 weeks, then increased to 20 mg. Within a couple days irritability, crying, emotional eating, and mood swings went away. I no longer over-react to things and my constant worrying subsided. It helped my palpatations, but not enough, so now have been put on buspar for that. Had never taken any meds for anxiety/depression before. Only side effects I had was a warming sensation/hotflash for about 1 hr after taking. This only lasted 4 days. I feel citalopram has given me life back.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Jellybean, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	3/13/2010 4:45:39 PM	I have been on 10mg for about a week now, I feel a slight change in my mood. I take it at night before bed, I am also on Ativan for insomnia and Ibuprofen for joint pain. I can fall asleep fine with this medication but after a few hours I wake up and feel dizzy, it takes me about 2 hours to fall back asleep. Celexa has improved my OCD greatly even at such a low dose, but my anxiety and depression will need a higher dosage to treat. I have high hopes for this drug to work, I have taken wellbutrin and zoloft in the past with horrible side effects.

I'm feeling much better and those around me have noticed too.  I've been taking 20 mgs a day for almost 4 months now.  At first it made me very drowsy and I lost my appetite for about a week.  The side effects subsided after about 2 weeks and everything has been great since then.  I still have emotions, they just aren't so strong and all over the place.  It definitely doesn't make me feel &quot;doped&quot; up, just &quot;normal&quot;.  I feel like I have my life back!!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	VT mama, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	3/9/2010 12:51:16 PM	After a year and a half I finally went off the citalopram.  I really feel it made me want to drink alcohol and avoid my children.  It helped calm me and not snap at my kids but at the same time I could only deal with them in small spurts.  I would retreat outside to have a drink(alcohol) and a smoke and then come in feeling more able to deal.  I went from a drink during the weekend to everyday.  I'am so glad to be off it although I did it by going cold-turkey and it's made me feel a little lightheaded and I was a bit weepy at first.  I used Prozac 20 years ago for 2 years and that worked fine.  This citalopram makes me feel like I lost about a year of my life.  I did'nt feel present in my life as a wife and mother of 3.  It's been 10 days without it and my urge to drink and smoke cigarettes are gone.  Does anyone have any similiar experience?  I'm just really puzzled and without health insurance a sit down with a doctor is not a possibility.  Hope this helps.
Depression	snowkitty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/9/2010 9:52:38 AM	I have been on this med for 4 mths now &amp; am very happy w/the overall effect it has had on my mood. In the 1st 2 wks i experienced nausea (i take it at night before bedtime) and in the morning dizziness upon arising. Both were gone after about two weeks. I also experienced loss of appetite which was gone after a month. Never had any feeling of being in a &quot;fog&quot; but it has made me &quot;not care&quot;, so to speak, about things that were bothering me before. I no longer have a crying &quot;breakdown&quot; once a month &amp; my mood swings are gone. My family reports that i seem much happier and less stressed. They like the fact that i no longer yell &amp; am not sad or angry alot. I just like the fact that for the 1st time in years i feel like &quot;me&quot; again. I'd recommend the drug &amp; i'd recommend taking it at night if you are worried about side effects. I didn't experience any sleep issues but am on Ambien b/c of difficulty falling asleep &amp; maintaining it anyway.

I was prescribed various medications all without any luck. My Doctor started me on the 20mg Celexa and it did o.k. but was still not taking care of the problem completely, Now I am on the 40mg and everything is great. Almost a week after I started taking it people started noticing that I was changing little by little, about 4 weeks after I was on it I knew there was a major difference in my life. I felt &quot;normal&quot; Nothing really bothered me, and when it did, I was able to handle it calmly and cooly without any major incidents. This drug has been a life changer for me. I am truely glad that My doctor prescribed it.
Depression	Eva75, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/8/2010 7:13:33 AM	I started on 20mgs and felt better but not as good as i waned to feel, so my DR had me begin on 40mgs and i feel great! I take it before bed and i am able to sleep,i can function in life without freaking out and snapping on people for no reason. My sex drive decreased for about six weeks but it has returned to normal, and i had sweating episodes for about a month and that has stopped all together. I did not experience any weight gain,in fact i am losing weight because i actually care enough about myself now to better my life. I had very few side effects and none that were bad. I knew that i had a problem with depression before i was never diagnosed and didn't want to rely on a drug to make me feel better but i had no other choice and i am glad i did. This drug has been an awesome addition to my life and well being! My sister in law is taking celexa as well at the same dosage as i am and had the same side effects and hers has stopped as well and is back to her normal self too. Stick with it the side effects can be annoying but once you get through them you feel alive again! Even if the effects were still present in me i would continue to take this medication. It really works!

Also could not drive on it. These medications are not worth this.
Depression	Kathleen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/2/2010 7:05:50 PM	I started taking Celexa when first diagnosed with breast cancer.  It helped me calm down, stop crying so much and deal with my treatments better.  Five years later, I'm still on it.  I like the even moods, ability to handle anything that comes along without flipping out, and lack of tears.  I can talk about my experiences with cancer without crying all the time.
Depression	tenzero, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	3/2/2010 12:08:24 PM	Celexa has made a vast improvement over previous antidepressants including most recently Wellbutrin.  I had some initial sleepiness which after 3 months has resolved, after 6-9 weeks I began to feel dramatically improved. I also have chronic joint pain which required Lortab 7.5 up to 4 times a day.  I now require maybe one Lortab per week and feel energetic, calm, no arguements with my spouse, and good sexual function. I would heartily recommend this drug as alternative to other less effective treatments.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	elizabeth Erie pa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	2/25/2010 9:07:45 AM	I have only been on citolopram since 2/18/10 was the 1st day i started.today is the 2/25/10 thought it was going to be great. I was sleepy so i took a nap and woke up with smiles and giggles. it was weird. I was happy! Then after a few days of taking it i noticed the happiness wares off after a few hours. i wish the happiness could stay like that all day. I am taking this med for depression the Dr. says it may help even though i said i just have anxiety problems . so i am trying this out first. but still having anxiety problems. not as much. it does help some. I may have to take this a little while longer to see the full effect's. I have no side effects besides sleepiness.during the day, if i take it at night then i don't experience the happy hours of the med. I need to feel happy all day. good luck to everyone out there with the same issues i face not every one will have the same experience this may be the one for you.

After 3 weeks I was having severe anxiety (worse than when I was on it). My Dr. upped me to 40 mg a day &amp; now I am gaining weight, having several other side effects and afraid to go off of it.  This is a viscous cycle!!!!!  I hate it and wish I would have never started.

Depression	Joy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/23/2010 12:50:38 PM	I had a depression bought in my twenties and Celexa put me on the road to well being. Later in life, in my mid thirties, I again had a bought of depression and was put back on Celexa. Although it has accomplishment the same outcome, an overall better sense of well being, I will say that I believe it takes 2-3 months before you feel the full affect.  I think this time around, I will stay on it as long as I can because it makes a significant impact in the way I prioritize things and the way I assess the impact of things and keeping it in perspective.
Depression	Kel, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	2/22/2010 7:24:21 PM	I was put on this medication as a precaution after losing my left hand as the result of a car accident. I had taken Zoloft a few years before for slight depression and discovered that the side effects were not worth taking it. I feel that Celexa has helped me deal with things in my life better and am generally satisfied with it. My friend at college also takes it and we both think that it makes you yawn a lot, even if you are not tired. I would also recommend taking it in the morning instead of at night, but this is just an opinion.

Because of this I consulted with physician and decided to try something else. I was weened off and stopped the drug completely about 2 weeks ago but am still having side effect from coming off. A weird sensation when I move my eyes to the side. A feeling of continued movement after my gaze shifts. Driving me crazy going to call doctor again.

I took the generic form.  what caused me to switch, was that I seemed to be losing hair but I think I'll get back on it because the generic form of zoloft did not work.

He also has a broken nose that he has to have repaired, I also had thousands of dollars in medical bills, due to all the ambulances, and hospital stays! The only one good thing I could possibly say about this whole situation is I found my son a very caring devoted Dr. that actually listens to my sons problems, and doesn't tell me there is nothing they can do except give him anti-psychotic medication that he doesn't need, nor does he have any symptoms that would call for these medications...

I have been on this for almost a month, still have anxiety issues. It kills my stomach and does not seem to last long. I started taking it in the evening, could not sleep because of the anxiety, so i switched to the am. seems to work better for me in the morning. I don't get anymore tired then normal with it. My sex drive seems to have come back, and for at least most of the day i can somewhat function.  I am going to finish the month and see if there is a change, if not it's on to something else.

I was suffering from pretty severe depression. My depression has eased a bit and I am able to think more clearly. I am tired through the day so I may start taking it at night. I have noticed that my sex drive has come back. It became non-existent from the depression so thats nice. A few years ago I was taking Prozac and that didn't help at all. Plus it killed my drive and may have even made my depression worse. I like what I see so far with Celexa.

I can sleep 9 hours at night and nap 3 hours easy. Very unusual for me. My eyes feel like when you just stepped out of the eye doctor, sensitive. I feel like my scalp is in constant tightness like I have been concentrating all day and my head needs to relax,  I rub my scalp to release the tension. I have recently started going to the gym 5 days a week. Even when i work out I am still sleepy and feel this is hindering my weight loss. I am not sure if it is the drug though I did not experience any of these symptoms before the drug.

I still suffer from anxiety, overeating, and have developed a worsening gambling addiction. The only good part about taking the medication is that I haven't had any complete mental breakdowns that have caused me to loose time at work. I don't really cry, and would describe my life &quot;getting by&quot; which is a far cry from being &quot;happy&quot; in the traditional sense. Would love to hear from others...

I have suffered for years with PTDSD. I take with Valium, and Risperdal (SP?) sp its my own perfect cocktail my doc has me on. But after years, and many different drugs later, I finally found the right antidepressant.I highly recommend it if you have tried zoloft, welbutrin, prestiq, savella, effexer, lexapro, prosac, seriquil and paxil to no avail (ones I've tried that did not work).

Never do that!! Getting back on it feels awful, but taking it continuously really helped improve my mood &amp; overall outlook on life. I fortunately did not gain weight since I was happier &amp; more active. I Had a better self motivation to get out of the bed every morning &amp; much easier time getting along with everyone, especially my co-workers since I work in a stressful environment, the ER. I had tried other antidepressants that just did not agree with me or made me feel as if I was walking around in a fog. But once I started taking celexa, I had no real side effects &amp; I actually started to be able to live my life without the high stress levels, &amp; my OCD accompanied with anxiety has been at an all-time low. I can say I am very satisfied :)
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	1/13/2010 10:07:27 PM	I started celexa about 6-7 months ago.  the first few weeks were hard because the drowsiness i experianced was unreal. i would sleep all day after getting out of work at 2pm, and wake up to eat then go back to bed until the next morning. After a few weeks it got better and now i dont experiance the side effects anymore.  it has really helped my mood swings, and has allowed me to let the 'little' things go. Tho, at first that was hard for me because i wouldnt get upset over the things i used to get upset about and that would frusterate me. But eventually i learned that i was alright.

I have only been on Celexa for three weeks and I can already feel the difference. Although, the first day I started it I took the 20mg dose as instructed by my doctor and it gave me a SEVERE panic attack.  The dose was then cut in half and slowly tapered up.  Have not had a problem since.

It certainly made my relationship with my wife, two young children, and my mother less than enjoyable, to put it mildly. I enjoy music again, and laugh a lot more. Gaining and maintaining a healthy looking weight has always been tough for me. I look better a little heavier and Celexa has increased my appetite and allowed me to gain 15 much needed pounds (I'm 170# now). I don't get NEARLY as upset at life's challenges. I started with 20 mg for about 3 months, but increased to 40mg and feel a lot better. I came off the meds for about 6 months and the old angry me came back. Oh well...whatever it takes for improve the LIFE experience. The only significant side effect I have is the ability to achieve orgasm. Erection is no prob but the O seems next to impossible. I tried wellbutrin for a few weeks to help with the O's but seemed to experience more aggression, so I quit that. Aside from that...this stuff is heaven sent.

IT IS A GOOD MEDICATION BUT MAY NOT BE RIGHT FOR YOU. IF YOU WERE SATISFIED AND IT STOPPED WORKING,THEN YOU PROBABLY NEED A DOSE ADJUSTMENT. EVERYONE RESPONDS TO DIFFERENTLY TO DIFFERENT DOSES. SSRIs  ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AND ALL OF THEM DIFFER SLIGHTLY YET JUST ENOUGH TO CAUSE DIFFERENT SIDE EFFECTS IN DIFFERENT PEOPLE. PLEASE DO NOT LOSE HOPE. IT IS POSSIBLE TO FEEL GOOD AGAIN!!! AGAIN,I CAN NOT STRESS ENOUGH DO NOT START OR STOP THIS WITHOUT TAKING TO YOUR DOCTOR. REMEMBER TO TELL HIM EVERYTHING YOU TAKE. EVEN HERBAL REMEDIES CAN INTERACT UNPLEASANTLY AND DANGEROUSLY!!! ALSO READ UP ON EVERYTHING THAT YOU TAKE AND KEEP A LOG OF DAILY PROGRESS AND PITFALLS. TAKE IT TO YOUR APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR DOCTOR. YOU SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. DO NOT LET YOUR DOCTOR RUSH YOU OUT OF THE OFFICE. DO NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH HIS ANSWERS AND THE WAY YOU ARE FEELING!!!!! HANG IN THERE

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	1/7/2010 4:18:21 PM	I started taking this drug for depression, anxiety and panic attacks. I was prescribed it in combination with Klonopin. My doctor started me off at 10mg and then within a month I was upped to 30mg. I first started taking it in the morning and noticed that it caused blurry vision, constant yawning and overall exhaustion...I then began taking it at night which turned out to be ok. After 2 months I lost 20lbs and actually felt better...Major side effect would be loss of libido...my sex drive that was already low because of depression and anxiety became non existent because of celexa. I could not &quot;get in the mood&quot;, reach an orgasm or even think of sex. It definitely helps with depression and anxiety but you have to sacrifice your sex drive.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	mavsgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	1/7/2010 1:37:09 PM	Was prescribed after Lexapro left me sleepy.  Took for 6 months, coincidentally started at about the same time I started having some issues going on in my life that would cause anyone anxiety.  Stayed anxious through the entire 6 months on the medication.  After I worked out the problems in my personal life, the anxiety continued, so was switched to a different medication that resolved the anxiety in weeks.  Celexa did work relatively well for my depression though.  I only had a couple of instances on it where the depression became debilitating.

Panic Disorder	Rdee8ch, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/5/2010 4:17:20 PM	I have been cursed with panic attacks ever since I started menopause (about 4 yrs ago). The panic attacks were always a pre-cursor to hot flashes. I was having the panic attacks/hot flashes every 30 minutes to an hour. The panic attacks were severe enough to make me feel like I was going to die on the spot even though my mind knew different. I started at 20 mg., but that was only enough to take the edge off. I went from, &quot;I'm doomed!&quot; to &quot;Oh,no!&quot; My physician increased the dosage to 40 mg and my panic attacks are completely gone! The only side effect has been periodic hypnopomic hallucinations, which do not bother me. Celexa has been a god-send!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	1/4/2010 4:46:19 PM	I was on 10mg back in 2007 after being in the hospital battling depression.  I weened myself off (BIG mistake) and was okay for a couple years but when life wasn't so &quot;prefect&quot; anymore I realized I needed to get back on something.  My doctor put me back on 20 mg in Oct 2009, I was so drowsy after the first month he upped my dose to 40mg.  I'm still exhausted &amp; have absolutely NO sex drive.  I just called inquiring about Wellbutrin (b/c I'm also trying to quit smoking) and he prescribed 10mg of wellbutrin with 20mg of celexa.  Is anyone on both of these?  Will this make my sex drive come back?  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Grace, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	1/3/2010 8:24:20 PM	It definitely decreased my anxiety, which often leads to depression for me, but I stopped caring re my friends &amp; clients (I'm a social worker!) &amp; it made my ADD 10 times worse, so bad that I couldn't stay organized &amp; on top of things at work. I've tried Paxil- made me happy, sleepy, &amp; I gained 40 lbs in 4 months, Wellbutrin made me very grouchy, Vyvanse didn't let me sleep, &amp; so now I just take Omega 3's, stay away from my allergens, &amp; have lots of support from friends &amp; God, &amp; ask my friends to keep tabs on me, if I feel myself slipping into depression. I did learn, on the Celexa, that I don't have to worry as much as I do re situations.

It decreased the hotflashs and mood swings that accompanies premenopause. It does cut appetite. I still get hotflashes and mood swings but it is not as pronounced and only occurs about 3-4 times a day and is very mild (yet annoyning). I do not like sweating. I feel 90% better than I did without the drug. Would like to know more about long term effects of this drug.

I will never take another ssri. I lost about 5 lbs in those few days. I think it would have killed me.

I have severe bipolar dx.  It controlled the manics like no other drug could.  I slept so well when taking it at nite. For the first time in 15 years I felt &quot;normal&quot;.  The side effects were minimal to non exsistant.  I had a sex drive, which had been nill on other drugs!  I never felt like I was taking a drug.  It requires no blood tests so I feel safer taking it.  Consider this drug if you have had trouble with others.  This drug has given me my life back.

I did have a little dizzyness and nausea, but it was manageable, I looked at it as a good thing to help with the wieght gain.  Unfortunately I broke out in hives and was take off the meds.  Now I have to wait for the hives to go away before starting Zoloft, oh well must keep trying.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	12/21/2009 4:35:06 AM	Diagnosed with anxiety/depression.Decided the condition was better than taking Celexa. Developed 'lock jaw' &amp; didn't care about anything.I went to a doctor about my insomnia &amp; ended up at the campus psych clinic. The doc there put me on Celexa for a mood disorder. I still had insomnia, but Celexa seemed to help in other ways at first. Then came the apathy. I didn't care about anything. I stopped cleaning the house. I would forget to eat. I could have an orgasm, but didn't want to be bothered with sex. I had no concept of dates or deadlines. I almost failed out of grad school because I just didn't give a damn. Physically the worst thing were the jaw problems. Jaw clenching is a known side effect. Mine was so bad I ended up with TMJ. I was in constant pain and in the end I couldn't open my mouth over an inch wide. The pain lessened when I stopped Celexa. I still can't fully open my mouth, but it is slowly getting better. My 'whatever attitude' has also slowly improved. I still go to the same doctor &amp; we are exploring other options. (Now if I could only get some sleep.)   
Depression	Elaine, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/20/2009 3:33:27 PM	After trying generic versions of Zoloft and Wellbutrin, both of which gave me terrible side effects and no improvment in my depression, my sister (a nurse) suggested that I try Celexa. I am on a low dose (10 mg) and taking the &quot;real deal,&quot; not generic, and am happy to report that my mood has stabilized and I have no side effects to speak of. The first week, I felt an almost uncontrollable desire to yawn, but this disappeared. I now feel &quot;normal,&quot; and don't experience the mood swings I had before. The only caution I would give is that this medication MUST be taken daily at the same time. For several weeks, I missed taking it on a regular schedule and it was like I had to &quot;reset&quot; the drug in order for it to be effective. I now take my pill at 6:00 p.m. every day, and I feel fine.

Took Lexapro about a year earlier, but Celexa a lot cheaper and insurance has high deductible.Side effects for the first month or so, pretty bad, very drowsy and craved caffeine.  Also felt suicidal about a week after starting; had not felt that before.  I stuck it out for about two months but ultimately, it did not work for me (20mg) and did not want to increase dosage due to side effects.Switched to Lexapro.  Felt better within a week and a half.  Much less anxiety, less depression, did not crave the caffeine to get my head out of the &quot;fog&quot;.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	12/18/2009 1:40:59 AM	I started taking celexa after a separation from my husband. After we seperated I was mildly depressed and I couldn't do much because I felt like I was in a fog. I couldn't concentrate on anything. Thinking was a major chore. It was horrible. I was put on celexa and felt better within a week or two because I was able to think clear. However I still felt depressed and unmotivated, but at least now I could think better. Another reason I didn't care for it is because it made me really anxious. I suffered from some anxiety before and this seemed to not help with anxiety. I was nervous alot of the time, my jaw was clenching, and the main thing I couldn't tolerate this drug was because of the major neck pain. It was hard for me to fall asleep because of my neck pain which started within a day of taking celexa. I say if you have anxiety, this might not work for you, but everyone is different. I read alot of the reviews and it seems it worked for alot of people, but not for me. I am trying Lexapro next.

My head is much more clear and feels so much better.  I also feel much less anxious and frazzled.  The dysthymia (low grade depression) has not lifted much.  I'm not sure if I'm willing to increase the dose due to possible side effects.  Maybe, it will continue to improve as I take it on a regular basis.

Finally I agreed to try Celexa and took it for 3-4 months.  It helped with the depression and I was able to start eating properly and exercising.  Unfortunately, I experienced something like little electrical flashes in my head, so I stopped taking it.  Looking back, I should have discussed this with the doctor, first.  At any rate, it got me through a very rough time and helped me get back in control of my life.

Other	Tabatha, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/7/2009 11:58:15 AM	I want you to know I am 31. I have three wonderful children and an amazing husband. I NEVER thought people should take medication that &quot;took away&quot; from how they felt. After all, our emotions are what make us human, they are what determines who we are through how we act. I didn't feel comfortable addmitting I needed help, however, someone recomended I see a doctor for something just to &quot;take the edge off.&quot; I do have a &quot;stress-related&quot; job, and was always either snappy or over-reacting to situations. This medicine has been a God-send. I am still me, I feel every emotion, and at the same time, I think more clearly therefore I process it better and more accurately. I have never tried any medication like this before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I know it works for me. I am SO thankful to my doctor who has helped improve my intire life with this medication. I started taking it for 2 weeks just a half of pill a day, then we increased the dosage to a full pill after the two weeks. I have been on it for a little over a month and not only did I notice a huge change, but so has everyone else-with all the feedback being positive. I can only tell the women thinking about this, or maybe you haven't thought about it but someone has mentioned it to you, you won't believe how entirely you can still feel like yourself, while at the same time your life has changed so dramatically! For the woman who has SO much going on, work, husband, children, home, errands, this just places things into focus, and allows you to prioritize without anxiety. Good luck and God Bless.

I started out with 20mg and then upped to 40 mg after a month. My mood has improved quiet well.  I do not get as stressed about things and do not feel depressed much at all.  The main side affect that I have noticed is nausea and feeling tired at times.  Other than that, it works really well.

I wasn't as angry as much and i didn't yell at my children too much. I was able to sleep( I was up all night worrying about everything)and I lost my appetite a little  which was OK because I was overeating). It has stopped working and i feel just as bad as before. I'm going to have to get it changed.
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	35-44	12/4/2009 8:33:05 AM	I was put on this medication to treat depression. I started out with 10mg/day for a week and then increased to 20mg/day. I was on this medication for about 2 months. I experienced an in ability to achieve orgasm during sex. I simply could not have one. But I had an increased sex drive, so it was a two edged sword. Also I don't know if it really helped my depression. I wasn't wanting to lay around all day anymore. but I was Angry ALL THE TIME!!! If someone or something made me angry that is all I could think about. I have since stopped taking the medication and my depression has returned but I am not as angry. I hope this information helps other people taking or considering this medication.

This medication works really well. I am on 40mg/d. I do experience some extreme sexual side effects from this drug (unable to ejaculate during sex). However, after doing some research I found a way around it and wanted to share. I take my 40mg dosage RIGHT before bed (I am sexually active with my girlfriend almost every night, so I take the medication after sex). While it is still &quot;difficult&quot; to achieve an orgasm, it is definitely not impossible. So, I just take the pill as late as possible, and then next night (about 18 hours after last dose) I have no problems. I hope this helps some of you.

This medication works really well. I am on 40mg/d. I do experience some extreme sexual side effects from this drug (unable to ejaculate during sex). However, after doing some research I found a way around it and wanted to share. I take my 40mg dosage RIGHT before bed (I am sexually active with my girlfriend almost every night, so I take the medication after sex). While it is still &quot;difficult&quot; to achieve an orgasm, it is definitely not impossible. So, I just take the pill as late as possible, and then next night (about 18 hours after last dose) I have no problems. I hope this helps some of you.

Panic Disorder	feelnbettr, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	12/2/2009 3:42:33 PM	Worked the first night. I was wound up very tight and feeling like I was going to explode. Simple pleasures were really non-existent. Immediately relaxed me and I began to feel more in control, and I could think more clear and rational. Side effects were insomnia, brief stomach cramps, nervousness ( better than panic attacks anyday), and tiredness, which is a bit frustrating being unable to sleep. Felt a little groggy the next morning, but again, better than wandering the halls all night with my mind racing. Got the sleep I needed though. Thankful my doctor prescribed.

Starting the fourth week I begin to become depress all over again but this time I was having suicidal thoughts.  The doctor wanted me to stay on the medication for another month at that dosage.  Before my next visit I was thinking about suicide and contacted my therapist to see if I could see a doctor.  She told me my doctor was out of the country and would not be back for 1 week. I saw my doctor on November 30, 2009 and he increased my dosage to 40mg at night. I am scared that the 40mg dose will do good for about 3 weeks then the depression will come back. Upon research I noticed there is 60mg dosages but right now I feel as I am going backwards instead of forwards. For your information I also take Geodon 80mg twice a day, Gabapentin 300mg twice a day and Ativan 1mg twice a day.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	czarmann, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	11/30/2009 8:47:45 PM	I have been taking Citalopram for about six weeks for anxiety. I am very happy with the results. I am not as irritable and snappy with my wife, kids, employees, etc. I also seem to be able to let things go that previously would have worried or irritated me. Both my anger level and anxiety is better. No side effects at all. Like most guys, I was concerned about the sexual side effects, but I've had no changes in drive, performance or ability to orgasm. The last one is what I'd heard was the biggest problem, but not for me. My wife and I are very active and that hasn't changed. In fact my improved temperament has probably helped our intimacy overall. Very happy with this med.  It is the first I have ever tried.

I take 10mg once a day.  Maybe you could start out slowly and increase?  The side effects (headache, nausea) take a week or so to go away, and it may take 3-4 weeks before you see any positive changes.  I think it's worth a try.  Good luck!

Bipolar Depression	finallyfree05, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	5	4		19-24	11/19/2009 10:46:24 AM	I have been depressed for years but always thought I could overcome it by sheer will.  However after the birth of my last child I could not take the unbearable sadness and then the extreme highs.  I had NO sex drive at all!!  I finally saw a Dr. who prescribed Celexa (im taking generics).  I started to feel better after about a month but I was experiencing bipolar mania, which means I felt extremely high, on top of the world.  My dr. then put me on Lamitical 25mg then 50mg.  I have to say &quot;I feel great&quot;.  My sex drive is back with a vengence!!!  I must be trying to make up for lost time!!  Anyway my Celexa is 20mg &amp; Lamactical 50mg (mood stabilizer).  Im still not on the required dosage, but I cant wait.  I feel so good its unbeleiveable.  Only because I was miserable for soo long.  Exercise &amp; talk therapy doesnt hurt either.  I think overall my husband &amp; 3 children are happier too with a happier me.
Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	11/16/2009 7:21:07 PM	I have been taking the generic version of celexa for about 4 months now. Both the generic and the regular have the same side effects I guess. The first day i took it i felt a little odd. But over time, about a week I started noticing I could focus better and not repeat thoughts over and over again. The only problem that I have had with it, are my legs bother me alot when I'm laying down and sitting for even a few minutes. Also known as Restless Legs Symptoms. This is a side effect, and sadly it did effect me like that. Overall the drug worked pretty good on me, but I am changing to Zoloft, to control more of my anxiety.

I felt fine during my cycle, but afterwards my normal period symptoms intisified. So i decided to stop taking it. I experienced awful withdrawal symptoms for about a week and a half. Dramamine and fruit helped ease my nausea. Also if you are experiencing bad withdrawal symptoms be careful what pain killers you use for headaches. Tylenol made me get sick.  Also naps helped alot, so if you have the opportunity to rest, do it. And know that it will go away :)

The side effects for me are dry mouth, moderate nausea, and tiredness. I have increased my sex drive extremely well. Which is always a plus, and even though I am not fully recovered it beats going without the medication. I keep you updated in a few months.

I guess you could say I was an extreme perfectionist. I have been on Celexa for 2 years now and I am able to function well and make well thought out decisions at work. Plus, I don't have my mood swings anymore. Only draw back if I do skip a daily does I can immediately feel my anxiety starting to build back up and can lose my patience with others.

I was nauseous for a couple of days when I first started, but that has passed.  I can already tell a huge difference in the way I feel.  My head is clearer than it's been in years....I don't have the &quot;brain sludge&quot; now.  It's amazing.  I contributed all my symptons to getting old.....thinking I would never feel better again.  I'm so glad my Dr prescribed this for me

Before taking celexa I was very depressed and angry. I started out at 10mg and am now at 40mg. I have been taking medication for 3 months now. I feel like a new person. I couldn't listen to music, watch t.v or cope with my children and grandchildren leaving after wonderful visit. I had outbursts of anger and vengence consumed me. I am 90% back to normal. I have had no sexual side effects in fact I am better in that area. I feel normal now. I have told several friends about my miracle drug and I thank God and my doctor for this. Hold strong and all will be ok.

Before Celexa, I had severe depression and extreme anxiety that would merge into full blown panic attacks. Celexa has been a life saver for me. The effectiveness has, of course, worn off some because I have taking it for so long but I refuse to taper off of it. I do not want to experience the severe depression and anxiety that I once experienced a long time ago. I do feel depressed at the moment and have anxiety as well (It has lost it's effectiveness), so my doctor has also prescribed me Xanax as needed and another anti-depressant called Pristiq. I have only tried Prestiq for 5 days but already do not like the extremely negative side effects I am experiencing so I plan to stop taking this. The Xanax has helped tremendously with my anxiety. I wished I could just keep increasing the MG of Celexa, but my doctor told me I am maxed out. I may research this and see how many MG is the max for this medication. Oh yeah, this medication has not caused any major side effects for me, even in the beginning. My sex drive is still as great as ever.

It has made a drastic improvement in my life and will most likely stay on it until menapause or later. I take 40mg a day. No bad side affects only good ones. I no longer have insomnia, can drive anywhere, am more social and confident. This is the only medicine that has worked for me.

My mind and body has a very low tolerance for any medicine and this one has worked wonderful for me. I take it at night and may be a little tired in the morning, but really worth the upbeat mood and more control of attacks, if any would ever accur. The sex drive improves in time. Just don't expect it very soon.

I was prescribed this medication by my Dr. because I was going through a tough time in my marriage . That was the first Panic attack that I had ever had. Ever since then I have reoccuring panic attacks that occur out of the blue. I never had panic attacks, depression, or any other issues before this. That was almost 9 years ago and I still get panic attacks once a year. I truly believe it is due to the medication.

Before I started taking it, I wouldn't get out of bed unless I absolutely had to. As a matter of fact, I almost rescheduled the appointment I had to get on this because I was &quot;too tired to go&quot; I take it before bed, which helps me sleep. Sometimes Im a little nautious in the morning, but that goes away with food. My sex drive is GONE ( if someone sees it please return it) Ha ha. Overall I will continue to take it. My mood has greatly improved and im back to &quot;normal&quot; again. I feel fantastic.

I do also know that depression runs in my family.  I have the type of nature that tries to deal with everything and was in denial that I needed any help of a medication.  People tell me that I have a calm demeanor and could not tell that I had been suffering inside.  I persistently dealt with it and now that I am on Celexa I definitely feel the difference.  I have been on it for about 3 years and started when I was experiencing extreme work related stress. On top of that I was experiencing menopause.  Then I lost my mother and have remained on it.  I was first put on Lexapro but it had an emotionally numbing effect on me. I have none of that with Celexa.  I am glad to find something without harsh side effects to my system.  I take it at night before I go to bed.  20 mg. Don't deny yourself the help you may need like I did for so many years.  Take care of yourself.  Talk to your doctor.  I hope this information helps someone.

I have had some nights with insomnia, but, I have experienced moderate relief and am regaining my previous level of functioning and mood. I will probably request a different medication however due to the anorgasmia.

No sexual side effects so far, but I've always had the libido of an 18 year old.

Depression	36mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	35-44	10/26/2009 12:17:39 PM	Just re-started Celexa two weeks ago, first time I started on it I was taking 10mg a day and by the third day woke up at night in the middle of a full-blown panic attack out of nowhere.  Scared me so badly that I quit taking the prescription for two months.  Just re-started two weeks ago, was cutting the 20mg dose into half and then half again!, and this made my side-effects less acute.  It will take me longer to get to where I am hoping to be with my depression, but the panic attacks aren't worth it. Just increased to 10mg two days ago and last night had an awful time trying to fall asleep - racing thoughts, anxiety...the scariest part was the feeling of heat through my chest, arms and face (like an acute hot flash or sunburn?).  It actually woke me up several times, this hot-flash symptom, and I would be drenched in sweat....wondering if anyone else had this side-effect too? I am hopeing that it goes away soon!  Had such good luck with my last anti-depressant but it's $90 more a month than Celexa.  Am looking foward to &quot;sunnier&quot;-feeling days!

Make sure that you have an understanding partner before you begin treatment. I have also run into another complication  anxiety. This is something new to me since I almost never experienced it, but as of right now its a daily occurrence. 
Panic Disorder	AnxietyHypochondriac, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	10/25/2009 1:34:45 AM	The drug has worked about 90% for me.  I'm a male in my 20s, a hypochondriac with severe anxiety disorder. Before taking this drug I would drive myself to the ER consistently thinking I was having a heart attack. Also a major fear of vomiting - the slightest stomach ache or indigestion would send me over the edge, and I would be petrified, literally shaking and trembling all over. I began seeing a psychiatrist and he put me on Celexa. I have seen a major, major difference .. although, like I said, I'd give it a 90% overall.. I still get nervous every once in a while about vomiting, and I'll have to leave work or drive myself to my 'comfort zone' (aka - home).  But this happens maybe once every three months - as oppose to every day!!  I can live normally again thanks to this drug. I strongly suggest taking it consistently at the SAME TIME every day.  This will increase its effectiveness. I felt a little dizzy when I first starting taking it but that went away in about a week. Lost my sex drive for a few weeks but then it came back in full force (thankfully!)  Give it a chance, don't let the side effects scare you - they are very mild. Doesn't bother my stomach at all.  If I skip a day or two, and resume, I'll feel the effects about 2 or 3 days later, strangely enough - i'll get a dizzy spell and a mild panic attack, or get depressed (feel like crying and be fearful of losing my parents - very weird).  I might be a kook with all of my anxieties, etc, but celexa allows me to hide them in front of others.  Great drug overall.
Panic Disorder	J35, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	2	Male	35-44	10/23/2009 9:29:47 PM	been on it now (20 mg) around 1-2 months. Basically has done nothing. I feel as antsy as ever, high levels of anxiety, even more intense fear of socializing, ocd, boredom etc..Basically exactly the way I felt right before I went on it lol. So, while Im not in worse shape, def. not feeling better. The most prominant side effect has been on my sleeping patterns. Been waking up waay earlier than normal/before totally wired. Only reason I get back to sleep is from generic Ambien (take 1/2 with the Celexa b4 bed, then the other 1/2 when I wake up in the very early a.m). If not for that extra 1/2 pill, 4get it lol! Strangely, my sex drive has NOT really been effected. Bottom line, very ineffective for me. I feel flat at best. Gonna decrease off it asap.

While I was asleep I had nightmares and/or crazy dreams. When I woke up I wanted to go back to bed. I wasn't able toget myself motivated to do even the basic things, including using the bathroom.I also had a lot of violent outbursts with this medication I'm not satisfied with the medication at all. If I were you I would talk to my doctor and get on a different medication.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	10/9/2009 11:15:43 AM	Started this med about 2 1/2 months ago.The first 4 weeks were TERRIBLE; stomach pains made me unable to do much of any thing.Dr.said it would go away by week 5 or 6.So I stuck it out.I am SOOOO glad I did.My depression is gone,I can think about things that used to throw  me in a panic,and now I'm fine.I have been on Zoloft,wellbutrin,prosac. Finally found something that helps.  Work with your Dr.,there is something that will help you,you just have to be patient-unfortunately with depression that's very discouraging.

I am not as anxious and paranoid as I was.  The one thing I have noticed as I increase my intake (per dr.s instructions)I've noticed I'm numb to certain feelings.  I dont' cry as much over sentimental things, etc.  Not sure if I like that feeling.

Depression	caz, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	35-44	10/5/2009 6:18:44 AM	Took cipramil (celexa brand name in the UK) for 2 years. A littel advertised side effect is &quot;disinhibition&quot;. This caused me to make inappropriate comments and swear more etc...very weird! Unfortunately I lost my job over it before I discovered the cause and stopped taking the drug. When I stopped I found I was not depressed as badly as when I was on it and the anxiety had gone as well... this drug can be useful for short term use prior to counselling to deal with rather than bury the issues. I was also suffering from what is quaintly called &quot;suicidal ideation&quot; as I was convinced my family would be better off without me...really bad shit I think you'll agree! The reason for the disinhibition is that serotonin (which this drug increases in the brain to make you happier allegedly) is involved in your internal behaviour regulation. Really look out for this and the suicidal thoughts if you are taking this stuff esp long term.. at least it didn'tmake me sweat as much as Prozac did! good luck out there everyone.

I am taking it for anxiety not depression. Overall I am very satisfied with it. My sex drive is pretty low and  I notice when I don't take it I start getting nervous and getting some anxiety, so I try not to miss a dose.

Depression	graciesmommy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	10/3/2009 2:51:58 PM	Taking this med was the most horrible experience I ever had in my life. I began it in June 09 at 20mg because I was feeling sad and depressed out of the blue.. Have never had depression ever before. So De. says try this.. After a week, I felt nausea constantly-felt just ill. By week 2- I began having ear pain and headaches with the nausea/loss of appetite and most days felt unable to function- went to Dr to see if I had ear infection. No-- asked if it could be the meds. Again NO..By week 3- I had lost 24 pounds. I was then waking up with indigestion (mind you I was barely eating), constant nausea, fatigue, headaches, feeling of absolute illness- Went again to Dr. asking is this the meds doing this..Again NO.  Began getting freaked that I had some sort of disease that I was gonna die or something. Spent most days on couch, sick as hell. Finally week 4-more weight loss, feeling weird crazy thoughts, didnt trust myself, afraid- worried, felt like I was going insane and this with all the physical complaints. At end of Week 4, I said I quit this med.  I stopped it, went to see my hemotologist in tears begging him to see if I had cancer or something (brain tumor) because I have never had headaches like that ever. Told him about the Celexa  and that the day before I stopped taking them. He looked at me and said, IT IS the MEDS..Told me about the half life and give it time to get out of my system. Sure enough less than one week later, I felt 100 times better. He offered for me to try Wellbutrin but I was super afraid of the same thing happening. So I declined. However again about 2 weeks ago began feeling sad, depressed, weird gloomy out of the blue--all my blood hormone tests are normal- so called the  Hemotologist and saw him. began taking the Wellbutrin 150 about 4 days ago. The only thing I noticed I felt a little better, some energy,little irritable today..Will see how it goes. I am taking a half dose of .5mg of xanax as well, since I am nervous about the side effect  
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	10/3/2009 10:38:31 AM	I am taking Celexa for mild anxiety. I had bad anxiety at night and it caused me to take 3-4 hours to fall asleep. My Dr. thought this would make me think less at night and be able to relax and fall asleep more easily but because of the drug I am not able to sleep at all. I have had about 8 hours of sleep in the past 3 or 4 days. I told the dr. I'd try it and see if that effect wore off but I am done with this drug... so much for helping me sleep. My anti anxiety med has caused me more anxiety then I've felt in a long time.
Depression	sewerman, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	10/2/2009 11:37:03 PM	I'm a 51 year old male who has been taking citalopram (generic celexa-20mg) for about 5 months now for depression due to divorce- wife left me for another man.  I take one pill before bed time.  My worst time of day is in the morning before work- anxiety and depression to the point of crying sometimes and calling in sick to work and staying in bed for half the day. So, I think I'm undecided if this is helping me or not.  Maybe I need a larger dosage.  My xanax sure helps though- but I don't want to get hooked on that.

Depression	GotSomeHelp, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	9/29/2009 8:20:46 PM	I started taking Celexa about a month ago and for the most part, it has worked wonders for me. I used to not be able to sleep because life problems, and with this I can almost always sleep! Its wonderful! It does a great job lifting my mood and increased my lacking appetite. It does, however, seriously kill my sex drive. Definite downfall, but I found the medicine to be worth it. 
Depression	Husband Wife Team, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	9/29/2009 1:22:12 PM	First of all I am the husband writing this for the wife. I am at work where we get internet access. My wife is 32 yo has been  diagnosed with PTSD, Bi-Polar, multi-personality disorder, anxiety, hypo thyroid disease, and depression. She is on abilify, clonazepam, levothyroxin. She was taking nerotriptilyn to help with sleep disorder but was removed from this and incresed the clonazepam at night. Been on Celexa for just over a week. At first she was tired all the time (was taking meds at night), then switched to mornings. That day she sleept all day long. Since that day, she has been not sleeping that long. She is smiling more and less talk about how she wants life to end or dwelling on the anxiety of life. She yawns a lot, but that is becoming less. The biggest problem she feels (and this is coming from her) is that she has a lack of sexual desire specifically decresed interest in sex and sexual ability. This fact is giving her a whole new and other reason for being depressed because sex is a part of our marriage that we both love. So has any married couples experienced this and have the sexual effects balanced out. Celexa works awesom for my wife, she has such a beautiful smile and laugh. I am falling in love with her all over again and it is great, just want the &quot;other&quot; effects to stop. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	9/28/2009 5:20:27 PM	I've recently started taking Celexa for mild depression. Im having a lot of side effects. Neausea, dry heaving, Dizzyness, Feeling &quot;Drunk&quot;. But it has helped with the depression a lot. My family has noticed a big change in my personality. Im walking around happy and care free, and I enjoy waking up in the morning now. Major decrease in mood swings.

Depression	ChrisInMidwest, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	9/25/2009 1:51:03 PM	I was taking 20 mg of Lexapro before I switched to Celexa just over 3 wks ago. Lexapro had really helped me with my depression, but it was too expensive ($93/month) and it raised my sex drive very high. My sex drive is normally good, but on Lexapro it felt like I was 15 again-which sounds great, but it was very distracting to say the least. So I switched to Celexa. The only effect I liked was a normal to at times, a reduced libido, which felt alright.The other side effects were awful: headaches, very tired, irritable, and, worst of all, brain &quot;fog' all day. My memory was just shot, because of the fog- far worse than anything I'd experienced before I'd taken any anti-depressants. I'm switching to a different med today once I hear back from my doctor's office, for hopes of a better outcome. Just a note to consult your dr when you switch medications, I made the mistake of not letting them know what I was going through and stopped cold turkey a few days ago. Now I'm even more irritable and my wife's not too happy with me, to say the least.  
Depression	4f57hj, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	9/24/2009 11:56:32 AM	 Recently switched to the generic of Celexa from an SNRI with fair results; feel the SNRI was more helpful with my tolerance of generalized joint and muscle discomfort; seem to be more sleepy on the Celexa but am not sure if this is from the Celexa or other cause; for a burning sensation in feet, the Celexa does not seem as effective though the cost is more affordable; possibly,an increase in dosage to 40mg. might help-have not had this prescribed yet;overall, believe Celexa is moderately effective but not that energizing.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	SCkitty, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	9/24/2009 9:02:25 AM	age 46. Had heart attack 3 years ago and more heart problems this year. Dr. said I needed nerve medicine and put me on Celexa. I wasn't sleeping well before taking. My third week into the drug and I slept fine. The fourth week and I went back to not sleeping, waking up crying and feeling blah. I've been taking this drug for 5 weeks now and I'm still waking during the night..can't go back to sleep and crying everyday which is something I didn't do before the medicine. It did help the mood swings... now I'm constantly down. Sex drive went from great to zero - can't orgasm. Felt better BEFORE I started taking this medicine.

Depression	LifeinProgress, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	9/21/2009 4:34:12 PM	Have been struggling with a severe case of depression for sometime, to the point where I have had sucidial thoughts and basically do not see the point in living...Finally accepted that I needed to seek professional help. Have tried Lexapro, Effexor and  Wellbutrin in the past for a very short time frame, all 3 gave me excrutiating headaches so I stopped taking them, not to mention severe anxiety and a general &quot;weirded out&quot; feeling.Have been taking Celexa 10mg for about 3 weeks now. I can tell you that I have not had headaches with the 10mg. My doctor wants to bump me up slowly to 20 or 40 mg, however, when I took 15mg, the headache was unbearable. My doctor suggested that I take it with two tylenols, which so far has been helpful. Haven't noticed a huge improvement in the depression, but I would say I am hopeful. Also, after reading some reviews, I started taking Celexa at night, so I am not groggy durig the day.As a side note, I am also someone who eats very healthy, works out daily and has a lot of family support. Thus, I hope that I will be able to be on Celexa long enough to dig out of what I like to call my depression, &quot;the black hole&quot;. Trust me, if you are sensitive to medications in general, especially AntiDepressants, Celexa may work for you. I pray that someone reads this and find it helpful!!

Depression	MommySusan1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/13/2009 2:28:22 PM	I have suffered from depression off and on for years and have taken Zoloft in the past.  This time it didn't seem to be working.  I also was hit with overwhelming anxiety because of my husband's job difficulties.  The doctor prescribed Celexa a couple of months ago.  After 3 weeks, I was ready to give up on this because it took longer to kick in than Zoloft. I also had terrible dry mouth and food just didn't taste good. But the Dr. bumped me up to 60 mg. and that really did the trick.  I only have dry mouth when I first wake up in the AM and food tastes good again.  My hubby said that on Zoloft I was more &quot;flat emotioned&quot; but on the Celexa, I have the normal ups and downs that everyone else has.  The only negative is that I am on the tired side, but not terribly bad.  It is a lot better than wanting to jump in front of a bus.  The best part is that a one month supply is only $4 at Walmart.  I urge everyone to give this a try and stick with it.  Good luck!

Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	9/11/2009 3:36:50 PM	Before I was discharged from the Army, I was having pretty serious anxiety problems. It got to the point where I attempted suicide. I was having at least one big panic attack a day, couldn't handle crowds, all that junk. I couldn't take it anymore.I was hospitalized and put on Wellbutrin and Ativan. These made things a ton worse - I couldn't handle anything. I would break down if I someone looked at me funny, and I went days at a time without sleep. I ended up taking every pill I had, trying to make it stop. Needless to say, I was hospitalized again and taken off those meds pretty quick.Then I was given Celexa and oh my god, the panic and depression stopped. Not immediately, but it helped a lot. I could handle being inside again, with other people. Loud noises slowly stopped bothering me. Had it not been too late, I'd have fought my discharge (the paperwork had all gone through while I was in the hospital, and I left about a week later), because I was getting back to my normal self.I haven't experienced any weight gain, except from the normal being home and not exercising and eating junk food. At first, the pills made me manic and jittery - I felt like I'd drunk about six cups of strong coffee in one go for the entire day, and couldn't wind down without taking a sedative. I normalized after a couple weeks. Celexa has worked out awesomely for me.

I was going through a major break up, last year in grad school, internship, and a full time job. I was depressed and crying a lot. Since I have been on my medication I have felt better. Sometimes I want to cry, but I cant lol because I am regulated. I think it is funny. I feel clear headed. I am happy to read the other reviews because so far they are on target with my experience.

At first it worked well, but I've been on it for almost a year and I starting to feel the same way I used to with the same depression symptoms.

I don't feel like a &quot;zombie&quot;; I can still worry for my kids, and get angry if I need to. It really takes the edge off. I'm really glad I started taking it. However, I tried to suddenly stop once-big mistake. I felt dizzy, nauseus, numb, confused...really weird. But within an hour of starting again, I felt 100% better.

I was tired &amp; immediatly noticed a decrease in my sex drive. At the time I was not able to drive due to my panic attacks. I am up to 40MG now &amp; I'm not tired anymore, but my sex drive is still nonexistant. I started driving about two months ago &amp; I feel great.  I have gained 18lbs since staring it, which is a down fall.

AS long as I take it everyday my moods stay balanced and good.  It makes me feel normal again, but if I stop taking it for even a day or two I crash and fall into a deep depression very quickly.

Family problems and my doctor thought it would help. I felt like it did at first but now have continual, horrible night sweats, more severe migraines and dry mouth.  I feel so lethargic and have no motivation!  I'd rather deal with problems than feel this way.  I'm going to wean myself off.  Weight gain also and no sex drive - not good!!!
Depression	fragile1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/2/2009 2:55:20 AM	I have suffered with depression for many years. I had tried approx 6-7 other AD's, but to no avail. Some AD's did nothing to lessen the feelings of despair while some just seemed to worsen my condition. With this in mind, I resigned myself to the fact that I must continue to suffer the rest of my life,with this debilitating disease. Approx. 3 1/2 weeks ago, I relented and had asked my Dr. if I could try-(after 5 years of suffering w/o any meds), &quot;Celexa&quot;. He agreed and put me on 20mg, 1x day. In the first week,I could feel a difference, a positive difference. 3 weeks later, Celexa has made a significant change with not only how I feel but also, my outlook on life.I can only conclude,that not only have I found &quot;the one&quot;-(Celexa), but with the help of your &quot;readers reviews&quot; and their experiences while using this drug, I have a renewed outlook on life, and freedom for the first time from horrible and debilitating disease! I often would say, &quot;how much more can one endure&quot;?! Well, no more. There is indeed, light at the end of the tunnel! Thank you readers and Good Luck to all!

I suffered from depression on and off for over 8 years, until a doctor put me on Celexa. Celexa didn't lower the symptoms of depression but it totally took away my depression. I can hug the person or group of people who where resonsible for the production of Celexa. THANK YOU CELEXA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After the initial &quot;get used to it&quot; period, I took 20mgs for 3 years and then needed to up it to 40. Now, instead of upping it again, I'd like to change the type or get off of it completely due to the sexual side effects. I really don't like those side effects and would almost have any other kind.

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/20/2009 10:22:14 PM	I started taking Celexa in 2005, when for some reason I started having horrible anxiety. I stayed on it for about 3 1/2 years with absolutely no problems!! It helped me so much! I was normal again. No side effects except a little sleepy but taking it right before bed helped that! In January 2009 I weaned myself off because my husband and I wanted to try to get pregnant. I felt amazing still for about 5 months! Then my anxiety starting coming back and even worse than before. I was given Zoloft and it was the worst thing ever. I was so nausea and had NO appetite on Zoloft and I felt worse anxiety. I went back on Celexa and it has been about a month and I feel great again!!! Celexa works for me, absolutely!!!!

Its a type of drug that takes a while to get in your system to show progression. I haven't experienced any side effects, except the dry mouth, but I have experienced what I call &quot;serious side effects&quot;. I've noticed a decrease in my urine (meaning that amount of times I go throughout the day) and also an increase in heart beat. I made note to my Pharmacists, but she suggest I go into my doctor's office for further suggestions. I persoanlly like this drug. It seems to work already. I was previously on Zoloft and the effects of that medicine took control ASAP it seemed. Not really a good medication for me, personally!

I used to subconsiously take my self off meds because the change it made in me. With this medication I feel clear headed and have been successfully on it for 3 years with no need for an increase of dosage. I have some outside therapy but it is not an ongoing treatment where the celexa is. I'm so thankful for this medication it has helped me to put my life back in order. I can live balanced. Everybody has ups and downs but mine are not so severe now!

I retired from being a professional woman - teacher at a major university- and when I was getting ready to retire and when I did retire I felt useless as I had defined myself as a professional woman and people tended to not give me credit for my background and experience. I just became a wife.Celexa also has seemingly cured my irritable bowel syndrome that has plagued me since a teenager.  As I slowly quit taking it now I wonder if the IBD will come back.

It kills your ability to be satisified and your desire to have sex at all. I haven't noticed that much of a difference in the way I feel either. My doctor says I should be experiencing a change in my over-all mood by now.

Depression	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Male	65-74	8/4/2009 9:08:42 PM	My wife was hospitalized with jaundice/anemia. It was determined that she almost had kidney failure and was in the hospital for 2 weeks. The next step was rehab in nursing home environment. Prior to leaving the hospital she was placed on Celexa for depression. This was continued at the nursing home. Her mental state has deteriorated to the point that she can no longer walk or feed herself. A blood test indicted an extremely high level of ammonia and Lactulose has been prescribed and started. Hopefully this will help her situation.Since she had history of both kidney and liver problems I don't believe that Celexa should ever have been prescribed. How can I protect my wife from this kind of obvious error?

In the last year my panic was daily, buckled up and saw a psychiatrist who had me try this since I was NOT happy with the side effects of Paxil. Paxil made me feel like a zombie, but this did the exact opposite - made my panic so bad that even on 1mg (.5 xanax twice a day) I could not function. Had to quit after just 3 days of this. Don't want to have to pop xanax daily as it loses effectiveness, going to possibly try Zoloft next.

Had the yawning/drymouth/sleep issues the first 2 weeks, but since then, things have been great. No more paranoid feelings and anxiety at night. I don't wig out on my family anymore. I had to play around with they time of day to take it, because at first it would make me sleepy, so I took it at night, but then couldn't sleep, so I take it at lunch now. I highly recommend it for someone like me, mild depression and anxiety. I also have found that it's ok for me to have a few beers with friends. I even got drunk one night, but no bad side effects. This drug does help with working with difficult co-workers also, I have found myself much more pleasant with the people I can't stand at work.

My doc prescribed me 20 mg and told me that I could experience a decrease in my sex drive, instead there was a decrease in my &quot;abilities.&quot; After about 2 weeks of 20 mg I decided to cut the pills in half to take 10 mg a day... this allowed me to sexually be myself again. When it came time for my follow up my doc decided to keep me on the 20mg celexa and add wellbutrin to my routine. After going back to the 20mg of celexa I am back to square one.

I started out at 20mg but after 2 weeks, I was still wanting to be in bed most of the time and would cry non-stop.  So the Dr. increased my dose to 40mg.  It seems to be helping.  I've been on Celexa now officially for about 6 weeks.  I stay tired a lot and and the whole &quot;loss of appetite&quot; part hasn't occurred for me.  Another one of the depressing things I've dealt with over the past year and a half is that I've gained 30lbs.   I need the Mx to help me get the motivation to exercise!

I used to get teary eyed for no reason. Since I've been on it I've never had a problem with it at all. I think it even helped me go through menopause. Because I never had any sweats and I didn't have many mood swings. (my husband thanked the doctor for that) I just stopped taking celexa about a week ago, so I'll have to see how it goes.

Now on Celexa for 2 months and still have daily sweat sessions and my hair is falling out at a rapid speed, unsure if related. Do seem to have more patience with my kids (3yr and 10mos) and I let things roll off me easier now. At the same time I dont like sweating everyday or being bald...am trying to be patient for my system to adjust.

For 4 of those months I continued to self-medicate with marijuana on and off (hoping that the meds would be enough to help me quit, after two weeks, I no longer was able to hold out). I took 20mg for one week and then upped to 40mg ever since. In the beginning it made me dizzy and very tired. The drowsiness never subsided which is why I switched to taking it at night and have been ever since. When I had finally been able to stop smoking marijuana 4 months later, my anxiety had subsided and my depression blew up big time. I had many crying spells. I could not concentrate. I was very lethargic, as I had been the entire time, and the celexa was not helping that. What I needed was energy. I stopped taking the pill today with instructions from my doctor to switch immediately to 150mg of Effexor (which I'm pretty nervous about...) and the withdrawal effects I had were: vertigo, sweating, crying, severe depression. Celexa works for many people. It helped me out in the beginning, as it was the first time I had ever been on an antidepressant. But it never was consistent for me, and in the end my depression became unacceptable and the Celexa was doing nothing to help.

Ive only been on it for 8 weeks and not only am I not as grouchy and irritable but I have also stopped emotional eating which as helped me loose 12 lbs already. After trying several antidepressants in the past, I have finally found the one that works for me. I have to admit however the first 2 weeks was rough. Tremors, sweating and dry mouth was insane however I stuck with it and the side effects subsided after the first few weeks.

I felt like it pulled me farther into my depression. I didnt have control of my emotions and was sleeping all the time. Took myself off of it and gained more control of myself. Now on Wellbutrin and LOVE it...
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	cheyenne90, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	7/7/2009 3:23:31 PM	I have been experiencing major anxiety for the past two months not to mention slight anxiety for 10 years, anyways this medication gave me good days and bad, if i  wasnt anxious i was feeling sick due to side effects and if not one or the other it was both at the same time. I have been on zoloft(which made me feel suicidal) wellbutrin which helped me get my libido back and then this celexa, im not to pleased with it the side effects keep me anxious and disappointed. I just got switched to lexapro today hope that works the best im sure it will tho. The side effects i have had for 1 month of taking this med is, drowsiness,out of it sensation, jitteryness,nauseas, no interest in eating what so ever, anxious due to side effects and irritability. Trouble breathing pressure in the eyes dream like state and every time i cough it makes me gag. THe side effects are not worth it for me, but meds work differently for different people. I hope you all the best and stay positive!
Depression	RogerBaran, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/7/2009 1:32:18 PM	I like this drug much better than Paxil. I have been on Celexa now for over 2 years and noticed improvement right away: Time didn't seem so collapsed -- I had &quot;room to think&quot; and a lot less &quot;knee jerk&quot; reactions to situations. My only concern is when I forget to take it -- the pressure in my head builds substantially and I feel very fatigued. However, with that warning sign I remember to take it immediately and I am ok again within an hour or so. If I don't take it for some reason (away from the house) then I seem to release the &quot;Darth Vader&quot; in me and I can become pretty unpleasant -- to anyone who happens to be around me at the time.I have remedied the above situation by setting a special ringtone to an alarm on my cellphone. It goes off every day at 7:00am. When I hear that special ring I know to check myself to see if I have taken my medications.Overall, I really like the way Celexa helps me manage life; way better than before. I also benefit from the return of my sex drive; which was almost totally gone while using paxil. All of the other drugs that I sampled seemed to have side effects that were unpleasant in one way or another. Not Celexa. It comes on mild from the start and smooths out the path quite nicely. By the third week or so I knew that I would stick with this drug.

I just had runny bowel movements for a week or so. I think &quot;wonder drug&quot; might be too powerful a word to describe celexa but it's the closest thing to it. I am now in week 4 of treatment and I feel better than I ever have about life in general. Energy is down a bit but once i get moving then I am ok. Please give celexa a shot and allow at least 3 weeks for a major change in your overall mood and well-being. This drug may have very well guaranteed me success in life and I am proof that it works.

Because of the weight gain (which made me more depressed) I chose to get off.  I was on a fairly low dose: 20 mg and it still helped.  Might try Cymbalta next because I have no energy and have trouble sleeping.

Being optimistic on what this drug can do for me, I knew I could not come to any conclusion until I have taken the medication long enough to be sure it has to be doing something. At first (30-90) days I was up and down about how it was making me feel, but I have since noticed a significantly downward trend with my overall outlook of life and episodes of GAD and Depression. And have also had several emotional breakdowns (a first). I understand that it is not commonly recommended for people 25 and under. I was Just about to turn 25 when I was placed on it. I am not sure where to go from here.

Life threw so many hard things at me that I was sobbing,worrying ALL the time. I was very tired and had litle or none of my creative spirit. This drug has stopped all that.  I am back to being energetic and creative and smiling :)Am much more able to handle the traumas of life; spouse wiht cancer, teenagers, step children, etc.... I do have emotions but they do not rule me.  I am on 10mg/day.  Do miss a more satisfying sex life but at least we have one now.  Before Cylexa-too emotional or angry to try!  Also, I am better able to support- emotionally- people who need me as well as find joy for myself.  Initially thought I'd try for 9 mos.; now thinking another year might be a good idea.

Here I am talking it for depression and it has no effect fo rthe Bi-Polar. She said that it only was making me worst so its not one to be used for BP!! I can tell you this because I havent felt any changes in me! I still feel terrible and unable to even be active!! I'm coming off of it slowly but fair warning not for the treat for Bi-Polar!!!! With the help of Christ and another med maybe I'll be closer to getting better really soon.
Panic Disorder	WorldTraveler, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/20/2009 3:22:38 PM	Over the past few years I developed a fear of falling, the phobia increased so that I was holding on to walls within our home, unable to walk to my car, even with 2 canes, petrified in parking lots, even with a shopping card.  A psychiatrist put me on 5 mg. 2x a day, but the AM dose left me too groggy, the 5 mg. PM dose gave me the kind of sleep I haven't had since I was a teenager (deep, wonderful dream-filled sleep).  After 3 weeks, my anxiety began to lesson, after 6 weeks I was walking around not holding onto walls.  It has changed me life.  I'm calmer &amp; the little stuff doesn't bother me any more.  The 10 lb. I gained after breaking my back, I can't seem to lose, so weight loss is harder, my strong libido is nearly non-existent, but I don't care, I'm not filled with dread &amp; anxiety.  I'm not worried all the time.  Close friends have noticed these changes.  After 9 months, I have no plans to discontinue it.  Some of the night sweats others are feeling are probably peri-menopause.  It is hard on the stomach, I took it with 2 75 mg. Zantac for the first 2 weeks, then 1 Zantac for another 2 weeks, now my stomach is used to it.  I take it before bedtime.  So the nausea others have experienced might be alleviated by taking it with a Zantac because Celexa is an acidic drug.  5 mg. works so well for me, I'm incredulous as to the high doses that others are on.  It does take 6 weeks for the full effect, so be paient.

I can't get up too quickly or even move my head too fast without feeling dizzy. Plus even if it was better for my depression my sex life with my husband sucked!! Over all I think that it worked only in my head because I so needed something to work at the time. The side effects are not worth it. The way I feel after only 2 days off of it are just nut's. Imagine if this drug affects someone more than me they could wind up in the hospital!!!

I had been on Paxil for 2 year but I just wasn't getting better and needed a change. After being on Celexa for about 3 days I felt like a new person. I have energy, feel happy, I actully want to do things. I haven't felt this good in years. I didn't reliaze how bad I was on the Paxil or how bad the side effect were until I was off of it. I feel like a new person. I have tried SO many script in the past 13 years and nothing has helped me feel like my self the way Celexa has. I know that I am still new on the medication, so far so great! It has really given me life back.

It's work a little while each step and then would lose it's effectiveness. Also seemed to bring on some minor depression while I was on it.

Depression	KMartin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/17/2009 12:29:55 PM	4 years on Celexa.  It stopped the intense, uncontrolable, non-stop sobbing.  This drug tamed the excessive ruminating.  My angry, impatient, always-irritable personality was replaced with a sweet mellowness. My suicidal ideations ended. I took this medicine because of some very seriously painful life events. This drug saved my life.The initial side effects: tense jaw, yawning, insomnia, and others, went away fairly quickly.  Celexa kicked in within a week.  This medicine numbed my horribly raw, painful, extremely depressed feelings. I could not stop crying, for literally a year before starting Celexa.  My ruminating was like torture.  I was wonderfully mellow and fairly happy once again.Long term effects included being pretty much emotionless.  I could not cry even if I wanted to.  My passionate, creative characteristics faded away.  I loved to sleep. My ambitions waned. I was definitely sugar coated and in my own little content, semi-zombie world.  But, I really needed that at the time....really, really needed it.I think I gained some weight too while on Celexa.  Hard to pinpoint exactly why.I decided to stop Celexa just 2 1/2 weeks ago.  I am thinking that I might be able to, maybe, not need it anymore.  I am going to try anyway. I want to get some of my old ambition back...my creativity....I miss the good intense feelings of love for my family.  I was kind of flat when it came to that. I was on 40 mg...Took 20mg for a week...then 10 mg for 3 days...now, zero meds. It was easy at first. Now, the brain zaps, whooshes are plentiful.  I feel sad and teary at times.  But that is ok...I am not afraid to cry....I think I just need to get used to emotions again.  I was very nauseous the first 10 days.  That is gone now.  I do have to stomach cramps now.  I am irritable, very tired, and just don't feel so great, overall.  But I am hoping all this will ease away eventually.  I sure am going to give it a good shot!  Quiting smoking was much harder!! LOL!

Everyday I feel sad.  I watch commercials and start to cry.  I feel exhausted too AND I have gained at least 10LBS.  It wasn't this bad towards the end of using Paxil.  I am not sure what I may need, but I think I know that this isn't it.  It has been over a month now and up to a dosage of 40.  I don't think I want to stay on it.

I started on 20mg a day and after 3 weeks got upped to 40mg. I use to be very anxious and I guess depressed. I had intense mood changes as well. When i was on the 20mg my anxiety was more or less gone but my depression and mood was still the same. Ive been on 40mg for about a week and a half now and feel amazing! I havent felt this great in years. And I've lost 9 lbs! I know everyones experiences are different but I found it helpful to read reviews when I first started.As for side effects for the first week i felt like absolute crap. Headache, sick, no appetite what so ever, shaky, kind of tippy on my feet...but those have faded. I do have a little bit of a metallic taste in my mouth at times but nothing unbearable...Good luck and I hope this helps

It caused horrendous side effects  and I ended up in the ER after taking it for 17 days (doc said it would all be better after two weeks). I was out sick from work for two week in an attemp to get adjusted to the med. It caused severe night sweeats, sleep disturbance, worsened the anxiety to the point of my brain being completely manic/aggitated and could not concentrate on the minor of things (TV!). It was explained to me by a psych doctor, after the fact, that the reason I had this reaction is because the med is for anxiety AND depression. Since I did not suffer from depression it simply added 'gasoline to the fire' by speeding up my brain - tenfold! Worse than any anxiety I have EVER experienced! I am now on Buspar and have not experienced any side effects.

Depression	ejayer, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	6/8/2009 6:02:34 PM	After having tried Paxil, Zoloft and Wellbutrin, Celexa was the only one that has really worked for me. I could feel results within the first 5 days of taking the medication. I have now been on Celexa for over two years and feel wonderful.

Depression	NeverAgain, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	25-34	6/8/2009 11:19:40 AM	After being diagnosed with a chronic illness I suffered from extreme depression and was prescribed 20mg of Celexa which seemed to work initially.  No sexual interest.  Unable to maintain erection.  Also made me unable to climax.  Eventually the medication seemed to stop working, so my Dr. prescribed 40mg.  Didn't notice much difference other than my abililty to climax returned but my interest in sex is NOT there.  I haven't been able to have sex in a year.  To aide the celexa, and after a suicide attempt, my Dr. also prescribed 150mg of wellbutrin.  This combo proved to be effective for a while with me taking the celexa at bedtime and the wellbutrin in the morning. Eventually that became less effective also so my wellbutrin dosage was increased to 300mg (2 150mg tablets) and I was advised to taper off of celexa by taking 1/2 a tablet at bedtime for a week, then 1/2 tablet every other day.  My withdrawls have been pretty bad...I experience muscle tremors, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, loss of appetite, headaches, and an inability to focus because of the symptoms.  I would recommed exhausting every possible avenue to treat depression without medication because eventually you're left over-medicated, and miserable because of side effects or withdrawls.  I plan to continue tapering off of celexa and then work at tapering off of wellbutrin.  I'm also planning to find a new therapist or some sort of support group, and start going back to church because I still don't feel like I'm living.  I seriously hope something I've said resonates, and helps someone to make an informed decision about their own treatment options.  Gotta go lie down because I just vomitted and my head is pounding.  BE WISE and BE WELL!!!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Hope, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	6/7/2009 7:24:41 PM	I have been on celexa for one week now and it's been a rough one.    All of the symptoms of anxiety for which I have been taking the drug have intensified and also new disturbances have been added -- nausea, shakiness and tremors, headaches.   My md wants me to stay on it for at least 10 days to give it a fair trial; but I'm not so sure.    I don't like the way I am feeling and certainly don't want to get any worse.   I only wanted to feel better and be able to cope with stressful situation; that is the reason for starting this med.  (never been on this type of drug before -- only tranquilizer)
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	 Female  (Caregiver) 	3	5	3	Female		6/7/2009 2:50:11 PM	I noticed pretty quickly that this drug helped me, however, it seems to be less effective now than at the beginning.  I exercise everyday and watch what I eat, but I can't seem to lose those few extra pounds like I could before and I'm wondering if this medication is responsible.  I had very little sex drive before this drug, now I have zero.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	6/4/2009 3:07:40 PM	Status migrainosous was my original diagnosis with overwhelming stress as the primary factor. The Celexa was prescribed to help me get the repeated anxiety under control. As it was very effective, the Celexa really calmed me down to the point where I was to take every other night and now I'm not supposed to take it anymore. I took Celexa for 3 months and am now three days off the drug. I can feel the difference the Celexa made with the treatment of the debilitating migraines. I did suffer with low libido but all SSRI's have this side effect and that was something I could temporarily live with, as long as I didn't have to stay on the medication too long. The decreased dosage to every other day helped with this side effect only a little. Regardless, the Celexa was very effective in the treatment of my anxiety portion of status migrainosous. However when you come off Celexa (like it says), you will have headaches until your body re-adjusts to life without Celexa. I hope I re-adjust soon. Although the anxiety has been reduced with the help of Celexa and stress counseling, the migraines I took it for have come back in force. Not good! My doctor was trying to get me down to 8 migraines a month; I've taken my migraine medicine now 4 times in 3 days. To let you know, however, status migrainosous is very rare and most migraine sufferers will not have to use this product.
Other	i, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	2	Male	25-34	6/2/2009 7:16:10 PM	I was prescribed this because of insomnia that is related to anxiety and possibly dysthimia.  No noticable effects until day 6 when hyperinsomnia kicked in.  I only slept 4 out of 52 hours.  I am kicking my dose down a half notch today and the doc is supposed to call me tomorrow.Just be aware if you are seeking this med as a treatment for insomnia there is around a %15 percent chance it will make it worst (at least in the short run, colsult your doc)
Depression	afraid, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	6/2/2009 5:59:59 PM	It helped the first month, I started doing small things I had not done before, but slowing faded back to depression.  My doctor wants me to inrease to 40mg, but afraid of side affects, shaking hands, disorientation, no sexual drive at all.

When I stopped taking it after 6 months...it took  6 months for the brain &quot;zaps&quot; to go away...which I cant say were zaps...just brief 5 second dizzy spells.  Still get them every once in a while.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	5/29/2009 5:49:02 PM	I was on Celexa for approximately 8 months for depression.  After being on several other medications, I had high hopes for Celexa, but I was disappointed.  I experienced extreme sleeplessness and some pretty significant weight gain.  Coming off the drug was also difficult as I experienced brain &quot;zaps&quot;, nausea, and tremors. Drugs affect people differently, so obviously this was just my experience.

I have more patience, little things in life don't bug me so much. I have missed doses, very rarely. When I have, probably four times in 7 yrs. The longest was 5 days and it was bad. I felt like I couldn't catch up with myself. I started to get weepy and mean. So I try not to miss more than 1 or 2 days. My children call them my happy pills. Side effects, after all these years. I guess I have gotten use to them. Which were dry mouth and sweating when I sleep. Otherwise I like it.

Depression	Jordan, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	19-24	5/26/2009 12:51:00 AM	Side-effects seemed to outweigh effectiveness, anxiety lifted after about a month of treatment, depression is milder due to decreased anxiety and anger issues, but I am now off the drug for near 3 weeks and my withdrawals have gone away and the anxiety has not returned. Side-effects seemed pretty intense, sexual being the most pervasive, decreased drive, pleasure, and an inability to reach orgasm really bothered me. It made me apathetic and affected my schoolwork negatively. Tiredness was common, I found it VERY hard to wake up in the morning, and if I could be awake enough, I usually didn't care enough about anything to wake up.  In my experience a good drug for a step up, to get things back on track, but not a permanent treatment for me.

I have noticed that I am really not hungry like I used to be and have lost some weight with it which is actually a good thing. I find that it is easier for me to take at night before going to bed.  I also have much more energy.  I was on Zoloft before switching to this and zoloft always made me very sleepy and all I ever did was lay around.

I recommend this highly!

I do think I need to start taking it at night instead of the am because it makes me very dizzy and nauseated with dry mouth.  I'm hoping that these sideaffects will go away after time.

It improved my mood dramatically, but the side effects almost drove me to insanity! I was nervous, agitated, I drooled alot, it made me involuntarily clench my teeth together very hard. I couldn't sleep, had night sweats, and could not have an orgasm to save my life. Decided being depressed was better than never having an orgasm again. Mood was improved but the side effects were just way too intense for me.

While on celexa I felt numb and very much unlike myself. I was on anti-anxiety meds for one year and decided to go off them due my complete lack of interest in sex and didn't want to deal with what I was experiencing for the rest of my life. I kept thinking there has to be a better way and I tapered off over a 4 week period. Getting off celexa was one of the worst exp. of my life. I had headaches, brain zaps, I was sick to my stomach, nauseous all the time and had horrible mood swings for two full months. About three months after I stopped I had a horrible emotional break down. I was at my wits end and hit the internet to research natural ways to calm me down. After trying 5-htp (which helped a little) my boyfriend mentioned magnesium deficiency. I did a little research on the symptoms and found that all my symptoms pointed towards this. Muscle tension, anxiety and horrible obsessive thoughts, insomnia, etc. After I did a little research on which brand of mag. to buy, I decided on &quot;Slow Mag&quot;. I took 4 tabs a day, two in the morning on an empty stomach and two in the evening on an empty stomach. I felt more relaxed and calm within a few hours of taking my first dose; my muscle tension seemed to just melt away. I've been taking slow mag everyday for a few weeks now and I have not felt this good in years! All symtomps I mentioned above are GONE!!! I urge everyone to please, please try mag first before giving in to the drugs our doctors push on us. Magnesium test are rarely able to detect a deficiency, so just give it a try and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH! There is a large majority of people with this deficiency and don't know it. If you decide to give mag a try, please research brands and make sure you buy a quality supplement that includes calcium. I want to help as many people as I can, you dont have to be a zombie! Good Luck!

I never knew a pill could help me.  My anxiety is so much better, I quit caring what people think of me, and my back of all things has quit hurting.  It had hurt for years is the crazy thing.  I don't have many negative thoughts like I did either. Side effects were noticeable at first, but seem to have tapered off.

I don't find myself crying and not knowing why as much as I used to. I was on Lexapro before celexa and it worked very well but I gained tons of weight on it like 50 lbs. Celexa isn't really strong but it does help to an exstent. I lost my extra poundage about 3 months after getting off of Lexapro and starting on Celexa and the best thing is Celexa has alot of the same chemicals as Lexapro does so I didn't have to get winged off the Lexapro before taking Celexa.

I have noticed a huge change, I do not fly off the handle anymore, I have less anxiety, more energy, more patience.  The change has also been noticed by those around me.  The only side effect that I have noticed is I am less hungry and can go a long time without eating or feeling hungry.  When i 1st began taking it, it did make me dizzy.  I take them before bed.  After about a week that went away.
Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	4/22/2009 5:43:31 PM	I have had depression for some time and have taken a variety of drugs that primarily addressed anxiety.  During the holidays in 2008 I had severe depression and felt utterly hopeless.  After a lot of trial and error, I am presently on 80mg of Celexa, 30mg of Cymbalta, all of which are taken in the morning.  I take Xanax at .25 for public speaking or for situations that I know will be stressful in advance.Normally I do pretty well with this combination.  Lately though I have been so tired during the day that I have trouble getting out of bed and staying at work: I want to just sleep until I have had my fill.  Not as in the mood for sex as I used to be which is just fine with my wife.  Given being overly tired/feeling overly exhausted versus being severely depressed, I'll take the exhaustion.  As someone who is suffering from depression, it would be nice to have something without all the side effects.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	4/21/2009 8:56:23 PM	I have been on 20mg of celexa for 6 months and have noticed great change. I don't have tension headaches anymore, I'm not crying daily anymore, and I feel much more in control of my life. I'm starting to notice more stress in my life, so I think I will try to have my Dr. increase the dosage, but overall the drug has helped me tremendously.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/19/2009 4:23:42 PM	since taking this medication I have noticed a difference in myself. I'm not as moody or irritable as I was. Before, I would yell or just start crying for no reason at all. The only side effect that I've had from taking this medication is being tired and yawning alot. But it is well worth the outcome.

Depression	harnessingtheinsanity, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/16/2009 2:21:41 AM	I've been on celexa off and on for 11 years for depression, panic disorder, GAD, etc. I hate to credit a med with giving me my &quot;life&quot; back, but having struggled with these conditions since childhood I have tried everything else known to man and still wound up on meds. Combined with CBT, celexa has brought me down to 10-20 panic attacks a year, as opposed to 10-20 a day. It sedates me a bit, and inspite of diet and exercise I have gained 50lbs on it. Like others have mentioned it has caused increased sweating, dry mouth, slightly decreased sex drive. On the upside,unless i tell them nobody would ever know i suffered from any mental illness. I also responded well for years to Desipramine, ok to lexapro, poorly to prozac, wellbutrin, topamax,and when unmedicated (by choice) found st. John's Wort to be slightly helpful (might help a person with less severe conditions). I would recommend Celexa in spite of some of the bothersome side effects, especially when the alternative in being so seriously ill as to be unable to work, eat, leave the house, socialize, sleep, drive, or even think &quot;clearly&quot;. I would say it is one of the more tolerable medications.

I don't feel like I am in such a fog like I did with some of the others I tried.  I find that with this medicine it is easier for me to focus on things.  Because it makes me sleepy, I take mine at night.  I find that works better for me. I have no apparent side effects through the day that way.

I have been on other ones but Celexa is better.  It took about 3 months to feel the full effects but I am better at controlling my symptoms.  My depression/panic attacks were first present when I hit menopause. I am young and I went into early menopause. My still side effects are yawning, (not tired just inability to stop yawning), dry mouth.

Like so many of the strong people on here, I was fighting for my life with all of the anxiety I had encountered. My doctor prescribed Celexa and Ativan, and let me just say that it really helped me get back on my feet. I was really worried heading back to college that there was no way I'd be able to make it through, but after about a week and a half, closer to two weeks, the celexa began to take effect. For me, and I am the very like cautious and judgemental type, I noticed that the Celexa was helping in the little ways that made a huge difference in my daily lifestyle. In situations when I had normally broken down, I kept my cool and made it through. I would recommend this to anyone who is patient enough to let this drug take its effect in the body system. Since I got on Celexa, 20mg a day, my life has been manageable, something I would never have imagined possible after my rapid onset of panic attacks towards the end of my fall semester in college. A final note though to anyone who does decide to try this medication, it does prompt the ocassional bout of brain fog. You get used to it eventually, but it at times makes you a little &quot;too out of it.&quot; Just avoid caffeine at all costs, its not a good component for someone using this medication- makes you ansy. Hope this helps someone.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	4/2/2009 5:34:10 PM	I took this med at night for the first time and awoke 3 hrs. later with a reeling feeling.  I got up to go to the restroom and fainted 2 times on my way back to bed.  The 2nd time I fainted I didn't even know I was on the floor.  It was just a wierd feeling inside.  I didn't know it than, but I started to experience the 1st panic attack ever, and though I only took the med once (10mg) I continued to have some panic attacks and am now on clonazapam to treat panic attacks and seroquel to help me sleep.  So what is being treated now?  Not the depression, but anxiety attacks.  This drug was not a good fit for me, but everyone is different.

It is not all the time, but I will start to sweat a great deal with little effort such as sweeping the kicthen floor.  Willing to deal with it due to how much better I feel.  I experience some headachs at the start and blurred vision, only lasted a week or so.  Not serious.  Continue to get minor headachs, do not know if attribuated to medication or not.

My insurence would not pay for the Pristiq so they changed me over to Celexa.  since I've been on the Celexa I am more tired than before and just about as irritated as I was before I took any kind of med.

The first day I took it I was light headed, thought I was going to pass out. My eyes were sensitive to light and I felt sick to my stomach. I also felt tingling on the side of my head. These symptoms only lasted a day or so and then I was completely fine. Celexa has helped me gain confidence in myself and to become a social butterfly. I did feel tired at first also, but I now take the celexa at night and feel fine throughout the day. I would recommend this drug to anyone who has anxiety issues. Do not let the first day discourage you, stick to it and it should help.

I am happier and less stressed.  I am not snapping at him but I do get upset if it is warrented.  The first two weeks taking it I was shakey and grinding my teeth.  But this got better during the third week.  I also felt some upset stomache.  I missed one pill last week and I felt awful.  I was very jittery and anxious as well as irritable and had a panic attack.  My hubby even asked me if I missed a pill.  I have also noticed a difference in intimate moments.

I still have my good and bad days, but over all with the help of faith and friends and therapy I have gotten through. I no longer suffer from suicidal thoughts and can get through the day, sometimes I don't want to get out of bed, and others I&quot;m really happy. It just stinks being stuck in the middle of everything. I do know that being stuck in the middle is better than being at the end where I was before I started taking Celexa.

I am no longer yelling at my kids and feel calm, able to handle almost anything....Oh, my sexual experience with my wife has actually gotten better since I started the drug a month ago.

She carries a pan with her in case she actually throws up, as of yet she has not thrown up. Could she be allergic to the medication since this is the only new medication she is taking?

Xanax also needed often. With this drug I have taken it regular, depression and anxiety have lifted, and Xanax use is way down...I have tried many others... this is the best at 10 mg for me and side effects are far less than with other depression medications
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	3/1/2009 10:26:42 AM	This drug has worked well for me but I recently had a medical procedure where I was told to stop taking any medications.  I reacted badly to the anesthesia after the procedure and was too sick to keep anything in - food, liquids - so I did not take the meds for a couple of days.  I think not taking the meds made me sicker to my stomach.  Is this common?  It was a horrible experience.

I have only been on it for 2 going into my 3rd week and for the past two days all I can do is cry! The littlest things set me off. I am scared. Is this normal? Can someone please tell me that I am not as crazy as I feel? PLEASE

Panic Attacks have gone away almost completely. Started off on 40mg, then down to 20mg, with little or no problem. Tried to go down to 10mg but was not enough to ease my day to day anxiety. Only side effects I've had was very tierd at first but then I started taking it right before I went to bed and that worked perfect. Some sexual side effects, seemed to be better at 20mg. Thats all I've experienced.

Be sure to tell your surgeon about this as most are not aware of it.  You should stop taking celexa a lease a week prior to surgery BUT it can cause severe withdrawl symptoms...crying and emotionalness and such.  I had such a bad reaction following knee surgery I was on crutches for weeks and I am still attending physical therapy to walk without a limp.

I have had 2 panic attacks in one year, so I've seen a significant change in my life! No sleeping problems, weight loss the first 6 months, but now stable for the past year.  I exercise regularly which helps. Nausea the first 2 weeks.  I feel great and have no side effects for the past 11 months.

In September of 2007, I went through a rough time and after being diagnosed with PTSD, and two NEARLY successfull suicide attempts, I was put on celexa. The first few days I was Groggy but after a week, I felt wonderful. I was able to be myself again. Lately I have been suffering some of the same symptoms again even though I have not only taken the medication religiously, but also increased from 20 to 40 mg daily. I am seriously considering a new medication. 
Depression	LotusFlower, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/21/2009 6:04:18 AM	I was prescribed Celexa to deal with depression and some pretty bad bouts of anxiety I've been dealing with over the past few years.  I have been on this pill for about three weeks and have seen its benefits work right off the bat for me. My family repeatedly says to me about this &quot;glow&quot; they keep seeing on my face and how I seem to look more &quot;peaceful&quot; since my Celexa therapy began. Personally, I have more energy, am able to concentrate better at work and am more chipper than I used to be in the past. I have been researching this drug right after I started taking it and read about the many different ways people react to it. I have had some sexual side effects (that would be the only drawback), but they turned out to be not as bad as I initially thought. Furthermore, this drug has also helped me with overeating secondary to the anxiety. I am not sure there is such a thing as the &quot;perfect drug&quot;, but I think Celexa comes pretty close to it. 
Depression	moonman, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Male	35-44	2/20/2009 9:36:15 AM	I started taking this drug in the summer at the lowest dosage of 10 mg.

I take 40mg a day, and it works well when I can remeber to take it on time. That is the hardest part of this med is taking it at the same time everyday. And if I miss a dose , I have some really bad reactions the next day.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Flap, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	45-54	2/11/2009 3:43:00 PM	I have had anxiety disorder for several years and Celexa has worked well for the overall and Xanax is fantastic for what I would call either panic attacks or situational stress, such as a big meeting or public speaking. Over the last year I have had severe depression; sad, crying for no reason, just unhappy almost all of the time. I have tried everything. The doctor had me on Cymbalta for the depression and the Celexa for the overall anxiety. The doctor has been migrating me from Cymbalta to Wellbutrin. I am presently on 80mg of the Celexa. I take one pill in the morning and one in the evening.  I did this because I was having severe afternoon headaches by taking all 80mgs in the AM. I still have occasional headaches though.I see a common thread in reading the reviews that insomnia is a side effect.Amen to that. I have tried Lunesta, Advil PM, Tylenol PM, Benadryl and supplementing these with Melatonin and it is like I have taken nothing at all for sleep. I have mornings where I can't get up and I have to sleep in because of the insomnia. Anyone have any ideas? I am so glad that my depression has receeded but the insomnia will kill me if the depression doesn't.
Depression	Jamie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/11/2009 1:44:07 PM	I have been taking it for 4 months now.

The first day I was shaky (hadn't been on medication for 4 years, which could be the reason). I expressed my concern for horrible side effects and was given 10MG to start. Shaky and a little sick the first day, but the next couple days were fine! I get a little tired, but it could be all the energy, and everything i have been able to do! I haven't felt like myself in years, and i'm finally back to normal! Very happy with the results so far!

He has grown 3 inches taller and has gained 100 lbs.  He is bipolar, and has the strength of a giant.  It is like he is on steroids, but he is happy all the time.  Celexa took him off those roller-coaster swings of high and low.  His manic-highs are now episodes of extreme physical work.  He is very methodical, no longer gets angry and throws his tools 300 feet.  And he is no longer depressed!

My eyes had a glazed dilated look (I didn't look like me!), and i didn't care about anything.  I wouldn't call being zoned out a cure for depression.  Stopped taking it and still feel zoned.  Can't imagine coming off this stuff after taking it for an extended period of time.  Scary.  Look for a drug-free way to resolve your issues first.

It took about 3 weeks to fully kick in but I definitely noticed a strong difference in my overall mood. When I do feel depressed now (rarely) it seems to be a bit more intense than before I began celexa, then again It's the middle of winter in Maine so who wouldn't be violently depressed. I highly suggest trying this drug if you are severely depressed, it saved my life.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	better, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	5	4	Female	35-44	2/2/2009 1:17:34 PM	Dr. presribed this drug to offset the side effects of the nonsmoking drug I was on for 1 1/2 weeks.  That medicine created anxiety attacks and panic attacks that rendered me anxiety ridden and depressed.  Celexa has helped me tremendously, I'm now able to drive short distances with no attacks.  Dr said to take before bed (up to 30 mg). I sleep for about 4 hours then awake for a short time.  Feel tired but otherwise MUCH IMPROVED.  Sex drive is impaired, but is ok with me for the time being.

I will be starting this weekend when Lexapro runs out (financial reasons).  I had a major life transition a few months ago and anxiety is taking me on some trips I'd rather not travel.

Depression	RaymondOKC, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Male	25-34	2/1/2009 11:20:55 AM	After taking Celexa for just a couple of weeks, my wife and I both noticed a change in my behavior for the better.  I was less stressed, didn't contemplate negative thoughts as often, and was overall a more &quot;happy&quot; person.  I quote happy because it has always been my belief that depression is cause by actual occurrences in life, and the only way to truly cure yourself of depressive thoughts is to face the things that are difficult to face and &quot;take care of them&quot; thoroughly.  I feel that the drug simply makes things &quot;easier to deal with&quot; than it actually makes you happy or less depressed.  However, after nearly 3 months of drug therapy, I crashed very hard.  No suicidal thoughts, but I was ready to quit my job and divorce my wife even though we have three small children.  This episode didn't last even 24 hours, but it was one of the worst I had experience in my life.  This drug also made me extremely tired.  I simply could not get enough sleep almost as if I were a teenager once again.  After my &quot;crash&quot;, I went off of the drug completely cold turkey.  During the first week being off of the drug, I felt almost drunk or high with a fuzzy state of mental being and a constant woozy feeling in my head.  During the second week, I suffered what I will call &quot;brain zaps&quot;, nothing painful but once every 1-2 minutes I would get a quick &quot;unbalanced&quot; feeling in my head that would last no more than a second.  It is now early in my third week of being off of the drug, and the brain zaps are waning, but my feeling of lack of good sleep is still very persistent.

Depression	suga, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	1/29/2009 5:34:28 PM	 I was put on Celexa after gaining too much weight on Remeron. I took it the first night and woke up 5 hours later severely sick. Vomiting, chest pain, dizzy, nauseous and wacky thoughts. It's been 2 days (I only took the medicine once) and I still feel out of sorts, sick and shaky. If you are sensitive to medication i do not recommend Celexa. This has been a miserable couple of days.

Though not perfect I have found over the past ten years for this to work the best. I just tried Lexapro for 10 months and had a horrible experience but now back on Celexa and doing great. Everyone responds different to any given medication. 
Depression	IDK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/26/2009 6:30:51 PM	The only negative that I have noticed is that if I dont take them for about a week because of not having money to get prescription, I have an overwhelming mood attack, ie: crying uncontrollably, angre, very irritable, very tired and worn out. Otherwise, this drug has been wonderful.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		3	3	3			1/21/2009 6:25:36 AM	I started taking celexa 20mg in July 2008 for anxiety. It worked well at first. when I first started taking it I had some side effects like headache dizzy no sex drive at all. Then in January started feeling anxiety coming back again and doctor put me up to 30mg it made me cry all the time I have not been able to sleep much. I called the doctor and she put me on another med and I made the conclusion that I do not want to be on meds I am going to try to just change my diet and excersise and take vitamins and see if that helps me 
Depression	Ang, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	1/20/2009 11:34:12 PM	Had severe chronic depression, and started taking Celexa.  Felt a little dizzy on first two days, but then much more calm after two weeks.  I hadn't felt like &quot;me&quot; in over 3 years; it was great!  Took Celexa for 4 years and VERY gradually reduced dosage with doctor's supervision, and now I am depression- and Celexa-free.
Depression	smokysteph, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/19/2009 8:42:28 PM	I have struggled with depression for over 20 years and I can honestly say that Celexa is the most effective antidepressant I have tried (and I have tried just about all of them).  I feel good and happy and well adjusted but not manic or hyper, and the side affects are nonexistent.  I take it with Xanax to help with the anxiety component of depression and Celexa has by far been the most effective antidepressant for me.  It also comes in generic form (citalopram) so it is less expensive.

I've also tried Zoloft, but i did not like the way it made me feel. At all. Celexa works amazing. And i love it because i hardly notice the &quot;drop&quot; in the evening. I would highly recommend this drug, it works GREAT!

First 2 weeks was rough with night sweats and restless sleep, but my mood was great so I couldn't stop. Then it balanced out and I'm a changed person. If you give it a chance and don't panic, it works.

At first, I had tingles in my head and I felt sick, horrible sexual side affects, depression. Then after about two-three weeks, I felt more amazing than I ever had, I was motivated, never tired, happy, it was great. Then I went through a suicidal phase...and now I am very irritable, and tired 24/7. It's had it's up's and downs..I do feel careless and less worry some though.

But I am faithful to taking it and need to address this issue with my doctor.

I'm having bad headaches. Overall, I've been very satisfied with Celexa. Depression and anxiety gone!! :)

I'm going this week to be switched to something else.

There were 3 separate times that I felt faint and like I had to sit down because I knew that I could blackout. I have this weird muscle crampness in my right arm that is annoying the heck of me and that doesn't really allow me to sleep that much and all this is from me having taken one pill(which was a few days ago).

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	12/23/2008 9:32:45 AM	i was started on this medication due to my anxiety, which was a huge trigger for my depression. i noticed a change within the first week, and since then it has stayed the same. no more crazy yelling and anger episodes, or crying over every little thing that upsets me in some way. my libido hasnt really changed much, and as far as my appetite i found the only change is that i dont feel full as quickly, not much of a weight change though. ive been on this med for over a year now and im thinking of reducing the dosage and slowly weening off of it. the reason why is that although there is no anger issues, there is no happiness either. at least not in a normal persons percpective. i feel very blah and dont find happiness like i used to, just a feeling of contentment. im hoping i will be able to find a normal range of emossions even if its only with a lower dosage and not completly being off the med.

Side effects...increased appetite, weight gain, unable to be moved or stressed, constant calm with no extreme feelings or saddness. Cannon cry. Went through lose in death without major upset. Reduces grief totally. Loss of sexual libido, relaxed to nap and care less.  Celexa truth -- To take a pill is to sigh in relief of anxiety.

At first I felt great; happy, talking to strangers in line to get coffee, overall feeling of having &quot;the cloud&quot; lifted. However, not knowing if it was just a placebo effect, I also had trouble getting to sleep and reaching orgasm, which can lead to more anger and frustration. It upsets my stomach and I don't want to eat! Just in the past couple of days I was having feelings of inadequacy and feeling overwhelmed. As far as that goes, it could well be from me getting ready to menstruate! Ladies, please don't forget about that!! My pms symptoms can start as early as 2 wks BEFORE my cycle!!

I exercised 5-6 times per weeks and still gained 15 pounds.
Depression	cg, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/7/2008 7:55:26 PM	I have been using Celexa for about 7 years.  I feel much happier in general, and it has completely changed my life.  I wish I had begun taking it earlier in life.  I am currently on 40mg, but have been noticing lately that this may need to be increased as I am also experiencing many menopausal symptons.   I have experienced a decrease in my sex drive, but that is also quite possible a menopausal symptom, since I didn't really notice it the first two years I took the Celexa.  I definitely recommend this drug to those of you sufereing from moderate deprssion, at least.

It also seems to help with my anxiety. It's like I get the start of an anxiety attack in my head, but I no longer get the physical symptoms of the attack and then everything eventually subsides. However, I am feeling a little bit &quot;slow.&quot; Also, a bit of nausea and loss of appetite.

Before on the medication, I was tired, irritable, and a bum to be around.  The first week, I was completely opposite. I was 100% happy go lucky all of the time. The second week, I was even worse than before I began the meds.  The third week, it finally balanced out and I was back to being myself and I have been happily for seven months. It a great med!

It's helped in the fact that I still have highs and lows. But I'm still having impulse issues and still hear voices. They are like arguments between two people. It's anoying. I used to have grand delusional impulses (see fight club) LOL I now just use that f----d up images in writting or art. I guess I really am crazy as they think I am. The celexa helps me realize reality. I still have all these thoughts and dreams but I realize they are mostly implossible fixations on my overactive imagination!!! HAHAHA What joy it is to know that you are crazy.

I still experience drops in mental functioning and issues with sensory filters, as well as general anxiety and strong depression and lack of energy. During the first weeks, I experienced slight nausea, headaches, and tingling in my arms and face, which was not that bad. Each increase of dose was terrible and temporarily worsened for a few days the  symptoms I already had including heightened anxiety, shakiness, insomnia, sensory overload, falling, mental drops in functioning, and fear. I am glad however, that I took this medicine since it has helped with anxiety.

I have more energy and it is easier for me to wake up in the morning and get going.  I have more self-esteem and self-confidence, and I am less upset about things, and certainly far from anger.  It is easier for me to be loving, patient, and understanding, and now, I am a better listener.  Life is doable, and I am more content.

Part of my problem was having too much time on my hands, and not wanting to do anything due to depression. While taking this med I couldn't get out of bed due to extreme lethargy, yet not being able to sleep, nauseau, shakiness.  I quit today, and still I'm feeling pretty foggy... I wish I'd read these reviews before I started!

Depression	coach's wife, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/14/2008 2:54:38 PM	After first trying Lexapro and having a positive experience with that drug, I asked my doctor for a switch to Celexa because it has a generic version which is drastically cheaper! He agreed that Celexa is very similar (chemically speaking) to Lexapro, and agreed to the switch. Like others who have posted reviews of Celexa, I feel that I have a little less energy than usual, I tire more easily, and my appetite has decreased. These are mild side effects and I do not forsee them causing me to stop taking Celexa. I enjoy the fact that I've lost weight, as it definitely makes me feel good to have people comment on how thin I look! As far as my sex drive, there has been a decrease on my part, but my husband and I did not have sex very often before I started this drug, so it really hasn't been as issue. Overall, I feel much more at ease with life in general. I recommend this drug to others who are dealing with depression.

When it wasn't covered by my insurance, I switched to Celexa (citalopram). Worked well for me, but made me feel like a &quot;drone&quot; sometimes - almost too leveled out. Also completely lost sex drive. Decided that I wanted to stop meds in preparation for another pregnancy and also b/c I really don't want to be on them. I stopped cold turkey (after taking 40 mg) and it is STUPID! Do not do it! I would suggest tapering off for sure. I have had migraines, shakiness, tingling hands, dizziness, insomnia and anxiety attacks. WAY worse symptoms than before I started. I have started taking half my dose now after 2 weeks of hell, and I'm hoping to gradually taper off.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/13/2008 11:38:27 AM	I was diagnosed with post-partum depression about 2 years ago. I have tried so many other anti-depressants, zoloft, Paxil, Wellbutrin and none of them really helped get me back to my normal self. Finally after adding Celexa 20mg to my Wellbutrin 450mg I am starting to feel like the person I was beofore I had my daughter.  I makes me not sleep so well, so I take it in the morning when I get up.  I don't have many complaints except for not being able to have an orgasm during sex.  Which is a big problem.  But so far this is the only thing that has seemed to help.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	AD, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/13/2008 9:00:37 AM	I have been taking Celexa 20mg. for 3 months.  I have suffered with serious anxiety issues since my childhood. The last few years I've had financial problems and extended family problems.  After giving birth, I suffered from severe anxiety, horrific dreams, and even worse panic attacks than I did previously.  I had the opposite of &quot;baby blues,&quot; because I didn't want to put my baby down even to have a meal.  I lost 20 lbs. due to depression.  Celexa has really helped with evening out my feelings and moods.  The biggest problem is I don't sleep well at night.  I take it before bedtime.  Sex life is a little better, because I feel better about myself.  Hope this helps someone out there.

I tried twice to stop taking the medication, because I thought I would be fine without it. Of course that was not such a good idea, because my symtoms got worse, and I had to continue taking the medication. I will never take myself off the medication again, and it is hard for me to admit that I may have to be on celexa for the rest of my life. I do have a lot of side effects such as yawning, drowsiness, rapid heart beat at times and loss of appetite etc. Taking celexa makes me much more calm and I am able to think clearer.

I love that I don't get panic attacks, but it makes me very sleepy.  Its hard for me to have a set time to take it because I work 7p to 730a 3 nights a week.  I'm on 10mg.  I have lost 10 lbs, which is nice.  I don't feel as hungry.  Sometimes I get stomach pain from it, but goes away within an hr.  I was on paxil but stopped because of the nightmares and insomnia.  Overall it works great.  I can finally sleep again!!!!!  Take before sleeping, works better that way.

She had no other problems and a normal life.  She was liked by everyone and give of herself to all.  She committed suicide while on this drug!!!  She was not eating, which drasticaly reduced her protein level, causing this drug to become toxic.  I believe with all my heart, ANYONE taking these kinds of drugs MUST tell their medical health providers EVERY LITTLE THING which is not normal for you!!!!  I know she would be here today, if her medical professionals were aware of her suicidal thoughts.  SPEAK UP and stick around....there are many who will miss you terribly!!

I had previously tried cymbalta and lexapro, and both worked ok for a little while, but their effectiveness eventually wore off. I also take this with an anxiety medication to help me control my &quot;episodes&quot;.  The only thing that I don't like about this medication is that it makes me really drowzy, but overall it works wonders!

It does help with my panic attacks and I do feel much happier overall, however the side effects are getting in the way too much.  I am extremely sleepy at work during the day, I have gained 9 pounds in 3 months, I still have the sex drive but it's very difficult to have an orgasm.  I was hoping the side effects would go away but they haven't.  It's time to change.

I started on 10mg and bumped myself up to 15mg a day.  I have never been a person who ever wanted or accepted these types of drugs, but let me tell you this little pill helps me.  I never had much of a sex drive so I don't notice that as a side affect and I have always taken something to help go to sleep at night so that isn't bothering me either.  I began this medicine because my eye would not stop twitching and bumped up the dosage because it started up again. I have noticed I don't have the inner turmoil anymore and I am just more relaxed in my own skin.  I feel like myself only better!

I have been on paxil, zoloft, lexapro, and seroquel. I also suffer from frequent panic attacks. I no longer take celexa, or anything else. I still get depressed but....i no longer want to kill myself. Anti-depressents don't do what they say they are supposed to do...they just make the situation worse.

Depression	bluefontguy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	10/25/2008 1:41:59 AM	I just wanted to say that everything you read about the difficulties of Celexa withdrawal is true.  My doctor didn't believe it, but I'd read a lot online, and it was absolutely true.  I slowly weened myself off the medication for several months, and still, I got the odd jolting sensations, and otherwise felt very strange for a good several months.  Honestly, I don't think I felt completely normal for a good six months.  I think the drug helped me, but coming off of it was not fun. And honesty, anyone who thinks they're going to stop using it cold turkey is nuts.  Just do what people tell you, slowly ease off of it over a period of months, not weeks, and it will be weird, but eventually you'll be fine.
Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	10/24/2008 3:45:11 PM	I have gained 7 lbs since starting drug with no change in diet or excercise.
Depression	Comic Book Girl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/24/2008 2:09:17 AM	This isn't a fly-by-night drug to treat depression. I have been on this tiny pill for a few years and I am so much better if I take it properly. Who cares if you gain 10 lbs? It is all about GETTING BETTER and that's the only reason to take and CONTINUE taking this medicine. If gaining a few pounds is the main thing you're worried about, you really have no major problems to medicate. I was clinically diagnosed with depression about 7 full years ago and I see a much better difference in my life while on this medication. I do not drink or even take Tylenol for minor pain; I was very scared about being on a &quot;pill.&quot; If you are depressed, seriously depressed, don't hesitate on getting all the help you can get NOW. If you're reading this, that means you believe that something out there can help. Guess what? There is.

Depression	miserable08, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	10/22/2008 2:11:52 AM	I have been on this medication for about 3 weeks now and I can no longer stand the side affects. I am on the generic version citalapram. I first was taking the generic version of Zoloft for about 4 months until I ended in the Psychriatric hospital for attmepting suicide. My doctor switched the medication to citalapram at that time and I have experienced the worst side effects, extreme hot flashes through out the day and night, nauseated during the night (severe feeling of vomiting), loss of appetite, food cravings for fast food, lost of interest in exercising ( I use to exercise 5 days per week), difficulty waking up in the morning for work, insomnia (unable to sleep), vivid dreams, nightmares, talking in my sleep (never use to do this before), anxious while at work, lost of interest in my career, depression has increased, and weight gain. Time to change medication and doctor because this is ridiculous. I rather just continue Therapy than take medication. About 4 years ago I had depression really bad and I never had to take medication, only Therapy, Therapy helped me a whole lot. My believes is medications is so overated, Therapy is the answer for me.  I am not happy with my current life on this medication. Good luck to all of you who swear by this medication, as for me I will be taking the Cognitive Behavioral approach to recovery for my depression,anxiety, and panic disorder.
Depression	Suy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	35-44	10/21/2008 4:18:20 PM	I've had (undiagnosed) chronic depression as an ongoing background for years. Then last year I landed in a terrible work environment and chose to leave it, in a way that ended rather traumatically. I went to consulting and the shrink freaked out saying I am so depressed I must go on meds now. I was hardly sleeping every night. I went to my M.D. who was also enthusiastic about the treatment. &quot;You will still be yourself&quot;, he said. He chose Celexa and put me on a very low dose (10 mg).Well, I bought a month's worth and took it... for six days. Yes, the pain and self-immolation inside my mind were numbed. BUT The last thing I can say is that I was myself. I was definitely NOT.Where to begin?- I am a morning person, off and running as soon as the alarm goes and sometimes a bit before that on most days; suddenly I would roll around in bed unable to switch my mind on for an hour.- My sexual appetite is quite healthy and wide-ranging. Overnight it was simply gone. I had never felt anything like it.- Perhaps worst of all: I am a researcher. I use my brain for a living. I write research articles. But suddenly, by brain became a fuzzball. I could not think for one minute straight. Not because I had other stuff on my mind; because it became a fuzzball.This thing seems to work for other people, maybe they are less sensitive to drugs in general. I know I am, and with all the pain, anger and depression I prefer to be myself than the numb slob I became when on this thing.The good thing about stopping after such a short while is that the &quot;chill-off&quot; period was much shorter. Yet, 3 days after getting off Celexa I had a day of worse depression than I had ever felt. But that was it.Since then I exercise on a daily basis, put a lot of effort into my research, and try to move my life back on track. It will never be easy - but believing that &quot;you can take a pill and it will be better&quot; is in my view no different than becoming a drug addict.

Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	10/20/2008 7:57:41 PM	I have been on this medication for about 2 months now. My panic attacks are less frequent but I don't sleep through the night at all. I have nightmares and they are very vivid. And the worst is my sex drive is nil which is causing a problem with me and my husband. So I don't know if the side affects are worth it because I still have panic attacks about twice a week.

When i take it i feel out of body, like im not myself. I have OCD and Aspagers. My OCD isnt very noticable now.But my aspagers is in full bloom. I am very smart but since I have taken Celexa i have trouble remembering things. I am very dissatisfied with this drug but i must take it. If i dont then i become very irritable and aggresive.

I dont feel medicated, have increased sex drive, have maintained my weight, and have had a drastic improvement in my OCD and phobia in just 3 months.  As far as my background I have always maintained a healthy lifestyle as far as exercise and diet goes and I feel that that has helped in conjunction with the Celexa.    
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	10/15/2008 3:34:58 PM	I have been on Celexa for going on 2 months now following some very stressful times.  The medication seems to do what it's supposed to do with regards to how I feel.  I am more positive, worry less, and feel like my happy go lucky self again.  Downside is I have been experiencing some side effects that I hope go away.  I have gained weight, but that could also be due to stress levels, and I have noticed it's difficult for me to have an orgasm.  My boyfriend seems to be patient and understanding so that's a plus, but it is bothersome for me.  I would say the benefits are worth the side effects though.

I feel a lot more relaxed, no more highs and lows, things don't seem to bother me as easily. People around me say that they have noticed a difference and I am much easier to get along with. I love this medication, it took me a long time to talk to a doctor about my depression because I was embarrassed, and he was a godsend in prescribing this. The only bad side effect that I have noticed is I have very vivid dreams, and have trouble sleeping, and I have been told that I actively talk in my sleep all night... Anyone else been told that? 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	10/11/2008 9:56:23 PM	This drug gave me very bad side effects.  I had been on it a few months, at which point I insisted my doctor take me off it (I also changed doctors).  The withdrawal symptoms have given me the worst mental health issues I have ever had.  My doctor says I just have to wait until it is out of my system.  This drug was horrible while I was on it, and worse when I went off it.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	kat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	10/8/2008 2:22:25 PM	I tried to quit smoking and had another experience with panic &amp; anxiety attacks.  Went to my family dr. who put me on Celexa.  Have had prozac in past with no side effects. Questioned why Celexa,   was told this is better for anxiety. Was on Celexa for 12 days and everyday I became increasingly sicker. Told my doctor and was told these were side effects. Went to a different doc &amp; therapist and both told me I had Serotonin syndrome.(can be fatal)  BE CAREFUL of this drug. My Symptoms were: Increased anxiety, hot flash that started at my lower abdomin and went up to my chin, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure(never had high blood pressure b/4), severe nausea, loss of appetite(couldn't even look at food.(lost 12 lbs in 2 weeks) muscle spasms, couldn't sleep and when tried to sleep the slightest noise made me jump out of my skin. Low grade fever 99.7, massive headache. By day 12 extreme dizziness and couldn't stand up due to weakness and balance loss. It took my body 8 days after stopping Celexa to return to almost normal. After this experience I will try to make it through anxiety without any meds. *Please Note I have learned a lesson from this experience if you have been diagnoised with anxiety or panic disorder I feel we are labeled by some of the  medical profession.  So any complaints or symptoms you experience might not be taken as serious as someone who has not been diagnoised with these disorders.    Please if you feel something isn't right with what's going on in your body listen to yourself and get a second opinion.

Other	mesuba, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	10/4/2008 5:30:28 PM	I have GAD and mild depression.  I took Celexa for over a year.  It was very helpful for treating both diseases.  My main issue with the drug were the side effects: restless leg syndrome, insomnia for hours after taking drug and hypersomnia around 8 hours after taking it.  I also noticed that it made me very fidgety, my feet would always be twitching and I could never just sit still.  The fidgeting did not bother me, I'd often not notice it because the movement itself made me feel good (lessened the anxiousness).  The RLS was horrific, I could not sleep at night!  I tried taking it in the morning, but by 6pm I couldn't possibly keep myself awake, so I tried taking it before bed, but even if I was extremely fatigued, taking the med would make me become wide awake and I'd lay in bed for hours trying to fall asleep.  Someone mentioned taking it at lunch which I never tried, but might have been the solution.  Also, if I'd skip more than 2 doses, I would become so depressed to the point of feeling suicidal, which IS NOT ME!  I also gained close to 30lbs while on this med, sometimes gaining 5lbs in one week when my dose was increased.  I also had a lot of muscle fatigue and stiffness.  All in all, if you need it, it works well, I just couldn't take the SE anymore!

I had been taking it for about 4 years and I just found out that I have a side effect that occurs frequently amongst men 20-30 years of age. I could not ejaculate while on this medicine. Other than that reason I would suggest someone to take it just be careful with watching out for the side effects. That side effect almost cost me my relationship because she thought that I didn't enjoy it.

I feel like a different person since I started taking this drug. I don't have panic attacks when I leave the house anymore, and my counting (OCD - I'm a numbers girl &amp; used to count everything!) stopped within weeks of starting on this drug.    I've found that it's best to take it around noon, if you take it before bed you may not be able to sleep, and taken too early in the morning you may be sleepy all day. Noon works great for me! I sleep well at night, have energy in the morning and just don't feel run-down all day anymore.   I have had some side effects, but I kinda love those too. I got Loss of Appetite and Dry Mouth, luckily enough. I have some serious weight to lose (about 90 pounds,) and now I have less of an appetite and drink about three times as much water as I used to. I lost 12 pounds the first month on this drug! So no complaints here.
Depression	KymmLisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/30/2008 10:12:15 PM	My doctor started me on 10mg and I took that for 2 weeks, I noticed nothing.  In fact things got worse.  My anxiety got so bad I had to start taking Ativan to stop the internal jitters.  She just increased the dose to 20mg today, so I'm hoping for the best.  I also take 60mg of Celebrex and 150mg of Deseryl.  I can almost handle the depression, but this anxiety is destroying me.  I can't stand this feeling of not wanting to move, or go anywhere. My depression and anxiety both cause me to isolate from people.  My family is worried sick.  I hope the increase in dosage helps. I need to rejoin life!

I went to my doctor and she perscribed me Celexa and it has worked really well for me.  It took a good 6 weeks to get it into my system.  I can now go places by myself without the fear of having an anxiety attack.  I take 20 mg except for the week before my period I go up to 30 mg because I have a little anxiety the week before I start my period then I just go right back to 20 mg.  The only side effect that I have noticed which is not really bad but I have a little bit more forgetfulness now, but it really does work.  I also know that prayer and a close relationship with GOD works.  Thanks

So far so good. My Dr told me to take it before bed but that was keeping me up all night, so I started taking it in the late afternoon and I sleep way better now. The sexual side effects did bother me for the first 2 months or so but now I don't have an issue. My hubby is very thankful for that. I was thinking of asking Dr to up my dose to 30 or 40mg because on occassion I still have some anxiety and I think the higher dose will help.

I am very happy with it.

Panic Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	9/7/2008 7:20:16 PM	This medication has been very effective in controlling my anxiety and panic attacks at the 20 mg level, but some of the side effects I have been having will have me asking my doctor what my other options are.  The increased sleepiness is annoying, but the significant negative effect it has had on my sex drive is causing my husband and I big problems.
Depression	jmacjmac, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	9/3/2008 6:12:15 PM	I have been on celexa for about 3 months now. I was on 10mg and in the first week I noticed a differance. However, after about a month, it was not working good anymore. So i got on 20mg. I have been taking 20mg for 2 months and some days it seems to work and other days I just want to lay on my couch and do nothing! I get so tired when i take it in the morning and can't fall a sleep in the afternoon. I thought that this side effect would go away, but maybe not.
Depression	Beverly, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	65-74	9/3/2008 2:51:31 PM	I've been on Celexa for two months and it has really helped my depression. I do have sleepless nights and hadn't thought of it possibly being related to Celexa until reading other reviews. I'm having severe anxiety; which is the reason for coming to this great site.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	9/1/2008 12:23:11 PM	I  began taking Celexa about 3 months ago, and it has definitely helped.  My life just turned upside down, I left a good job for a bad job, took a cut in pay, family driving me crazy, feelings of not being good enough.  I am a single mom, work full time and attend school. The stress of it all was causing awful painc attacks.  I finally went to my Dr, and it was almost embarrassing.  At first I was sick to my stomach and couldn't really eat anything without wanting to vomit.  Dizzy, tired, all the time.  I decided to only take 1/2 a pill for a few weeks, then gradually to the whole pill.  Now I am adjusted.  I did stop taking it suddenly, thinking I was pregnant, but I do not recommend doing that!  I have been all emotional, and its like the side effects of coming off are worse than when I began to take it.  Its probably why I thought I was prego.  In all, I didn't think it would make a difference, but it has.  If you are unsure like I was, trust me, it helps.  Everyone around me can feel the difference as well.

I thought it might of been something else but my doctor advised me to go off the celexa for a week and the headaches stopped. For some reason it worked great all up until now?
Depression	coloradogirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/25/2008 10:26:50 AM	I have been on this drug for 4 years and have been satisfied overall. I do have some weight gain I cannot take off no matter what, and also my sexual desire is next to nothing which my husband dislikes. I take it at night because it does make me tired during the day and I often take a sleep aid to sleep through the night. Nothing  too major just a Tylenol PM but the sleeping is a factor since I have a 2 year-old. I'd look for something else but don't have time to bother with it at this point.

I never knew I was truly depressed until in my late 20's my mother told me that she no longer enjoyed our conversations because I was always such a &quot;downer&quot;.  My mother and I are very close and I decided right then and there to do something about it.  Zoloft and Prozac did nothing.  Effexor made me extremely sick to my stomach.  Was on Paxil for quite a while until I met my husband and wanted him to know that my lack of sex drive was not related to him. Wellbutrin put me in such a fog I walked around like a zombie, could not control my extremities and felt like my head was floating above my body.  Along came Lexapro and I was saved!!  Something finally worked well with my body chemistry(an my mother's as well) and didn't cause me strange side effects!!  Being that my insurance did not cover it, my doctor put me on Celexa (Lexapro's cousin) and I have never looked back.  I do not &quot;hide out&quot; or avoid social situations as much as I used to.  I laugh and love to make people laugh.  People that I confide in about taking an antidepresant can not believe that I actually NEED this.  That is how much this has helped me.  Lastly, the only side effect I get is if I forget to take it for a few days I will cry at the drop of a hat.  I will feel like crying over ANYTHING when I skip a dose/doses.  It is then I know I am off my routine... but no other side effects.  Hope this helps someone else.
Depression		4	5	4			8/22/2008 8:14:00 AM	I have been on Celexa for about 5 years now. The only time I've ever had a problem was when I have missed doses or stopped taking it all-together. One or two missed doses doesn't affect me but any more than that and I notice a big difference in my mood. While on this medication my anger, weepiness, and aggression are all relieved. I recommend it to anyone experiencing these feelings, however, if you also suffer from depression it shouldn't be your only method of treatment. Also, as with any medication, you should take it exactly as prescribed and try not to miss a dose or just stop taking it without consulting your physician.

Has anyone else had this effect?  I've only been on it for 6 weeks, and want very much for it to work for me.  I feel a bit tired, but have not done as much 'crying' lately, which is an important sign for me.

I know it has to take a lot of time to work.  I have been tired throughout the day but at night I can not sleep.  My mind is really busy being on this medication.  My doctor told me to take it in the mornings.  I may have to switch to taking it at night before bed. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		3	1	3			8/15/2008 8:47:47 PM	I have all the side effects. I am really sick to my stomach and dizzy, I am very tired and I yawn a lot. I can't sleep at night.

For some quirky reason or another, I then decided to stop taking Celexa. NEVER, NEVER STOP TAKING THIS MEDICATION WITHOUT MEDICAL CONTROL!!!!!! After less than a week after I abruptly stopped taking this med, I tried killing myself.  I am now on different mental health care medications, and doing well ... scared the living daylights out of me!  I am sure Celexa would have continued to work well for me, had I not been such an idiot ... Oh yes, for a man to have sexual disfunction as a side effect is a real mind blowing trip ... 
Depression	sjean, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	7/30/2008 12:55:17 PM	After a few months of being on Zoloft (and dealing with side effects that should have forced me to get off of it much sooner than I did), I saw my doctor and switched to Celexa.  It has worked so much better for me...no more racing thoughts, I rarely have anxiety attacks, and I don't get into such deep &quot;valleys&quot; anymore.  I didn't take it for a few days when I ran out of pills while on vacation...very bad thing.  I felt like I was going absolutely crazy.  But right away when I started up again everything was back to normal, even the first day I took it.  Every day isn't perfect, but it has allowed me to function in my daily life and I no longer feel completely stuck and unable to deal with problems, big or small. I am so grateful for what this treatment has done for me, my life, and my family!

I had no side effects that I noticed, but I didn't notice a decrease in my depressive symptoms, either. I felt like I was taking nothing.
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/24/2008 2:56:06 AM	Celexa really didn't work for me, though I think my reactions were pretty atypical. I started having intense mood swings after a couple of days. I would be nonstop talking and moving and excited one hour and then hide in my room and sob an hour later. My dreams became so vivid and horrifying that it was difficult to distinguish them from reality. I also started becoming agoraphobic and cut myself a few times. Personally I would not recommend it to anyone, but I do know that I had pretty uncommon side effects.

Dr. gave me Lexapro thinking it would help my insomnia (NO, made me WIRED) then gave me Celexa (Made me YAWN and feel out of it, and I saw things around me like I was looking through some sort of filter, kind of blurry/distorted in a wierd way). I stayed on for 3 months, and am now off. Just sticking to my insomnia meds now-sonata at the moment.

This medication takes care of it and then some. I've not had any weight gain while taking this medication (on top of being obese to begin with). I highly recommend Celexa.

However, I tried Wellbutrin for two months before that, and it was horrible. My anxiety and depression are now under control with Celexa. I still have the ability to feel all of my natural emotions, but in times of upset, I can better control them, so as to not overreact. My husband and I fight less often, and I'm enjoying life more. 
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/15/2008 10:43:24 AM	I was prescribed Celexa after losing 14 pounds for treatment of IBS which caused increased anxiety and social phobias (my average weight for the past 20 years had been about 120, so that was a significant weight loss for me).  The generic form of this medication has truly given me my life back.  If my doctor had not prescribed this med &amp; I had not been receptive to trying a SSRI for my problems I would still be struggling.  I am so very thankful for the relief this drug has provided!  I do notice that fatigue is a side effect, but it is certainly not as debilitating as dealing with the IBS &amp; anxiety it was causing!
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/14/2008 8:41:28 PM	I have IBS and I would freak out over every time I would have to travel and go places because I didn't know where or when I could use the bathroom again. I practically lived on anti-diaharea meds. Ever since I started taking this, I don't worry about where the bathroom is and I rarely taking anti-diaharea  meds anymore. THANK GOD FOR THIS MEDICINE. I NOW HAVE MY LIFE BACK. PRAISE JESUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/12/2008 6:43:42 PM	I've been on this drug for 8 years for OCD/anxiety/depression.  It has worked very well for me.  Sometimes I still have some OCD symptoms, but overall I am very much improved.  I did have a decline in my ability to orgasm, but Wellbutrin has taken care of this issue.  My worst complaint is that I have VERY vivid dreams that sometimes leave me tired and make me feel as if I haven't slept.  My second complaint is that I have an increased startle reflex- which can be rather aggitating.  I take this (40 mg) with Wellbutrin (300 mg) and Trazadone (150 mg) and the combination has really changed my life.  I can leave the house, I don't count, I can touch things, I can also drink the water.  I am not drugged up or feel disconnected- I have previously had bad luck with Prozac and Paxil.  I hope this is helpful!

Too soon to say if it will help but I am waking up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep.  Pulse rate is up and can't sleep.  My dr also gave me Xanax which I am reluctant to use because it is habit forming but I guess I might have to at this point.  
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	7/3/2008 12:45:43 AM	I was taking this medication for 6-7 years for depression.  Instantly, major weight gain occurred and would not come off.  Tired all the time; over time had to increase dosage and then decrease when I got too anxious.  If forgot to take it for a day, sickness (stomach upset, nervousness) would occur.  When I finally decided I did not need it anymore (with my doctor's knowledge); I gradually decreased the dosage.  BE AWARE: There is no going &quot;cold turkey&quot; with this medicine; you will become very physically sick if you do.  I gradually cut back 5-10 mg about every three-five months as I could; then at the lowest dose, went every other day until the medication was finished.  The highest I was at was 60 mg.  It took about 2 years to get off the medication.  It was very tough; there was stomach upset; worry; diarhea; cold sweats; felt like my head was &quot;foggy&quot;.  But it can be done.  If you feel you need to get off this medicine; talk to your doctor and give yourself A LOT of time (gradually; at least a year).  I really think your body and mind become dependent on it.  If I could do it, anyone can.  Best of Luck; be blessed.

Depression	lulu, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	13-18	6/29/2008 12:45:13 AM	been taking it about 4-5 months. started out with 10 mg that worked for about 3 wks after that i found myself ranting on and on abuut everything late at night, staying up and and cleaning things that were already clean just finding stuff to keep me busy because i couldnt sleep. it gave me such a burst of energy and when i would finally fall asleep i didnt want to get up (knida hard to do with a 3 yr old and a dog). my doc increased it to 20 mg and put me on trazodone which another andidepressant. taking the celexa with trazodone helps me get to sleep but it takes about 1-2 hrs to work and it makes my eyes look all red like im really high. overall the celexa helps with my depression but i have found at time that get light headed and am exhausted. but i have so many things going on that its hard. i try to suck it up and do my daily activities even if i cant. i recently had surgery and the bed rest sucked!!!! it made me feel depressed cause i couldnt live up to all my obligations

Depression	jan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/21/2008 4:04:24 AM	I've been on citalopram for 17 months, 20 mgs.  My doc upped the dose to 40 mgs when my Mom passed away in Sept 2007.  I found that on 40 mgs, I was numb.  I couldn't even cry for my Mom.  Felt like a sneeze that just wouldn't come out.  I took myself back down to 20 mgs., and I actually felt something, no more numbness, and I could cry.  Been on 20 mgs ever since and I feel pretty good.  Just had another major death in the family and I am ok on 20 mgs.  I do miss the vivid dreams that I had when I was on 40 mgs!!!

It has been a miracle drug as far as controling my uncontrollable crying at stupid commercials, constant worrying about my children getting hurt etc. and sadness as each of them went away to college.  However recently I have been experiencing shear exhaustion, decreased hearat rate, and a &quot;blip&quot; in a recent ekg. My doc wants me to take a stress test to make sure everything is okay before changing my medicine. I also take 25 mg of Atenelol for high blood pressure/symptoms of mitral valve prolapse.  The extreme tiredness is becoming debilitating. I have grand ideas of things I need to do in my mind but my body is too tire.

Immediately sexually dysfunctional, had headaches and a was unable to focus.  Spend the money on your health and switch to Lexapro, the best antidepressant/anxiety on the market.  You will not become sexually dysfunctional, you will just have to work at it a little longer.  Relieves anxiety, ocd, and extremely helpful with social phobias.

Although as soon as the attack would start within a few seconds it was over. I have been on here for a year now, and just wondering if the dr. needs to up my dosage. I take 40mg. a day. Sometimes I feel like I can not sit still, and feel jittery. Just wondering.

Depression	Pat pizzolato, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/29/2008 11:19:07 AM	I had the worst hullicinations, it was like I had taken LSD or some other drug, I called my Dr right away and went to him, he said I was second patient that had same reaction. I am on zoloft as all insurance will pay for and is working ok, I will never take this other drug again.
Depression	sleepy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	5/29/2008 9:12:50 AM	I have been on Celexa for about 2 months now.  At first when on 20mg it was working great.  I had so much energy (lost about 6 pounds in 2 weeks) and I was enjoying play time with my children again. It was great, but about 2-3 weeks after that the engery went down.  I then moved up to 40mg and I still have not felt that burst of energy again.  I am very tired all day.  I don't sleep that great at night, but I do have two children under 4 years old and that may be the problem, but I truly believe in that first 3 weeks it was a miricle drug, now I am having second thoughts.  My anger, depression and short temper has improved greatly but I am just so tired all the time.  I can sleep 10 hours through the night and then get up for only about 4 hours then take a 3 hour nap.  That is just not exeptable for a mother of two.  I will continue on this med until my doctor has any other suggestions.

I am weening of Effexor and onto the 40 mg Celexa.  I have never had a reaction to shrimp or fish but, I did last night.  I itched something awful and some today.  I don't know if the med. had anything to do with it but, just wanted to let you know.  So far I am doing okay with it though.
Depression	Tommy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	5/24/2008 9:47:38 AM	I took this drug for depression &amp; anxiety at a 20 mg/day dosage.  Had to take it at night as it made me sleepy &amp; detached.  On it's own I found it ineffective &amp; actually counter-productive.  I switched to Wellbutrin at a 200mg/day dosage in the daytime &amp; found it to be much better for my condition but still not an ideal situation.  I changed again to taking the Wellbutrin daytime &amp; 10mg/day of Celexa in the evening &amp; finally got good results.  I was happier &amp; enjoyed going places &amp; meeting new people.  Hope it lasts.

It has calmed my nightmares, and I have only had one panic attack this week! (That is down from probably two or more a day depending on the situations in the day, so yeah for me!) I do feel a little more tired than I would like; it feels as though I could lie down and take a nap all the time, but that's a better feeling than the alternative! I take this along with Klonopin (0.5 mg twice a day). These two drugs have given me my life back! School, work, friends, bring it on! I can take on the world!

I've been on celexa at 30mg for 4 years now. I found that the first 6 months - 2 years the medication worked well. After a while the effectiveness of the medication wore off, and even the higher dose wouldn't effect me. Because of my age, the doctors said it was likely because of hormonal changes. Overall, I do feel it somewhat worked, but i wouldnt reccomend it for children with depression.

Panic Disorder	michael42, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	5/8/2008 3:17:41 PM	DO NOT take this medication.  I tried it for 4 days and had severe headaches, nose bleeds, and no sleep.  The effects that Celexa has is far worse than any panic attack that I have experienced.  I would not recommend this medication to my worst enemy.  I have had a hard time concentrating, remembering things, and just making it through the day.  My doctor is changing it to something else today.  God, I hope it works better than this crap did.  AVOID CELEXA AT ALL COST

I have anxiety and panic attacks which makes it hard for me to do daily activies with friends and family. My Doctor just raised my daily dose to 30mg, and will be getting up to 40mg daily. I haven't felt any of the side effects. I hope it works out well!  Good luck to all of you! and thanks for the reviews
Panic Disorder	hellokicia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/5/2008 12:49:40 PM	I went on this drug for Panic Disorder and general anxiety.  It did a good job tamping down on panic attacks.  I still had them, but they occured less often, and when they did they were way shorter and way less severe. They also seemed to decrease in frequency over time. The only side effect I noticed a lot was trouble orgasming (which I never had issues with before!)  I ended up going off it for that reason only.  I am now trying Wellbutrin, which solved the sexual side effect.  We'll see how the Panic attacks go on this one.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	5/2/2008 7:41:46 PM	I've been on Celexa for far longer than I should have. It is VERY inexpensive as a generic. Then had trouble getting it switched which only happened today. I'm glad this helps so many people. For me the fatigue has been ruining my life. Right now I have full blown signs of depression again while on 40mg of Celexa. I will be trying Lexapro now (fingers crossed!). Best of luck to all.

I am told that I'm not the same when I'm on the medication. I used to have more energy, and since taking this drug I have gained 30 pounds.

It has leveled me out and I am much more able to deal with everyday stress.  I do feel that it has made me &quot;care&quot; much less than in the past.  I have been on Celexa for 2+ years now and have gained about 30 pounds - but not sure if that is a result of the medication.  I have tried to go off the medication - but get very achy and tingly with a strong headache on my left side.

New doc doesn't like using Lorazepam as a maintenance drug and wanted to stop using it and increase Celexa. I began having side effects from Celexa @ 40mg dose (increase from 20mg Celexa and 2 mg Lorazepam daily). For me, Celexa @ 40 mg created too many side effects that were uncomfortable (migraines, blurred vision, muscle tremors, etc). Celexa @ 20-30 mg works well for me in conjunction wtih Lorazapam.

I take it at night, it helps me sleep (before it would be close to an hour before my mind would shut up for me to fall asleep).  I use to snap at my husband and family, not meaning too, but the celexa rid me of that.  Only side effect is that is slows me down, which sucks since I'm already always tired.  Got off of it once on my own and it caused headaches, realized how much it was helping me so I got back on.  It works for me!!  p.s. my mom takes it too and she did a total 360 for the good!!

Depression		4	5	4			4/12/2008 4:42:46 PM	Took 20 mg at night, and felt better almost immediately (suffer from seasonal depression).  Stupidly, I tried to stop taking the drug cold turkey and was absolutely miserable--shaky, headaches, spaced out, no appetite, twitchy, and tired all the time but I couldn't sleep.  Getting off the drug now but I am making certain to taper.

Now I am able to get my life back together. NO side effect. Only the first 2 weeks while the medicine was adjusting in my system my libido was low...now I crave sex like never before, and sex is amazing! Feels better than before.Maybe the fact that I am more active, taking long walks, eating healthy, has helped me skip all those side effects that everyone talks about.If you start on this medication I recommend to ALL to adjust your lifestyle as well. Go outside! Enjoy the sun! Exercise..Help yourself, don't expect the medicine to do it all for you. You need to put something for yourself too!This medicine was the tool for me to get my life going again. I am back to who I was 15 years ago.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	4/11/2008 11:41:57 AM	First time use at 10mg, a low dose &amp; took late afternoon..by late evening my head seemed as if it were going to explode, tried sleeping but head continued to throb in pain. By 7am my head was still in pain &amp; the entire day left me totally unable to do any normal activities. Luckily I didn't have to go to a job! All day I struggled with head pain, eyes feeling heavy/tired/sensitive to light &amp; totally 'hung-over' feeling. By late afternoon I could feel the drug existence lessening in my system &amp; gradually allowing me to move about! Phew..one tiny pill with a huge effect! I never had any anti-dep pills effect me that way &amp; I have taken many[Effexor,Lexapro,Elavil,Neurontin,Cymbalta,We llbutrin,etc]. Whew~ I am still feeling after effects of this low dose of Celexa...could it possibly be that I accepted the Generic version of this drug that offered me such negative results? I am not even going to 'attempt' to try another dose due to the extreme head pain &amp; lethargy! Calling my Dr. Good luck to those who continue to struggle toward resolve!

I got such a 'head rush' it was scary. I could not sleep and had more of an anxious feeling than ever. The next day I was disoriented. I do not see this as an antianxiety drug.
Depression	lndsymj, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	4/7/2008 12:46:31 PM	I've never been on anti-deps before so my doctor started me at 10mg for 1 month.  I'm now at 20mg and have noticed a difference in my mood.  Side effects for me are usually stomach acid, feeling hotter than usual, shakiness, yawning and now nightmares--very scary, life-like nightmares.  I've also noticed that I crave fast food and sour patch kids like never before.  Overall the side effects aren't so bad that I want to change, but they do concern me.  
Depression	Rose, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	4/6/2008 12:25:53 PM	I started taking Celexa in the AM because it has a tendency to keep me up at night. I have taken it for about 5 years after trying Paxil and Zoloft both of which had horrible side effects (paxil left me with dry heaves) and zoloft left me too spacey. I would recommend backing off on caffeine if you are taking Celexa in the AM because it gives you a boost and you may feel spacey if you have caffeine along with it. As with any drug, side effects seems worse at first but all of mine on Celexa went away after consistently taking it. I was nauseated at first but after my body got used to the AM routine it went away. Consistency with taking Celexa at the same time every day is what will help you notice a big differece. Like I said, PM doses keep me awake still, but it had no effect on weight, skin, sex drive, or ability to process thought (its actually helped me in all of those areas!)

Depression	rdkitty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/4/2008 5:21:22 PM	My husband takes it and it works veryy well. Before he had mood swings a lot and could not handle stress, now the mood swings are very minimal and he can stay calm when a stressful moment comes at him. We can always tell if he forgot to take his medication in the morning!
Depression	Fred, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	4/3/2008 10:09:05 PM	Celexa was one of the worst experiences of my life.  I only took it twice and I felt 10 times as sick as before I started.  My closest experience to Celexa was being too high on LSD in the 70's.

Depression	SP123, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	4/2/2008 2:23:23 PM	I only gave 3 stars b/c I'm still unsure with how I'm feeling. I have been taking Celexa for about 3 months and at first I felt great aside from all of the usual side effects. Now I'm exhausted all the time although I don't have many outrageous mood swings anymore I still feel irritated and stressed. The exhaustion is what gets to me most. It is hard for me to wake up in the morning and get up to get ready for work. I have already quit one job because I didn't have the energy level for it.   I'm hoping things get better for me. This is the 4th medicine I've tried and I'm only 21 years old.

Started at 20 mg but felt &quot;out of control&quot; and anxious so my doctor reduced it.  It takes the edge off of everyday life/problems and really helps me sleep.  Once I switched from AM to PM dose all was well.

I would say it helped some.  I have to take ativan everyday, because the panic attacks aren't controlled yet.  Starting celexa was horrible.  Increased anxiety, shaking, no appetite, nauseous, insomnia, loss of sex drive.

Depression	Carol, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	3/27/2008 6:15:20 PM	I have tried this medication twice in 3 months and it has been a complete disaster for me.My first experience my Doctor started me off on 20mg.I felt like climbing the walls!Severe headaches and room spinning around.My Doctor decided that he had started me off on to high of a dose and wanted to try another anti-depressant,not an SSRI-horrible experience did not sleep for three days,so back to Celexa 10mg.First 2 days seemed OK then anxiety levels and panic attacks started increasing and progressively got worse.I had to take Lorazepam to get through the day.My insomnia never improved on the Celaxa,in fact I seemed to get higher at night and could not sleep more than 4 hours.Now my Doctor says to stop taking it and continue on the Lorazepam as needed.I am particularly sensetive to this type of medication so if you have high anxiety and stress in your life do not expect this product to help.
Depression	rickmike3, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/25/2008 12:09:07 PM	Before Celexa I was taking Zoloft 100 mg per day for six years. Worked well up until about six months ago when I started to become extremely depressed/suicidal. Doctor recommended Celexa. Have been on 40 mg per day for about six weeks now and have never felt better in my entire life! Only side effect is very vivid and strange dreams, but absolutely no other side effects. I highly urge anybody who is depressed in any way, shape, or form to use this drug, because it is an absolute life saver!

While I'm not at an effective dosage level yet, I wanted to tell anyone who's starting this to try taking it on the PM instead of AM which is the way I started.  It left me feeling kind of spacey &amp; tired all day but when I switched to taking it at dinner time almost all of those effects have gone.  I still have high expectations for this medication when I get up to an effective dosage level &amp; have been on it a while longer.

Depression	lulu, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	2	3	1	Female	13-18	3/10/2008 11:49:40 PM	started off with 10 mg but shortly after it stopped working. my doc increased it to 20 and told me that i could start taking it at night (i wasnt sure if it would interact with my topamax). its supposed to help me sleep but it doesnt. i still find it hard to fall asleep and when i do i dont want to get up which is kinda hard with a 3 yr old nephew and as many doctor appts as i have. also in the last few days i have noticed myself being realy nauseas and a bit unbalanced almost as if i black out in the time it takes to blink my eyes and when i open them im bracing myself on the wall so i dont fall. kinda starting to scare me. i would recommend watching yourself and being VERY carefull when taking this medicine.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/10/2008 9:45:58 PM	I was very hesitant about taking anti depressants because I didn't want to feel like a zombie or something. But I found myself not being able to get out of bed to go to work or do anything. I started taking citalopram and after a week I felt a little better but not ALOT better. My dr increased my dosage twice. I feel much better. I don't cry at the drop of a hat for no particular reason anymore. My thoughts seem more clear and not jumbled. My stressors are still there but this medication has helped me to handle them differently and not snap at people. That is the biggest difference that I've noticed. I like this however I don't want to stay on this for a long period of time. On my next dr visit I am going to discuss weaning off of this. If you are hesitant about trying this anti depressant, don't be. Talk with your dr

Lost control of emotions with love of my life. Started on 20mg. It has only been a week but can feel a powerful difference. No more alcohol cravings-Trust me-Do Not Drink while on this stuff. It's crazy. Cures anxiety. Depression lifts but ambition decreases. Strange sexual side affects. Definite decrease in sex drive, but get sudden unexpected sexual urges. Gives you peace, but you quit caring about people quite as much. I became introspective and clear headed. I think other people are hilarious now. They seem like a joke to me. Before I felt the joke was on me. Never believed in medication, but you can feel this stuff reorganize your brain.Does not alleviate heartbreak though. Wish I started it sooner.

It was originally prescribed to help with my insomnia. It took over 2 wks for me to notice any change.  But two stress-inducing situations in one week brought about no major reactions.  Before taking this medication, I would have been really uptight and spun up.  I like the way it evens out my moods. Friends and co-workers have noticed a positive change. I do feel groggy in the mornings but I sleep well. No other serious side-effects so far.

I switched do to medical insurance. I take this medicine for several different reasons. I have obsessive compulsive disorder, posttramatic stress syndrome, and depression.

I had been an emotional wreck dealing with my husbands deployment overseas and this has helped me so much.

My experience has been truly awesome, it stopped my compulsion to &quot;comfort eating&quot;, and the weight came off like water. I haven't had any outbursts other than what has truly made me mad!! Everyday living is normal, my family noticed a change within 2 weeks. They tell me I'm a joy to be around now. It has improved my relationship with my family, we can now just sit a talk. No more yelling, crying, and stomping around. Wish I had this when I was in High School!!  Life would have been a lot easier for all of us.

On Celexa I feel like I'm still human and still can have feelings. It really helps to keep a lid on things when I usually would have outbursts. I no longer have suicidal thoughts, I haven't gained any weight, sexual side affects are a minimal, and I couldn't be happier.

I wasn't crying all the time and things that were causing me extreme stress seemed managable. I did have sleep problems and sometimes I would feel hyper and anxious. I gradually cut myself off of them, and within two months was worse than ever. I suffered irregular heartbeat for 2 weeks which is a rare side effect. Did not affect my sexual drive much. My doctor has switched me to Paxil, and I think Celexa was better, but I'm worried about the heart irregularity. I suffer from SAD as well as a history of depression, but sometimes I can be off of drugs in the summer.

Then after two years it just seemed to stop working, I hadn't had to take a Xanex with Celexa for about 2 years then all of a sudden it's a couple times a week. I'm slowly going off this to change to a different SSRI and the withdrawls are terrible, I'm nausea, and dizzy and faint like, room spinning kinda thing. Can't wait to try Zoloft which is what doc's putting me on.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	1/21/2008 5:00:21 AM	I find that I have better control over my emotions. Along with exercise, positive thinking and taking care of my spiritual self feel positive about my future. After reading some of the comments posted, I am comforted by the fact that my physican started me off slow and is not over medicating me. It seems that some people are thrown on 40mg and no one is really monitoring their condition. Depression is not suppose to last for years and it seems that some people need to deal with the life issues  that continue to contribute to their depression. To those who have been depressed for a long time, it might be time to get a second opinion or an alternative diagnois. God Bless and good health.

Of course I was scared.  I finally decided to try somethin because I was tired of crying all the time and getting upset about every stupid little thing. Boy do I wish that I would have gotten on this 30 yrs. ago!  My whole outlook on everything has changed.  I handle situations differently, I react totally different, and the happy person that I have always been inside is now really shining outward.  My hyperness has gone away and I feel genuinly happy.  I am so grateful for this medicine.

I've gained about 20 pounds, but the medicine works so well for the depression, I'm not even upset about it.  The only problem I have is my period has gotten very irregular.  I'm not sure if this is because of the drug or because I turned 40 this summer.
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	35-44	1/15/2008 11:59:09 PM	Worked OK for the first 2 years of treatment, effectiveness wore off precipitously thereafter.
Depression	35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4		35-44	1/15/2008 5:57:15 PM	I have been on this medication going on 3 months now and think that it is wonderful.  Now the 1st month i was on it I was SO extremely happy- that has worn off but it is still effective for the most part.  I am only taking 20 mg.  It definitely helps you to deal with the small stuff, whereas before the small stuff seemed like big stuff.  So far so good.  I have had some headaces though and the first month or two could not sleep at night- that has subsided a bit.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/14/2008 5:01:29 PM	I started off taking 20mg, and saw no real change so I increased to 40mg after about a month. Really helped turn those self-critical negative voices off in my head so I could concentrate on teaching myself to think differently. Took it at night but I wouldn't be able to sleep so I take it now in the mornings, no more issues with insomnia. Have very minor sexual side effects, however have had weight gain, about 15 pounds within the past year. I'm hoping to cut back on the dosage and eliminate taking it completely. Keep your fingers crossed!
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	1/14/2008 1:42:59 PM	I was depressed for awhile, and I finally decided to confront it and see my doctor about it, and she immediately put me on this.  For the first week I was nauseous right after taking it and had no appetite.  Once it started to kick in about 2 weeks later, I started to feel better, and now almost 2 months later I finally feel like myself again.  I don't feel overly good, I still have bad days, but I'm no longer obsessing over what I eat, I have energy to do things, I am focused in class, and I am enjoying myself when I should be.  Another plus, no decreased sex drive, which I was afraid of as I'd heard anti-depressants can do that.

Started taking Lexapro and wellbutrin, lexapro caused weight gain, wellbutrin made me tired-bottom out.  Switched to 20mg of celexa and wellbutrin xl 300mg. Worked fantastic, had nausea from celexa, yawned alot,  but felt better as soon as began treatment, crying stopped within a couple days.  Lose weight the longer im on it. nausea gone, yawn ocassionally.  still take wewllbutrin xl 300 in the a.m. and now take 40 mg celexa at night.  I have never been better.would probably be dead if not for the meds.  Xanax also kicks in the help

I had a lot of nasea (a common side effect) initially, but it went away.  I took it right before bed to avoid the nasea.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	1/2/2008 5:50:26 PM	Quite helpful for my very mild depression and anxiety. I have gained weight (5 lbs), and my libido went way down after about 5 weeks of use. Currently on 10mg buspar to combat sexual side effects, which may help a little (hard to say). If I skip two doses I notice that I am more irritable, needy, and mood-swingy.  
Panic Disorder	Ana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	1/2/2008 5:35:45 PM	I have not been on the medication long enough to say for sure whether or not it has completely worked for me yet.  But adjusting to it has been extremely difficult. I am also on 60mg of Buspar. I have been taking it for 1 1/2 years, it worked well until recently. For the first few weeks on 10mg  I had a major increase in anxiety and anxiety attacks, had tremors, was very shakey, could not relax, trouble sleeping, and a decrease in sexual desire (well who wouldn't when you feel like this).  I was completely miserable and having to work full-time.  It took about 5 1/2 weeks before I felt okay. Without the help of Xanax to calm me down I would never have made it through it. I would have to take .25mg of Xanax with the Celexa every morning and on really bad days a few times throughout the day.  I highly recommend having Xanax or another drug similar on hand incase you have intense side effects. I have been told that I am more sensitive to it than others. I felt good for two weeks and then started having a lot of anxiety again. Was advised to increase my dose to 20mg of Celexa.  I still had the same side effects with the dose increase but not to the same extreme. It has been two weeks and I am not feeling completely myself yet.

Depression	cybercin23, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/30/2007 9:04:32 AM	I have been dealing with the loss of my little sister, then my aunt, and a couple of close friends. This has really helped me with coping better. I was on prescription, Zoloft but it only made my panic attacks worsen. Sence I've been on this new medication, I am still having the panic attacks. Not as greatly as before, but I feel that the things that were slowing me down and making me feel so empty and sad inside are getting better. It has helped me so much and I am greatful that my doctor had agreed to change the medication I was on and take my panic attacks and depression more seriously then she had before.

It works great, although I still get panic attacks occasionally.  I used to get them twice a week, reduced to one every 2 or 3 months (I'll take it!).  If I miss a dose or two I start getting &quot;Brain Zaps&quot; which are quite disconcerting and uncomfortable.  That side effect is known to happen with other SSRIs too.  Also, I've gained about 50 pounds in the last 6 months since I started taking Celexa and Klonopin.  I was a skinny guy before but now I'm trying to lose a gut--big change.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/26/2007 9:55:35 PM	I switched from Lexapro to Celexa due to Lexapro's weight gain. I love the weight loss side effect of Celexa, but it doesn't seem to be equalizing my moods as well as Lexapro did. I can definitely tell if I miss a dose. I'm home for the holiday break and I don't know if it's post-Christmas letdown, boredom, or what, but I just feel blue tonight. I don't recall feeling this way on Lexapro. I also feel more paranoid (is so and so mad at me?) on Celexa, another feeling that was masked on Lexapro. But the weight gain was not healthy.

Panic Disorder	gsf, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/21/2007 5:16:29 AM	I was originally prescrobed Celexa to deal with omgoimg severe panic attacks related to the consequences of being diagnosed with MS. It was not effective for that. I was also on Dexedrine for ADHd and immediately began having issues with that drug, which I had  responded ver well to and had almost immediately made vast improvements in my life. I CAN NOT IMAGINE  HOW  MUCH WORSE i WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT IT AT THAT TIME. Almost immediately after starting Celexa, I began  having touble sleeeping, it was wrecking havoc on the dexedrine impact, making it not only innefective at the prescribed dose but causing me to have to use more than usuala s my symptoms worsened and I would be awake for days.It was helpful whenI was in a depressive state, however I was also experiencing manic episodes before I started it, but had increased symptoms after taking it.The depresion was so bad however that I did kept taking it.The most frustrating apart was that  doctors all blamed the dexedrine, which actually  helped to manage the adverse side effects of the celexa. They all began to thinkI was addicted to the dexedrine because of the contraindaction with celexa (iformation that I found  on the webafter two years of this).Overall- it was a horrible experience and did nothing to help  the panic which was the  biggest issue. It was however useful for the depression, unfortunately with  major adverse side effects.

Celexa (40 mg) has helped the first two conditions immensely. I am no longer suicidal, and I can't imagine facing the day without Celexa. I didn't believe in medication for depression until now, and I haven't felt so stable in years. My side effects were minimal and included some fatigue, a minor hand tremor, dizziness, and loss of appetite. Unlike Prozac,  Celexa is not an approved medication for bulimia, so I'm seeking alternative help for my eating disorder. However, I credit Celexa with curbing my depression and anxiety. I'm very happy.

I found this drug to be horrible. I used Celexa to transition off of Paxil(also horrible) At first, Celexa was great. Then I starting getting really dizzy, lightheaded, and fainting.  I lost all motivation and drive. I can't remember anything and it's like I'm in a fog. I became more depressed than I ever had before. I cry all the time and do nothing all day. Celexa does not work for me and I am highly unimpressed.

Tried prozac first-had sexual side effects. Have been taking 40 mg celexa 5 years. Those around me noticed a difference immediately without knowing I began taking medication.  Tried &quot;weaning&quot; myself off without telling my wife-to no avail, she knew within 3 days.  I am concerned about long term effects.

Depression	Calm inside, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/13/2007 3:40:47 PM	I had gotten depressed and suicidal because of family problems with my children.  It had gotten very bad with crying nonstop and even thinking about how to commit suicide.  I knew I needed help.  The celexa has been very helpful with the suicidal thoughts and the depression, the only things that bother me is I find it very hard to cry and like one of the other reviews I read, I feel numb.  I've only gained 2 pounds and this I believe is from the holiday eating as I've been on the med since September 2007 and just gained the weight in December. Sometimes I feel disconnected from things in life, but then I wonder if feeling normal finally instead of always crying and feeling suicidal and depressed is just taking some getting used to.  I really never had calmness like I do now on the celexa.  I've been on paxil and gained 50 pounds, on wellbutrin and lost weight but never on anything that has helped me this much. I hope I don't have to take this for the rest of my life, but if I do it's better than the life I was living.

It fluctuates from anxiety, to depression, to flu-like/auto-immune symptoms, and so I'm being treated with Celexa. It's made subtle differences, but I'm still hopeless as all get out.Not to mention that I've been extremely sensitive to any dose change in this drug, up, down (turns into sideways, back-ways, makes me disoriented and irritable)

I think clearly, No panic attacks, more social, relaxed, no trouble sleeping, more interactive and a sense of well being. If you're in a fog, take something else.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	12/10/2007 10:16:57 AM	I have tried many antidepressants and unfortunately over the years of use, I have gained an enormous amount of weight. I am currently taking a combination of dexadrine and celexa and am still noticing a steady increase in weight gain. The drug itself works well in masking depression symptoms, however I notice that I feel like I am in a constant fog and could care less about my surrounding environment. I often wonder if it is better to fight the depression naturally and maintain a healthy weight, or remain on this drug and continue to gain weight, feel like I am in a fog and not remember a darn thing from one day to the next. It seems like it is a catch 22.

Depression	Cathy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/6/2007 8:52:59 PM	I've been on Celexa for 5 years.  It has worked wonders on my depression.  I did gain 30 lbs in the first 90 days of use.  My personality is calm.  Where I used to cry all the time, now I don't cry at all.  The &quot;edge&quot; is off my moods, whether it be high or low.  All in all, very satisfied with this medication to handle my depression.

It helps me feel like myself on a good day, every day.  I am less impulsive, more reflective, but also less likely to laugh spontaneously.  I have gained weight on anti-depressant SSRI's in general and  my sexual drive is very low.I am also taking Wellbutrin (150 mg) in the AM.  It offsets the tiredness and helps with my sex drive, just a little.

I liked Celexa it cause it made me feel a lot calmer and happier with life but if I'm overweight I'm going to be unhappy anyways. It's a 'darned if you do &amp; darned if you don't' with Celexa.

I have experienced some nausea and diarrhea, but I hope that will clear up with continued use. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/3/2007 8:13:10 PM	It was hard for me to admit I had mild depression and even more difficult for me to begin taking medication for it. I always felt like I should be able to control how I feel. I never felt suicidal, just blah and negative, so I admitted I could feel better and gave in to taking the medication and went to 3 counseling sessions, mainly to accept my depression. It has been a very positive experience for me and the medication has been working. I take 40mg 1x/day and I feel more positive about my life and my interactions with people. I had mild side effects for the first month, dry mouth, yawning, decreased sexual desire, but they went away. I now believe depression is an inbalance of chemicals in the brain because after taking Celexa, my thinking changed. I tried to change it on my own to be more positive, but it always felt like something was blocking me. I have now realized and accepted I have mild depression, and that is what was blocking me and I don't have the power to control it, and it's ok to get help with it.

My energy level is up. My crying spells for no reason stopped. I am happier and I don't have as much stress.  I suffered from depression for years not knowing what it was and had a suicide attempt back in 1996.  I am aware of it's symptoms now and can usually get myself back on track without medications.  This time was different.  The gym didn't help, talking to people didn't help.  I am so glad that I had the courage to call my doctor and say I need help.  I hope I don't need to be on medication for ever, but I am a much better wife and mother on it right now.

I was always trying to get one step ahead so I'd have time to sit and enjoy my two young children and family more, and was feeling like I could never get to that point.  I now feel great!!  Each day I feel blessed that I've been given this opprotunity to be the best I can be to my kids and husband before it may have been too late.  The only side effect has truly been the sexual effect.  Hoping that gets better in time.

Started at 20 mgs. and was fine.  Almost a year later i am just starting 40mgs after my Mom passed away, my hubby lost his job, and my Mom in law passed away.  Think it is helping me cope, but I wonder if it is kind of making me numb?  Anyone else feel like that?

Without it, life was unbearable.  At a higher dose, the side effects were unbearable.  The 40mg dose each morning is just right with no noticeable side effects.

I started taking 20mg a day about a month ago and feel great. No more nighmares and my drinking is almost down to nothing. The side affects are and were very mild. Works great for me.

I started on 2o mgs and did well for a year.  Then I had some major family trauma and major life changes, and started on 40mgs.  I've been on 40 for a week, and I feel good.  My Doc keeps a close eye on me and together we will work to lessen the dose and maybe even stop it altogether.  I am very happy with my results of therapy with Celexa.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/27/2007 1:37:48 PM	I had severe depression and was reliving childhood abuse trauma through nightmares. I tried taking Celexa in the morning but it made me too sleepy to function. I take it at night and sleep well without any nightmares. It has returned me to a sense of normalcy--not feeling high like some other drugs tried previously. I've had no side effects and I'm generally sensitive to medications.

Made me very dizzy and unable to focus at first, but after lowering the dosage I was able to gain control of that. I have worked well at this lower dose, but it might be time to up it after a year. I had tried Paxil and Prozac previously, and this has by far been the best.  
Depression	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/24/2007 10:42:41 PM	While probably not for everyone, Celexa has made a wonderful difference in my ability to deal with severe depressive episodes (as well as normal day-to-day events) in my life.  It has no side effects such as weight gain.  I have not attempted to stop taking it, however, I went through a terrible withdrawal from Paxil a few years ago. Hopefully, Celexa won't produce similar results.I'd recommend trying it to see if it works for you.  If not, try another remedy.

I have panic disorder and it made it so much worse the first two weeks I was on meds.  I now have to take one Ativan with Celexa in the morning in order to avoid major panic feelings.  Doc says it will get better with time and higher dosage.  I have been on it two weeks today and we are increasing dosage tomorrow.  Hopefully that will make the panic feeling go away.  Also noticed crazy crazy nightmares!

I felt much better after 3 weeks but was still dealing with anxiety. The psychiatrist just raised my dose to 60mg which I have been on for about a week. I am waiting to see if it helps.

I was scared to make a change of meds,  today I am sooooo glad I did.  I feel like a new person.  If your doctor or you feel it might be time to make a change,  try this!!!

Panic Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	10/1/2007 10:26:20 AM	The only side effect has been the decrease in sexual sensation and satisfaction. Previously tried Paxil, which had the same side effect plus insomnia to boot. The sexual side effects are frustrating and I don't think anyone has a real solution for it.

However, a downfall to this may be the weight gain over time. I feel the medication causes faster weight gain than without it. It is important to get lots of exercize while on this medication.
