Abortion	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	6/2/2011 3:36:54 PM	I was given this medication to help with passing tissue from a blighted ovum. i could only take half the meds because the side effects were horrible. i felt very dizzy, lightheaded and weak. the amount of blood loss was like a super heavy period, at one point i was soaking an overnight pad in about an hour for 3-4 hours. the cramps sometimes got really bad, but thankfully i was prescribed some vicoden. the days following i was still weak and dizzy when standing up, and occasionally had an irregular heartbeat.you will need to take a few days off from work, at least i needed to.i am so thankful to my husband and family for all the support through this sad time.
Abortion	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/22/2011 3:31:35 PM	I was prescribed this medicine after finding out that I had a miscarriage just to make sure my body got everything out. I experienced slight cramping but nothing worse than you would expect with a normal period. The was heavy bleeding also but that was expected. The only bad part was the feeling I experienced after taking it. I followed the directions and took it with food but as soon as the medicine kicked in my stomach felt completely empty. Overall though it did what it was supposed to with very little side effects

Other	PCOSpatient, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/17/2010 3:22:08 PM	Had a pregnancy, no heartbeat and no natural miscarriage. Chose to terminate versus wait and see as I have PCOS and a prior premature labor with complications. Took Mifeprex 200mg oral 24hrs before, then took 800mg if IBU 20minutes before taking the 800mg of Cytotec(misoprostal) by dissolving in mouth and swallowing (used lifesaver to aid in covering gross taste and producing saliva at doctors direction). 20 minutes passed and my throat, stomach and uterus began spasm very lightly. 2hrs passed and uterine cramps began and had first gush of fluid, other spasms subsided. just shy of 24hrs on medication and regular cramping, with once in a while a big cramp. Have not needed IBU or pain meds today.
Abortion	dodson81, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/9/2010 3:05:49 PM	My doctor prescribed this to me in place of having a D&amp;C procedure. At first I was glad because the thought of going thru that again was not what I wanted. She acted as tho it would be fairly easy but with some cramping. I was only able to take two pills before I began to pass out due to the excessive amount of blood I lost. I lost so much blood that my husband rushed me to the ER where I had to have an emergency D&amp;C done. I do not recommend this to anyone at all.
Abortion	cnp102, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	19-24	2/8/2010 1:02:06 AM	Horrible medicine. After taking the medicine, I couldn't eat anything for the next 24 hour because of the strong symptoms. Makes your stomach feel like it's in knots. I wouldn't recommend this medicine to anyone.
