Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	2/28/2009 11:58:31 AM	The first week my skin cleared up well. I believe it reacted with my other acne medecine and i got sick with stomach aches, and nausea from it for about 2 weeks now. Some of my acne is also starting to come back and it does not help the red spots. It will dry out your face so use a good non-oily lotion.

So far it has been going well, though I do get very oily and have to blot my skin and touch up with poweder 2 times a day. I would recommened this to people before they even try oral drugs.

For the person with the hyperhidrosis, you shouldn't use the Hypercare with anything else.  Apply it every night until you're dry for a full day, then as needed.  I've been using it for years, and I never sweat under my arms, on my face, or even my hands any more.
Acne	Andi1665, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	9/17/2008 1:39:15 PM	I just started taking this medicationa  couple of days ago.  I am going to continue for at least a week, but since I started I have been feeling rather nauseous.  I will give it time to see if it the medication or something else.To the person with the body odor.  My niece has some of these same issues.  She used to always smell like onions.  The doctor determined that using antibacterial soap was not good for her.  It cleaned her body too good and removed all the natural bacteria on her body.  She has since used a product available from the pharmacist called &quot;hibaclens&quot; (not sure about the spelling).  She has had not problems since.  This product is expensive but it works great.

I've been to several dermotologist and no cure. One suggested botox I can't afford that with no insurance is there any help out there for this condition. It is very embarrassing to go out in public and know that you have take a bath 2-3 a day and still smell like a raw onion. Regular deodorants don't cover the smell please somebody help me.  I've tried many products claiming to help my condition over the internet nothing works

He developed a very severe rash over his entire body (including the palms of his hands and the bottoms of his feet) the only place not affected was his genitals, Thank God.. His doctor decided to refill his prescrition instead of making another appointment with his dermotologist. I quit giving this to my son and decided to seek another doctor for my children.
