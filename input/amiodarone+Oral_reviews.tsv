If you're on it, get off it.  Watch your thyroid.  This drug is highly aggressive against other organs when use is stopped.  Either way, causes lung toxicity then goes after other major organs.  This drug should not be in use.  It killed my father in four months and the suffering was horrible and completly unnecessary.  Do your homework on this med, search the internet...it's not FDA approved, endorsed by the AHA and has not had clinical trials.  It should not even be in use.  There are other arrythmia drugs to choose from that don't have the same vile effects on the rest of the body.

Had two cardi versions prior which didn't stop my afib. Dr started me on 400mg and it stopped my afib after 6 weeks. Cut down to 200mg 6 mos ago-still no afib. Didn't give a five star rating overall because I developed a thyroid problem and take synthroid for that but better than having afib! No other side effects.

Atrial Fibrillation	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	4/27/2012 12:24:35 AM	I have hypertrophic stenosis as well as atrial flutter along with atrial fib.  I was diagnosed when I was 26 years old.  I have been on every rythum drug ever made.  I have had 3 cardio-versions, 2 cardiac ablations and the MAZE procedure (open heart).  None have worked. This drug is horrible.  I am in rythum but the flutter is still with me and I go in and out of rythum constantly.  Can not sleep at night - legs and body twitching. Eye sight at night is terrible. Can not torelate heat or cold and have ben hospitalized once with pneumonia, have a nubulizer, 2 inhalers and when I have an attack my general MD puts me on amoxicillan and prednisone.  This has happened 3 times in the last 2 years.  The MD push it off as chronic bronchitus, but I know it is from the devil drug.  I have been active all my life and managed to keep my job until now.  I can't breath,  I am so tired all the time and I am using all my retirement $$ to survive.  I have applied for SS Disability but they do not recognize A-Fib as a disability.  It sure is when your work is construction and you can not walk to a job site.  My muscles are weak to the point where I sometimes can not make it up a stairway way without stopping to catch my breath. I want to just cut it out, but the last time I did in July 2011 I ended up in ICU with un-controlled A-Fib and SVT (sub-ventriclular tachacardia).  I am afraid of dying with or without it.
Atrial Fibrillation	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	55-64	4/25/2012 11:49:08 PM	this medication did help regulate my heart beat.

Atrial Fibrillation	billieann, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	4/6/2012 11:21:56 PM	My husband started taking this medicine 8 days ago-the last 3 days he has been feeling &quot;weird&quot; as he calls it.  Scared to go to sleep, afraid he will stop breathing.  Has anyone else had this problem?  WE are concerned about this.  Right now the Dr  has him taking 2 pills in the a.m. and 2 in the p.m. wondering if I should take matters in my own hand and just cut his dose in half before he suffers something more than what he has so far?  Please give me input....thanks
Atrial Fibrillation	cml1221, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		3/20/2012 8:55:27 PM	I wrote about this drug in January. I do not see my post on here anymore. I would like to warn all of you who have just started or are taking this drug. I lost my mother within 3 weeks of being bumped up from 100 mg a day to 400 mg 3 times a day. No one warned us that 17 percent of the folks that have been put on this high of dose get lung toxicity and 10 percent die. We left the hospital on Dec 2nd 2011 after they had shocked her heart back into rythem.On Dec 19th she told me she could not breath and to call an ambulance. When we got there they put her on oxygen when it got up to 100 percent use they hit a wall the only place they had left to go was a vent for her. She gave me instructions before they put her in a coma if it did not work do not leave her on it. On Dec 25th the doctor came in and told me that she would be on the vent long term and that now her kidneys and bowels were shot . At that point my family and I knew this is not what she wanted and we told them to take her off of it. If I can say anything to all of you if you are on it and they raise your dose get chest xrays and blood work at least once a week and do not let anyonre tell you different. Our world was changed in 3 weeks time and lung toxicity is the real danger just ask the doctor better yet talk with your pharmacist they will tell you what you need to know.We all know there are risks with any drug but after looking up different things about this drug and even things that are on the FDA sight I think that a skull and crossbones should be put on the label. Please be careful folks and if they raise the dose to high level beware. My mom was very careful with medication I don't know why they thought it would help her to raise it that high because all it did was kill her. The doctor could not even look me in the eye when he said she became toxic. I hope this helps to those who are concerned. And to those who lost a loved one because of it. GOD BLESS YOU and I feel your pain.

I have not experienced any side effects. I do not have a-fib as long as I take 200 mg once a day. The only time I have had a-fib was when the doctor cut the dose down to 100 or 150 mg per day. He is changing me to Multaq because I have been on this so long. I sure hope it works. I do have a slightly elevated thyroid.

Was on Multaq and it did not help with afib and made my whole body hurt. Am so afraid of the lung issues, was a smoker and have diminshed breathing capacity and worry it is going to impair my breathing more. I do have a good Cardio and has me monitored every three months. It is awesome to have your heart beat regular but the fear of other things going wrong is very real and scary.

Atrial Fibrillation	ConPro, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	12/12/2011 1:55:17 PM	I have had A-fib all my life, never symptomatic, but earlier this year was diagnosed with a congenital valve and aorta problem requiring surgery. I was on Coreg 6.25 BID for months leading up the the surgery, and my rate was always under 80 with just mild fatigue while I adjusted to the med. After surgery, I was placed on Amiodarone 200mg Twice a day. The week after discharge was great, energy, very little pain, except I developed a cough that made me see galaxies not just stars. The second week after discharge, I began to have trouble breathing, I could not complete a flight of stairs without getting short of breath, wheezing and sweating. I could not sleep, and so I called my surgeon's office and the Nurse Practitioner started prescribing an inhaler, lasix etc. I pointed out that I had checked the side effects of the amiodarone and she said 'They are long term effects' and blew me off. The inhaler sent my pulse and BP through the roof (I did not repeat). I have now stopped the amiodarone and my energy level is returning and I feel much better. If I need abeta blocker then I will use the old tried and true Carvedilol, Inderal etc. (but I guess their reps don't have short skirts).The list of side effect are scarey. The fact that they can put something like this on the market without close supervision or even warnings. If your Dr. says here, say no thanks. It is Your body, you have the right to just say NO!!!

Was on Multaq and Metoprolol,but Dr. switched me to Amiodarone. He did not warn me of the serious side affects.  I started to have constant headaches, extreme hand tremors, chest pain, and bradycardia with a pulse rate of 46 bpm.  Was tired all the time and had weird dreams.  Switched back to Multaq and the headaches, bradycardia and chest pains went away.  am feeling much better since I stopped taking it. This drug is like playing Russian Roulette with 5 out of 6 chambers loaded with bullets.  Recommend this drug only to your worst enemies. To all others: WARNING - DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!

He had been experiencing shortness of breath before the surgery, and had massive fluid retention after he was discharged. Suffered a minor heart attack less than 24 hours after returning home. Has been in hospital with severe respiratory issues, as well as fibrosis and inflammation in lungs.Because his new med lists did not include amiodarone and through a lack of communication, polmunoligist could not determine where the inflammation was coming from or what might have caused the fibrosis. Hopefully, the steroid treatment will stop any further damage to his lungs, now that doctor is aware of his prior use.

We tried to decrease it but I went back into afib.  Multaq was far worse.  I went into heart failure with that after several months and it didn't keep even keep me in sinus rhythm.  I do have regular blood tests and x-rays.  I have had many cardioversions and even 3 arterial ablations.  The only thing keeping me in sinus rhythm is amiodarone.  A good doctor will work on getting you the least amount of the drug that keeps you in sinus rhythm.  They generally start you out with higher doses but should not keep you there for long.

Since starting on this drug ten years ago, I have only had one episode of V-Fib and that was resolved by my internal defibrillator shocking me back to sinus rhythm. This is an excellent drug for people like me who really need it.My cardiologist and electrocardiophysiologist have monitored my lab work on a regular basis and I have never had any lung or liver problems with this drug. It can be a life saver.

She did not do well on it, but was basically ignored by her doctors. Her feet and ankles started swelling on Easter Sunday, 2010. She called her doctor. They said she did not need to come in (even though the warning signs say to call your doctor immediately). I think the non concern made her feel like she was just complaining and would just have to live with discomfort and sickness. By May 23, she was so sick, we went to the doctor. One lung was completely filled with fluid. (We were not at the hospital where her doctors were located.) Still no concern about this medication. Within 24 hours, she was in ICU. W/in another 24 hrs. she was moved to a hospital that could better care for her. She stayed in ICU for 4 weeks before passing away. What I actually think she had was kidney failure that showed up as fluid in her lungs. I could just shake myself for not taking a stronger position earlier on. She was so very healthy and strong until this happened. If you are taking this medicine and having problems, please see if your doctor could prescribe something else. I found out too late that there are intermediate drugs that could have been tried first.

Atrial Fibrillation	Jane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/9/2011 2:01:49 AM	My wife was put on this drug after trying multaq.  Multaq gave her severe stomach cramps and bloating and was not controlling her afib. She has had an unsucessful pulmonary ablation through the ribs on both sides.  The surgery left her with plueral effusions.  So DR. put her on 40 mg lasix twice a day and swithed her multaq to amioderone.  She passed out and hit her head on the ground . She was taken by ambulance to the hospital and very shortly after went into Vfib several times. Her blood work showed low potasium and magnesium levels which caused by the lasix(diuretic). She recovered after getting potasium and mag IV's. Her new Dr. took her off the amionderone and lasix.  She is short of breath and Dr. thinks amioderone caused it. She is doing much better now.  Her previous Dr. should have been checking her electrolytes regularly. I don't think  amioderone good drug.

The list of side effects is huge &amp; I had many of them, several very serious ones. Difficulty with coordination, muscle weakness, muscle loss (I lost 40# mostly muscle), difficulty breathing, dizziness, sensitivity to the sun, too much sun turned my skin grayish blue, and vision. My Cardiologist wanted to keep me on it so I got a second opinion which after testing was I should have been off it long ago. &amp; then changed cardiologists. (For those few patients who truly need this, stopping it can kill you, so I knew to get a second opinion &amp; welcome the additional testing)Off it 4 months now &amp; I feel better than I have on over 5 yrs. My new cardiologist has me doing strength training as well as cardio &amp; I've gained 5# back so far. They also have me gradually changing my diet more towards Vegan, replacing meat with egg whites, soy products, and protein mix. I'm also eating more fruits &amp; veggies. More info on this at Dr Dean Ornish's site http://www.ornishspectrum.com/ It's working for me.

I have previously reviewed this drug and would like to add more.  I was on Amiodarone for 8 years and the problem with the drug is not only when you are taking it but after you get off of it.  There are so many different things that go on, like rapid heartrate, hypothyroidism and many more.  The big problem is that the drug stays in your system a very long time after you stop taking it. I agree that there has to be other alternatives.  A fib is like a plague just when you think you have it  undercontrol, it comes back.  
Atrial Fibrillation	DAVID, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	55-64	4/20/2010 7:31:40 PM	MY OPINION WHICH APPLIES TO ME: This is a dangerous, very effective drug for my afib but I am afraid of it. Trial and error I found out that by CONTROLLING high blood pressure ELIMINATION of excessive dietary salt, added potassium and magnesium supplements, REDUCED my afib attacks by 90%. Also to be avoided are chronic infections such as bad teeth. I absolutely must monitor and control my blood pressure by using a BP machine. If necessary I use Isosorbide sublingual to get my blood pressure under control. I use enalapril 50 mg once a day but nothing and I mean ZERO medications that I tried are as effective as sublingual isosorbide. ADRENALINE production I discovered is a MAJOR contributor to Afib. So is sleep apnea. This disease is a hydra, with many heads and a patient has to ATTACK it from many different angles other than AMIODARONE. I will not passively sit back and let an overtaxed cardiologist write an Rx for 200 mg / BID and then proceed to kill myself. Amiodarone to me is a medication to be taken ONLY to restore sinus rythym, and then readress the &quot;hydra&quot;. I learned to recognize the pre-symptoms of my afib attacks, poor sleep HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, higher than normal pulse, sweaty palms, excessive urination, aggressive dreams and behavior (adrenaline). To me AMIODARONE is a miracle drug but I will not take it on a maintenance basis. There are too many other options open to me and I have found many of them to work splendidly. Learn your body, monitor your BP and pulse, try the alternatives that I tried, but for crying out loud just don't ASSUME that your cardiologist knows all there is to know. After all he does not have to live in your body and suffer the consequences. I hope this helps someone else.

I stayed on it about two years on a low dose.  My physician had blood drawn every 4-6 weeks to watch for liver and any other organ problems.  He sent me to eye and lung specialist also to monitor me.  I believe if you have a good physician, you can help yourself by being very active in your care and follow-up any symptom immediately.  It is a dangerous drug with many side effects and every one reacts differently.  I am the lucky one with this drug.  Fortunately I no longer need the drug.

I started having shortness of breath upon exertion, walking, step climbing, etc.,and was sent to a lung specialist.  After a number of Cat Scans, X-rays, PFT (pulmonary function test)and a lot of blood work, it was determined that I had interstitial lung disease.  Recent tests have indicated that this is clearing up somewhat and the doctormentioned that Amiodarone could have been the culprit. My cardiologist took me off this drug as soon as I was diagnosed with ILD and put me on Multaq.

My husband got pulmonary fibrosis from this drug, to make a terrible story short he passed away from pulmonary fibrosis and ARDS which this drug also causes. He had a terrible time when he was on this drug, but still NO dr told us of the side effects, this drug should not be given to anyone without a signed consent form saying that the dr has told them that this drug can cause death.

I started it in July and stopped in September due to a rash. I lost my appetite and it has messed up my Thyroid so NOW I am on thyroid meds to straighten it out. When I stopped taking amiodarone-with Dr's permission- I started vomiting and just felt awful which lasted about a week even Pepcid didnt help. And my hair is thinning out--one of the side effects of amiodarone-it started in October. Cant wait until this drug leaves my system! If I had read about it before I got on it I would have screamed NO !!!!!!!!! There are other drugs out there so ask your Dr to prescribe something else.

The potential side effects sounded so dire I elected to try to live with the AFib, taking a beta blocker to maintain heartrate.  This didn't work out for long due to shortness of breath and general lack of energy. So my cardiologist and I decided to try the amiodarone, then eventually switch to the newer Multaq.  I took 800mg per day for 4 weeks prior to having a cardioversion.  Then 400mg per day for two weeks following the cardioversion.  An EKG proved I was still in rhythm, so I was dropped to 200mg per day, which I am still taking.  I have been on amiodarone for 14 weeks now, and am still in rhythm 10 weeks since the cardioversion.  Fortunately I have been feeling great, with no side effects whatsoever.  Quite frankly, this is the best I've felt in five years, and now have the energy to have regular workouts and long walks, and have lost 20 pounds so far.  I am very happy with this medication so far.

My side effects were to numerous to mention all of them.I hope and pray they will all go away. After taking myself off of it ,since the AF returned, I feel much better. My breathing has greatly improved and many of the other issues have as well. This drug is going on my list of allergies. I NEVER WILL TAKE IT AGAIN !!! Look up the side effects it may cause and you won't either.

I just recently came off it. I cannot be sure if my symptoms of general fatigue have been related to the medicine or to the trauma and surgery my body underwent.  After two years i would expect more phiysical improvement but I feel the amiodarone has stifled my progress.  Glad to be off this risky drug.

I have experienced such things as tingling and pain in my feet, my back hurt so back I could hardly move at night.  When I would walk very far my legs ached severely.   I have been sun sensitive, sensitive to the heat and cold.   I must say though I did not have a breakthrough for almost 8 years.   Recently I had became so short of break and dog tired all of the time.  My doctor took me off of the medication and recommended an ablation, which I did about 2 weeks ago.   Still hoping that it works.   Amiodarone, as I was told by a cardiologist, is the last drug a person should be on, it is the &quot;big gun&quot; so to speak.   For a long time the good out weighed the bad for me.   Since having the ablation I can honestly say that I feel a hundred times better than before.  
Atrial Fibrillation	RIRudd, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	12/1/2009 7:39:58 AM	I developed life-threatening complications with this drug only after dose had been cut in half! Problems developed slowly, as drug is stored in body fat and takes a long time to leave body; drug had done a good job of controlling my a fib for several years; then I was seen by an MD that did ablations; I wanted to see if I was or might be a candidate for this procedure; that MD cut the dose in half; my a fib returned in 2 months ( no great surprise); but then I started to experience fatigue, muscle weakness, then started losing weight; I had to stop working; then developes intermittent fever, cough; diagnosed with bronchitis at one MD visit, with pneumonia two days later; was hospitalized (at my request!)  and 36 hours later developed resp. failure, and spent a week on vent in ICU!!  I was also throtoxic, with nodules on my thyroid;  I had several appts with MD's while the early symptoms were developing; no one questiond if Amiodarone was at fault; I could only find one reference in medical lit. on line that stated side effects might occur when dose lowered!  I am fine now; did require some short term rehab and physical therapy. Please be aware that these problems are possible even when dose lowered!  I assumed that &quot;less must be better&quot;---

It was somewhat effective only. Heart was then shocked into sinus rythym, and placed on 200mg twice a day to maintaine the sinus rythym. Experience a lot of side effects especially in the morning upon taking the 200mg of Amiodarone. Such as headache, nausea,poor balance and coordination,consipation, stomach and intestinal gas release,weak in the knees,tired, feel like I'd like to sleep, but when I lay down I can't, have problems sleeping at night as well.This is side effects that come off the top of my head, but there is more !
Atrial Fibrillation	darla, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	55-64	11/13/2009 9:08:40 AM	Amiodarone gave me multiple side effects.  Lung toxicity was tops and that effects ability to walk (not enough oxygen in blood)...I was coughing and wheezing alot, upper esophagus partly paralized that affected swallowing. Hair loss, lower part of lungs couldn't get air (Felt stiff) Also hands and feet swollen, itchy hyperpigmented spots on face and neck, loss of taste, EXTREMELY TIRED, eyes sensitive to light, loss of apetite w/constipation, Plus I don't feel it was effective that much on the atrial arrythmia  I was having. I have no idea why I was given this toxic drug and am still having symptoms.  I only pray I don't have permanent damage.

He was only on it for 5 days. Since discovering it was wrong and he should have not taken the medicine at all he has started having trouble in his joints. He cna barely walk on his left foot and his right hand and wrist is swelling and painful too. He was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis but did not have any of these problems until he was given the amiodarone that he didnt need. I think this is a very dangerous medicine. He can't even do work like he used to and he is gettig worse. Every day it's something else wrong with him. It's very sad because he shouldn't have been taking the medicine because a stupid doctor read the test wrong. Can anyone tell me about any legal consultation i can contact. DONT TAKE THIS!!!

Nose bleeds, low platlette count, tiredness, insomnia, weakness, hair loss.  Went to the doctor on Thursday and he said biopsy indicated liver disease.  He sent her home.  That evening she became inchoherent. Taken to emergency and Amonia count over 300.  Became more confused, unaware, and uncomfortable.  Body posturing, writhing in pain and could not communicate.  Stopped breathing next morning and all organs failed.  This drug is too dangerous to be on the market.  Better to die from heart failure than to go through this torture.
Atrial Fibrillation	AmioFailure, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	10/13/2009 3:48:11 PM	My husband began using this medication July of 2007.  He is followed by his primary care physician and cardiologist for years. In Feb 2009 he had a biventricular pacemaker inserted and his Amiodarone was increased from 200mg to 400 mg for one week by the electrophysiologist/md, then he went back to 200 mg.  He fell in May while teaching our grandson to ride his bike.  He hit his face on the street and his whole face was black and blue for weeks.  He started walking funny, wobbly per our grandson.  In June he fell and hit his head on the edge of our deck, he required 24 stitches in this head and has a huge scar.  In July he spent 8 days in CCU after collapsing at home, 911 had to be called.  At the end of August his Amiodarone was increased to 200 mg and 400 every other day. Since that time my husband now requires oxygen 24 hrs a day.  He was having arm and let involuntary jerking movements, terrible nose bleeds daily, upset stomach/bloating, unsteady on his feet, passing out, dizzyness, extremely tired and short of breath difficulty controling his bleedtimes/coumadin control.  He has not left the house on his own in two months, cannot drive, go out to dinner or stay up past 10.  He was well and active until about April-May when all these side effects began.None of his physicians brought up drug side effects.  I did some research and found the side effects, brought it up to the drs. and they immediately stopped this medication.  This was two weeks ago.  He is starting to improve in all areas except for the tiredness and shortness of breath.  I am hoping as more time passes that the breathing will get better.  Am planning on discussing with his pcp at next visit.  I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone!

Within days he developed shortness of breath and difficulty walking. During this time he was still in the hospital and not one healthcare professional considered that this drug might be responsible. At a follow 2 weeks after discharge his cardiologist suggested that it might be Amiodarone toxicity. He is now on oxygen full time, can hardly walk and steroids stopped working after a short time. His lungs are permanently scarred. Prior to taking this drug he had no lung problems. He is 79 yrs old. I'm not sure he'll make 80. Please get this drug off the market. It is a killer.
Atrial Fibrillation	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	9/13/2009 8:04:24 PM	If your doctor is thinking about putting you on this medicine, DON'T let him. Don't let ANYONE you love be put on this medicine.My dad was put on this medicine after receiving a pacemaker. In less than a month's time he was admitted to a hospital due to what they thought was pneumonia. He was very weak then. After 2 days in hospital, they finally put him in ICU where he went into respiratory distress.They put him on a respirator which he was on for almost 2 weeks, took it out and he was not getting enough oxygen in his blood, so they reinserted a ventilator. After a couple of days, they put a trach in him. After being on numerous antibiotics and high dose steroids, his kidneys were near failure so they started dialysis. It was not successful for a couple of days, then doctor told us he would not make it.He died July, 2009. His death certificate stated amiodarone toxicity as cause of death.

We insisted that it was the drug, Dr's disagreed.  He was put in the hospital and they treated the symptoms They would think he was ok and within 10 - 12 hours we were back in the hospital for the same symptoms.  This went on for about three weeks on and off until we insisted that he be removed from the medicine.  We have not had any problems since.

I took it for two years. I also had a AED implanted. I had approximately 4 &quot;shocks&quot; in those two years. I now have permanent lung damage (70 percent loss of CO2/O2 exchange). After the lung damage appeared I was place on another arrhythmia medication, Mexilitene. I think Amiodarone should have never been approved by the FDA.

However, this med stays in your system a long time. I hope I don't have any further problems. Than God that I am now off this med!

My platelet count dropped to 10,000, could not walk to my mailbox without stopping with shortness of breath, had URI, hyperthyroidism and lung inflammation which caused my oxygen level on room air to drop to 80%.  I would not recommend this poison to anyone without VERY close supervision by a true professional (which mine was not). I had been taking the drug for almost 6 months, and no tests were taken for possible side effects despite my complaints to my cardiologist.  It remains to be seen if my blurred vision and  lung inflammation will be a permanent problem.

Atrial Fibrillation	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	12/27/2008 4:25:26 PM	My doctor prescribed amiodarone for my afib about 3 years ago.  I was on it for 4 months.  I developed thyroid problems and have been on meds for that ever since.  While taking the amiodarone my eyes starting twitching to the point that I could hardly read or watch TV.  At night my legs and arms twitched so badly that I could hardly sleep.  My eyes still twitch occasionally and I haven't been on the drug in years.  I told my doctor that I wanted to discontinue taking this drug.  I went back on Inderal which works fairly well.  I still have had 6 bad episodes this year so far.  My new cardiologist has prescribed Sotalol.  I've read some of the comments and warnings on this drug and don't get that warm, fuzzy feeling about it.  I definitely would not recommend amiodarone to anyone.

Side effects of fatigue,cold became intolerable. It did maintain rhythm. One year ago I got off. Now have controlled AF and feel much better but have irregular pulse. Now have two more problems to deal with - take thyroid for life and beginning dry macular degeneration. I am functioning better but have added two more lifelong health problems. Is/was it worth it!!

I've been cardioverted 8 times, it never lasts more then a few days. I have tried probably every drug out there; flecinide, Rythomol, Toporal, either they didn't work or in the case of Flecinide, I didn't sleep for 3 days which is a rare side effect. I have had two Cardio Ablations, after the first I was on Aamiodarone for six months, didn't work and the possible side effects were not worth continuing.

Dr. says this is the best med for me &amp; that I'm not a candidate for ablation.  The only regular blood work I get is for pro time.  I have a history of thyroid (Graves Disease.  I am now beginning to think that this med is the reason behind my fatigue, shortness of breath (I have had echos &amp; x-rays and pulmonary functions that were &quot;clear&quot;)&amp; maybe my tinitius that started a year ago.  I'm 63 and active except when I've been stressed then have difficulty breathing (as if someone had their hands around my throat)What else can I ask my Dr to do??

I recently had Atrial Fibrillation Ablation to correct my problem and was started on this in the hospital. Prior to the procedure I was shocked twice in three months, had decreased heart function and was taking Metoprolol and Enalapril to correct 210-215 heart rate(when I would go into A-fib). The combination of medications and ablation look to get me off all meds within 6-9 months.

It takes a MRI to detect spots on the lungs.  If you have trouble breathing or shortness of breath, insist on a MRI.  The side effects are, dizziness, shortness of breath, lack of energy and others.  A friend of mine was taking this drug and was having all of the side effects and we saw him deteriorate and the DR said it was not the Amiodarone.  After a MRI was done on the head and upper chest by the Ears Nose &amp; Throat DR the spots were detected.  After examining the xrays they showed clear.

His pneumonia is resisting treatment with IV antibiotics.  After reading the other reviews posted here, I can't imagine why his cardiologist even considered using it for a patient already dealing with serious lung disease!
Atrial Fibrillation	CyndyR, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	1	Female	45-54	8/4/2008 3:57:48 PM	I am taking this Medication for 3 months and have alot of side effects such as: Chest discomfort, dizzieness, blurred vision, light headedness, upset stomach with consitpation.  Doctor stated even though all test show heart is OK must take this med for 6 months or if  fibrillation comes again would nee dto be on this med for the rest of my life.  So I continue to take this med.  I have spoken to my primary care Doctor and he also agrees with Cardio Doctor.  There must be something out there that would assit people like myself without all these side effects.  I am 53 years old and not readfy for retirment yet.  After taking this med for 3 months I am considering disability retirement since I can't function at my job with these side effects.

He is now in a rehab. hospital. And I sure hope that he will walk again, he so weak. This medicine has made him so weak. My father has only been on this drug for 5 weeks. This drug needs to be taken off the market and FAST.
Atrial Fibrillation		1	1	1			6/12/2008 3:09:26 AM	My father died 2 months ago from Amiodarone Pulmonary Toxicity (however, his cause of death was officially labeled as &quot;Interstitial Pneumonia).  He had only been on the drug for approximately 5-6 weeks, following a highly successful heart valve replacement surgery.  He had some minor pulmonary fibrosis prior to this and was 76 yrs. old.  In my opinion, his cardiologist should never have put him on the drug with the track record it has, especially because of my father's age and pre-existing condition.  The drug also killed his neighbor about 2 yrs. ago, after he'd been on it for a year.  The neighbor was suddenly struck with symptoms of breathing difficulty and died within days.  I watched my father suffer for over a month on a ventilator and was with him as he took his last breath.  It's interesting, because my dad researched just about everything to the extreme before he bought or tried it.  But, I think he had blind faith in a way, in his doctors.  I now warn everyone I know to stay away from Amiodarone and ask that they warn others.  Id like to think that maybe spreading the news of my experience may save lives, somehow...

Atrial Fibrillation	ljhca, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/25/2008 9:44:09 AM	I've had high blood pressure and suffered PVC's for over 30 years but recently developed A-Fib.  The A-Fib episodes were frequent enough for my cardiologist to be concerned and I went through all the usual testing.  I also have Aortic Stenosis, a narrowing of the aortic valve, which I have had probably most of my life and is unchanged over the last 10 years. I have been put on 200 mg Amiodarone twice a day and now I feel great with no further episode of A-Fib or PVC's.  I also feel much calmer dealing with day to day stresses.  I have been told to have regular blood tests to ensure this drug is not affecting my thyroid, liver or kidneys.  If my progress continues positively, my dosage will be reduced.  While I'm sure this drug isn't for everyone, it certainly seems to be working well for me.

It is difficult for me as a parent to give him this drug knowing all the horrible side effects, but so far it is the only drug that has helped contolled his heart rate. I have not found much research on this drug and infants, but his father and I can only hope he grows out of it.

Atrial Fibrillation	Karen Muccino, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/8/2008 2:42:56 AM	My father died from Amiodarone Pulmonary Toxicity. He was taking 200mg for 10 months. He was a retired OBGYN and neither he nor his Cardiologist thought his dry cough was a warning symptom that he was developing lung damage due to Amiodarone. The FDA suggested that Wyeth put out a stronger warning about lung damage in 2003. Wyeth did not release the updated warning until 9 months after my Father died. I just want to make as many people aware that if taking this drug, you develop a cough, have it investigated immediately. My father had a normal CT scan of the lungs just weeks before he woke up 1 day unable to breath. Amiodarone was NOT approved by the FDA for the treatment of Atrial Fibrillation. If anyone develops adverse reactions, please report to the FDA, so that they will be better informed regarding the severity/frequency of adverse reactions with this drug. Since I started writing about this, about 4 years ago, I have been notified by numerous people of their tragic stories related to losing a loved one to Amiodarone. Wyeth procrastinated putting the revised warning out until my story ran in 17 newspapers. The law is not apparently consumer friendly. The public needs to fight to change laws, that when the FDA suggests a revision to a warning, that the Pharmaceutical companies are required to get the information out to the public within a certain timeframe. It took them over a year. I feel that the only reason why they delayed publishing the new warning was fear of profit loss, as I have been informed that they made over 3 billion dollars for the use of this drug for Atrial Fibrillation. I have requested that they put out stronger warnings, and develop an appropriate means for monitoring development of adverse reactions, but have gotten no where.

I'll undergo another pulmonary vein isolation to re-route my heart's electrical system.
