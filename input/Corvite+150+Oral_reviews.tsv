Anemia from Inadequate Iron	RosalesT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	6/19/2011 2:06:58 PM	I was on Corvite for only 1 month. The reason I chose to stop taking it was due to the large amount of hair I was losing. In addition to the extreme hairloss that obviously frightened me, I also noticed that I was very short of breath or what is called shallow breath. Experiencing that side effect is something I dont wish upon anyone, you pretty much feel as though you are going to stop breathing and pass out. Finally, the stomach pain was also intolerable, in fact the pain would last up to 2 days. If I wanted to feel some sense of relief in my stomach I had to eat an extreme amount of food and then quickly take it. In all honesty it is just not worth going through all that suffering. I would closely monitor side effects when taking this drug. Its not to say it wont work for you, however, for me there was no success.

After taking this, I felt wonderful again and had more energy. I am wondering if I need another vitamin with it since I am breastfeeding.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/1/2009 11:22:19 PM	I am one of those people who gets serious GI upset.  Corvite 150 was the iron that my doctor put me on when I became anemic.  I was very pleased with this iron supplement.  Other iron supplements that I had been on in the past had majorly constipated me and had caused me to have constant GI upset.  I had even seen a specialist because of my GI issues.  Corvite 150 worked so wonderfully for me!  I couldn't believe how well my body tolerated it and how my iron level went up so fast!  If you are in need of an iron supplement, choose Corvite 150!   
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	Concerned patient, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/18/2009 9:19:21 PM	The color of my stool turned to black, so I reviewed foods and medications taken within the last few days, when I checked my new vitamin, Corvite 150, the color was so deep red, I decided to research the side effects which indicated color of stool would be black. I now feel more comfortable and will wait for my regularly scheduled appointment to discuss this with my doctor.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	6/19/2008 10:29:25 PM	I became so constipated on this iron.  My doctor said it was supposed to be easier on my stomach, but it was terrible.  I only had to take it once/day, but it didn't get my levels up well enough, and my doctor switched me to a different iron (and I suffered through taking this iron for 3 months everyday!).  I would not recommend this iron.  Doc said it was new, and I was obviously his guinea pig.  If your doc says he is giving you corvite 150, tell him/her no thanks!
