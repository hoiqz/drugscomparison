I'VE HAD TO APPLY FR DISABILITY. I LIKED MY CARRER. I WAS VERY ACTIVE BEFORE TREATMENT &amp; NOW I CAN ONLY WALK ABOUT 15 FEET WITHOUT STOPPING FROM PAIN &amp; BASICALLY...PURE AGONY. 
Chronic Hepatitis C	BrynGerard, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	2/4/2012 6:59:51 AM	I have been taking Peg Interferon and Copegus(Ribavirin) since Jan 3 2012. I have type 1 of the virus.I have decided to discontinue the use of them because the psychotic effects are truly disturbing.  The Rage and Anger now consume my every moment, and as get almost no sleep it is a living hell.  The physical stress from Anger and Rage rings out in every cell of my body.  I have experienced almost all of the side effects, Blindness in one eye, over sensitivity to light, nausea... read that list that comes with product and I have had/do have them all.I am discontinuing the treatment because there is hi probability that the long term effects (psychotic) don't go away.Everybody dies, it is just a matter of when and how. Not every one suffers from mental illness, and a life of mental illness is no life at all to me.So I am abandoning the treatment in the hope that my sense well being and inner peace will return. I don't want to exist in living hell of mental illness.  Death is a massive part of life. I want to be concious of dying and engage with that process fully to gain the full benefit of death as it relates to cycle of life.  You can't do that if you are mentally ill.

Chronic Hepatitis C	Amazing Grace, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	2	Female	55-64	12/15/2009 1:31:00 PM	Have only had 2 pepasys injections so far, beginning viral count 7.7 million. For 2 days after injections, very fatigued, nauseated. Riboviron has caused hives from face to ankles-see my doc today, so will hopefully get something for that. Plan to continue treatment if it shows evidence it is working with lab tests.
Chronic Hepatitis C	GeoffSkateman, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/22/2009 3:00:40 PM	I started Pegasys and Copegus on July 31, 2009. My Viral load was 760,000 and Genome 1.  By September 23, 2009 my liver enzymes were back to normal and when we repeated the viral load test on October 23, 2009, the results were negative, the virus is undetectable.  Although the drug treatment was like chemo, it was well worth it.  The side affects have been miserable at times, but I figured out that if you did not lay around and feel terrible and you moved around and did things to keep you busy, the side affects were not as bad.  I will say this, the cycle of side affects varied and changed from week to week.  I guess it affects everyone differently.   My first 2 months were the worse.  We have kept a close eye on my blood labs and so far I have fared very well.  I do not wish this treatment on anyone, but I will say this, if you keep a strong will that you are going to beat this, you will.  I also must say THANK YOU to Roche, they provided me under their patience assistance program the treatment free of charge.   Roche has saved my life and I am forever grateful.  Good luck to anyone who gets this virus.  It can be beaten.....

Other	Paul, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	3/10/2009 3:46:28 AM	I have been taking Pegasys for a myeloproliferative malignancy (bone marrow cancer).  It has been thus far very effective in achieving hematologic remission.  My counts have returned to normal in 8 weeks at the lowest (45 mcg) dose.  Very minimal side effects (a little fatigue).  I have now reduced the dose to 35 mcg per week as my counts went a little too low (white cell count) and that seems to be keeping things stable.

But after 1 year of treatment the virus was at undetectable levels. It has now been 4 years. We are very happy but still keep up with the vitamin regimin daily.

Chronic Hepatitis C	linbq, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	1/21/2008 11:38:41 AM	My husband has engaged in aggressive acts toward me at night.  He has punched my face (after minor face surgery); squeezed my left nipple &amp; breast (after I underwent a breast biopsy); stood over me &amp; poked my arm; &amp; last night he awoke me, slurring his words &amp; demanding that I give him a knife.  I gently slapped his face, &amp; realized that he was unconscious.  I am afraid of him &amp; afraid to tell him that I will sleep in another room--there is no lock on the door, however.These symptoms began with the Pegasys treatment.  Is that a coincidence?  Am I in danger?  He has always been a kind &amp; gentle man.  If I call 911 it would ruin his career.  I am beside myself with worry.To conclude, my question is this:  is this a side effect of Pegassis?  I would appreciate your feedback on this unsettling matter.Sincerely,Linda Busque
