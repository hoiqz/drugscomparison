Deficient Activity of the Testis	Peanut, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/12/2012 6:57:43 PM	Just had my 5th implant over the last 17 months. Original Uro MD was conservative and started with 8 pellets - current MD implanted 18 last time and this time. Starts working in 2 days, but agree with the comments that the last month is rough. Some hot flashes / night sweats and tenderness for a day or two but on day 2 1/2 very little soreness. Discussed other options but the practice is sold on T-pel. T-level got to be 1000+ down to 400 in about 3 months. Highly recommended, very effective.

It has now been 5 weeks after insertion still bleed from an open wound not healed. I have always been a fast healer but not with this procedure.Two of the twelve pellets have fallen out one in week two and another in week three. My docter did not inform me that immediately after the procedure you needed to plan for cold packs and a reduced activity for a a day or two. I see my doctor every week and he uses silver nitrate to stop the bleeding but it still persists. I gave up a large part of my summer vacation due to not being able to enjoy lake activities.I immagine a lot of blood testing to figure out adjused volume of having the every two weeks of injections to go back to in 3-4 months.I will never use this product again and worry about how the nurse will work around the remains of the pellets when they begin the every 2 week injections again. This decision was not the &quot;no brainer&quot; that the docter said this procedure was.

My urologist started the pellet therapy and I had great results, he increased the number of pellets with every insertion.  On my 4th round he put in 20 pellets to try and get me to last 6 to 8 months.It' has been a nightmare ever since.  My feet and ankles have swollen, sometimes so bad that I cannot walk. Constant pain in my feet.  I'm having shortness of breath and heart palputations.  I've broken out with acne over my chest, stomach and shoulders.  I'm having extreme anxiety attacks.  I talked to my urologist and he said he doesn't know what to do with me and to go to my primary Dr. who has not been much help either.  It's been 4 months since they were inserted, I may have 2 or 3 more months to go with these symptoms.  Has anyone else had these issues?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

My initial T-level before the first implant (10 pellets) was 320. After a month my levels were are 750. After about a week or 2 I had much more energy, much better mood and my sex drive and function returned. Can't say enough about how happy I am that it has worked so well. There was some minor discomfort for about a week after, but that is to be expected. My only concern is that I could definitely feel myself coming down in the final month and that was confirmed when they said my T-levels had come back down to 340. So I am thinking about asking to go on a 3 month cycle instead of a 4 month to help maintain a consistent level.

I am 64 years old and this implant holds my testosterone level above 500 for 3 months at a time. No pain or real discomfort as a result of the implant.I have lost weight and my overall health has improved, i.e. - lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels. The implant is pricey but worth every cent to me.

I'd been depressed, no energy, etc.  I was implanted with Testopel then and, next to marrying my wife, it has been the best thing I've ever done.  The last 3 months have been the best of my life.  The sex life in my marriage has returned, I am losing weight and just feel so much better in general.  One note: The effect, at least for me, was up and down at first.  I did not expect this as everything I had read had said it would be gradual/constant.  I first felt the effect 5 days after implantation.  The feeling of testosterone would then wax and wane for about the first month.  The nurse said that was probably my body getting used to the Testopel.  After the first month the feeling of testosterone was basically constant.  I am going in for my second implantation soon and am very much looking forward to it.  There is about a week of discomfort after implantation but it is well worth it.

My level was in the lower double digits and afterwards had me back to normal and at a consistent rate.  The implants for me seemed to last almost 5 months before it went down. New implants start kicking in around 3 days. The first time you get them, you may not realize the hot flashes etc because your body is getting use to having a normal level again.  After a month, I was happier, more energetic, more consistent blood sugar, and a happier man (wink wink). Why take ED drugs when you can resolve the problem without the side effects of ED drugs.

It was a costly treatment that would of been worth it to me had it worked. It brought my level up to the low 300 range. Guess I will try the shots.

Since my husband started this drug his sex drive has gone through the roof.  His personality has changed and I have breast hair growth and constant bleeding/spotting (menstrual irregularities).  My husband was on the gel before this and the same issues were present however I believe our young son was inadvertently exposed.  I am devastated by this and will not know the long term effects of this for many years to come.  My husband switched to testopel to alleviate my concern about our son being exposed.  I am angry and his high sex drive makes me resentful.  My biological changes are concerning too.  I hate to make my husband choose between his health (supposedly) and our marriage but I'm too concerned about the silent exposure I may now be getting and his personality changes.  I hate this drug!  It has ruined our marriage!  There are no long term studies on its safety and yet it is being prescribed constantly!  My husband has low testosterone.  He was a better husband and father before this drug.  He now thinks only of sex and has no remorse for what he may have done to our son.  We will never know but I'm not sticking around to find out.

I had pellets injected 2 months ago, felt great for a week or 2, then the pellets all came out.  Stepped out of the shower, and one at a time, they shot out of the incision site.  Just had new ones inserted yesterday.  Procedure is painless, however, next few days suck!  I would recommend the pellets assuming they don't come out again.

It's only day 4, so I do not expect to feel any results and haven't thus far. The incision site is not painful at all but the implantation area adjacent to the incision is VERY sore. I'm not sure if it is normal to have this much soreness; it's painful to sit down or touch that area. Maybe my urologist lacks surgical skills and stuck the trocar into the muscle. Who knows? I am going to call his nurse tomorrow and make sure this pain is not unusual. 
Deficient Activity of the Testis	Amazed, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/15/2012 2:26:21 AM	I'm 38 years old and was diagnosed 3 months ago with Low T.  My Testosterone level was 215. The doctor had me try androgel for 2 months with no noticeable difference.  I was then referred to a urologist who recommended Testopel as an alternate treatment.  I had noticed over the previous 3-5 years that my energy levels had dropped and my interes in sex went from normal to low to non existent.  I had 12 pellets implanted 5 days ago.  The first day I couldn't tell a difference, but from day 2 until now has been a whole new world for me.  I feel 21 again.  I have tons of energy and my wife has been very please with my renewed interest in sex.  Unfortunately with my insurance I had to pay $1100 for the first implant and will have to pay $300 for each subsequent implant this calendar year until deductibles reset in January.  Like most have noticed there is mild to moderate bruising and swelling but this goes away quickly.  I go back in 6 weeks to have them check my T levels.  If any of you guys are on the fence about this, take it from me.  This has changed my life.  Even at a couple thousand dollars a year out of pocket for me it is well worth it to me and my wife.  You owe it to yourself to at least contact a physician and discuss this as a treatment option.
Other	Therightchoice, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/20/2012 4:58:14 PM	I am a 41 year old male that was diagnosed with hypogonadism.  My T-level was low normal (245), but for my age it should be a lot higher. My doctor first started me out on Androgel and it helped some, but I never got the numbers my doctor was looking for.  My doctor then suggested that we try Testopel.  I had the procedure done about two months ago and I was sore for almost two weeks and two of the pellets expelled within the first two weeks.  However, after all of that was worked through I have to say that I am feeling pretty damn good! I have more energy, my sexual appetite is like it was when I was in my mid twenties, and my erections are VERY frequent and rock solid!  My T-level was checked last week and is now 733 (with only 10 pellets)...the normal range for my age is 241-827...so not bad at all!  Hey guys, I recommend this 100%....I am pleased with my results thus far.  It has changed my life for the better and I look forward to my next procedure...so bring on the swelling and soreness.....it's all worth it!
Other	Mike, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	35-44	3/20/2012 2:25:56 PM	My starting level was 407, but was experiencing many symptoms associated with low T. Had 10 pellets implanted on 2/23/12 and was retested on 3/12/12 and results came back at 447. Was quite a bit of pain initially (for a couple weeks) which would have been fine if I got the results I was expecting but I essentially got nothing for $800. Doctor was expecting a 300 jump so I am more than disappointed. Anybody else had the pellets not work? Can they screw up how they put them in? Do they have to do anything to the pellet before insertion?  He suggested the gel but I am skeptical now.

I have hypogonadism unfortunately and the Dr that did my implants said a few points lower and I would loose the physical ability to have sex with my wife. I couldn't believe it. I've only had the pellets now for 2 days but I am already starting to feel the results. For the past 2-3 years, I was on a slow decline into a person who just does enough to vet by every day in life. I have put on 30 lbs in that time and the beautiful woman I married, well let's just say that we've had some problems. But now, only 48 hours after my treatment, I feel the excitement for life starting to rise again. I have more energy. Im in a better mood. I'm less irritated. All in all, I feel like a new man. The procedure was painless and my soreness so far is almost non existent, and it only cost $20 out of my pocket. Insurance covered it all. I am 100% satisfied with this product and would highly highly recommend it to ANYONE that is experiencing symptoms from low-T. All it takes is a blood test to check you level. My Dr. Also gave me a B-12 shot after the procedure (which only took about 7 minutes). It helps give you a little boost until those magical little pellets start doing there thing. I had 12 of those suckers installed. Also make sure your Dr puts in estrogen blockers as well. Well for all you men out there that have done this already, I'm pumped to join the club. And for all you men thinking of doing this, you would be stupid not to have this procedure done!!!

MD suggested Testopel and I researched it for several months, especially here! First implentation was in September 2011, 12 pellets. Total Testoserone serum level was 1080 four weeks later. Procedure was mildly unconformatable but my failure to chill the insersertion site resulted in a seven inch bruise. After five months, T level was 280. So last week a second implant of 14 pellets which should leave T level at 600 after four months. The effects were all that I anticipated. Hopefully ObamaCare will continue to cover this proceedure!

It's now Friday morning and I feel great. There's some bruising and swelling, which is to be expected. But, for those that are a concerned about the pain experienced by some on this msg board, trust me when I say, it's bearable. You can't plop yourself onto the couch as violently as you normally do, but it's far from debilitating. I woke up at 6 am this morning, (with no alarm clock) feeling great! After a tiring day yesterday, I fell asleep before 9:30. No sleeping pill, no red wine necessary! The dr. said no working out for 3 days so yesterday was my first gym trip. It was a great workout.  The full effects apparently won't be felt until 2 weeks, but I already feel great. Could be psychosomatic! Woke up with morning glory, and bumped it into my wife accidentally of course! She's in trouble when I get home from work. I'm 36 years old, I weigh 200 lbs and have had a hard time dropping weight. I was concerned as my workouts weren't producing the results I was working for. My T levels were 310. Reasons for ratings: 4 stars for effectiveness because I'm only 5 days in. I haven't felt the full effects yet, but so far I'm happy. 5 stars for ease of use. The procedure took less than 30 minutes, and I barely knew it happened the first day as my rear end was numb from the local. 5 stars for satisfaction: it's possible that I am so satisfied thus far because my insurance paid for the procedure. If I had to pay the grand that others have, I may have different expectations. Good luck to those considering testopel.

Deficiency of a Substance that Promotes Masculinization	krnoto55, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	12/7/2011 8:01:31 AM	After trying the gel and patches on and off since 2001, and never really getting my T levels up to where I (and my Doctor) wanted to get them, I jumped at the chance at getting Testostorone pellets implanted.  My Urologist did the job the end of July 2011, he first cleansed the area - they insert them into the area near the outer part of where the top of your rear jean's pocket is on your butt.  After cleaning the area, he put on a covering to help prevent infection, then injected the entire area with Lidocaine.  That stung a bit, like getting stung with a wasp a number of times, but the pain quickly subsides, and the area goes numb.  Then my Doc used a small trocar instrument, specifically designed to implant the pellets - he inserted it into my numbed skin and dug into the fat layer, then placed the pellets there.  For me, since I don't really make any T any longer, he implanted all ten pellets.  It was over in a few minutes and I was allowed to get dressed.  The pain didn't begin until about 24 hours later.  Yes, it was painful,  but then I also have Fibromyalgia, so it was bad.  For relief, I used a half of a Lidoderm Patch I had leftover from an old script.  That I changed every day and after a week the pain was gone.  Now, for my T levels - they went from under 100 to close the 400's using the pellets.  I was actually going through puberty once again - waking up with woodies, having more energy, getting more body hair, beard hair, and I even spotted a few chest hairs - my first ones at age 55.  I was able to have orgasms once again - I felt like I was becoming the man I was supposed to be - finally!The pellets lasted about 3.5 months and I had the second group implanted.  It went easier, but I had more pain afterwards.  Again, I used Lidoderm patches.  Ask your Doc for some - it will help with the pain if it becomes too bad.  I'm going to ask for a script for another box before my next implant.  Testopel is a Godsend.  No more gel or patch - it's great.
Other	krommer, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	35-44	11/27/2011 12:13:39 AM	The procedure is a bit painful and post-op is also a bit painful.  Area of insertion is very sensitive nothing a couple of Advil can't take care of.  Overall, I feel great!  My mood has improved, sex drive increased, erections last longer and are harder.  I have lost weight since the first procedure, however, I cannot say it is due to the Testopel.  I went on Atkins and lost nearly 30lbs.  I will keep having the procedure until my insurance company decides to stop paying for it.  If this happens I will find some other means to pay for the procedure.  It is worth the effort.
Deficient Activity of the Testis	John Alex, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	2	4	Male	45-54	11/15/2011 10:01:48 PM	I wrote my first review a month after the implant. I gave the highest rate on all. Now after 3 months I have to revise &quot;Ease of Use&quot;. Unfortunately it got infected, which caused some of the pallets to just pop out. I am on antibiotics and hoping I this heals eventually. I still vow for the effectiveness of it. My testosterone level rose exponentially and I don't remember being so sexually active in years, besides the overall &quot;feel good&quot; effect of it. Hence the satisfaction is still high. Now I have to decide if I go for it again given to this experience. I might say &quot;yes&quot; though.

Have used many performance enhancing substances in my younger years. Have not excercised seriously for 10 years. Total lack of energy.  Forced myself to start working out 6 months prior to receiving Testopel. Notice huge energy boost in the 2nd week post implant. Key, is to find a good pysician and develop an exercise program that fits your lifestyle. Well worth the cost. Looking forward to feeling alive again!

The results were OK, but when my doc offered testopel I jumped at the chance. The first time I had a little soreness for a week, but the second one I had almost none. The results for me are vastly superior compared to the gel. My wife hates me now because I won't leave her alone. ;-)

Unlike many guys in here, I had a painless procedure, my Doctor skillfully implanted the pellets with the help of the Testopel Rep. I had 3 days of discomfort and pain. Went to the gym in the 4th to work out upper body and worked out legs (carefully) in the 5th. On the 7th day, I was sitting, walking and going over my normal life, which by the way has improved significantly. Guys, let's help out a bit: drop weight, exercise, live healthier. Treatment alone won't make miracles. Stress made me sick, I am work on it myself and the results are great! Good luck!

Maybe my doctor is more skilled with the insertion than others but the worst part of this so far was the Novocain local given prior to the actual insertion of the pellets. Sure there's been some mild discomfort for a few days after but nothing that troublesome. This beats the heck out of frequent injections and daily Testim applications and I've gotten all the &quot;wood&quot; I need.

There was no pain involved with the implant procedure and within a week, the small bruising had disappeared. I can't even tell where the cut was now. I started feeling something a little different after only a couple of days. I am having more energy daily an xthe main thing for me is that I have more motivation to do things again. I cant wait until it is at the peak. 
Other	papadawg, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	65-74	8/5/2011 2:32:36 AM	Had abnormally low testosterone level along with energy deficiency and loss of sexual function to the point of almost never getting an erection that would last for more than a few seconds.  Urologist recommended these pellets so I went with his suggestion.  First implantation was over a year ago and did not notice any improvement at all until about a month and a half had past when my energy level went way up, but then started coming down until the next implantation that was about six months after the first.  Experienced the same effects.  Do not like the roller coaster type of effects.  Had to change Doctors about three months ago and will be trying another type of HRT.  If anyone would ask me, I would not recommend the pellets because of the weird roller-coaster effect.

Only because it's been 9 days and I still can't sit down. Absolutely ridiculous please make. Sure you have the right doctor. I have a huge hard lump and alot of pain at the injection sight. I went to my doctor and he told me to go straight to the E room. Now I'm on reflex for 2 weeks and lost 3 days of work. Not worth it man. Just not worth it

No this is not magic! You will have to stay with it for several months to get the full effect.  I went monthly for 6 months and now I am on a 3 month sched.  Some discomfort but well worth the trouble. Energy back, head clear, overall well being improved, sleep better, libido better.  What else do you want?  Trying to be 20 again is going to be work! Some practitioners will be better with these implants than others!  Little sore but not bad! But if you would rather be lethargic and feel like crap... go ahead, but not me!

Very painful to the touch. As the pain in the insertion site grew worse, it seems the effectiveness of the drug is falling. Perhaps due to inflamation? Will give it another week. Next time chose a site with more fat under the skin?

Tried cream during this time also and it had to be supplemented with injections to keep level in range.  The testopel has been a blessing for me.  I had 10 pellets implanted in May.  The area of the implants was a little sensitive for a few weeks with minor bruising (to be expected), but my doctor and his staff at Tift Urology done a great job.  It's expensive (~$940.00), if you don't have insurance to pay for it.  I've only had the implant for a little over a month and not sure about level yet, but will have it tested next month.Now for the good part, I have energy and feel great.  I get up early, stay up late, and don't go into a coma when I sit down.  My wife loves it also, not for the reason most people think, even though it has helped.  I don't mind working on the &quot;honey do list&quot;, I fix her lunch and dinner, we spend more time together, I'm more passionate and caring about her needs and wants.  It all boils down to I'm just not wore out all the time.  My overall well being is better.I have read a lot of negative reviews about testopel, but I can say that my experience thus far has been great.  Keep in mind; it's only been a little over a month since implants.  At this point, I would highly recommend testopel for anyone who needs it.Thank God, no more weekly shots.Brock

I decided to try this since my insurance would cover with only a 40 copay. I won't get it again. It was very painful, I am sore and black and blue. I don't feel any better. The injections worked fine so I will go back to them. I do not recommend this drug!

All, but for a very brief time using testosterone patches, I was treated by IM injections every 3 weeks. The frequency was shortened to every 2 weeks much later in my treatment. I dreaded every scheduled treatment of giving myself an injection. So, just a couple of months ago my new urologist suggested pellet implantation treatment. Yesterday I went for my first treatment. The doctor did exactly what I saw done on a YouTube video. The procedure was painless except for a brief sting at the beginning of the local numbing process. After the procedures was finished, which took all of 3 minutes, there was no discomfort or pain what-so-ever. I am posting this 24 hours later and still no discomfort or pain. The only thing that I have found is some bruising at the implantation site. I would fully expect that though as the pellets are placed in various spots through the incision by moving the muscle tissue around. I am looking forward to positive results with this type of treatment. I will be posting more after getting lab results in a month and three months.

After 30 day check, levels only went up 52 points, still way below normal, was told to give it another month but am going back today to find out why I am still so low.  Pain, don't care, just want it to work.  Will update later.

My first insertion of testopel was good but my numbers crashed within two months on eight pellets. My doctor put in ten this time, so I'm hoping for more energy and better control with my diabetes.

I got 10 the first time but still had symptoms.  Got 12 this time. First time, my doc was new and it was fairly painful for a week or so.  This time, it was much better.  I'm guessing practice makes perfect...I was on gels for over 4 years.  Paid $40 per month for my co-pay.  With Testopel I paid only $20.  Nothings perfect but this is the best option for me
Deficiency of a Substance that Promotes Masculinization	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	5/4/2011 9:32:22 PM	Had 8 pellets implanted a week ago. Was painful briefly going in (like a bad bee sting, yes) but subsided after 30 seconds or so. Severe brusing for a week but much better now. I can tell a difference but nothing very dramatic. Convenient to have it done and less expensive in my health plan. Highly recommended by the Urologist. Test results in 3 weeks, we'll see how it does.

I am very nervous about needles and pain but found the procedure to be very bearable. About 30 seconds of intense pain before the numbing took over, and a few seconds of needle penetration after that. Dr was great about describing what he was doing and reassuring in a MD kind of way &quot;I had to tell 3 people they have cancer today - this is nothing!!&quot; He did 8 pellets and my level was just over 300. MUCH cheaper from an insurance point of view; just a covered office visit. Gels would have been a few hundred bucks. Assuming it works, I would have it done again without hesitation.

I was more than willing to try it and leave the Androgel mess behind. My T levels were quite low and although I felt much better on the gel my levels were not optimal. I should mention my Dr. said he does the Testopel procedure 7-10 times a week so I was comfortable with his experience. The procedure itself was totally painless- a little novocaine and felt nothing. I consider myself pretty tough but that night I was really sore and had a large lump where the pellets were placed. The pain lasted for 10 days- really uncomfortable. At 2 weeks the pain is gone but there is a good sized lump where the pellets are. I should mention that I am thin and have low body fat. When the MD did the procedure he did comment that it is better to have some fat in the behind for the pellets to sit in. This may be the difference between easy vs. hard with this procedure. Will probably try it one more time but if it's as bad as the first time it will be back to the gel. Good luck guys- hope it works for you.

Injection was painful and the next day I had an infection at the site. It's been a week now and it's still very sore and tender and red. Hoping it will get better in the next week, but still too early to tell. Should have asked Dr. about possible side effects..who knew?!? Dr. did not give me all that much info. As far as sex drive, the mind is willing but equiptment isn't...hopefully soon. Thank goodness my wife is 8 mos. pregnant!

I was told by the doctor that I would have so much more energy and that my sex life would improve greatly.  This is not the case.  My testis have shrunk to the size of very small grapes and erections are non-existent.  The doctor now refuses to discuss this case with me.
Deficient Activity of the Testis	DV, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/4/2011 4:52:15 PM	I just had the Testopel pellets implanted yesterday.  I was worried because of some of the reviews I saw on here saying how painful it was, but to me, it was no more than the feeling of a bee sting that lasted about 10 seconds which was the numbing shot.  After implanting ten pellets, they had me lay on an ice pack for about 15 minutes.  Afterward, I kept waiting for the pain, but it never came.  Today it has been a slight &quot;twinge&quot; occasionally, but not bad at all.  I am an insurance agent and have been jumping in and out of the car all day...business as usual.  I do work out at a gym five days per week so I am used to sore muscles and joints, so maybe I have developed a high pain tolerance.  However, those of you that had a bad experience, should maybe consult a different physician.  I did not think it was any more than an injection in the hip.  I have been on Androgel for about six years and with my insurance, I have a $30 per month copay with Androgel.  With Testopel, my insurance only charges me $25 for a regular office visit copay.  And it will last four months.  So I am going from $360 per year for Androgel to $100 for Testopel.  So far...I am very pleased.  And to those folks reading these reviews...Don't let it scare you away from the procedure.  Everyone is different and some doctors are better than others.  I will post again later to tell how my progress goes. 
Other	maxdog, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/2/2011 11:41:10 AM	I have to agree with wilfredtr, the skill level of your caregiver will reflect the overall comfort level after the implantation of the pellets.  The first implantation was a little sore for 3-4 days with bruising for 2 weeks.  The doctor was very aggressive when numbing the area.  Almost as if he was doing a liposuction procedure.  I believe this was the cause of the discomfort and bruising.    The second round of implantation was performed by a different doctor. He did not subscribe to the same aggressive numbing technique.  No soreness or bruising at any time after the implantation.   Far more consistent results with the implants for me over the other methods of testosterone replacement.   
Other	Flash, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	65-74	2/24/2011 9:58:50 PM	I had been on Testim for one year due to lack of libido.  This had worked fairly well for me and raised my testosterone level to normal levels.  Starting in 2011, I lost insurance coverage for testim and my urologist recommended testopel insertion which my new insurance would cover ( go figure ).  I had it done in early January with 10 pellets.  I responded fairly quickly and my testosterone levels rose even higher then with testim.  It definitely helped my libido.  I did suffer with a large bruise, but I bleed easily.  It was quite sore for about a week, but nothing terrible and I tolerated it well.  Took over 3 weeks for the bruise to disappear.  It has now been 7 weeks and my libido has continued at a good level.  My next insertion is scheduled for early May.  I will be interested to see if the January pellets last as well until then and how my testosterone level is holding up after four months.  So far, so good.  Definitely better than messing with the gel everyday.  My biggest problem with the gel was getting it to dry.  I live in Florida and the sweating was a problem all the time.  Time will tell.  Not looking forward to the insertion, but the results so far have been worth the short term discomfort.

Seriously men, MAN up! (Maybe you should wait till it works and you FEEL and talk like a man again. Sheeze. ) I've had the implant done four times already, and each time it was no more dramatic than getting a normal injection. Yes, it was sore the next day (duh), but no limping, lying on my side, or &quot;saucer sized welt&quot;. Effects are steady, level, and I am ecstatic at not injecting myself with T once a week. The Gel was wack, and the co-pay horrendous.

I was surprised to learn that the bumps I felt under my skin were lesions, ( I thought that the bumps were the pellets) and that they might never go away.  It has been 7 months and my first injection site still has the bumps.  My doctor told me that we will have to change up the locations of the injections because the bumps or lesions is a side effect. I am going back to the gel, I simply don't want to have these lesions under my skin all over both of my buttocks considering I am 60 and have many more years to use this treatment.

Very energetic to begin with. no prob with erections at all. had a physical with my doc and he found my T level was 187 at 10AM in the morning...We did a redraw a couple of weeks later, and it went up to 287 at 9AM in the morning. We decided to try testopel. I had it done 8 days ago. didn't hurt much during implanting the 10 pellets. during first 24hrs, but hurt quite a bit for about 7 days. day 8 pain decreased a lot. pain was mainly when i did streching that caused the skin over the insertion site to stretch.Does anyone know the approximate increase in T that should be expected from a base line T level of 287. I'VE BEEN SEARCHING THE WEB AND I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING OF THE EXPECTED LEVELS OF T after TESTOPEL USE FROM USING 10 PELLETS. so far i haven't felt any changes at all what so ever yet. hopefully i will feel something soon.

I often forgot the Androgel or swam during the day it just didnt work for me. Testopel is great one time every 3-4 months(felt decline at 3.5 months). Hurts for a week to three weeks after implant but for me its worth it, less mood swings increased strength and energy.

Very active. a few kids, wife. sex life is active. never had any concern regarding ability to have sex. not having any of the symtoms of anything really that are associated with low T. But went to my doc and he drew labs....my T was 250 in the morning (when it is normally the highest)......went for a redraw and my T was still only 360. Still too low for my docs comfort level. I don't know if i've always had low T...never had it checked. but lack of facial hair would be the only thing i could think of.My doc recommended Testopel. Just had 10 pellets implanted yesterday 12/16/10. no real pain per say as many reviews said they had. he inserted them more to the upper buttock, just below the right hip bone...awesome and virtually pain free insertion. minimal discomfort the day after to no pain. Eager to see my T levels in about a month from now. a little expensive at $60 per pellet. Total $600 + 200 doctor charge. My insurance didnt cover it. I will give feedback in the future for any who care to here my feedback. i'd low to here other reviewers feedback in the future. See ya soon.

Easy absorption, and I didn't even mind the scent--kind of liked it, in fact, and I got lots of compliments on my &quot;cologne.&quot;  But the daily application was a hassle, so on my doctor's recommendation I tried Testopel, 8 units subcutaneous in left buttocks.  (I imagine we'll switch off left and right, going forward.)  As others have reported, there was bruising and soreness for about 10 days, but that has subsided completely.  I am now 1.5 months in and I feel good. The effects are very similar to Testim but less &quot;spiky.&quot; On Testim, I'd get strong sex urges and energy highs, but things are more even on Testopel.  I get my levels checked this week (a little late--I should have done it at one month), and if all is good, I plan to continue.

Recovery took three weeks and the high test felt great for one month. Fuller muscles energy and drive. Nearing my third month and all has fizzed out. Back to no energy sex drive muscles deflated and workouts are a struggle again. Going back for more. Have to use some gels until my next ass mutilation! Bring on the pain!
Other	oolongtea, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	45-54	11/23/2010 3:25:42 PM	Had 16 pellets planted, too many! Wound healed then re-opened and some pellets extruded. Meanwhile, soreness at injection site all over again and no real positive effects are apparent. Possibly the 16 should have been inserted 8 Left 8 Right to avoid crowded injection site. However, since no effects are seen this far along, I am doubting that it was an appropriate treatment.

I like the ease of not using the gel every day, only wish it would last longer.

So far I have noted no benefits of any kind except extreme soreness at the site of implant (hip). I have alternated ice every 30 minutes during the day since having the procedure done. This may be too soon to make a judgement but at this time no improvement has been noted of any kind.  I will make more comments as time progresses but if no benefit is received I will not repeat the procedure.  The Testim gel was extremely messy and smelly.  Prior to that for 10 years I took an injecton of testosterone in my alternating hips and my desire for sexual relations did improve.  
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	45-54	10/6/2010 6:47:31 PM	50 year old male, testosterone 326, first implant by physician, 8 - 75mg, site sore 30 days, extruded one pellet, after 2 months 356, disapointing. 2nd implant done by RN at HRC, 8 - 200mg, sore 4 days, no problem, in fact easy 5 mins. I think the first implant was done improperly because the 2nd one was and is easy.  Waiting for the next test to see how my rate is rising, not too much improvement yet but only 7 days post.  I think it will be great later!
Deficient Activity of the Testis	ChrisPBC, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Male	35-44	9/19/2010 12:27:54 PM	Had 10 pellets implanted left buttock on side. After months of gel use decided to try pellets. Gels were too inconvenient. Day 3 the site is so sore I can barely walk. I woke with chest tightness (could be muscle related) so went and had pressure EKG for precaution. All seems normal but the chest tightness is worrisome. My energy and erectile function feel A+ but with all this energy I can't walk bc I'm sore on a scale of 10!! Ouch Testopel. I will update.

I received 10 pellets to the front of my left thigh.  The site is very sore and tender in an area about 4 inches wide.  I'm hoping the discomfort doesn't last too long.  I like not using the gel, but I'm not looking forward to my next session.
Deficient Activity of the Testis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Male	35-44	7/14/2010 5:22:05 PM	Got injected yesterday and boy am I sore! Looks like I got shot in the rear with a paintball gun. Was wondering if that was normal. That is, being red, swollen and sore in an area the size of a half dollar at hte implant site. Too soon to know if its working but I feel better already. Got 10 pellets and I'm 235lbs. Don't look forward to the next injection but beats the gel.
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	4	Male	35-44	6/17/2010 10:59:01 AM	Its only been 2 weeks and my soreness is gone. I am still waiting for my energy level and sex drive to return. My doctor told me it takes about 2 to 3 weeks for the first injection to take affect.
Deficient Activity of the Testis	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	6/10/2010 11:28:11 PM	Its been 1 month since I had the pellets implanted. Area had been sore for 2 to 3 weeks. Energy level and sexual drive has sky rocketed back up again. Much easier than the gel, but doctor told me today that I will need 10 pellets every 3 months. Not looking forward to the implant procedure but will continue because its better than all the other alternatives. Insurance doesn't cover all of the cost but its cheaper than the gel, don't know about the shots, doctor does not recommend them because it makes your testosterone level fluctuate too much.

The numbing shots were uncomfortable as well as the implant procedure of pellets felt strange. I felt like a saddle being stitched up. Also agree the soreness lasted about 10 days. The results were good and easier than topical applications, but I don't look forward to the repeat implants. Would that be due to my pain tolerance or the skills (or lack of) my urologist?
Other	Rmman, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	2/20/2010 8:14:56 AM	What a nightmare! Do not subject youself to this procedure. &#160;I recently had Testopel implanted at the suggestion of my Doc. This began a 12 month disaster that first started with a very very painful 6&quot; bruise at the injection site that lasted 21 days. After that, each of the 12! Pellets slowly worked their way back through the original site or through the fat and skin on my rear to &#160;be ejected in a painful bloody mess. It took nearly 10 months for everthing to be rejected. I had little or no increase in total or free T. I wasn't able to sit comfortably, and I still can feel particles and scar tissue in &quot;injection tracks&quot; under my skin. I fear this is permanent. &#160;I believe my doctor performed the procedure as correctly as possible and the problem is with the product itself and a vast amount of marketing lies by the drug company. Even if the results were better, I could never imagine going through this every 6-8 months. If you need another option other than gel, stick with simple T injections you can do yourself at home every 2 weeks. No pain or recovery, plus you van feel the results in increased energy etc immediately. The cost is almost zero compared to the Testopel or Gel. Take my word for it. Don't do it uness you are into pain and permanent scars. Feel free to contact me if you want more info. Rmman@comcast.net&#160;

Other	Johna66, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	55-64	1/4/2010 7:40:54 PM	Had 8 pellets inserted in my butt 5 mos ago. A month later one came to the surface and was very uncomfortable, like a giant splinter when you put pressure on it. Dr removed and a month after that another piece of a pellet had to be removed for same reason. The sight is still bruised. The positive side was the increase in energy. Erections increased in frequency and effectiveness. I just had blood test and was told today that more pellets will now have to be added to bring the T-level back up again. I am told that this next round of insertions will require me to turn the other cheek :-)

After the initial injection soreness passed my energy level has picked up. My sexual desire has returned and may be even better. I am very pleased with the medication.

It has helped a little with my ED problems. Painless and no sticky cremes to rub on or weekly injections.
