Mixed results, as some nights it works great; others I'm pacing the floor again. I go back for my check up in the morning, and I'm anxious to go over this inconsistency in results. When it works, it's awesome - SO nice to be able to sleep for more than an hour or so at a time before being forced out of bed to pace!
Other	AnneNC, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/11/2012 8:33:56 PM	Prescribed for restless legs, and it is working (so far) very well! 2 weeks into it, so it's a little early yet, but the results so far are very encouraging. I'm actually able to go to sleep and stay asleep through the night. Major change from pacing the floor for hours at night. Little grogginess, some dizziness in the morning, but that beats the heck out of only getting 1-2 hours of sleep at a time, with nightly totals of 3.5 to 6 every night!

If I take it at bedtime I will either oversleep or be very groggy in the morning.

Horizant began to work almost immediately..I am even sleeping better and uncontrollable movements are practically nonexistent.  Yes, I was groggy the first week but have acclimated to that.  Honestly, this has been like a miracle for me.

Additional Medication to Treat Partial Seizures	Jene, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	65-74	8/6/2011 12:06:01 PM	Has effectively stopped uncontrollable movements caused by extreme Restless Legs Syndrome.  Before using Horizant, RLS seizures were extreme throughout entire body.  Side effects of dizziness, etc. disappeared after a couple of days.  I can now sleep, which the RLS previously prevented.
