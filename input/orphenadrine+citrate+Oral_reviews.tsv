I find it to be very effective for moderate pain. We used it as needed when overseas and asked our physician here for a script for occasional use.

Muscle Spasm	Deweycheetem,  Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male		3/21/2010 12:03:59 PM	I have taken this medication for 3.5 years.Only side effect is dry mouth. I have 8 discs in my back either bulging or detereriated and partial Rotator cuff tear.Iwork as an all trade Skilled maintenance @ wastewater treatment plant.Found that this drug allows me to work without loopy feeling and has left me spasn free even after 8.5 hours of doing heavy physical labor.It's a Godsend for me. Don't get me wrong some times after cool down I feel spasms but when I start moving again it kicks back in. Best thing a DOC ever perscribed me. I tried 4 other relaxers either loopy,foggy,or didn't work to allow me a full day's relief while working!!!

I was taking Flexeril when ever I had a flare up. And it was working fine. But last time I hada flare up my doctor called in the Norflex ER. It just does not work as well and it makes me really tired and dizzy which the Fexeril never did. So I can not use it when I have to work, or even drive. It also gives me a drug hang over feeling.

I found that it made other muscles ache, due to less strength. Also, back still feels stiff and I hate feeling tiered during the day and dizzy and while my back seems to hurt more often I don't get as many debilitating spasms. So I on the fence as to weather this is working...any suggestions anyone?

When taking this medication my vocal cords/and mouth became very dry to the point where I couldnt hardly talk, very horse sounding. I have been told I have syjgerns disorder and uric acid and fibermyalgia. So I was put on other medication.

My doctor gave me this to use while working because it is a very mild muscle relaxer. It works very well. No drowsiness and it allows me to work without being loopy. Other stronger muscle relaxers give me better relief but leave me to dopey to work.

Muscle Spasm	Bill D., 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	65-74	11/30/2008 12:59:12 AM	I was diagnosed with &quot;slipped rib&quot; syndrome.13 years ago, my chest was opened to plug a small hole in my heart. When I recovered, after about 6 months I started having bad cramps in the muscles around the rib cage. The bottom line is that occasionally a muscle would ping on a nerve or nerve ending, causing wicked cramps. These cramps would not last very long (10-15 min.) and I would have to get into a position that didn't make the cramp feel so painful; usually I had to lie on my side for a few minutes. I went through more tests than I care to remember gefore the diagnosis was made by my new GP. She prescribed orphenadrine citrate (2/day). This has been a wonder drug for me. I rarely get any cramps.I would certainly recommend it.

It is important to note that Nyquil has the opposite effect on me also. My problem with this medicine is that it made me feel lifeless, but also made my body ache. I awoke with greater stiffness in my neck in the morning and retained fluid which made me have to urinate frequently for the first 5 hours after waking. This medication was prescribed to me for muscle spasm between by shoulders.

I havn't had it for a week.  When I wake up in the morning I can hardly move. I really need to take them. I understand according to my pharm. that the insurance won't pay for them because they can be bought over the counter.  What other name do they go by.

Muscle Spasm	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	55-64	5/22/2008 3:58:56 PM	I wrote earlier that I was taking this pill dispite the effects of shakes, dizziness, dry mouth and trouble urinating.  Unfortunately I had to stop due to after time my speech was also effected. No one could understand what I was saying and it was also becoming difficult to put thought into words.  The dry mouth was constant and nothing helped.  The other thing was I was also vomiting 3-4 times a day. Appetite almost nill.  Though the pills worked for my muscle spasm the side effects were just too many to deal with. They were effecting my daily life and being able to interact with family and friends.  This would be a great little pill for short term use but for me it just wasn't worth it.
Muscle Spasm	ekimserrot, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	3/11/2008 4:33:03 PM	After taking a few pills I did not like the effects.  I felt complete useless.  I was in a dumb funk, didn't want to do a thing.So I started taking them at night before bed and though I suffer from dizziness, shakes, trouble unrinating and still some confusion, it is still much better than taking them during the day.  The muscle spasm have lessened to almost 100%.  But because of my hep c, this is the only pill I can take that is safe for the liver.
