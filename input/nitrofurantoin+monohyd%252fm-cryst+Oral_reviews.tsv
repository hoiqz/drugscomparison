Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	elaine6s, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	8/24/2012 7:54:55 AM	I have frequent uti's and i am on my second round of this drug. On my first round i felt a little bit better but not completely cured until the last day (2 pills for 10 days). Now I'm starting again with a back pain and chills before starting so I'm hoping that after reading other reviews i have better results. My best results were when i was given cipro but i guess that is an overall antibiotic and cannot be given for just this problem.

First couple of days were ok but then I got very nauseated and actually vomited. Even after eating with the pill.  I am extremely tired but haven't noticed any headache symptoms like others have mentioned. I took the pill once a day for ten days. I don't think I will be asking for this again. Just didn't like taking it and how I felt afterward.

I am afraid to say that I have none of the problems everyone is complaining about and it has helped my UTI.  Weird.  And I don't necessarily eat when I take it.  I take only 1 in the morning and 1 at night (100myl) for 5 days.  I am almost done with them.
