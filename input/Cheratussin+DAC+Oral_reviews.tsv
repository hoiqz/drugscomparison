Cough	Blessed, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/4/2010 1:01:52 PM	This is my first time using this Cough Syrup. Remember to take it with a full glass of water. I have a lung condition: Broncholitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia, Chronic COPD, and had a lung biopsy. It has done very well for me as far as coughing goes, no problems with my appetite, it has helped the coughing alot and has loosened the mucus in my lungs and has been very productive. At first I had to take 10ml every 3 hrs. and have slowly been working down off of it. With my health condition being so rare with lung disease it's been a miracle drug to me..

It decreased his coughing but when a jag hits it is still horrendous.  Also although he sleeps he is still coughing heavily throughout the night. Does not appear to help with relieving congestion if anything it appears to be worse than when he started taking it.

I know I do sleep much better when taking it at night.  I am also taking Mucinex along with this for the chest congestion and its a miracle drug.
