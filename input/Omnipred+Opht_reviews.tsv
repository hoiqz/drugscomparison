Other	Just me, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	5/20/2011 2:59:39 PM	I have a stye/cyst inside eye socket that used to be a stye. Tried Tobradex for 5 weeks, didnt work. 2nd day of this omnipred, it burns and stings I hate to use it. Was told 4 times a day for a month. Just read the dangers and I am worried. I notice a dry eye now, but the intense itchiness is gone. I just have to tolerate the 3-4 minutes of stinging, not sure if its a fair trade. I am 51 yrs old, had the stye/cyst for 3 years. No medical insurance kept me from treatment. Light sensitivity made me go to the high priced Dr. I will quit the medicine if the stinging doesnt improve in a few days.
Other	Elmo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/25/2011 5:06:39 PM	My mom received this drop when she complained of extream dry eyes.  She was told by her doctor to use this drop 2-4 times a day.  She'd been on it for almost 20 days and she woke up with EXTREAM eye pain, headache and all sorts of issues...two days later the same thing.  She went to a specialist and they said she shouldn't have ever been put on this med.  for her problem.  This is crazy...after reading all these reviews I wonder why this drug is even on the market.  My mother now is being told that she might have developed glaucoma (close angled)and she has to have laser iridotomy to try to ensure she doesn't go blind!!!!! Anyone else with the same type of issue???
Severe Inflammation of the Eye	drmkachr, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	55-64	8/15/2010 8:44:46 AM	Although this medication did help me initially, I was devastated when I learned that because of continued use as prescribed by my physician, I now have cataracts that are obstructing my vision.  I was not able to read the very small print on the drug insert and was NEVER told of this possibility until recently.  I feel as if I could have been tapered off of this medication earlier. 
Inflammation of the Eye Following Surgery	FromThere2Here, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	55-64	6/26/2010 3:34:58 AM	I had cataract surgery two days ago, with a followup with the eye doc today. I began using Omnipred the day after surgery, as prescribed. But every time I use it, I experience INTENSE burning (feels like pouring lemon juice on a paper cut). Is this normal? How long will it last? I have to use it 4X/day - I'm now dreading each time I do. The Nevanac &amp; Vigamox burn a little, but not like the Omnipred! (&amp; yes, I am using them at least 5 minutes apart).
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	4	Female	55-64	4/28/2010 9:17:41 AM	I used a few days before surgery for glaucoma and couple of weeks after surgery to prevent infection.  As far as I know, it worked.  I also had the white film on my bottom lid which I had to remove. My question is did this make anyone else gain weight that they could not lose?
Other	penguin, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	3	Female	65-74	2/26/2010 9:23:58 PM	What was first diagnosed as an ulcer with a tear, was later found to be Nodular Scleritis, of unknown systemic origin.First treated with Vigamox to no avail, then agressively with Omnipred, 1 drop every hour for 16 hours,then every 2 hours for the next 3 days. I am getting some relief from the pain and the trobbing (when bending over) is has lessened. I have have been told that this medication can cause several unvanted side effects, such as Cataracts,even Glaucoma. I am concerned about using this product, I am noticing more sensitivity to light and a 'cold'dry feeling to the eye. I understand That there is a tapering off process nescessary when stopping this med. My eye doctor is following me closely (almost daily) but still I wonder, Is there a time period in which the benefits  outway the side effects? Will bee seen again on Monday.
Other	redeyes, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	1/22/2010 11:11:21 AM	I had cataract surgery on my right eye in November, and the left eye in December. I was given Omnipred to use. Four drops daily for four weeks. After I stopped using the drops my eyes became sensitive to light and the eye became extremely painful. I am still using the drops in both eyes. I am down to one drop a day in the right eye and the pain and sensitivity is back. I had to go back to two drops today. If I had read any of the reviews before I think I would have asked for a different drug. I keep asking my self if I would ever be off this drug. 
Inflammation of the Eye Following Surgery	medeye, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	35-44	6/9/2009 8:59:29 PM	I had lasik surgery and placed under this medication.  Immediately after one drop per eye, my eye sight gets blurry, whitish cloud over my eyes, then I close my eyes for 3 minutes and the fogginess leaves.  My drop back is that it leaves or creates a white mucus film around the bottom eye lid and have to remove it using q-tip or tissue.  Maybe this is the end result and kills bacteria.  
Inflammation of the Eye Following Surgery	Queenie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	2/16/2009 5:54:58 PM	I had cataract surgery in both eyes.  The first surgery was in December and the second was in January.  I cannot take less then 2 drops per day.  After taking one drop beginning Thursday morning, by Friday morning by eyes became red, inflamed, and sensitive to light. My eyes were even sensitive while wearing the medical sunglasses. By Saturday morning I could not take the pain and called my doctor.  He told me to go back to three drops a day in each eye.  Now my doctor has prescribed another medication, so I will see how this works.It was very comforting to know that I am not the only person experiencing these side effects from this medication.  I was beginning to feel like a weirdo. 
Other	The Yeti, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	35-44	12/12/2008 12:54:42 AM	I had cataracts in both eyes, am 44. Started this med 2 days prior to first operation and followed that with 2 weeks of use. Started this med in second eye two days prior to stopping drops in first eye. After second operation I had to continue this med in second eye for two weeks. Stopped this med, going from 4 drops per day to 0. Within 4 days my first eye started watering, ached, and could not stand light. Went to eye doctor and was told 2% of people who use this med CANNOT stop cold turkey, they have to gradually taper off. Had to use this med 1 drop per hour for 4 days, then 1 drop per two hours for 3 day (this is where I am now) and then will start with one drop per 4 hours for I do not know how long, I go back to the eye doctor in 2 days.
