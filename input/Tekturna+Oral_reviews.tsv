High Blood Pressure	skibo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/30/2012 5:20:42 AM	I have been on this medicine for about 3 to 4 years now. I show no symptoms of side effects as of yet but since checking this med again i have some blood sugar problems now,but not sure if this drug has caused it. The normally prescribed drugs for high blood pressure was causing me to lose sleep as I was always waking up exhausted, I also was constantly waking out of complete sleep on regular blood pressure medicine before be placed on tekturna. It works for me. 
High Blood Pressure	TimDozer, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	7/10/2012 1:43:16 AM	The first time pill I took, within 1 hour I was feeling weak.  The doctor office said to keep taking it so my body would get use to it si I stuck with the program even though I would feel weak like I was going into shock.  I made it two weeks and I threw the stuff out and called my doctor and said I quit.I only have one kidney.  I was urinating less and felt weak on Tekturna.  After a couple days of being off of it I started feeling better.  My creatinine(sp) readings are normally around 1.5 to 1.6.  I'm a big guy, bones and muscle so...I have a little bit of kidney damage before Tekturna ad the weakness and less urine made me panic so I tossed it out.  I only have this one kidney to live on.  It's gotta last.

Wild swing in BP from 111/68 to 196/111, which was part of the original problem but all in the upper range.  I was weak before but as much or moreso now, plus fuzzy brain blurry bloodshot eyes and chest and muscle pain.  Chest pain which the dr attributes to reflux, (have had long term reflux but controlled.  Overall feel miserable.   also take 2 doxytosin at nite - sllep well, groggy all day, do one chore and am wiped out.  Force myself to walk briskly 1-2 miles daily.

This medication has done great bringing my pressures down from 162/110 down to 106/78. I am sure my body likes these numbers but I cannot tolerate feeling so crappy so much of the time. I already have fibromyalgia and spinal pain, so the additioal painfullness from Tekturna is not a welcome feeling.
High Blood Pressure	Vocrin, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	12/17/2011 6:20:01 PM	Tekturna has been a bad experience for me. Because ARBs and ACE inhibitors were not working so well anymore, I was switched to Tekturna. The first day I took 150 mg of Tekturna with a small rise in BP. The second morning, I took 300 mg of Tekturna and quickly developed a piercing headache (and I rarely get headaches for any reason) and felt very &quot;unwell&quot;, and by the afternoon, my blood pressure had risen from 140/90 to an ALL TIME RECORD HIGH for me - 170/100! I woke up the third day with a very sore throat (which eased after aspirin). My waking BP on the third day was 138/89 (after taking 2.5 mg xanax to lower my dangerous BP the night before), but after 150 mg of Tekturna, my BP soared to 159/92 and is still rising.

The tekturna 300+hct has brought it down from 180/100 to 117/67 in 3 mo.  Only side effects experienced have been an unproductive cough and occ pain in kidney area, as well as decreased libido. It is expensive--$3+/day, as compared to the generics, which run $10/for 3 mo. I'm hoping to be able to decrease dosage to 150mg in a month or so.

Went from 150mg, to 300mg till now on 600mg 1x daily. This was 1st BP w/no reactions for 1 1/2yr. Now I can't even step outside if it's to hot and humid.

I was very hopeful in the beginning , but now I can't walk w/out holding a cane I 'm so afraid of how quickly I get hit,sweats,dizzy,nausea,complete feeling ill. I've stopped driving for fear I will get sick and injure people.  It's no fun. Toss in nausea Meds and my day is shot. I just started getting what Dr said is a high BP headaches.

High Blood Pressure	Na'Themba, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	5/27/2010 1:19:13 PM	I have had borderline hypertensive readings for over five years: up to 140/90, down to 94/72. But over the past year, the readings have been at the high end. So my GP prescribed 150mg Tekturna per day for six weeks. My blood pressure went down to 127/80, but those were six miserable weeks.It was as if I never quite woke up. I was sleepy and in a dream state all 'waking' hours, every day, except twice when I deliberately did not dose in order to get some urgent work done. My supervisor and I had words regarding my suddenly lackluster performance at work, and this was after I took up a Starbucks habit just to get through the day. I was so sluggish that my blood sugar readings rose nearly 100 points, on average, so that I had to increase my insulin dosage. My blood glucose levels are sensitive the the amount of activity in which I engage, and I am usual moving constantly. I didn't move unless I absolutely had to while taking Tekturna. It was a major effort just to type an email.Then there was the hyperhydrosis. I have never sweated so profusely in my life. Co-workers were alarmed when the least bit of movement caused me to sweat profusely. I sometimes soaked through an entire set of clothing within fifteen minutes just by walking (slowly) for three minutes.I'm glad some people find benefits with this treatment. However, I am loving life now that I've stopped the treatment and moved on to a diuretic.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	12/27/2009 5:45:09 PM	I will not take this drug again! Just after five days I experienced extreme fatigue, severe lower back pain, especially around my kidneys, and pain in the heels of my feet. Could not sleep more that two hours at a time. I took myself off of this drug this morning, and by late afternoon symptoms  started to subside. Will discuss with my dr.

I am having several side effects. It has brought my bp down but its too low now with bp of 100/50 with pulse in the 40/50 range. I'm tried, dizzy, itching, feel sick to my stomach, heaviness in chest, and a lot of pain in my feet. I agree with the person who said bp is a very scary thing when nothing seems to work. I also take 2Lisinopril/HCTZ 20-12.5,Isosorb Mono 30mg. ER, and Atenolol 25mg. 1/2 tablet a day. Also, I have been just the opposite of most patients, instead of putting on weight, for now I'm losing. (Good side effect for me)To go along with everything else I also have irregular heartbeat. Anyone else?
High Blood Pressure	Sandra, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	9/5/2009 11:31:07 PM	On Tekturna - side effects after taking for 2 months gained 12 lbs, watery eyes, lower back pain, bloating, severe headaches and swollen gums. Can't sleep more than 3-4 hours at night on this med. Stopped taking two days ago to see if this clears side effects up. Looking for natural bp relief!

Had none of these symptoms prior to BP meds.Now taking 150 and am considering discontinue med entirely.  Lowered my BP to 117/but side effects especially weight gain is not worth it.  WIll try exercise, eating right and taking no meds for awhile and see how that works.  I also take Simavastin which I may continue if no side effects.

However, I have some kind of a skin condition on my hands...dry, cracking, bleeding, hurt, etc which I have not had before. It started shortly after I started taking Tekturna &amp; I don't knonw if it is related or not. Anybody have a similar experience?

High Blood Pressure	Leona, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	5/5/2009 10:47:38 AM	I started on 150 mg Tekturna  with good results.  However, my BP increased to around 140/100 after 7 months.  The medication was supplemented with 25 mg HCT and I started feeling dizzy with no improvement in lowering my BP.  Recently, 300 mg Tekturna was prescribed and I am now experiencing lower back pains and tenderness in those same areas.  I stopped taking the  pills for now until I see my doctor soon.  
High Blood Pressure	nursede, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/3/2009 3:33:11 PM	No side effects for me, BP is well mamaged now after failing 2 other medications previously. My biggest concern for this medication is the cost of one month supply of 300 mg. tablet's. I learned it would cost me $107.00 a month. I am on samples now, but my doctor will have to Rx something more cost effictive for me. I find the med to be more than a scam on the price, shame on you Novartis. This is only medication, not a medical procedure. There are more meds out there than your's that I can afford. Maybe you could cut down on your advertisement and stop taking all those costly meals and gifts to medical professionals to &quot;sell&quot; your products!! Yes I am a nurse and I know much about you Pharmaceutical companies, been there, done that!!  Yes, SHAME on you!!

I qit taking Tekturna, and now I am back on Lotensin, and after 5 days on my normal drug....I am still experiencing dizzyness, and some disorientation, and I don't dare drive. Hope this wears off...

High Blood Pressure	reel fun, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	65-74	3/31/2009 1:36:45 PM	I immediately developed a toxic reaction to the drug.  I only took 9 doses.  I had a fever(104.6)first and took aspirin for that which exacerbated the toxic reaction and that led to renal and liver failure.  I was hospitalized for 5 days.  BUN, creatnine, and bilirubin finally started to come down and I was able to avoid dialysis.  Effects have lasted for months.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	65-74	3/7/2009 11:33:16 AM	My Family Practitioner prescribed 1/2 of a 150mg Tekturna once daily, as an adjunct to other BP meds that I was already taking (Atenolol, Verapamil,Terazosin, &amp; Indapamide), in an attempt to control an elevated systolic BP. The first night that I took it my nose started running and my eyes watered all night. The watering eyes had stopped by mid morning the next day, but my nose was still running. I called my MD, and he was a little surprised that I had suffered the side effects with such a low dose. He said, however, to stop the Tekturna. The runny nose was better by evening but took another day to essentially resolve itself.

I also take Diavan HCt 320/25, Folic Acid 2mg,Plavix 75mg, Lipitol 20 mg, Coumadin 5 mg, Norvase 5 mg.  Could this be interacting with any of these to cause the rash?  I have an appointment with a dermatoligist next month per my primary physician because he doesn't know what's causing it.

High Blood Pressure	sherloc , 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	55-64	1/7/2009 9:42:42 PM	I have been on this medication for a few months, My docotor included Amlodipine 5mg, now I am up to 10 with 300 mg Tekturna..My legs are swelling now with itching and extreme exhaustion. This is the fourth drug combo I have been on. Other drugs worked for a while, then.. side effects..I am changing my lifestyle; exercise,I have eliminated most meats, eating more fruits and veggies.. It has to be a better way to control this.. Why is there such an increase in this medical problem? Everyone cannot have high blood pressure without reason?, even if it is hereditary. what is happening?.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	12/30/2008 11:20:02 AM	Difficult to control HBP runs in family. Started Tekturna 300 mg when side effects from both CCB and ACE were not tolerable. Drug worked okay (BP 130/85) for first year then lost effectiveness. Along with decreased effectiveness came worsening side effects most notably pre-ventricle contractions (about every third heartbeat) and fatigue. BP readings as high as 151/121 recorded on Tekturna. Three weeks after switching medications, my BP is 110/80, fatigue is gone and heart rhythm greatly improved. This was not the drug for me.

Have taken Tekturna 150 along with Bystolic 10 and HCl 25 for about 4 mos.  this is the first combination that has successfully reduced my BP to below 140/ 90, so I feel I am stuck with it.  However, was on Bystolic alone at first, so, other than fatigue, all symptoms seem to be from Tekturna, ie: dry caugh, occasional acid reflux, continuous runny nose.  Noticing some hair loss.  Has anyone experienced sore teeth and sores inside the mouth from biting the inside of your cheek while sleeping?

Start with it 4 months ago with other one for cholesterol: Crestor 10mg. Most of the presriptions I take, and the ones I stop taking, suppose to produce simmilar side effects.

I always research new drugs before taking it.  However from the problems that most of you exhibit I will not take it.  Since 1996 I have been disabled with weak muscle syndrome and has been barely ambulatory in rehab for 1yr and 7 mths.  I am currently on leave from work because of said problem which developed from long term use of HCTZ.  Chronic lower back pain and hair loss is also present.

Previously, my fasting glucose was from 98-108.I exercise daily and watch my diet, with emphasis on vegetables and fruits. Are these side effects due to Tektuna?

Began with 150 and now up to 300mg. Noticed water retention in feet and legs immediately, but hoped it would get better. The last few months I have experienced &quot;arthritis-like pain in my joints, especially my fingers, knuckles and knees -- very painfully (almost debilitating). Have experienced some hair loss and thinning also. Am contacting my doctor this week to attempt to come off this med and find something else. It has brought my BP down, but I now cannot deal with all these side effects! Took Cozaar for years with no side effects, but it got to the point it was not controlling my BP as well as my doctor hoped.

Has anyone experienced increased libido?  My husband swears that my sex drive has increased since I started taking Tekturna.  He is not complaining and neither am I, but I wondered whether anyone else has experienced this?  My Dr. said that he doesn't have enough people on it to make a study.

I would consider that an undesirable side effect for any drug but especially one for blood pressure.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	11/13/2007 1:28:23 AM	I have experienced hair loss, intense muscle fatigue, and brain fog.  At times the nerve endings in my body feel very tender, almost like a burning sensation.  This drug does stay in my system longer than 24 hours, so I am trying to reduce my dosing to every other day. I began at 150 mgs. and am now taking 300 mgs every other day. I have tried every other family of blood pressure medicines, so I guess I could say this is the drug of last resort for me.
