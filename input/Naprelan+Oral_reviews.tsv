Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/5/2011 1:18:46 AM	I have had Lyme Disease for 18 years and as I have gotten older (now 46) joint and muscle pain has become increasingly worse. In 2009 I was prescribed opiates and the like for pain, but they were not for me - This drug is the miracle pill for me, and, despite the warnings, sonograms, mri's and cat-scans show NO CHANGES in my cardiovascular system.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	4/21/2011 8:25:50 PM	I am age 54 and I was diagnosed with severe athritis in my right knee. Dr. prescribed this for a flare-up for intense pain, it immediately worked. However, I have developed a severe rash with blisters on my chest, underarm and back. I stopped taking it and will be seeing my Dr. asap.

Other	MC56, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	5/20/2010 3:56:26 PM	I had foot surgery (left) to remove a bunion. My podiatrist put me on 500mg Naprelan twice per day. My right foot became swollen as a result of favoring the left foot while in a cast and now a boot, but now the right ankle has pitting edema. I read on WebMD that NSAIDS (naproxen) can result in edema. I didn't experience the edema until after beginning the Naprelan. I wonder if there is a connection.  It is worrisome and I hope it goes away once I'm off the Naprelan. Has anyone else experienced similar reactions?

Pain	Shay, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	1/12/2010 1:30:03 PM	My name is Sharon Spencer and 53 yrs. old and I was prescribed this Naprelan Tab/500mg for possible Siatic nerve pain? I had a Heart Attack/2 stents-2003, and again 1-6-10 and bllod clot formed and went to bottom chamber. I need to know if this medicine will cause harm due to my recent events. I have been put on Atenolol-25mg., Enalipril-2.5mg., and Plavix-75mg. I forgot to tell my Cardiologist, but after reading the precautions, I'm not sure I should be taking this. I really like the way it works, but if it can cause blood clots, I need to know.
Other	smcl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	45-54	9/23/2009 12:18:30 PM	I took naprelan for back back and occasional numbness in my arms. It worked well for the pain, however i had to stop taking it because of serious heartburn and swelling of the legs and feet.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/29/2009 6:37:03 PM	I had foot surgery and went from oxycoten (sp?) to this to relieve pain and swelling. I have not had any pain at all. I like it because I only have to take it once a day.

Other	satchmo, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	25-34	10/26/2007 9:35:52 AM	This medication works very well for post-op swelling in my knee.  However, it took so long for the medication to sustain itself in my bloodstream, that by the time it was constantly effective, it was time for a refill.  Also, once I came off of it, the pain was immense, so I had to start all over again.  It does the job, I just wish there was a less expensive means to this solution.
