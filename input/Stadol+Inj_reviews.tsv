Labor Pain	tristaj90, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/18/2012 6:48:15 PM	The medicine was great for my labor pain. I was given it at 4 cm dilated because I didn't want a epidural too early. It allowed me to sleep in between contractions (and I actually didn't feel much during my contractions). The only thing I didn't like was that it made me so out of it-I felt like I was having an out of body experience, and I felt out of control of myself. Other than that, it was a great medication for labor pain!

Toridal, Imitrex, etc. did nothing to stop the pain or the vomiting (which is continuos.)  Stadol along with Vistaral has been a life saver!  The only time it doesn't work as well is if I wake up with a full blown migraine. Even then if I can get the Stadol in my system it will allow me to sleep long enough to get through the worst of it.

Use for blinding headaches as a last resort. Only use when I'm prepared to stay home in bed as dizziness is a side effect but it's worth it for the pain relief I receive. Rx bottle is very small amount.
Additional Agent to Induce General Anesthesia	Jaycee2311, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1	Female	55-64	6/29/2011 8:46:22 PM	My Dr. used this drug on me a few days Monday of this week when I was getting a colonoscopy and an endoscopy, along with some Zophran and Versed.   It was the most terrible experience. I rasied up as best I could and told the nurse I was dying and asked where the Dr. was.  She told me it was just the meds that I was alright. When he started the procedure I was still awake but felt like I was dying. Rapid heart rate and I told them I could still feel everything he was doing, he said give her some more Versed. I was so drunk I remember nothing about the trip home and about 2:30 in the morning I thought I was going to have to go to the ER.  I was on fire and in the throws of a full-blown panic attack.  Shortness of breath, rapid heart rate.  I did not go but I felt like I was way out of control. Eventually I calmed down enough to slow my heart rate and breathing down. I had Zophran &amp; Versed the last time I had this done so I know that it had to be the Stadol that caused this reaction.  It would remind you of the effects that women say that date-rape drug has on you.  I felt like a rag doll and absolutely powerless to do anything about it!! No, I would not reccommend this to anyone. This drug is great for people who just want to get high!! For me never again!!
Labor Pain	Beth, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	6/29/2011 9:58:21 AM	A horrible experience.  The drug did NOTHING for pain. I could not speak, felt dizzy and out of control.  The labor was excrutiating. I was on pitocin and unable to communicate or even move. 26 hour labor, 4 hours pushing.
Pain	mrs migraine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/19/2011 10:40:35 AM	stadol is one of only two medications that will stop my migraine headaches. it works very well, very quickly and helps me rest.
Labor Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/29/2011 1:47:47 AM	I was given this medication during labor, it was enough to reduce the intensity of the contractions.  Allowing my body to rest and recover prior to delivery.  This was a good pain medicine for me, and I did not need an epideral.

The doctor told me that they are 100 times worse than migraines. I tired everything...literally. The first time I had one I had to drive 2hrs from  where I lived beacuse the doctors didnt know what was wrong. Once i got there I was put in the hospital for three days for stroke like symtoms the whole right side of my body was numb my eye was almost completly closed. They were coming so frequently that I was in the er so many times it was becoming emmbarrasing.Once I found what it was andwhat worked for me it was the best relief ever. I have my Stadol nasal spray and my Imitex stat dose pluse Oxygen. Usually I can keep them at bay with my Stadol but once they get to a point where I just cant stand it anymore then I have to use the shots and oxygen. But the Stadol alone helps me alot. If I catch them in time.
Pain	chetb1976, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/2/2010 1:02:56 PM	I have had chronic daily headaches and migraines for the past 20 years. I have been on every pain med there is, and the stadol spray seemed to usually always work. I have had injections at my doctor's office, and usually in the ER I would get demerol &amp; phenergan or nubain. It seemed like the nubain worked better when I had to go into the doctor. I have been on hydrocodone, ultram, demerol pills, talacen, oxycontin &amp; now take oxycodone up to 6 per day. The best thing that works for me is called Dihydroergotamine. It is an injection, the same med that is in Migranal spray. I give it to myself IM with an oxycodone &amp; it usually knocks out the pain!! But my doctor only wants me to use it once or twice a week! I'm asking about Stadol spray &amp; injection when I go back this month!! 
Pain	Riverlady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	10/25/2010 7:33:26 AM	It has been used by the E.R. lately when I go in for a Migraine or Muscle Tension Headache, sometimes for both at once, with Toridol.I find it often isn't as effective on my Muscle Tension Headaches without even just a little oral Valume because it does not have the same relaxing effect as Nubain but in light of the Nubain shortage I'm glad it's there because there is little I don't have an adverse reaction to but recomend avoiding regular use of Stadol.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	8/29/2010 2:23:07 AM	I'm sorry for the people who have had addiction problems with this medication. But, if used as directed, and not abused, this medication is an excellent rescue med for severe migraines. It can be addictive, but so can vicodin, hydrocodone, etc. I think stadol is less addictive. I've been on alot of different pain meds, and in my experience, people who suffer chronic, severe pain aren't looking to get high, they are looking for relief from chronic, severe daily pain. Stadol provides that. The overall effect is one of pain relief but it's not a &quot;nice high&quot; - it can make me a bit nauseous, anxious, groggy; it tastes awful, and if too much is taken, can cause rebound. Why would I put myself through all that just to feel &quot;high&quot;? And blaming the dr. for a patient's abusing their prescription is not very mature. The dr. prescribes; if the patient abuses or drug seeks, that's on the patient. Unless the dr. was negligent, it's the patient who needs to take responsibility for their own addictive behavior.

I wanted MORE and MORE of it and they wouldn't give it to me.  The only way I could get off of it was to get on Suboxone.  I would say that STADOL NS ruined my life!!!!
Pain	grammiek88glv, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	35-44	5/25/2010 8:10:27 PM	My use of stadol nasal spray was my miracle worker for few years it is just now starting to take more and more to take the edge off of my migraines.
Labor Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/13/2010 9:38:26 PM	I was given Stadol while in labor and it was too early for an epidural. I became so light headed and dizzy that I could not even hold my head up. Labor was harder due to my dizziness and I couldn't even hold my baby after birth because I was afraid of dropping her. It did not help the pain, just made me feel drunk and out of it. Also made me extremley emotional due to feeling lack of control. do not recommend using for labor pains!

It may work, but the long term effects are not worth it. It is highly addicitive and actually caused rebound migraines when my wife was not using it, which progressively got worse. we are now trying to detox her from it and the whole family is suffering. rehab won't take her since it was used as prescribed. Here is how this drug reduced my families quality of life... she would get a nubain shot and then come home and when that started to wear off, she would spray stadol to keep the migraine at bay. You ever seen anyone fall asleep while eating? And then continue to eat while asleep? How about trying to talk to them while they are in and out of consciousness? How about this repeating itself every night for at least the last two months? How about having children that I now have to explain why mommy snaps at them, and I can't leave her alone out of fear? It may work, but it intended as a very short term pain reliever, not for month after month. I am going to fight to have her doctors medical license pulled for this regimen, and because he is a horrible doctor who just writes prescriptions for whatever the drug rep brings. Good luck to all of you that have been on this for awhile...if you ever want to try an alternative method to solve your migraines, the detox from this is not fun for anyone.
Pain	Jules32569, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/1/2009 1:52:41 PM	Stadol NS works somewhat for my migraines, depending on how long I have had them. When worse comes to worse, my saviour, my beloved doctor , gives my a shot in the in the office, &amp; by the time I hit the car I am out for the next 13-15 hours! Thank you sfor Stadol! Other than Dilaudid, which I strongly try to avoid, it works beautifully for me!!!!!!! 
Pain	GrandmaG, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/4/2009 9:33:05 PM	I have used the nasal spray form of this medication and it works great.  I am allergic to many other medications, but have no problem with Stadol.  Fast, effective relief for Migraine pain and I can function!  It has been a godsend!  Saves me from a trip to the ER for those really bad days!  Only downside, my doctor doesn't like to prescribe it, so every refill is a hassle.  His PA originally subscribed it and he has been P.O.'d about it ever since (two years now).  I think it is a much better alternative to Vicodin or other pain relievers I can tolerate.  Wish he wasn't so biased against it!
Pain	Heather, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	11/2/2009 4:56:33 AM	Although it is the only medication I have found to rid myself of a migraine, it also has an after effect of another headache, thus contnual use. Also, while on it I get a sense of out of self, a detachment. I find it a very odd mental state. I often can't wait until the drug wears off because the mental state can become so uncomfortable.

I have used so very many pain medications and migraine remedies to no effect.  Stadol has given me my life back.  I use the inhaler.  It works fast and since I use it according to instructions, it has produced no side effects.  My only complaint is that it wears off after a few hours.  I for one, can't live without it.  Chronic pain is a life stealer.  Don't be afraid of pain medicine but don't abuse it either.
Pain	blue frog, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	35-44	10/18/2009 3:33:21 AM	was given this shot for very bad back pain, worked wonders on the pain, but I hallucinated pretty heavy for awhile and got some strong chest pains that lasted less then a minute, could not edit thoughts to spoken words...said some pretty embarassing things in the doctors waiting room waiting to check out. Drenched the car seat in sweat by the time I got home. despite those effects, I would use it again if offered for the kind of pain my back was in- had a golf ball sized knot on my lower back near my spine. It also finally let me get some needed sleep.

I can't take triptans and am allergic to almost everything else.  I must admit the Stadol NS does knock me out!  However, when I have a migraine that is exactly what I want! I also caution, I am very aware of it's addictive nature; and I do not have an addictive personality or tendancies.  Caution.
Pain	cairo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/17/2009 1:27:22 PM	I use this medication for the pain of severe migraine headaches, with extreme pain in my left eye with all of them. Most of the time used in conjunction with Zomig Nasal Spray or Migranal Nasal Spray and an anti emetic it works very well sometimes to the point where I can actually function to a certain degree even with a migraine. I have had these migraines since I was a very young child as have all of the women in my family. Stadol works better than any other pain reliever I have ever used. Anything I try to take by mouth during a migraine I immediately throw up. Stadol is a nasal spray and works fairly quickly, and I don't throw it up because it is a nasal spray. I have also found that ice packs on my head help. I have found that because the Stadol is so effective in controlling the pain I get in my left eye, that once that is controlled the migraine often won't progress to the point of vomiting and doesn't seem to last as long. In the past prior to the Stadol my migraines could last for several days.  I will occasionally get one that will last for 2 days at this point in time, but rarely one that lasts longer than that.

Labor Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/15/2009 7:29:26 PM	This drug proved to be inefective during  my labor process. It di not relieve my pain, but instead left me in a state of mind where I felt I was not incontrol of my suroundings. I felt light headed as if my mind was elsewhere. It made me very emotional making me want to cry over everything, and when my baby was born, he wouldn't stop crying. My postpartum nurse said the pain meds can get to the baby and make them cranky. My nurse said the medication would only stay in my system for two hours, but it was in me for 7 hours.I couldn't hold my baby due to the medication making me feel like I would lose control of my body and I would drop the baby. I do not reccomend Stadol for labor pain relief.

I was tod about it after it was already put in my IV. I was wrongly told what te drug was for and I was not informed of any side effects except for the drowsiness. I didn't ask for nor need any other pain medication as I had already had an epidural. I wound up having the side effect of a sense of false security, i.e. it made me paranoid. That was the most scared I've been in a long time.

I drifted in and out of consciousness for several hours and hallucinated quite a bit.
