Emphysema	Older One, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	65-74	8/16/2012 4:20:22 PM	Several times immediately after taking the drug I was forced to use a rescue inhaler in order to breathe.  Also, I think the drug affects the heart pulse rate (pulse will vary between 40 and 90 BPM within a short period of time - aproximately one minute).

Asthma	J., 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	35-44	6/6/2011 10:53:36 AM	From day 1, I had severe headaches.  Especially after taking Advair before I went to bed, I would wake up with a really bad headache.Also started having bad muscle cramps in my feet and hands.  Which is why my doctor took my off of Symbicort.  Symbicort was about the same, worked great but had constant muscle cramps.I took myself off it, and those symptoms stopped.  My back isn't hurting anymore either.

Allergic Asthma	Kitty, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	65-74	11/5/2010 12:47:50 PM	I've always had allergies but as I became a senior (over60)I began having a problem smoothering and could not understand why.  My doctor said I had developed asthma because of my allergies.  She decided to prescribe advair and in the beginning prescribed the 250/50 twice a day for about 2 months and when my lungs cleared and my breathing improved she decided to prescribe the 100/50 twice a day.  After about 2 months I now only use the 100/50 once a day, at night before I go to bed, and I now use my emergency inhaler only occasionally.  I don't seem to have any side affects but sometimes I worry about the steriods and the dry powder going into my lungs.  I'm not sure what the long term affects are as I've only been using Advair for about 3 years.

Asthma	Lovean, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	3/5/2010 8:58:57 PM	This medicine did help my breathing but it sent my blood pressure thru the roof.  That makes this asthma situation a double edge sword... do you die because you can't breathe or because of a stroke?  Either way, I am unable to carry out normal everyday duties nor am I able to carry on a normal life.  Other side effects are weight gain, irritability, sudden bouts of crying and general malaise.
Asthma	35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5		35-44	3/5/2010 6:32:46 PM	I had problems with oral irritation from the diskus dispite agressive rinsing and gargling after use to the point that our diet was going change.  Also, the dry powder irritated my vocal cords, which is bad for singers.I love the Hfa version and highly recommend it.  My only complaint is that you have to take two puffs instead of one.

Asthma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/12/2009 9:23:25 AM	I read the review about the child having major behavior problems after starting Advair.  I am wondering if that is our problem.  Our daughter was very sweet and kind until 4 when she started Advair.  We have had demanding, screaming fits since then and there is no major changes to cause this.  I forgot her Advair (which we rarely do) the other morning and I realized we had no fits.  This morning she woke up pleasant and within 2 minutes of administering the Advair, she errupted.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this???

Asthma	Gail, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	4/14/2009 12:30:36 PM	I was recently diagnosed with Asthma. A big surprise since I have NEVER had breathing problems before. They say that it may be allergy triggered. I wonder if it has to do with the fact that I had walking pneumonia the first of the year. That's when the problem started. They have me using the Advair disc, inhaler and a nebulizer. I was amazed. I could actually SLEEP again! Then, after I had been using it for about a month, I started having really bad cramps. At night, my toes, feet, calves, and thighs cramp. I jump out of bed several times a night. During the day, my fingers and hands cramp really bad. Once it starts, it will sometimes go on for an hour. It's very painful. Sometimes happens when I am doing nothing, but mostly starts when I grasp something. Like using a pen to write or holding a knife and fork to cut up my food. My doctor says that it may be the albuterol and suggested that I cut back on the usage. I gradually got off of the disc. I use the nebulizer every other day, unless I feel like I really need to use it. I use the inhaler when I feel like I need it. I still have the cramps, but not as often. Does anyone else have a problem with cramps??

This is the salmeterol/fluticasone one. I had a dry mouth for awhile and chewed gum. I did not know it had so many side effects though.
Asthma	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	3/25/2009 10:36:02 AM	I have asthma(just found out) and bronchitis.  This drug doesn't make people gain weight, if anything you lose it. These people are probably unhealthy and do not work out. This thing does work great, but does sometimes lead to getting headaches a little easier and can make some people wheeze or lose their voice for sure.  great drug none the less.

Asthma	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	11/12/2008 2:19:09 AM	I find Advair to be pretty effective in helping to control my Asthma and Allergies. I am all over the place in Asthma and Allergy symptoms, so it's hard to treat with just one drug. However, Advair and Singulaire together seem to be controlling it at the moment.My only issue with Advair is the dry mouth. I was advised to rinse out my mouth after taking to prevent this, but I noticed recently the water coming out of this is yellow. I'm a little concerned about what that could be, but because of it's benefits I can overlook it.

I did experience some difficulties with losing my voice and had to wean off of the medication. I am a teacher and definately need my voice!  But it is effective to get your asthma under control.

The results were amazing, but soon after starting the routine, I lost my voice and had major issues talking, singing was an impossibility. My doctor swithced me to Symbicort and it is working great. 
Asthma	Mom,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	5	3	Female		5/12/2008 10:41:28 PM	My elementary school daughter has asthma due to chronic sinusitus and takes Advair to help her manage the asthma.  Daily, she complains of severe stomach aches.  She's now on Prevacid to help control stomach acid yet she is going to the school nurse two times a day in severe pain.  We've tried Mylanta and her teacher allows her to snack when she feels the stomach ache coming on.  Has anyone experienced this side affect?  Suggestions for improving quality of life?

Lately my grandaugher (who lives with me and her mother) has become very combative and her behavior is one of crying, screaming, demanding and uncontrolable. Does the affect of the steriod have anything to do with this new behavior??? Please help!!!!!!!!!Shas has recently moved in with me (she has wanted to for over a year now) and since she has been prescribed the Advair her behavior has changed dramidically.
Other	aniswrt, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	55-64	12/17/2007 10:40:25 PM	My biggest problem with this medication is that if I use it as prescribed, I end up with the flu symptoms but it isn't as bad as asmanex because I can take it only one puff at a time which works okay. I have allergies and it helps contain them but it makes my feet hurt terribly. I guess that's musculoskeletal pain. I can't take it too many days in a row but when I do take it, it is effective. I guess I'm just intolerant to some of it's effects.
