High Cholesterol	Traci0216, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/18/2012 12:30:03 PM	Read many of the reviews for this drug and was nervous about starting it but my numbers have been borderline high for 2 years and my Dr. didnt give me a choice anymore. She started me on 20 mg &amp; wanted me to try it for 2 months to see how it worked. My Dr. told me to take it at bedtime &amp; so did the pharmacist who also said eat a light snack with it. Every night for the last 2 months I make a piece of toast before bed and then take my Lipitor. The first week and a half I had 3 bad nausea spells but not 100% sure it was due to the Lipitor as I also have HBP. My Dr. told me &quot;if&quot; I was going to have any side effects I would notice them the 1st two weeks. I did notice some sharp shooting pains in my legs from time to time but it only lasted a few minutes. But then it stopped and I havent had any issues since. Went back last week for my 2 month check up and all my numbers went down significantly! Both she &amp; I are very happy about that so for now I am continuing with Lipitor. I am on the generic version which I run through my insurance instead for $15 instead of paying Walmart's higher cash price. But if you cant get the generic (cant get the $4 price unfortunately with the generic) Lipitor has a $4 card you can get through their website and you can use that at Walmart or any pharmacy.

High Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/12/2012 1:05:28 PM	After a month on 20mg of Lipitor daily, my total cholesterol went from 270 to 180. But my followup blood test show that the Lipitor has my liver readings above normal. So, my doctor is having me try 20 mg Lipitor every other day instead of daily, and add 200mg of Co-Q10 daily. We shall see if this will work to keep my cholesterol down and my liver happy.

(this had been going on for at least 6 - 9 months befor I mentioned it to my Dr.).  Dr. immediately said STOP LIPITOR. I have not taken Lipitor for at least 9 months &amp; my muscles in upper arm stil &quot;ocasionally&quot; are achey. I am wondering if the Statins are not stored in mucle &amp; are not &quot;Gradually&quot; leaving?

First noticed my sugars were greatly increased. My A1C the month before starting Lipitor was 5.6. The month after I took Lipitor i was 7.2. As soon as I stopped, my sugars fell but are still kind of high. Also had terrible shortness of breath - would wake up feeling like someone had a pillow over my face, restless leg syngdrome and a deep chest, dry cough. Again, these symptoms disappeared when stopping Lipitor but I just haven't felt the same since then and am having big trouble controlling my sugars. The drug isn't worth the side effects in my opinion.

High Cholesterol	justme2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/1/2012 6:57:18 AM	I have been taking cholesterol medications for three years. I have taken simcor and trilipix without any effects other than mild flushing from the simcor. The price of both of these medications are high and not covered by my insurnace until my deductible is met. Was given name brand Lipitor 10 mg that my Insurance covers. I only took this medication twice. Took on Thursday night, woke up extreamly tired, muscles and joints hurt all over, tingle in tongue and throat, and pressure in ears. I had just started this medication with another new medication that I started two days prior. Thought it may be the two together causing the effects. Did not take any medications on Friday or Saturday. Still felt awful on Saturday. Sunday I finally felt better. Took only the Lipitor Sunday night. Monday woke up to same symptoms only worse. Tounge swollen tingly, pain, tingling and numbness everwhere, ringing and pressure in ears, throat swollen and sore, tightness and pressure in chest. Felt off balance in body movements and speach. Knew I was having an allergic reaction along with several of the listed severe side effects. Went to Dr. and was told to stop Lipitor immediatly. Taken off all medication for a week to clear out my system. Today is Tuesday feel a little better but can not wait for it to all go away. I have never had a allergic reaction or sever side effects from any medication prior to this. Felt I would not since several immediate family members are taking this medication without problems. But since I have had quite a few people let me know that they and others they know have had similar effects. 
High Cholesterol	sparky22, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	4/19/2012 5:26:57 PM	Only a month in I started experiencing tingling and numbness in random places on my arms and legs.  It was very scary.  In addition was getting pain in joints I had never had problems with before.  When I realized it might be the Lipitor due to a story I had heard previously,  I started looking and found this site and discovered other issues I was having but had not thought related. I immediately contacted my doctor and was shocked he wanted me to continue this medication even though there can be extreme irreversible side effect; which is where I felt like I was headed after hearing so many of these stories. I refused to continue so he backed off.  Unbelievable.

I recently stopped taking Lipitor. I had EXTREME muscle and joint PAIN 24/7! This caused me to depend on pain medication still not getting relief, causing depression. I was not able to lift a gallon milk out of the fridge, bend and stand up or climb stairs to mention a few. I wanted my life back my family needed me and I was lifeless! It's only been a week along with physical therapy, massage therapy and I can't begin to tell you how Great I feel. Thank God, what a blessing.

I went thru numerous cardiac testing and ct scans, cardiac blood workup and even a cardiac cath suspecting heart disease (some family history) only to find nothing was wrong with my heart or arteries. (Thank God) I was told to get off of Lipitor and I can tell a difference after 2 weeks of being off the drug. My cholesterol was lowered after two months.

I complained to my doctor after approx 5 years about  stinging and burning on soles of my feet. He was more interested getting my cholesterol down. The feet problem developed into Peripheral Neurology for which there is no cure only pain relief. I stopped taking any statins 3 years ago. PN has now stabilized. I believe statins are poison, and should be avoided.

I was diagnosed after taking this for 18 months with dermatomyositis, a condition of skin rashes and horrible muscle degeneration, pain, and weakness. After being off of Lipitor for about 12 months, I have seen the muscles improve, but I don't think that I will ever be able to climb a flight of stairs without hip pain or move laundry from washer to dryer without some shoulder pain.I would urge people who have been prescribed this drug to keep an extremely close watch over any muscle problems.

Nearly four years ago I had to go on an artificial left ventricle because of Lipitor, and eventually had a heart transplant. If you are having elbow, jaw, shoulder, or back pain, if your hips have stabbing pains, you are losing weight, coughing, have burning eyes, or have increased hissing and ringing in your ears to the point of deafness, stop taking this poison now. Do NOT take Statins or their &quot;substitutes.&quot; Lovaza does the same thing, and will cripple you as well!

While it was effective in lowering my hereditary high cholesterol, I had to quit due to side effects.  Muscle cramps, joint pain, nausea and paraesthesia resulted in limiting my sleep tp 3 hours a night. I'd diarrhea nearly every day.  It's been 2 months since I stopped.  The muscle cramps, joint pain and diarrhea are slowly subsiding.  I still experience constant paraesthesia.

This is not in my big toe, but I have had my toe swell and get red and hurt like you can't beleive. One Dr. told that my toe needed to be fused because of no cushion between the joint. I do have elevated levels of URIC Acid at times but not always when I have a problem with my tendons in my feet. I am told a lot of people have problems like this because of the use of Lipitor

I'm better but still get some cramps and gas.  So glad that i have an understanding husband who has helped me deal with this physicaly and mentally.  I pray these symptoms go completely away very soon.  Will never take any statin again.

High Cholesterol	Jennie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	9/13/2011 10:08:55 PM	Been on medication for 12 months. Was NOT informed of side effects. Severe muscle and joint pain has been misdiagnosed as arthritis. After hearing about side effects took myself off this medication. never again will I take this stuff. I have suffered dreadfully, had to give up work as I was unable to drive the 50 k's to my employment, and did not have a decent nights sleepp for over 12 months. I cannot believe that I wa not told about the side effects, I have since also changed doctors.

I did not even have high cholesterol, just got caught in the web of a doctor who likes my insurance!   I'm firing him and quitting the statins.
High Cholesterol	kathyk, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	9/5/2011 12:15:50 AM	I was taking 40mg of Lipitor daily for 4 months and had muscle stiffness,  I then decided to take it 3 times a week instead hoping to reduce the muscle stiffness. Consulted my Doctor after six months on Lipitor, told him about the muscle discomfort and it and he told me to continue taking it 3 times a week because my cholesterol level dropped down to a normal level.  So I did....... and regret it.  After 1 year on Lipitor the muscle stiffness was unbearable.  I stopped taking completely, it has been 8 weeks and the muscle stiffness has been going away.  Not completely gone, but a big improvement compared to past.  I also think that it made losing weight harder.  I had been dieting prior to starting Lipitor and afterwards weight loss slowed down and now after these 8 weeks starting to lose again.  (Maybe because moving around getting easier again.)  I now need to see what negative affect this has had on my Liver.  Think it's time to find a new way to keep my cholesterol down.

High Cholesterol	Steve, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	45-54	8/30/2011 10:29:49 AM	About a week after being placed on Lipitor I started having lower back pain. Then I could not get out of bed one morning because of the back pain. I ended up going to the emergency room and was put on muscle relaxers. Because of this I stopped taking Lipitor. Once better I began taking it again and the back pain started again. That is when I realized the Lipitor was the problem. So against my doctor's recommendation I no longer take Lipitor. However, I no longer have back pain.
High Cholesterol	Bob, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	35-44	8/16/2011 7:55:00 PM	Started taking and within one week started having stomach problems. Reduced the amount and it got a little better. Now after two months found out that the Lipitor was causing my gall bladder to not function properly. Going to stop using this immediately and try to get something more natural since this is the second cholesterol medication that has caused problems.

Stopping today and left message with doctor to give me something else to try.  All my friends are taking Lipitor with no problems. I'm just one of the unlucky few where it does not agree with me.

My cholesterol numbers immediately went down and the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol also reduced.  However, about 2 months in I am experiencing muscle and tendon stiffness.  I have quit taking Lipitor and now hope that these symptoms will reverse!

I took myself off it today. 
High Cholesterol	chris, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	55-64	8/6/2011 9:03:01 AM	I was put on 80 mg. four years ago for hereditary high cholesterol.  In March I began to have severe muscle pain and difficulty walking.  After finding user reviews and reading about side effects, I stopped taking it.  The pain went away.  I worried about stopping it and went back on.  Within 3 days the pain was back, worse than before.  My doctor said to stop taking it.  Have been off it since May.  I think that the damage to my muscles may be long-lasting.  I have difficulty walking smoothly and weakness in my muscles.  I was a figure skater, cross-country skiier and tried snow shoeing this last winter.  Lipitor has a lot of other effects that I didn't realize until I stopped taking it such as dry, peeling skin, needing the bathroom constantly, nightmares and difficulty sleeping, depression, fatigue and memory loss.  I am now adding ground flax seed to meals, taking omega 3 capsules, coenzyme Q10 to help with the muscle damage and feel much better, except for the weakness in my legs.  A Dr.Oz show talked about drug companies advertising to doctors, who believe them and who do not look at independent research and he also said that statins do not help women.  I wish I had known about the side effects before they damaged my muscles.

I have a very difficult time walking, with weakness in my legs and a lack of energy. It feels like a colony of ants is running up and down my arm. I am having a hard time remembering things, loss of memory. Sure Lipitor lowered my Cholesterol dramatically, but look what is doing to me. I am off this stuff.
High Cholesterol	Kathy K., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	7/17/2011 11:53:05 PM	Lipitor worked, it reduced my cholesterol levels but after the first 30 days of taking it daily I experienced sever muscle stiffness.  I decided to take it every other day and the muscle stiffness was REDUCED but still there.  (My Doctor said it was working well and keep taking it every other day.  Now after 1 year of taking it every other day, the constant discomfort is bad.  I will be changing the brand the Doctor prescribes or change the Doctor.  I don't care to feel like I am 70 when I am only 50 years old.

Six months ago i had a scary event.  Sitting with my wife and friends my wife said i was mid-sentence when I quit talking and stared blankly at everyone.  I could recall nothing of the previous 2 hours.  I also have increased joint pain and have trouble straightening my knees and trouble sleeping.  I am 72 years old, male, retired Navy/Airline pilot.  Glad the memory lapse did not occur while I was flying which I still do for recreation.  I read Dr. Graveline's book, &quot;Lipitor; Thef of Memory&quot; and identified immediately with his conclusions. Dr Dwight Lundell's book &quot;the Cure for Heart Disease&quot; &amp; Shane Ellison's &quot;Hidden Truth about Cholesterol-lowering Drugs&quot; have convinced me that high Cholesterol is not a heart threat.
High Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	7/12/2011 1:04:05 AM	I have been taking this for about six months. Three weeks after taking my levels had dropped about 40pts. My doctor wanted me to continue taking anyway. In the past two months I have noticed some memory loss, hair loss,constipation trouble sleeping mand dry mouth. I recently had labs and had in increase in B12 levels,not sure why. I am currently off lipitor for three months and will see if these symptoms go away.

I fall because my knees give out and my hands and my wrists droop because I can't seem to keep them straight so I drop hot coffee etcetera onto the floor or myself.  I have never had ANY problems like this in my life!  These symptoms seemed to come on over night. I was shocked to read all of the statements from other users who are experiencing the same thing.  I have taken myself off this drug and I have an appointment to consult with my doctor about alternative treatments.  I only hope that the fatigue and pain will lessen as the months go by.  I have concerns that I might be stuck with this.  How infuriating!

I have had an enderarterectomy (carotid clean out) and had a stent placed in my LAD (widowmaker) artery about a year ago.  Along with 2 fish oil tablets, all types of cholesterol and triglycerides are at recommended levels.  I have been concerned about that large of a dosage, but lesser amounts did not lower the levels enough.  I have had no problems so far with the lipitor.

I've been experiencing aches and pain in my joints,abdominal pain,been short tempered and my memory seemed to be gone!  I work with elderly people and can't afford the symptoms.  The comments helped me to see it's the medication, not my mind. I need to improve my diet and exercise and skip the Lipitor.
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	Rebecca, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	35-44	5/11/2011 5:18:24 PM	Since I have taken Lipitor 10 mg. 9 months ago I have experienced the following: Memory problems, fatigue, arthritis, plantar fasciatis (sp?) along with bone cracking in my feet, itchy throat, strange prickly type pain in colon area, headaches, pain in the upper right quadrant of my stomach, constipation, and now depression. These did not happen overnight but very gradually, so gradually it was difficult to put it all together and realize it seems that Lipitor is the cause. I not only have high cholesterol and high triglycerides I also have a very high Lp(a) count. Dr. wants to switch me to Crestor 10 mg., which I have tried in the past with worse side effects than the 10 mg. Lipitor I've been taking, because it's supposed to be better. I think I will stay away from ALL statins to see if my symptoms improve. I'm only 42 but I feel like I'm 62! This stuff ages you at an incredible rate and I firmly believe that the benefits of &quot;lower numbers&quot; do not outweigh how horrible these statins can make you feel. Why bother taking these statins (if you are experiencing side effects) and alledgedly living a longer life (if &quot;high numbers&quot; even ends up being what takes your life) when you are miserable on this stuff? Quality of life vs. quantity of life...that is something each person taking these statins WITH SIDE EFFECTS needs to determine for themselves.

It is almost a throbbing pain and I am concerned if it is the drug.  I thought at first it was a pulled muscle, but I have never experienced pain like this and I have not lifted anything heavy because I have back problems from time to time.  This greatly concerns me.  A trip to the doctor is in order ASAP.

It did lower my cholestrol level but I decide that I could not live with the consistent pain.  I also tried Crestor with the same complaints.  I will not take another statin drug and be miserable all the time.  Life is to short for that!

High Cholesterol	Homer, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	1/1/2011 6:56:01 PM	I have tried a few statins before trying Lipitor. I could not take any of the other statins for longer than 2 weeks. I had pain throughout my body. Tried Lipitor in a low dose (10mg). In 6 weeks I started getting same problems with pain. I am tired, don't feel like working out, weak, irritable. My joints hurt and I feel weak in general. Another thing, I think it has lowered my testosterone levels. The hair on my legs is falling out. I don't know that my testosterone levels are down but I feel like it. I just feel terribly weak with low self confidence because I am lethargic in general these days. I need something to get my levels down but statins do not work for me. Anyone have medical suggestions besides exercise and diet. I need a pill, I know that. I am going off Lipitor today. Don't know which way to turn. My doctor thinks I should stay on statins regardless. I don't think I can. I cannot take feeling this way from now on. HELP!

There was tingling and itching to the point I kept scratching my lower underarms.  I was mystified as to why this was happening on a constant basis.

After going to the emergency room on the advice of my MD they found I had Wolf Parkinson White syndrome - which had never shown up on any previous tests. I was sixty years old at the time and they put a halter. When I asked if it could be Lipitor, they said probably not. When I stopped taking the Lipitor it went away and never returned. I asked the drug company if they had any knowledge of the effects of the drug on people with inactive WPW and they said NO. I would not take it again.

I do not have high cholestrol but was prescribed 80mg of Lipitor. On the 19th of June woke up with pain in my shoudler blade and radiates down my arm. Thought it was from sleeping wrong but pain became more intense by the next morning and has been as such since. My doc prescribed pain killer, muscle relaxant and nsaid. Two pain killers don't work. I am seeing a chiropractor now to see if he can help me because my MD seems to think it is a pinched nerve. The only relief I get is when I go to bed. My CPK levels are normal.

I also experienced memory loss, fatigue and it got worse recently, feel tired all the times. After reading the comments in  this website, I now believe that my problems were caused by Lipitor and I will stop taking it tomorrow to see if the problems will go away.

High Cholesterol	finelto, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	4	5	4	Female	55-64	6/9/2010 7:38:52 PM	OMG  Thank you all for posting. After at least 6 years of taking 20mg, I initially had no problems. On occasion, my hands would fall asleep especially upon awaking; tingling and paralyzing severe leg/foot cramps, every so often. Last summer when playing tennis I noticed muscle weakness. After a long walk I experienced hip and leg pain for many weekes afterwards. A couple of months ago I developed severe leg and thigh cramping every night and am living on pain killers and sleeping pills. Had extensive blood work and all other tests: bone density, cardio sonograms, circulatory tests etc. arthritis panels all came back negative.  Doctor did not want me to go off the drug, as my condition is hereditary. I took myself off Lipitor about two weeks ago, and am very very slowly feeling better. Have an appt with my Dr next week and he will probably send me to a neurologist. I would wager that this is from the pill.  Extensive statin use can cause myopathy, neuropathy, fibromyalgia, etc.  I will not go on another statin. I will ask for an alternative.  I have done many hours of research and read so many posts and articles. I will not take Lipitor again. I have read it may take many months to clear. I pray the nerve/muscle damage is reversible!

High Cholesterol	eml256, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1		55-64	5/8/2010 1:38:25 PM	discovered I have a mutation in SLCO1B1 gene, which probably resulted in greatly increased plasma statin levels, essentially statin toxicity for 4 yrs.  I believe I developed parkinson's disease instead of the myalgias which have been noted with this mutation.  I think the myopathy I developed was a mitochondrial myopathy resulting in a neurodegenerative disease.  studies have shown statin AUC's from 200 to 400 times normal in individuals with this mutation who are on a statin.  or plasma statin levels of 134 % higher than normal. To me this is the definition of toxic plasma statin levels.

Cholesterol is down around 160 with 10mg taken at night.  But, recently have gotten a headache while sleeping.  Could it be the Lipitor?  Took myself off for a few days and did not experience a headache.  Plan on going back on it now to see if it is the culprit.

After my results came in, my doctor called me and told me to stop taking them, the were causing muscle problems.  that was three years ago. The muscle pain has gotten a little better, but not completely gone away. My doctor continues to check me.  I had an EMG test done which showed muscle damage.

I started having serve pains in my legs, feet, joints, it is effecting my life.  The doctors no not seem to think that anything is wrong, and think that I am looking for pain meds.  I am going to stop the lipitor and see if these pains clear up, I hope that this will clear up the problems.  I am thankful for this site so that I now know that others have the same symptoms as I am having.  Doctors should look into the use of lipitor when their patients complain of pains, unstead of thinking that they are looking for pain pills. the problem that I am having is that my regular doctor left the area and I am having to see anther doctor in the same office and he did not even to think about the lipitor causing the problem.  Doctors should be looking a meds causing problems for their patients.  Lipitor should be looked into by the FDA.  Dangerous drug.  Also memory problems

Medically, his cholesterol levels, while not high to begin with, have been very satisfactory, in the 150's now with excellent triglyceride levels as well.  My husband is very trim and physically active in his job.  Lately, his right elbow has been giving him terrible joint pain, which i see is a side effect. Also, he is experiencing erectile dysfunction, which could be caused by other factors, but has never been a problem before.  I see only one other post which mentions this as a problem.  Just thought i'd add this in case anyone else has noticed this.

My lower legs became covered with bloody red patches; I had aches and pains; I was always fatigued and I suddenly found myself unable to walk across a room without excruciating and debilitating pain in my thighs. My doctor told me to discontinue the Lipitor immediately. It has taken six months for the unsightly patches on my legs to fade and for me to be able to walk with with only slight pain.

It has reduced my cholesterol levels to a normal range.  I also take diovan HCT 80/12.5 for high blood pressure.  Over the course of the years on these medications I have complained of just not having enough energy no matter how much sleep I get, finger tips tingle, feet ache first thing in the mornings and can't barely walk barefoot. I also have experienced weight gain especially around my waist, joint pain and heart palpitations.  My husband has also commented that he thinks I have a little memory loss as well. Last year I stopped taking these medicines because of a bacteria I contracted visiting another country.  After getting better I realized that my feet didn't hurt any more and I had much more energy.  Since I have been back one the medicines all these symptoms have returned.  I am really questioning whether to continue or discontinue them.  I have to say that I am amazed at the number of people with the same complaints.  Thank you for sharing.

Doctor then had me switch to Lipitor at 10mg.  By the end of the fist week had severe muscle pain and tingling skin sensation all over including the bottom of my feet.  Felt dizzy sometimes and tinnitus got way worse.  Then on night seven right in the middle of sleep time was awaken by my heart pounding so hard.  It skipped beats missed beats and then started buzzing.  The next day I stopped taking this drug.  After two weeks I got my arms and legs back and can swim laps again without pain.  Tried Zocor six years ago and that was whole different horror story.  Some bodies are not accepting of statins.

When my doctor recently switched me from 40mg to 80mg I began to notice muscle aches, particularly in my hips and legs.  The pains have become so severe that I am now taking 600 mg of Ibuprofen to sleep and just get around.  While the medication is controling the Cholesterol (down from original 279 to 130 total and now LDL under 77) I am concerned about the pain and a feeling of depression.  I don't want to do anything and the pain, while I work through it, is truly limiting. I have an appointment with my doctor in about 10 days; I wonder what is findings will be.  Also, I am on three blood pressure meds - diovan, cardizem and atenolol.  I wonder if there are interactions causing the pain and also some severe skin itching on my torso and lower legs.

Poly-Myalgia the doc calles it because it's my entire body that hurts all the time like having the flu every day &amp; the fatigue is awful as well. It ruined my life. I've been mostly homebound. It's Rheumatism. All muscles in the body are effected. My memory is shot too. I observed my memory getting worse shortly after starting Lipitor or the older one, can't remember the name,it was a statin anyway. It has ruined my health &amp; poss. caused my type 2 diabetes, which I didn't have until I started on the statin. Doctors told me that couldn't be from the statin, but I looked it up &amp; these are side effects. Either the docs aren't educated enough on the side effects or the Pharma guys play down the side effects. Anyway, statins do more harm than good. Life long memory trouble, fatigue &amp; all over muscle pain &amp; muscle weakness &amp; muscle spasms are my gift from BigPharma's need for greed over proper testing of drugs before putting them on the market.
High Cholesterol	Gini, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	1/15/2010 5:37:15 PM	taking it about 4 yrs.  Began 10 mg, much muscle pain; dropped to 5mg daily, chol level still good, but awful cramps, dropped to 5 mg every other day, chol back up.  Began 5mg daily and now see immediate, frightening memory loss! No other changes whatsoever.  Am I losing my mind or is it the Lipitor?  Drug co's don't seem to acknowledge this as a side affect...anyone else?

One day I noticed my eyebrows drooping.  Then it felt like someone constantly touching my hair.  Finally, I started to massage my scalf for relief.  It was then I discovered my scalp to be quite bumpy.  It almost felt like soft spots that you would find on an infants head.  I read the side effects that it breakdown in muscles or muscular degeneration.  I am convinced that Lipitor caused it.  I have been off Lipitor for 6 months and there is little improvement.  Please research Lipitor on the web to see additional side effects.

I was unaware that I have a genetic mutation in a transport protein that moves statins into the liver to be metabolized.  This results in abnormally high plasma statin levels, since the drug is not broken down. Studies report from 122% to 400 % ABOVE normal plasma statin levels for individuals with this mutation.  The mutation occurs in a LARGE % of the population--22 to 38% in the caucasian population, so this is NOT RARE.

June, 2008 entered hospital for 7 weeks. Liptor had attacked my muscles - rabdomyolis (spelling). It then attacked my liver, transplanted kidney, and all kinds of infections. I was on morphine for pain for 3 weeks. My sister told me I nearly died. I then spent 2 weeks in rehab but spent 2 1/2 months at my sisters having rehab 3 times a week. At first I could not do anything for myself; my sister had to do everything for me. This hit me very fast. Being a kidney transplant person, I take a lot of meds. I sat down at my kitchen table to take meds and could not get up from the table. Please read about all medications - I refuse to take any meds that have the side effects of weak muscles and /or they are statins!  
High Cholesterol	jeanne, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	11/23/2009 10:59:18 PM	I took Lipitor for about 10 days.  Suddenly couldn't walk up stairs without crawling due to such leg pain.   Dr did not tell me that eating grapefruit/juice exacerbates side effects, and that taking CoQ10 was essential to help eliminate the side effects. I had to find this out myself...then stopped taking the drug immediately, and pain went away.  I subsequently found out about chelation therapy which I did and after one year reduced the 65% stenosis in my carotid arteries to &quot;no significant plaque&quot; on my recent sonogram and CT Scan.My doctors are shocked and don't want to believe my results!  One has to become one's own health advocate and not let the MDs dictate everything. Use &quot;alternative medicine&quot; to keep healthy.For cholesterol lowering I'm taking red yeast rice along with CoQ10 daily, among other vitamins &amp; minerals.  I feel great!

But, if that's the trade off in keeping my high cholesterol in check it's well worth it.

My doctor had me on potassium supplements for a while. Eventually the potassium issue resolved itself and I quit taking the supplements.   I am strongly considering asking my doctor to take me off this product.  I have changed my eating habits -- possibly I can regulate my cholesterol with proper diet and exercise.  I don't really want to take this, or any other, medication if I don't need to.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	11/16/2009 7:33:35 PM	have been taking lipitor since january 2002. I have experienced aches but I also have a very bad back from an accident. My problem is that I'm having low potassium levels that I never had before even though I take a diuretic because I have a heritary fluid problem, but I have taken this for 38 years and never had a problem. Is it possible that the lipitor is causing the potassium drop?

It got so bad I couldn't walk. I kept resting it as the Dr requested I do but with no improvement. I eventually got severe ankle joint pains as well, bone on bone pain that the Dr suggested could be osteoarthritis. It eventually effected the other ankle as well.I considered the Lipitor as the cause and stopped taking it. The pain subsided but returned while on another statin for only 4 days, a year later! I can no longer do what I use to do, no rependitive pounding such as running, treadmill walking, or fast paced street walking. I haven't checked with the Dr to find out if this can be reversed. Just excepted the fact that for some reason statins effect cartilage, perhaps from absorbing the fat it needs.Is there someone out the with similar problems?

I recently was told by a doctor to try (co q 10) to help with the joint pain ...It is like majic it works great ..I also take paarmaceutical grade .I am not sure if it matters but i followed doctors advice because the joint pain was so severe, it worked for me.

Why did it take me so long to find these posts?  Been taking Lipitor for about 5 years.  Instantly began feeling the horrible leg cramps, severe muscle fatigue and inability to simply get out of bed and walk to the restroom in the night or mornings.  Extremely long time to get going in the mornings.  I can relate to most of the posts stating horrible side effects of this drug.  Also taking levoxyl for hypothyroidism which I believe somehow counteracts with the lipitor causing even more symptoms such as horrible itching. I even had spinal epidurals because of the leg pain (being diagnosed as pinched nerves and perinial nerve damage).  But now after reading these posts, I believe it's ALL BEEN CAUSED BY THIS DRUG!  I'm a young active person who loves to ride horses.  For the past five years it's been a very painful experience causing me to be bed ridden afterwards from such fatigue and unexplained muscle pain.  The side effects from taking this medication FAR OUT NUMBER ANY BENEFITS OF THE NUMBERS COMING DOWN.

I could hardly walk. My doctor had me take it at bedtime, so the morning were bad trying to move around, I had to take pain medication about midday to be able to move pain free. I don't think taking the Lipitor is worth the pain especially if you have to take pain medication. I won't be taking Lipitor again.

I took Lipitor only 3 days and began to have severe weakness and pain in my left shoulder (torn rotator cuff repaired 6 years ago), both wrists (carpal tunnel repair 10 years ago) &amp; legs.  I notified my DR. he agreed to stopping this med.  I've been off Lipitor for a week, pain and weakness is getting worse requiring help with dressing. I have Raynauds symptoms, hands are like cold jello, dizziness, gait problems, super fatigue. I am, or was, an active 56y.o. male who now needs help putting on my shirt, jeans &amp; socks. I will never take Lipitor again.

First in the neck which took about a month and a half to go away. Second in my right elbow which lasted about 2 months. Then lately I have experienced pain in the left bicep. I have been on Lipitor for 1 yr paying 30 a month and have talked my doctor into switching to Zocor. If I experience any pain from that med, I will stop all together after reading all of these reviews.

My doctor reduced dosage to 40 mg per day, but a month later I'm still having pains.  How long will it take for the reduced dosage to take effect to the point where I stop having pains in muscles of my lower legs?
High Cholesterol	Irene, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	9/2/2009 2:24:19 PM	I have a problem with my  kidneys it is low  funtion.  Also i have suffered muscle problem. My doctor said everything was fine when I was tested every 6 months when i started.  I thought everythin was ok until i got another doctor and She said I have low kidney funtion. This doctor won't take me off the lipitor she said it is not the problem . I think she is wrong.  Is there another one that will work the same but not damage the kidney and muscles.  I am been given all kinds of test to find out why.  I think if the take me off the lipitor I will be ok. Why won't they try.  Confused

Within a week &amp; 1/2, I began experiencing pain in my hip joints, knees, lower back and leg muscles, as well as strange pains in my head. I began to get depressed, with a negative attitude towards my husband;  then nightmares and total sleepiness, so much so I could barely function.  After sitting at a dinner for a relative for 2 hours, I could barely get up and walk.This was the 3rd week.  I stopped taking it on Aug.13th.  I am getting better, as this drug leaves my system. My sister is a nurse and she sent me this report from Dr.Whitaker~ please read it.Cholesterol-Lowering Drugs When people arrive at the Whitaker Wellness Institute taking a cholesterol-lowering statin drug such as Lipitor, Zocor, Pravachol, Lescol, Mevacor, or Crestor, we stop it on sight. We dont do this because of an irrational anti-drug bias. We do it because statins are costly, marginally effective, and rife with adverse effects. Common side effects of statin drugs include muscle pain and weakness and liver problems. However, they are also linked with memory problems, heart failure, and increased risk of death. Thats right. These drugs may slightly reduce the number of deaths from heart attack in some groups of patients, but risk of death from other causes goes up, canceling out any survival benefit.If you are taking a statin drug, talk to your doctor about getting off it. There are far safer means of lowering your cholesterol and, more important, reducing your risk of heart disease.

After 10 years usage, aches, pains that were too numerous to keep track of I changed to Crestor. Great move.

I have had cholesteral problems all my life and no matter what pill I took, I still had high numbers. A few years ago my doc reduced my Lipitor to only 10 mgs, but added another pill called Ezetrol. I take them both at dinner and have perfect numbers since then. I really believe the combo of Lipitor and Ezetrol is fabulous, and I've had no side effects. If anyone still has high cholesterol and is taking Lipitor, speak to your doctor about Ezetrol!

High Cholesterol	Waiting for Energy!, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	7/20/2009 1:25:29 AM	I have been on Lipitor for about 12 years along with Diabetes medication and high blood pressure medication.  In the last several years, I have been telling my physician that the fatigue is horrible -- no energy whatsoever -- everyday chores seem overwhelming.  I have noticed confusion, depression (and I am really a very happy person)and not being able to enjoy life the way I want to.  I also have shortness of breath and problems sleeping and occasional palpitations.  She only says it could be your weight or menopause.  She only laughs when I mention all of these drugs I am on.  I just read about my BP medication, and discovered all of my side effects were possible with that medication.  I am now reading about Lipitor and the same side effects seem to apply.  I do know that when I forget to take my medications, I almost feel like a &quot;real&quot; person.  So sad that these drugs are deemed necessary.  I doubled my weight in 18 months after I had my baby (was always model skinny before that) and I know that is where all of the medical issues started; however, now I don't believe it is all weight -- these side effects are contributing factors as well.  It is difficult to try to lose weight when you are so fatigued.  I would give anything to go back to no medications.

An increase in dosage to 40 mg per day reduced my total cholesterol below 125, my LDL below 80 and my triglycerides below 100.  It has had no effect on my HDL level, which remains below 40.  I have suffered no side effects.

I could hardly walk and was falling a lot.  My legs wouldn't hold me up.

Well, I'm not one of them.  I take the full elephant dose, 80mg/daily.  No discernible side effects. Total cholesterol=90; LDL=50.  For someone with coronary artery disease, these are the low numbers I (and my cardiologist) believe will prevent progression.  That and a nearly fatless plant-based diet have reduced my angina, permitted vigorous aerobic exercise, and promoted weight loss.  I'm sorry for those suffering side effects.  I've been on one statin or another for 10 years and never experienced a single one.

Since that time I have had severe joint pain and tendon problems. I have neuropathy in both legs and feet. Angina and abnormal bouts of extreemly fast heart beats have started to happen more frequently in the past 3 years. Afer reading up on this drug I discussed with my doctor about getting off of it for awhile and see if any of these conditions improve. We both agreed that I should stop for a few months to determine if the side effects are related. I have been off of it for four days and have aready noticed a marked improvement in my tendon pain and joint pain.

High Cholesterol	Chill, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/23/2009 11:27:51 AM	I take this because good diet and lots of exercise aren't enough to lower my numbers. My only other risk factor is heart disease runs in my family.  Would normally have about 240-250 cholesterol.  This stuff certainly and significantly lowers LDL and trigs, and slightly raises HDL.  May also lower c-reactive protein (inflammatory marker, which might be much more important than cholesterol as a cardiovascular risk factor).  I tried taking generic Zocor to save money but although it worked it gave me more side effects (muscle and liver). Switched back to Lipitor 20 mg and all is good again.  Everyone is different though.  I was also taking Zetia or Welchol but recently improved my diet even further and now don't need to take those; besides it's unclear whether taking those has much benefit in terms of significantly saving lives.  Lipitor continues to be studied and apparently shown to reduce mortality and severity of cardio-incidents somewhat; it isn't without some controversy though.  Dietary Tip:  take psyllium (2 Tbsp disolved in plain milk or water)!  It's a bit nasty but cheap and effective!

If taken on an empty stomach, I would get nauseous or would get an upset stomach where it was more painful or cramp like than a feeling of nausea. Lastly one side effect not mentioned is the loss of smell. If I were to give a number of 1 being low and 10 being high on the smell scale, I went from being able to smell at a level of 8 to about a 3 while on this medication. Only things that were really strong could I really smell. Which, if you think about it, is really a plus when you're changing an infant's diaper.

I have used Lipitor for the last 20 years.  I had my first heart attack when I was 32.  I had a triple by pass immediately after the event.  At 42 I was put on Lipitor to reduce my cholesterol levels.  They dropped from 250 to under 110 and have stayed that way for 20 years.  I take 20 mg at night before I go to bed.  I have never had any muscle pain, memory loss, fatigue, or other harmful symptoms.  I do see my doctor regularly, every six months for a complete check up including a full blood panel, which checks for cholesterol and kidney problems. 
High Cholesterol	CC, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	25-34	5/22/2009 5:58:04 AM	I am a young male in good physical condition who has been placed on Lipitor because my cholesterol number is at 200. I do not believe that I need to be on this drug yet the wife, who is in the medical field does believe so due to family history. I took myself off the medication when My back started hurting very bad, like I was being punched there everyday. My Bicep muscles were achin as well. fatigue is a constant in my life with a new baby and work schedule. I keep up on my weight management and workouts. I eat impecibably and can only achieve better if I was to be hooked up to a bag in the hospital. My dR. lowered the dosage to 10 mg. Really do I need to be on it? Oh by the way my pain has started again, Go Figure. Zetia has been brought up also and I have read those reviews, I believe all of the poisons that are pumped into us may be the cause of our problems and actually make things worse.

I started having terrible knee pain,swelling and weakness.  I thought I had hurt them.  I was found to have torn cartlidge and after having them fixed.. I still had pain. Just thought I had to live with it. While on antibotics I hurt all over in my joints, they were swollen and I couldn't even get up off the couch.  Called doctor and she said to stop my lipitor right away.  three days later I am down to very little pain and I can feel my legs feel stronger.  I am so upset that I did not know this was a side effect of this medicine.  I had surgery to remove the cancer and that was easier then the problems with my knees and legs and over all tireness. I will not take this again or any others if I can help it.  Also my husband takes tricor and reading on it I am pulling him off it tomorrow. some don't have side effects but others like us it is just bad.

My bad cholesterol is in the normal range, but my dr. would like it to be lower.  Good cholesterol is well above normal.  I started not feeling well but didn't connect it to Lipitor.  I had muscle weakness, fatigue and started having heart palpitations.  A nuclear stress test showed no problems.  I took a break from it a couple of months ago and felt better.  Now after 2 weeks back on I'm getting the muscle weakness again.  I don't want to continue taking it.

My back and legs hurt so badly that I could not walk after sitting for a time. I stopped taking this drup after a blood test showed increased liver enzyme level.  WILL NOT TAKE AGAIN. Still have some muscle pain in my legs.
High Cholesterol	Norm, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	45-54	4/21/2009 10:20:09 AM	I was taking Lipitor for 10 years (10mg/day).  Im 53 years old now and not overweight.  I have had several tests done for several medical conditions that have cropped up over the years.  It all started 5 years ago.  Chest pain.  Blood work showed a very high CPK count (300+).  A heart scan indicated no signs of any heart problems.  Joint/muscle aches (high CPKs?).  After seeing a neurologist, no condition was found causing ailments.  Nose bleeds and constant ear infections.  A brain MRI showed nothing was wrong.  Last year I went to the doctor for visible blood in the urine and lower back pain.  Lab work confirmed blood.  Two CT scans and a bladder scoping showed nothing abnormal.  I took myself off Lipitor and havent taken any for 8 months.  Since then, no more aches or pains, no more blood in the urine, no more back pain, no more mood swings, no more nose bleeds, and no more ear infections.  It took about 6 months for all the aches and pains to go away because Lipitor stays in your body for a long time (from what I read).  Im now taking supplementals, exercising, and will go back in to check my cholesterol next month.  Needless to say, all the tests I went thru scared the hell out of me because you always think the worse.  Since being off Lipitor, I've been feeling 100x better.  Hopefully, my cholesterol will be down when I go back to have it tested.  Either way, Lipitor is poison and I won't be taking it anymore.

After reading many of these posts I cancelled my visit to my orthopod and voluntarily took my self off drug and started seeing decrease in swelling almost immediately.  Do not get hung up on this drug.  There are many others out there than to put up with unnecessary pain and sufferage.  Listen to your body more than your doctor.

I've never heard of someone having a choles-terol level of 548, but, I did at that age. I have normal levels now, not only because of diet change, but definately due to Lipitor. I've struggled throughout my life with this Dx. I've had no struggle for the last 6 months of my life. I wish I'd have been started on this medication earlier.

About one month after starting this med I noticed that I could not bend or squat down for more than 30 seconds or so without severe pain and if I thought that was bad enough when I would stand back up, after struggling to do so the pain was almost totally debilitating. In my line of work (Surveyor) I am constantly on the move in the worst of terrains one can imagine, therefore I need my legs to be in the best of shape or I can find myself in a real bind at times even life threatening situations (e.g. snakebite, animal attack or other injuries far from civilization) now back to the med, after some research on my own due to the fact that I have always been in great physical shape, especially my and years of playing football and baseball with never an injury I found out that it was the Lipitor that had messed up my knee so I immediately quit that crap and after several months my pain subsided somewhat however it has not nor do I think my knee will ever be the same again. This is truly a case that will affect me in job function and athleticism for the rest of my life as after 3 years of being off of this stuff I still haven't regained full function. I curse this stuff.

For awhile, no physical effects.  However, for the past 3 weeks, I thought I had athlete's foot, as the bottom of my feet, including my toes, burn horribly.  Also, around midday I start feeling fatigue, falling asleep at work.  I'll switch to 1/2 dosage (5 mg) until I have bloodwork &amp; check-up by cardiologist.

I just started to have a general feeling of joint pain, that went from my feet up to my rib cage.  The pain became so bad that I did not want to live.  I was talking to a friend 4 days ago, and she told me to stop the lipitor.  I have stopped and have been taking diphenhydramine and a pain medication.  The pain is now in my feet and right hip only, and I feel much better!!!  I could feel my lymph glands swollen under my arms , and I could feel all of my joints.  The only joints that had not started to hurt,  were my neck and upper spine!!!  I know now why people with chronic pain want to die.  The medication had lowered my choles by 30 pts, but is so not worth the pain I went through.

Reminds me when I took Mevacor(lovostatin). The muscle pains are horrible. I'm also taking it with Welchol. I started with burning foot pain about a month ago and nothing helps. I'm tempted to just quit. I have a 20 year old case of rhabdymyalosis (muscle condition caused by taking statins). Not fun!! I have fibromyalgia because of all this. The Welchol (6 pills a day) only brought my overall cholesterol down 20 points from 420!! Now I take 10mg. of Lipitor. No blood tests yet. I go in April. I don't know if I can last that long with all the muscle aches and pains.

Shortly after starting medication I had neck and shoulder pain, eventually this spread to my back and ankles.  I figured hey, your 41 this is normal.  Today when I could not fasten my seat belt due to extreme neck pain I called the Dr.  They have switched me to Zetia but after reading about it on this site I have decided not to take it either.  Sounds even worse.  Any suggestions for natural remedies?

My doctor lowered the daily dosage to 10 mg and it seems to have had the desired effect of controlling my cholesterol and eliminating the unpleasant side effects of this drug.

After about a few weeks on the drug I noticed that I was feeling extremly tired and experience fatigue on a daily basis.  I attributed it to the fact that I am over weight and just perhaps feeling tired due to my fitness lever.  Almost every evening I would almost drag myself home during my daily commute. One weekend after I missed my medication due to forgetfulness, I realized I was not having the achiness and fatigue.  I that point I started being suspicious of the Lipitor of the cause of my fatigue.  That monday I resumed taking the medicine and almost immediately the fatigue returned.  My doctor has since then put me on a low dose of Crestor, which seemed to be working for a while but a months later the fatigue has returned.

My father is a doctor and put me on Lipitor, with in a couple of weeks both my shoulder joints were in tremendous pain. I assumed it was just because I was sitting around and doing nothing while recovering from my back surgery, I am usually very active (HATE SITTING AROUND). So about 8 weeks after my surgery I stopped taking all medication including the Lipitor, which I had been taking for 10 weeks now. By this time I could barely put my shirt on, the shoulder pain was so great. Within a few days of stopping my meds I realized my shoulders were feeling better, still hurt like hell, just better. After no meds for a week, I decided I should probably continue the Lipitor (unaware this is what was causing my shoulder pain) mistake!! It only took about 3-4 days before I realized the shoulder pain had gotten worse and what was causing it. I have been off the Lipitor for a Month now and even though I can put my shirt on again, I cannot get my arms past parallel when lifting them straight out away from body. I am unable to swing a golf club, I am 100% sure ALL my shoulder pain is due to LIPITOR!!!!!

I took it for a month but started having pain in my feet and legs.  I advised my doctor about the pain but he did not think it was the Lipitor.  He gave me medication for the pain, thinking it was arthritis.  The pain continued in my legs and feet that I couldn't walk anymore so I stopped all the medications.  By the next week, the pain had gone and I told my doctor so he would change his thoughts on prescribing this medication and tell the pharmacy companies.But he still did not believe me so I changed doctors.  I am not going to take this medication ever again.

He first experienced severe sleep disturbances, sleep walking (jumped out of a window from nightmare!!!)  He was agitated; couldn't think and had memory problems.  My son struggled with these side effects for 2 1/2 years while on Lipitor.  Five consulting doctors did not associate any of these symptoms to Lipitor!!!!!!  That was the only medicine he was taking!!!!  After graduating and stopping the Lipitor for 6 weeks, he went on it again and withing 5 days (Lipitor is quickly injested) the same nightmares of &quot;guns and knives&quot; began again and he walked away; bought a gun and KILLED HIMSELF!!!!!!!  He is not the only one who has committed suicide on a statin!  I know of NINE others who have or know of someone who has!  On the list of &quot;rare side effects&quot; for Lipitor has listed second to the last &quot;mood disorders&quot;.  Suicide is not mentioned!  I know Lipitor killed my son and you should make it clear to all of the millions of people taking it and also all of the physicians prescribing Lipitor so they can warn their patients.  MOST of the doctors are NOT aware of these serious side effects..Muscle aches and pains that sometimes do NOT go away are also very common and Pfizer knows it.  They know about all of these side effects, but are just not letting any one know!!!!  Now, I am left with the daily ache and pain of my son's death.  His brother and sister have also had their lives impaired by his devastating suicide.  These pains we are left with are also side effects of Lipitor never made public.......I will never stop bringing this most prescribed drug in the world's deadly side effects out to the world.  Pfizer knows about them all......
High Cholesterol	TD Brown, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	2/11/2009 4:28:53 PM	I took Lipitor for 3 mos. and I had to quit taking it because of the leg cramps. It also made my liver enzymes high. They are slowly coming down. I have been off of the medication for 6 mos.but my liver enzymes are still high.

Took for many years but gradually, before I realized what the problem was, I developed life altering episodes of severe muscle weakness and chronic myalgia pain. Stopped Lipitor and improved dramatically.

I have multiple sclerosis and assumed the painful leg spasms were result of my disease.  After reading these articles I want to get off Lipitor, and will tell my doctor to take me off. Between Lipitor and Cymbalta I don't know which one is worse.  Why can't there be drugs with no side effects?

However, I developed very weak muscles in my legs.  I found it hard to rise from a sitting or lying position.  I began reading a lot about Lipitor and decided that I would experiment with stopping and see what happens.  I have now been off Lipitor for a year.  My HDL and triglycerides have increased some, but not a lot.  My leg muscles are no longer feeling heavy and weak.  I can squat and rise without holding onto anything or any other help.  I will not go back on Lipitor.

My doctor recommended I take 150 to 200 mg of CoenzymeQ10 with my 10mg of Lipitor.  I do exercise regularly.  I find the aches and pains tolerable at this point.

The doctor's logic was 'why not take it as a preventative med since it works?'.  It was working fine in keeping levels low, but the last 6 months my husband has aged 20 years! he is aging right before my very eyes.  It is heartbreaking. He has muscle pain in the shoulders, neck, elbows, hamstrings and back, sweats (which he thinks may be related to a pain med he has been prescribed) and extreme fatigue.  All of this has brought on severe depression, yet he continues to go to work and keep a positive attitude with great faith in God. We are seeing a pulmonary doctor because of sleep problems, a rheumatologist who has diagnosed him with fibromyalgia and another who has said depression is is main problem. (this is also the Dr. who prescribed the Lipitor.  He is now on Cymbalta, pain meds and sleep meds. After a recent sleep test, he is now on oxygen at night, which is helping him sleep but his overall condition is worsening with each new day.  After reading these posts, when he has the strength to get out of bed (it is  after 10:00am) I am going to beg him to STOP the Lipitor! This is one case in which the side effects are NOT worth the benefit.

Never had high cholesterol, high blood pressure or Heart attack. But in 2003 at the age of 65 I had a 4 way bypass, clogged arteries were found as results of stress test. My heart Dr. has me on Lipitor, Lisinopril, Atenolol. My cholesterol is usually around 100 and blood pressure normal usually around 115/65. The Dr says this is right where he wants me. The only problem I have is Leg cramps after I play golf,which I do a lot of. I found that if I use a vibrator on my legs before I go to bed I dont have the leg cramps.So to the person who complained about the leg cramps, try this it might help.
High Cholesterol	ddede1964, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	1/22/2009 10:41:30 AM	I had taken 10mg once a day for approx 1 1/2 yrs with great results in lowering my bad cholesterol in fact it happen very quickly, and all of my liver results had come back great my liver tolerated it with no problems, However over the course of the last year i noticed mussle aches in my neck and shoulder and upper back, which i had contributed to a slight straiting of the neck that i have, but over this passed summer the mussle pains and weakness increase and spread to elbow, legs,feet,toes and an extream feeling of fatigue and tiredness and some stomach upset and nausea. I contacted my Doctor who told me to stop taking the lipitor as i was out of town at the time this side effects became to much to handle and after a month and a half I still experenced some leg cramping and mussle fatigue,but better then it was, but of course my cholesterol increase again and he put me back on the 5mg of lipitor again within 3weeks time the fatigue and tiredness, nausea and increased mussle problems started again. I have taken my self off Lipitor and will not take it anymore. If anyone has a more natural way of lowering the chol that has worked i would love to know. I am sure it will take months for my body to get back to normal.

I have been taking it for about 10 years and beleive it may be having an effect on my memory. Some books suggest that I may be correct while my family doctor says he has never heard anyone complain of memory problems. I would love to hear from anyone else with the same problem.

My mom has been taking this drug for years and it certainly has helped her cholestorol levels.  However, she suffers from many of the side effects that other readers have mentioned.  She gets too many headaches, suffers from hearing loss and has had joint pain and leg and feet pain for years.  Now she is literally losing her mind!  She can't even have a conversation anymore as she has big problems with word and phrase retrieval.  Taking her to the doctors today and will insist we take her off Lipitor to see if any of these side effects go away or at least lessen.  I know there are other drugs that can help her cholestorol levels.

As soon as I stopped taking it ,as my insurance no longer covered it, my total cholesterol was awful. I pay full price for this medication because this is how effective it has always been for me. My condition is almost 90% genetics. In fact my one family member was prescribed a different medication and I had him call his doctor to have the doctor prescribe Lipitor. He did. As a healthcare worker and patient this is far a good medication. I wish it could be more affortable for all insurances.

Used while working out 4 times a week.   after a year I became extremely fatigued, felt like sleeping at work.  Then muscle pain and joint pain to the point of extreme discomfort.  My blood test found very high CK levels (ruptured muscle cells)Dr. took me off pill and it took 1 1/2 years to get my CK levels back to normal.  Now he wants to start me on another statin drug )-: I still don't know what to do.

The pain was similar to shin splints.  When I realized it must be the lipitor, I stopped taking it - the pain lingered for another 2-3 days - lessening a little each day.  No position - or heatr or ice relieved the aches and pains.

I take a low dosage of Lipitor - 5mg 3 times a week. (Mon-Wed-Fri) Have been taking this medication for years with with side effects of leg cramps, that's when my Dr. lowered the dosage, and found it tolerable. But in the last year and a half, my health has deteriorated greatly! My symptoms have been extreme fatigue and LOUD ringing in my ears. The ringing is at the point that I cannot sleep and it is very disruptive and irritating. I went to a specialist to check my hearing and to make sure there was not a physical problem and was told that I would have to learn to &quot;live with it&quot;. I am immediately going off the lipitor to see if this is the problem. I am 62 years old and want my life back! I have also been experiencing intolerance to heat with dehydration. Had my thyroid checked and it is within normal range, although a 2.7 cm nodule was found on right side and is benign. Dr is just &quot;watching&quot; it for now.  
High Cholesterol	Gimpy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	55-64	12/29/2008 10:20:45 PM	I started taking Lipitor about 5 years ago.  It lowered my cholesterol from 260 to 156. I don't eat any red meat or pork, occasionally have chicken.  This is primarily a genetic issue not diet/nutrition.  I usually eat mediterranean-type food (veggies &amp; pasta) and am 5' 9&quot;, weigh 162lbs. Both my father &amp; grandfather had high cholesterol.  I was not aware of any side effects but started experiencing foot pain/numbness a year &amp; a half ago.  I have two herniated disks (L3 &amp; L4), which I associated with the numbness.  My orthopedic surgeon diagnosed the problem as neuromas and recommended foot orthotic devices for my shoes, physical therapy/exercise &amp; icing.  I did not get any relief, although I followed the protocol religiously for months.  After greater pain symptoms developed on the bottom of both my feet (extreme soreness, burning sensation to include around the toes, large area of numbness around both balls of my feet &amp; heel pain), I started getting sore shins, cramping and sharp pains in both calf muscles. I went to my internist, who sent me to a neurologist for testing.  I went to a muscle specialist, who performed an EMG test, and determined that my peripheral neuropathy was caused by the Lipitor. He advised that I stop taking the Lipitor immediately &amp; stop the icing because it could cause additional nerve damage.   I stopped taking Lipitor about 2 months ago along with the icing treatments.  The leg symptoms have cleared up completely.  However, my feet are slowly getting better but I am still experiencing chronic pain/numbness &amp; burning sensation, even around the toes.  Simply walking around the house with socks on (carpeted floors) causes soreness &amp; pain.  Although the Lipitor dramatically lowered my cholesterol, this debilitating side effect was not clearly identified by the warnings (muscle soreness?).  I am hoping that I do not have permanent nerve damage and that the condition will continue to improve.  I will provide more info in 6 months.

I also suffer from migraines, which were controlled.  When I get a headache, I would take Imitrex and now when I took it, my headache would increase, the pain would go down the back of my neck and arms and I would get sick to my stomach.  My doctor thought I was having reactions to Imitrex and started changing my migraine medicine until I remembered I hadn't been having these problems until I started Lipitor.  I had to do some convincing to show my doctor it was the Lipitor that was causing my problems and not my Imitrex.  I am off the Lipitor and I can now use my Imitrex again with no problems.  Until, I started reading the problems on WebMd, I thought I was the only one who had problems with this drug.

Muscle stiffness, difficulty in walking especially when I first wake up, severe pain around the back neck/shoulder area, inflamation of muscles in general. this is only the 2nd day since I was told to stop the drug, so I have yet to experience a change.

Yet, the time-bomb was still ticking away in my system until my termination of the medication on my insistence one week later.While I still experience some very subtle but occasional side effects, like the flutter in my left ear, things are looking up.  It does take a little time for the medicine to work its way out of your system and prayerfully for me, I caught it in enough time to where I will not experience any permanent or long term damage.  My prayer is the same for all of you and thanks again for all who shared their experiences; you truly were a Godsend for me.

My EEG results were normal.  I met with my Neurologist this week, my first medical visit after stopping the Lipitor (3 weeks now), and I ecstatically expressed as well as had her observe just how incredibly well I feel.  I cannot put into words just how much my life has improved in all regards.  I feel like a brand new creation.  Feeling this well further emphasizes just how significantly bad off I was.  I am convinced that my body had hit its ultimate wall and was beginning to shut down.  I still find it very amazing that although I discussed different symptoms with my primary care physician not knowing what they were, he never considered the Lipitor, while these symptoms are clearly referenced as; &quot;Rare but possible side effects and when mentioned to your doctor, he/she will be able to diagnose it.&quot;  This very statement is currently airing during TV Advertisements for these drugs.  But, had I not challenged my doctor as a result of the comments posted on this site, I would still be on it, detrimentally so.  My Neurologist concurs that it is clearly evident that the drug was the obvious culprit.  I will remain on 81mg low dose Aspirin pending my physical and a follow-up MRI in March.  While these drugs work well for some, it can debilitating if not fatal for others.  One example I give is Penicillin which is fatal for some, but as for me, I have had no problems with that or any other drug for that matter until now.  See the conclusion of this message on the following posting.

High Cholesterol	linkbeach@a0l.com, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	3	3	1		55-64	11/17/2008 10:57:15 PM	I have been on Lipitor for over 3 years and was initially taking 40 mg per day. High cholesterol is hereditary in my case. My sister had been on nearly every medication for chosestorol over a 15 year period and her total number is 265.Three months ago my &quot;new&quot; primary doctor decided that the total cholestorol was too high at 205. Normally it has been from 250-270 which was a very substantial improvement. For three months now I have been on an increased dosage--80 mg for 3 months. Each day I am so tired and achey that I can hardly function normally. I have had spasms in my right hand, and could not even hold a glass. The least amount of activity is exhausting to me which has meant very little exercise. My memory is very fuzzy and sometimes I am hesitant to even drive. A nap is a daily necessity. Since I have fibromyalgia, initially I thought that was just getting worse. But most of the above issues began afer taking the 80 mg. Tomorrow I have an appointment with my medical doctor who prescribed the Lipitor. I do not want to take this large dosage. She told me in my last visit that she wants me to get to 180 for total cholestoral In reading the reviews from other readers, so far I found only one person who was ever under this dosage. I have just turned 62 this week and I want my life back!

Muscle weakness and chronically tired. I stopped taking Lipitor and am regaining strength.  This medication reacts with Plavix and some heart medications.  The condition is Rhabomyolosis (sp?)  Check it out on the net. It was an eye opener

Thank God my mother told me she had heard of such problems due to Lipitor.  I stopped using it and within just a few days was feeling much better.  My doctor confirmed these were common side effects, so I told him I wanted off statins altogether.  I feel 100% better without Lipitor.

I have been taking it for a very long time and it does not work the best for me. The doctors say it is doing its job keeping cholesterol down as well as helping the heart, but I feel antique. My entire body is sore beyond beleif, well if you take this and have trouble, you know what I mean. I take other meds as well(topomax) and I think between the two I may go insane. Any suggestions?

I was your average healthy 35 year old male with genetic predisposition for high cholesterol. Today, I'm 41 going on 98.  This drug ever so slowly took time away from me.  After about 4 years of being on Lipitor everything seemed to be going well.  But then the headaches started.  Along with the headaches came tender spots around my skull.  A year later the fatigue kicked in. My memory skills seemed to fade. But, no, I thought I was to young for that to happen. At year 6 I started to experience generalized pain throughout the body.  Shortly afterwards, the pain became more intense in the major joints.  And then the muscle soreness showed up. Soon I was so sore and weak that I could not walk up a flight of stairs.  All the while my doctors checked everything; CT scan of the neck, brain MRI, tested for Lyme disease and other diseases.  Finally, remembering that Al Gore had done us all some good by inventing the internet, I ran a few searches and found numerous reports of identical symptoms.  I discussed these findings with my doctor and we stopped all use of Lipitor. After a week of no Lipitor, I sit waiting to regain my strength. Fortunately some of the joint and muscle pain has subsided.  I'm happy about that, but am fearful what next week brings. If your doctor is prescribing Lipitor, think long and hard before you do.

I understand it is good for calcium and has other benefits that we are not aware of.  However, I have a friend who has taken this drug for 5 years and is chronically ill with liver problems and muscle wasting, no strength.

All levels have dropped noticeably with my good cholesterol only dropping 1 point.  I feel it is a good medication.

She was given this before and it put her in a wheelchair. The doctor took her off it because of our pressure a few years ago. The doctor prescribed lipitor again recently. We stopped mom from taking it. What is going on with the FDA? Why is this still on the market? Thanks WEB MD.

This is where a person finally learns the truth about &quot;wonder drugs&quot;.  I have never been sick a day in my life till I started taking &quot;Lipitor&quot;.  In fact, I didn't know what was happening to me for a very long time.  After reading the reviews of this drug by consumer's, I put the puzzle together.  Unable to sit, stand, move, soaking sweats feeling as if your body is on fire (not hot flashes), gaining an enormous amount of weight, memory loss, stiff neck, muscles, leg pain unimaginable, fatique and exhaustion, headaches, wheel chair bound, unable to leave the house for many years.  Only a few side effects of this drug.  After the kickbacks the DR's receive and knowing what this drug does to an individual, I am totally MAD!  READ ALL the information from consumer's, read all the reports about your medicine's.  This is so important.  Almost ten years I have wasted on trying to feel good for one day.  My husband is taking another brand of statin.  He has used this drug for over a year.  As of late, his mucles hurt so bad and he can hardly rise from a sitting position.  Arriving home from work he looks as if he can hardly make it in the house.  We both sat down and started reading about all the medicine's we take and SURPRISE!  Statin's are bad!!!  I have a choice wether to be disabled for the rest of my life, risking a stroke, or continuing &quot;Lipitor&quot;.  What would you recommend?  Yes, it controls cholesterol but at what price?  
High Cholesterol	Boyd, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	11/6/2008 5:50:29 PM	I started taking Lipitor around seven years ago.  In those seven years I am almost in a wheel chair.  Constant fatigue, unimaginable every day.  Sleeping has become a luxery for me.  Headaches and back aches, legs feel like you could beat them to death and they would still hurt.  I am stopping as of today 08, and trying over the counter med's.  I have been using Cinnamon and Garlic which are good for cholesterol and going to inform my doctor.  He has seen me every year and I progress worse, yet never metioned Lipitor could be causing every pain in my body.  My life has been taken away from me and am praying that this was the cause.  Never in my life did I think it was this.  I also have fibromalgia but not to be able to walk without assistance ... the doctor's know of these effects and yet they continue to prescribe it.  PLEASE, if you are feeling anything like I am get off of this drug!

High Cholesterol	G, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	11/2/2008 7:51:02 PM	I have hereditary high cholestorol. I am 48 yrs, 105 lbs and watch my diet, excercise etc... but to no avail.  Was precribed 10mg/daily since last April.  Recently experienced a fluttering in my ear, tingling in the hands/feet and bouts of confusion witnessed by co-workers, dry mouth, chronic fatigue, muscle cramps etc... etc...  A week ago my Dr ordered an MRI for the following week and even suggested pre-mature dementia but the following day I was admitted to the ER with high fever, high blood pressure, heart palputations in addition to the other symptoms mentioned.  They suspected stroke, menangitis, lymes desease etc... (all negative.) Extensive blood work, Cat Scan, MRI remains in-conclusive as to a diagnosis.  No one ever considered the Lipitor.  On a follow-up to my Dr after discharge I mentioned it and while he didn't consider it, he agreed to take me off the med for now.  I have an EEG tomorrow and a follow-up MRI pending.  I am very encouraged to have discovered these postings that lead me to believe that perhaps without the Lipitor in my system I will soon return to a sense of well being.  I am thankful to all who shared their experiences.

I do not have high blood pressure or any other health issues.  I tried Lipitor for approx. 90 days. After the first week, and my body adjusted to the medication, I felt fine. I was taking 10 mg per day and after 30 days, my LDL went form 140 to 97. So the medication definitely worked.  But I gradually began having joint and muscle aches and pains all over my body. I was always tired. I am a very busy and active person and so I continued to push myself, but around 90 days later it occurred to me that something was not right. I discontinued the medication and within two weeks, I was totally back to normal; no more joint or muscle pain and return of energy. Because of my reactions to Lipitor, my doctor has recommended using Flax Seed Oil Capsules 1000mg, 2 times a day.
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	Mississippi, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	10/3/2008 11:06:21 AM	I took Tricor for months will little results so my Dr. added Lipitor.  My next check up was much improved.  But after a few months I started having severe muscle cramps in my legs at night.  Sometimes I even have them during the day while standing on my feet. I have been treated for restless legs syndrome without success.  I have taken quinine, Requip, qualquin, and now Mirapex with no relief. About a year ago I started having hives and a skin rash that itched intensley.  I went to Dr.s all year last year trying numerous creams that did not help.  I found one cream that did help clear the rash.  It is Clobetasol.  Not something you want to use long term. But my rash is better in 2 days.  Both of these problems have interrupted my home life and work life.  After reading these posts I will not take another drug for Cholesterol and Triglycerides.  I am diabetic and heart disease runs in my family. So I will try to eat better, get some exercise, and take my chances.  I am tired of itchy rashes and walking the floors all night with leg cramps.

Primary Prevention of Heart Attack	NoDaisysYet, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	9/19/2008 3:11:55 PM	I first posted comments back in June. I was on this med for only a month then. In August I had a cholestrol test and my numbers only improved slightly and I was on 80 mg!!The side effects were terrible. I work out a lot and was unable to do so because of the joint and knee pain. Walking was painfull, bending was painfull. When I started having pain in my lower back that did it. The last straw. I went to the Dr and told him I was not taking Lipitor anymore. I was off the drug for a month and started feeling better in a couple weeks. I just started on Crestor 10 mg. Life is too important to accept these sides effects. 
High Cholesterol	AMABS, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	45-54	9/19/2008 9:43:19 AM	since dietary cholesterol numbers have no bearing on heart disease, and the fact that it robs your body of coenzyme Q10 ( which regulates heart beat ) I feel the drug is far more dangerous than helpful. Heart disease is caused by the over production of homocystine which is from the bodys inflammatory response mechanism. excess homocystine scars the artery walls and then plaque buils up over the scarred tisse. Lowering cholesterol DOES NOT REDUCE YOUR RISK OF HEART DISEASE.  Most peole who have heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels. Here is a personal example. My dad has been on lipitor for years, his cholesterol levels were perfect. He goes in for a checkup and comes out of the hospital two weeks later with a quintuple bypass because all the arteries to his heart were 85% clogged. So, explain to me how litpitor helped him? Look at the laundry list of side effects. Better solution is to de-stress yourslef, Eat very healthy, stay away from processed foods, DO NOT go on a low fat diet, Make sure to eat meats high in EFA's, drink lots of water and get off your ass and exercise.  Lipitor is good for one thing only, making a drug company tons of money.

High Cholesterol	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	9/2/2008 9:31:26 AM	I've been taking Lipitor for 10 years with minimal aches and pains. This past July I started having severe lower back pain. Then I started seeing blood in my urine. My doctor assumed it was a kidney stone and sent me in for a ct scan. Nothing was found, but my doctor told me to stop the Lipitor and sent me to a urologist. Another ct scan and a bladder scoping showed no adnormalities....thank God! I was off Lipitor for about 3 weeks and the pains were going away. Also, lab results were showing less blood in my urine. Still, the doctors didn't think Lipitor was the problem.  The urologist told me to continue my Lipitor. Two weeks after taking Lipitor my lower back pains came back. I was eating pain meds like candy. On my own, I decided to get off the Lipitor once again. It has now been one week of being off Lipitor and I have no more lower back pain, no more leg pain, no more foot pain, no more headaches, and no more visible blood in the urine. I also sleep better. Lipitor helped my cholestreol, but tore my body up. One more thing.  Five years ago, my high cpk enzyme levels sent me to an emergency room when the doctor thought I might be having a heart attack. After lab work, heart scan, and tests by other specialists my results all came back normal. I still have high cpk levels and I'm hoping those will go down after being off Lipitor. I'm now started dieting, taking fish oil, and flaxseed oil. Results are pending. In time, Lipitor will distroy your body one way or another.

High Cholesterol	juboo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	8/26/2008 9:12:10 PM	The dr put me on 10mg and i did good on that. Numbers were still not what he wanted so he put me on 20mg.  I started having HEART PALIPITATIONS.  I took myself off the lipitor and told my dr.  He was great.  Told me that only i can know what i feel.  Not a side effect listed, but i could be one of the minute people that have &quot;other&quot; reactions.  Off for awhile than he wanted me to try it again with taking Toprol for the heart problems.  Tried again and the palipitations immediately started up again.  Just cannot tolerate it.  Had an ekg and wore a halter monitor and nothing is abnormal with the heart.  Tried the Zetia too.  Same thing.   Am afraid to try anymore and give myself a heart attack.  So if anyone else experiences this you are not alone.  Am still having problems at times with the palipitations even after being off for months.

He also started me on Chantix to quit smoking.  I began to have several bad side effects, so after a month I stopped the Chantix.  About a week ago I heard about some side effects of Lipitor, did some research and discovered that I had many of those side effects.  Some that I had attributed to the Chantix had stopped, but some didn't. I had pain in legs and feet, depression, headaches, unusual sleeping patterns, difficulty concentrating, dermititis, lack of coordination, and just a general feeling of being unwell.I stopped the Lipitor that night (1 wk ago) and told my Dr., who put me on simvastatin 40mg, which I just started today.  I am hoping this drug will work for me so I can start the Chantix again &amp; quit smoking!I just thought people should know about some of the side effects of Lipitor.  I would have never guessed that it would affect me like that. I would suggest if anyone has any problems like that, they should talk to their Dr. asap.

I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy shortly after that.  I also have muscle pain and nerve pain in my left leg.  No doctor has ever related the two and I am still taking 20mg Lipitor, and the pain remains. I am going to stop taking it for awhile and see how I feel. It did lower my cholesterol and it has remained low.

It has worked well for me.  Though I have some aches &amp; pains - nothing is severe and I take Ibuprofen morning and night (600 mg) and this sucessfully addresses the the achy joints.  Overall, it has worked as advertised and my cholestrol &amp; trigycerides are at the upper end of the &quot;normal&quot; range.I suspect the Ibuprofen has made it easy to take.  I'm happy with the results.  I regularly golf, walk, and work out.

Four hours after my 2nd dose, I was in extreme abdominal lower quadrant cramping, which ended up radiating around to my back in the region of the kidneys.  I had darkened urine and increased frequency.  Most of the cramping resolved within 12 hours, though some remained for an additional 12.  I broke into sweats, became pale, and found that I could not focus.  I immediately called the doctor and did not resume this medication.

My cholesterol dropped 50 points after I started taking just 10 mg. of Lipitor. I have taken it to control cholesterol for over 10 years now. My cholesterol levels recently increased, and this time my doctor added fish oil supplements to the Lipitor, along with recommending dietary changes. My cholesterol came right back down again, to around 150. No side effects noted.

About 2 months after beginning the med., I developed sporadic pulsating tinnitus but didn't immediately associate it with Lipitor. About 4 months ago, this tinnitus took over my life. I couldn't sleep, think, etc. I developed anxiety over this constant roaring in my head. It stopped the day I went off the Lipitor. My doctor has changed me to Crestor, which seems to be working and the tinnitus hasn't returned. This side effect isn't well known, but it is a real and present side effect.

They want me around 50/60 not 70. Three stents in 6 mos. Eat right, diet and excerise. One blockage went from 50% to 71% in 6 mos???

I dropped dosage to 10mg recently and am feeling better. My doc didn't seem surprised at my report, but I'm not sure if I should be releived or shocked to see so many similar reports posted here.  Due to the long term heart related benefits I'm more affraid to quit taking entirely; hopefully the dosage being dropped will be a happy medium.

It worked well in lowering my cholesterol and triglyceride numbers.  However, I was gradually increasing in the frequency of muscle cramps and developed extreme anxiety, irritability, and became less able to keep my mind focussed on the job.  After I stopped taking the medication, my mental faculties returned to normal in about 3 weeks and the cramps ceased.
High Cholesterol	ekeene10, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	5/13/2008 12:12:13 PM	Took almost 4 wks. Joint and muscle pain in low back, chest, arms, legs, feet, hands.  Severe fatigue.  symptoms were gradual in onset and severity, so it didn't occur to me that the med was responsible until I experienced severe abdominal pain.  I stopped the med and within 2-3 days, symtoms were dramatically reduced.  It took several weeks to feel close to normal again and be able to walk and work out at the gym again.  I am about to try Zocor, another statin.  Will start very slowly with a low dose, and increate to moderate dose very gradually.  I will pay close attention and listen to my body this time.  Keeping my fingers crossed, because diet and exercise alone are enough for me.

I had developed poor circulation when sitting for long periods of time. I'd lost the strength in my arms.( I can normally bench press 250lbs.) I was unable to run a mile. (I normally run 3 miles a day).  For the last several months I had been unable to sleep. I tossed and turned all night. I constantly dreamed of death. I had become irritable and fatigued easily. I would be startled by loud noises.  My vision had become worse and overly sensitive to bright light. The muscles in my jaw would crack.  My doctor told me that my triglycerides were 5 times higher than normal. I had gained 45 pounds since my last visit. I was really scared. Since taking Lipitor 10mg I've noticed improved circulation especially in my feet. The veins in my hands (and feet) are no longer distended. I am able to sleep at night. According to my wife my sleep apnea is gone. I'm 48 but right now I feel like a a teenager. My vision has improved. I no longer feel the lids tightening around my eyes. I don't feel dizzy when I stand up suddenly. The bad dreams are gone. I have only been taking Lipitor for 2 weeks. I changed my diet to lighter and leaner portions. I take fish oil 1200 mg. I've experienced a real improvement in my quality of life.

Overall cholesterol dropped from 260 down to 115, LDL 187 to 98, HDL 53 to 65 within first year. However, after year 3, chronic weakness and pain in legs developed and had to quit. Within 3 months of stopping strenght in legs returned to about 90%.I've tried vytorin, zocor thus far, but leg pain comes back after a few weeks. I'm a 60 year male and I was on statins(Baycol,Zocor, Liptor, and Vytorin from age53 1/2 to 59. I'm off statins now and lipids have returned to previous high levels275 overall, 180 ldl, however HDL is over 70.

Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol		5	5	5			3/28/2008 3:05:16 PM	Remarkable drug in my opinion. I have taken 10mg for about 3 years. Cholesterol went from 270 Total (LDL 150, HDL 37) to 126 (LDL 82, HDL 39). Diet and exercise couldn't get it down but Lipitor put the numbers through the basement with no side effects. Great medication!
Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	resbca, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	3/27/2008 9:59:13 PM	I had severe muscular pain and weakness in both shoulders, arms, down both legs within a few days of beginning Lipitor. I finally collapsed while walking and was taken to the emergency room. None of the MD's involved brought up Lipitor or any statin use as a possible cause and kept putting me through extensive and invasive heart tests. I stopped it on my own after three weeks and started improving within a few days.I hate to say it but that was three years ago and the shoulder pain and nueropathy in both legs continue. If you are experiencing muscle pain or weakness don't wait thinking it will go away. See you Doctor immediately and question the use of a statin. The damage can be permanent.

I stopped the drug and was better inside of two weeks. Now I take Advicor with no side effects. There are lots of choices for lowering cholesterol.
High Cholesterol	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	2	5	1			3/26/2008 3:59:09 PM	I took this medication for about 4-5 months. My muscles hurt so bad, it felt like they were going to explode. I called my doctor and told her I was not taking it any longer. She put me on Zetia, and the pain in muscles went away. Some people cannot take statin drugs such as lipitor. Watch the symptoms, I thought it was arthritis for long time, pain was awful and I slept a lot.

I had terrible memory loss, was unable to do crossword puzzles, couldn't remember the basic plot from a recently viewed movie, etc.  10 days after stopping drug, I was back to my old self.  I'll have to find another way to lower my numbers.  Zetia gave me horrific ringing in the ears so that's not an option.  I'm ready for a holistic approach.

While in the hospital I didn't take my lipitor.  Every fibromyalgia &quot;symptom&quot; I had disappeared completely within a few days: fatigue, lethargy, depression, Severe muscle, joint pains especially in the hips to the point of being almost crippled, nausea with severe vomitting, periperal neuropathy. These symptoms persisted for over two years!! They subsided a few days after taking the lipitor. I have a new lease on life!

Some minor muscle pains on occasion but consider the numbers: Before Lipitor my LDL was 206. Since starting Lipitor my LDL has averaged 137. Naturally, a somewhat practical diet was also applied but no regardless, the numbers speak for themselves!

I told the doctor this as well...cut back due to the constant increased muscle pain in my arms, shoulders, hands(many times the pain wakes me up at night) shoulder blades (burning pain just from floding clothes)hips(burning pain when only walking 2 blocks-(have to stop and rest then I can walk a little more)  Take tylenol or Ibuprofen for the pain...don't like to take either of these drugs very often so I endure the pain most of the time. I am thinking of stopping the Lipitor totally.   My doctor has been told about my side effects and doesn't seem to think it is serious-but I do.  My bloodwork Dec '06 was Cholesterol 206=HDL 56 &amp; LDL 125.4 while on the meds.

High Cholesterol		1	1	1			2/8/2008 1:07:03 PM	 just recently, news articles have been published saying the FDA has found now after reevaluation, that lipitor has no beneficial affects on patients cholesterol during clinical trials. why would the doctors tell people that exercise and change in diet are more effective in lowering their cholesterol instead?

High Cholesterol	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	3	5	1	Female	65-74	2/1/2008 7:35:22 PM	I took Lipitor at 40 miligrams and developed tiredness in the extreem.  I got up tired.  I did not realize it was Lipitor and my doctor did not relate the drug to my tiredness.  Then the doctor increased the Lipitor to 80 miligrams.  I developed terrible pain in ankel and foot joints.  I was wrappeing my feet with ace bandages just to walk and even then had trouble walking.  I went to an endochronoligist for another problem and she said I was on a high dose of Lipitor and it could cause the pain I was suffering.  I quit immediately taking Lipitor and the pain subsided.  I just hope there is no more damage as my liver levels came back out of whack not too long after that.  This is a drug that should be discuseed by the doctor with the patient before prescribing.

No problems.  No adverse symptoms.Then without warning I had growing muscle and joint aches, growing fatigue, then ringing in my ears, sore throat, and tingling in my extremities - all in increasing intensity until the symptoms were severe and borderline debilitating.Once I stopped lipitor, almost all symptoms were gone in 4 days.  Effective drug, but side effects can be severe and unpredictable.  It (inexplicably) took my doctor 3 visits to figure it out.

High Cholesterol	Ed, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/18/2008 9:44:06 AM	I had been on Lipitor for many years.  It helped my cholesterol levels, but the side affects were horrible.  I had muscle weakness and soreness throughout my whole body.  My feet were sore to walk.  I was fatiqued, had lots of stiffness, depression and nervousness, weight gain &amp; severe memory and concentration problems.  I thought I had a stroke.  I also noticed spots on my skull were tender to the touch.  Thinking all this was other problems, my Dr. said to go off for 3-4 days and then go back on, if symptoms presisted when going back on, then go off immediately.  I did that and found out the symptoms were from the Lipitor.  The drug affected my life, activity, job and home life.  It about ruined my life.

I had blood tests and an ultrasound of my liver.  My liver was inflamed, but fortunately not permanently damaged.  It took almost two weeks without taking Lipitor for the symptoms to reverse.  This can be a very dangerous drug for some people.

My friend, who was also on this had the same problem and stopped taking it.  I too stopped and my leg pain went away.It did keep my cholesterol normal, but the pain was a bad side effect.

Went on a strict diet and exercise, but levels came down to the 280's.  Tried Niacin, but had reactions to it in the higher doses.  Now no 80 MG and cholesterol is down to 200 and staying there.  Triglycerides are still high even with increased fiber diet and low fat.  I have had no side effects even on this higher dose.

Afterwards we started the Lipitor to keep my LDL as low as possible since I have low HDL no matter what we do.  It seems to do that.  As far as I know, I have had no problems caused by the Lipitor, but I have not been off it for any period.  Some g/i symptoms I have had were apparently due to other drugs I also took, but maybe it was the Lipitor alone or with the other med. If my next Chol still looks very good, I may stop it for awhile to see if I feel any changes.
Primary Prevention of Heart Attack	Lance, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	1	Male	55-64	11/14/2007 9:29:56 PM	I am a five foot, 9 inches tall male and my weight is 150 pounds plus or minus 5 pounds. I started on 10MG of Lipitor and a strict diet in November of 2003 at the age of 60 years. I followed my diet in spit of people questioning it. I developed and suffered sever nerve and muscle problems, fatigue, achiness, and a burse on my left elbow within a relatively short time. As time went on, I developed bleeding in my spine and had a bout of sciatica requiring physical therapy. On a number of occasions, infection caused Tendinitis in my left shoulder requiring medication and physical therapy and emergency trips to the hospital. Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis arthritis have become sever. Later on blood pockets developed under my skin on face and scalp. Continuing tenderness of my skin on both arms has been off and on. My lack of interest in anything or any wish to do anything has been the result of these side effects. Severe side effect brings of periods of depression lasting for many months. Two gallbladder attacks resulted in more emergency trips to the hospital. Test revealed a huge thumbnail side gallstone consisting mainly of cholesterol. I am how on a more restrictive low cholesterol lower fat diet. Constant infections have ruled out a gallbladder operation.  Kidney, bladder, urinary problems, and erectile dysfunction have been serious side effects. I have been diagnosed with idiopathic peripheral neuropathy that tends to get worse in the colder months. Dry eye, dry mouth, and starting cataracts in both eyes with dramatic vision changes have developed in the last two years due interaction to additional medications the fight infections. Early in 2007 I had three abnormal blood test resulting in reducing my dosage of Lipitor to 5MG for 3 months that lead to changing to 5MG of Lovastatin. Still have severe side effects. Will have another blood test in December, 2007.

High Cholesterol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	11/14/2007 7:55:44 PM	I have a family history of heart disease. When I reached 50 years of age, and wasn't able to get optimum results with diet/exercise, my doctor started me on 20 mg./day.In the 5 years I have been taking it, I've always had satisfactory results with blood testing. At the start I had some minor muscle weakness in the arms but that subsided after a brief time. I am now 55 (my father and uncle both died at 54 from heart disease). Though I can't say it's Lipitor alone since I don't smoke cigarettes as they did and follow a fairly low fat diet, I would venture to guess it has helped me.

I've been on Lipitor for 5+ years and have had no side effects. I ran the NY Marathon last year and several other 1/2 marathons. I have never experienced any muscle weakness or soreness from Lipitor. Prior to being on Lipitor my cholesterol was over 300, triglycerides were 350 and HDL was very low. This along with Gemfibrozil and a bowl of Flax plus cereal by Nature's Path every morning are the ticket for me.

He started it again and it returned so he stopped it permanently.  I think this drug and other statins have the potential to be dangerous and are prescribed too often instead of making lifestyle changes first.

Started taking l0 mgs. after Baycol was removed from the market. Recently my total Cholesterol was normal; however, the LDL was higher than the HDL and my doctor increased my dosage to 20 mgs., one per day. He will not recheck for several months but is confident this will work and I have a lot of confidence in my doctor, with diet, exercise and weight loss, this should work. All meds. take time and not every one reacts the same, but Lipitor has worked just fine for me and I listen to my doctor, not always believing myself, but he is really patient with me. Just hope this product stays on the market. Thanks.

High Cholesterol	MstngLady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/5/2007 11:15:21 AM	I can't say if this drug was effective as I only took it for a month and got so sick I had to quit taking it. I had severe muscle aches, was so fatigued I felt like I was dying and then I got some sort of urinary problem where my urine was discolored. I was so sick I couldn't get out of bed. That was 6 years ago. I refused to take any other cholesterol drugs until the last year. Took zetia, it did help but again got the muscle aches and severe fatigue. I quit taking it and my cholesterol shot up 100  pts. in 3 months. Tried taking it again but had the same results so again, I quit taking it. About 6 months ago blood test show that my kidneys are not functioning properly for a person my age, apparently they're aging faster than I am! I had a kidney ultrasound which showed nothing and my Dr. isn't investigating it further, which really bothers me as I would really like to know what happened to my kidneys. What scares me the most is that I am a single middle aged woman who is self employed, therefore I have limited resources as far as any benefits if I become disabled due to kidney failure, which is apparently what I am looking at in the future. Are the drug companies that make these dangerous drugs going to support me?  I think not!

Since I have prediabetes, the neuropathy was ascribed to DM. I read about this side effect, and stopped the lipitor. My symptoms are now gone in my feet and tolerale in my hands.I am a doctor myself, and I think many clinicians are not too good recognizing side effects.

Lipitor works well, and I have used Zetia along with it to bring my levels below 190.  I don't, however, follow a strict low-fat diet, which would probably help.

Even after increased exercise and major diet changes I just could not achieve the number that my doctor and I wanted.  So... on to Lipitor and it works for me.  I have no side effects that I know.  I take it at night before bed with 4 oz. of water.
