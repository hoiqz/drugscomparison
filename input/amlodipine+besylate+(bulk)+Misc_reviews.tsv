Other	NinaF, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	7/2/2012 1:33:30 PM	I have been taken this drug amlodipine besylate 10mg, along with a water pill call spironolactone 25mg for about a month and I am now experiencing hives, and occasionally joint knee pain.  I have stop taking both medication for about three days now and I am still itching.  I rub witch hazel to stop the itching. The medications give me a headach also.  So I split the amlodipine besylate 10mg pill in half and wait four hours and take the other half. In so doing, I don't get headaches.  I read about the adverse affects and muscle pain, headaches and hives are a few affects in taking both of these med's. I believe these (this) medication works for my high blood pressure, but I am going to have to see my Doctor about this and have him precribe me something better.Hopfully this helps the next reading.
Other	Peaches, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	45-54	6/14/2012 2:40:55 PM	I have been on this drug for over a year.  I take this drug to control my high blood pressure.  I started out on 5mg and the doctor increased it to 10mg.  It does a good job controlling my blood pressure.  But my liver enzymes have increased significantly.  I am now seeing a gastroenterlogist. We are still running tests but he thinks it is this drug that is causing me problems.  Lately I have started experiencing swollen ankles and feet.  And after reading some of the other reviews have determined that the joint pain and frequent headaches is probably from this medication as well.  I am in contact with my doctor; waiting for a call back.  I no longer want to take this drug.  It has too many major side effects.

Other	Lindac, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	5/26/2012 8:07:33 AM	Ive been on this drug for 2 months which did improve BP.  Four weeks ago I started feeling listless.  The symptoms began to pile up, chills, exhaustion, shortness of breath, diarrhea, weight gain, rapid heartbeat, swollen ankles, all which attributed to depression.  I thought something was seriously wrong until last weekend when I forgot to take this medication for 3 days.  I was like a new person, lots of energy and feeling great.  This drug completely changes a person and their lifestyle.  Find another way...this stuff is poison.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	5/12/2012 2:10:42 PM	This drug is very bad. Took myself off after 3 days. Low energy was the first side effect. Slight swelling in ankles, joints were tender when working out. I refuse to take a drug that interferes with my 5-7 day workouts and asthma. I was shocked to hear it causes shortness in breath. Working with my doctor for new BP medicine and exploring healthy foods to lower BP. Stay away from this drug &amp; work with your doctor. Talk to all of your healthcare professionals...they can provide insight.

BUT, since I started taking the AMLODIPINE, I found I had the same side-effects as the first review I read here at WedMD; stomache problems, weight gain and chest pain! I thought maybe it was all in my head and that I should give it a chance, but I am contacting my Doctor today, and asking to get back on the Lisinopril- I'm not a &quot;weight-gain&quot; person either, and I've put on a good 8 to 9 lbs. in the last 2 months!

I was given Omeprazole the firs t time and Famotidine the last two times, which are antacids.  I finally got fed up and did my own research online and discovered that one for the side effects of Amlodipine was stomach pain.  I immediately sent a messaged to my doctor and attached the article for his review.  Finally he told me to stop taking the medication.  Today is the first day in almost two years that I do not have stomach pain.  It was so bad that it felt like I was having a heart attack.  I always had this painful full feeling after every meal and I have gained over 20 pounds, another side effect, which is so unusual for me.  There was also the issue of swelling of my feet.  This drug was very harmful and costly to me and I hope this reveiw helps others with their symptoms.

Doc said there were no side affects...bull s**t (especially after reading all the other posts).  He has had mild to severe chest pain.  He says it either feels like he's just had a hard workout or got kicked in the ribs by a horse.  He has an extremely high pain tolerance but he was doubled over on the floor this morning in pain.  He's going to doc today.  He didn't notice any weight gain or swelling like others have reported.  Worked great for his BP but not worth his pain.

It did help to lower my BP but I started to notice when I was in bed it felt as if my heart was outside of my chest and my face broke out.  Told the doctor about the rash and she said more than likely it was the Benicar and since the Amlodipine was working better she now have me trying it alone twice a day with a water pill Hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG once a day.  Have been doing that for approx 3 weeks now and the blood pressure is almost sometimes lower than 120/80 in the AM but approx 130/85 at night.  I have now noticed that a several small bumps on both arms and both thighs and upper chest area and the face is like a road map.  Also have started to experience swelling ankles for the last 5 days. Thought it was due to excessive salt until I started to read the reviews.  Oddly enough I took the Benicar by itself for 3 days and the swelling of the feet went down.  Will now stop taking the Benicar and Amlodipine and go back to Diovan until I see my doctor in early May.

I have been sleeping in a dark room with a fever but the chills, eating only tea and toast and having vomitting and diarrhea. I was working up to taking 4 2.5 mg a day when that did not work. I stopped completely. This is my second day off taking two of the meds the docs did not want me (old RX)to take and I'm up and starting to feel better even ate some soup.
