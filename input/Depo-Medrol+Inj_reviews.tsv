It was not a good experience.  I was sick for a week, just sick and aggitated uncoordinated and no sleep.  the next week I began checking my blood pressure and it was elevated, I never had bp problems prior.  I developed migraines and intermittent dizziness, my voice changed, my legs became week.  my heart raced.  I went back to see the doctor and he refused to see me.  I saw another doctor and was told to take a tylenol for my headache.  i will never take those injections again
Other	NEVER AGAIN!, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/26/2012 4:35:57 PM	Just one trigger point injection of 20 mg. depo-medrol 4 months ago resulted in numerous side effects. The menstrual irregularities, red face and chest and extreme insomnia have subsided, but the pain in arms, hands, legs and feet persists and isn't letting up at all. I was told by my doctor that this was merely a &quot;pediatric&quot; dose and harmless. Found out later the proper dosage for depo-medrol. In addition to being in the package insert material it's posted in the July 15, 2002 issue of the American Family Physician Journal (article title &quot;Joint and Soft Tissue Injection&quot;): 2 to 10 mg for soft tissue and small joints. So, the 20 mg I received for one trigger point (soft tissue injection) is excessive. Corticosteroids are very potent drugs and in my experience with both depo-medrol and kenalog (also horrible side effects) doctors tend to be incredibly cavalier in administering these meds and have a collective blind spot when it comes to side effects.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	lenap, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/10/2012 2:04:09 PM	This is the only treatment that works for me.  Tried all the other RA treatments, nothing works like this.  I receive an injection in my buttock once every 4 months (if I stretch it)  Have been known to come in 3 - 3-1/2 months)  The injection does not hurt at all.  Relief is instant.  I can run,walk, climb stairs, etc. which by the 4th month is very painful.  It truly is a miracle drug for me.  I might get an occasional hot flash or sweats but that is all.  It might not work for everyone, but it does for me.  Nothing else worked.  I do feel slight tingling in my toes from time to time and numbness but that is the worst.

After many treatments for RA, nothing worked.  The only pain relief I receive is from this injection.  I can walk, get out of the tub easily.  It is really like a miracle for me.  I know when the 4th month is coming because I feel pain all over getting worse each day.  I do get hot flashes and sweating which are uncomfortable but better than constant pain.  My bone scans are fine for me age (65).  Without this I would not have the quality of life that I do.

I did receive an unexpected reaction from it, however. My skin became red all over, and I became feverish and had headaches. After the second day of this, I finally stopped reacting to it. Benedryl helped, which means I had some sort of an allergic reaction to it.

Other	AbigailB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	19-24	4/24/2012 9:47:10 PM	I have received injections every three months for the last 1.5 years due to chronic back pain from a car accident. The injections are, at first, very painful, and it can take up to 6 days for me to fully recover, but within a week or two I feel perfectly fine! With these injections I am able to retain full range of motion with very limited back pain. Unfortunately, I do have to go through this same process every three months.Side effects for me include bruising and redness at the injection sites (t10-t12 and surrounding muscles on back/spine), pain at injection sites, and severe muscle soreness. I do take prescription pain killers for 3-5 days after receiving injection.Even with the associated pain, I highly recommend this for intramuscular injection! The benefits outweigh the temporary pain issues.

Contact Dermatitis	Venus, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	7-12	2/3/2012 12:24:18 AM	My cat had flea infestation and scabs on the rear end.  We put flea treatment on her.  Then my husband got concerned and took her to the vet where she had a geriatric/senior exam.  There was reputed to be a heart murmur which indicated heart disease.  The vet gave the cat an injec tion of Depro-Medrol supposedly for easing the irritation of the skin.  Well,  soon my cat displayed tiredness,  wouldn't eat and couldn't breathe very well.  She started vomiting and that is when she was rushed to the vet again.  This time a new vet said her lungs were filling with water an d she had congested heart disease. She was 12 years old so the vet whom we knew better than the other vet,encouraged us not to take drastic measures to save her.  So she was put to sleep, just like that.  B efore the injection she at least was not exhibiting all these other effects,  just the heaart murmur and problems with bad teeth. She was just a cat but couldn't the vet have warned us of any side effects and couldn't he have thought twice about the Depo-Medrol injection?  Everything was ok until we took her to that first vet appt. 
Any Disease Following Trauma Involving Joint Cartilage	RSD/CRPS/fibro and joint pain., 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	2/2/2012 2:30:16 AM	I rated this for RSD/CRPS, but also received injections into joints after same auto accident. Helps lube joint, as well as relieve pain for some time.  It plateaus in relation to effectiveness, but remains effective at that level.  First uses are most dramatic, then you plateau at that nice level.  I have it shot into the shoulder, shoulder blade bottom tip (scapula), and hip joints, mostly (as well as into the spinal column). Oh, and the occipital area in back of neck, which helps neck, headaches, and thinking (due to pain relief).

Other	RSD/CRPS, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	9/22/2011 12:15:02 PM	RSD/CRPS (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy also called Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome) from and auto accident in 1998. I was totally dysfunctional until 2001 when epidural DepoMedrol injections helped me be able to function within the family (but not return to work).  My pain had spread everywhere (meaning in body and limbs, spreading top right, down, then across the spine, top left, down).  This drug got it under control. To have had it earlier would have stopped the spread.  I get much less of it now than then.  I was told benefit would plateau, and it did, but the first effect was dramatic.  I still have many problems, but at least I was more available to the family.  Side effects of fatigue and depressed mood are temporary, and fade in a week or so after treatment (then I'm back to the normal fatigue and mood from the disease).  I recommend the drug to those having had a trauma, and RIGHT AWAY, to stave off the possibility of RSD/CRPS (first six months after trauma). My life would be better had I been treated sooner.  Medical community needs to be more aware...  There are millions of RSD/CRPS sufferers un-diagnosed, or misdiagnosed.

Was prescribed a 40mg be given directly into hip joint by a radiologist. It works fairly well, and I much more mobile. However, my one side effect has been ringing in my ears....sounds like a bunch of locusts. I am considering a hip joint &quot;resurfacing,&quot; rather than too many shots of Depo Medrol. I understand there can be many other side effects more severe than tinnitus.

I went to my family doctor and they provided me a quick shot in the rear, in about a day I was able to breathe and could not believe how this little shot opened my nasal passages up like it did. None of the other over the counter medications came close to giving me such relief! I must say this was a miracle drug for me as well. I had no known side effects to report. The shot lasted for a good 4 months before my symptoms returned.

Although I did experience relief from back pain, I had sufferred a complete failure of my right-hip which was diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis shortly after my Depo-Medrol treatments.  I had no history if hip pain or problems prior to this.  The end-result is that I had to have a total hip replacement.  I was only 46 at the time of the diagnosis.

Went to a female rheumatologist who did complete blood work, etc. and said cortisones CANNOT help fibro. I said, it DOES help me.  later i went back after a &quot;burst&quot; and she was amazed at my strength and how i could walk.  She waited 30 days, then gave me a 120 mg injection of Depo-Medrol.  For about 3 days it did not help. Then it kicked in and for two full MONTHS i have had full range of motion, able to walk up and down steps without my cane, can lift 10 pounds, my husband does not have to help me out of bed or dress me.My family doc said he gives Depo to arthritis patients, but will begin to give me the shots 4 times a year as the rhematologist recommended.

I have tried many medications and nothing seems to work.  Once I receive the injection I am pain free for about 4 - 6 months sometimes less.  But the side effect that bothers me is my face has become a bit moon-face and weight gain.  I work out and watch my food and still gain weight.  I hate this but could not function without pain so those are my choices.  No other side effects so this med is really like a miracle drug.  Guess we have to make choices sometimes.

Vasculitis	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	11/7/2007 1:49:42 AM	I have been given this drug twice for short term relief of symptoms for Rhuemitoid Vasculitus.  It acted like adreneline for about a day, but the pain and other symptoms went away for weeks.  I do get other drugs such as Ritoxin and prednisone, so it is not a solo effect.  But I do know when I get it and it definitely has an effect. 
Other	25-34 Female 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/25/2007 2:11:45 PM	I was referred by a co-worker who suffers from severe allergies as I do.  I went in the same day I found out about Depo-Merolo and got a shot.  Within 5 minutes my conjestion was cleared and the dry cough was non-existent. For myself it was a miracle shot.
