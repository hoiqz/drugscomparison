Infection of Intestines caused by Staphylococcal Bacteria	Dowdydsx, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	35-44	8/27/2012 2:10:28 PM	Took vancomycin to treat CDiff, after 14 days, stopped medication.  3 weeks later Cdiff was positive again.  Took Vanco for a total of 30 days tappering does last two weeks.  Side affects were horrible, back pain, stomach ache, cramping, fatique and diahrea.  Have been off it for 5 days now and still feeling tired with some stomach issues.  How long does it take to get out of system and/or for my digestive system to get bck to normal?

At first I was told my insurance wouldn't cover it. I had my dr. call in a pre auth and it went from $420.00 down to my 5.00 co-pay!  Just a tip to help those with insurance issues.  Also, that is for the liquid.  The taste is horrible, but, short lived with a drink of something immediately following the dose.  I am however headed back to the doctors for a bubbly, rash that I have developed.  This is an awful bacteria and I feel for any one who has to go through this.  I just can't wait for it to be GONE...6 weeks with this has taken a toll on me.

But after taking the oral vanco for 54 days, about 10 days after stopping the medication my mouth began to burn, went to a dentist who said that it could be nerve damage from the extended use of vanco. I now have Burning Mouth Syndrome which is very painful. Has anyone else had this experience. Thank u.

It was very expensive, (my porton was nearly $2k after insurance picked up the majority), but since it was the only thing after months of fighting c diff to have worked, it was worth it!
Other	Meiko2010, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/15/2011 9:08:12 AM	My insurance, Medicare Part D, paid for the drug which I was given after 3 (14 day) courses of Flagyl.  I was critically ill, and getting worse.  I wish my physicians had not been so conservative because not going on Vancomycin earlier almost killed me.  One of their reasons was that it was an expensive drug.  I took it with Flagyl. This also took three 14 day courses.  I did not get worse while I was on it as I had with the Flagyl alone. Vancomyacin saved my life.  A few months later, my hands swelled and were extremely painful for several weeks.  It could have been a residual effect of the c dif or something else.  It disappeared.  After I tested clean, I still had diarreah for several weeks, but I think my system needed to recuperate even after the c dif was gone.  C dif is a horrible, horrible, often deadly disease and I am so grateful I had this drug.I think my physicians could have explained how the drugs work better, that they often take weeks to attack c dif and that the symptoms might remain after the illness is gone.

Cost for 14 day 1oz doses 4 times a day should be about 25.00. Try a hospital pharmacy. The drug works!

Severe Bloody Diarrhea from Antibiotics	welldun, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	4/30/2011 11:19:41 AM	C.diff is terrible - Dr.s &amp; dentists really need to make people more aware of the possible effects of antibiotic over-use, &amp; especially clindomycin, often the culprit in contracting this disease. Had I known about c.diff, I would have held off on more antibiotics for my infected thumb, at least for a while! And then I would also take massive doses of probiotics along with the antibiotics, also NOT mentioned by the dr. Yoghurt by itself won't do it. My first course of meds were the Vanco capsules, at $1400. This did not clear up the condition, so my dr. put me on a pulse therapy of liquid Vanco, 4x a day for 14 days, 2x a day for 7 days, 1x a day for 7 days, and so on.The first round of 14 days worth of the liquid solution was only $23! Not all pharmacies can dispense the liquid form, but it is definitely worth looking around for one that does! So far, symptoms have improved, but this disease is notorious for relapses, so I am keeping my fingers crossed - and faithfully &amp; meticulously taking my medicine!

A 7 day prescription, after insurance, was $1200.00. Are you serious? Needless to say I am not on this medication and instead I am on the god-awful Flagyl, 1500 milligrams for 10 days with a cost of $7.47. Go Figure!!!

Other	anyajenkins, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4		19-24	7/27/2010 1:27:24 AM	I was prescribed Vancomycin for C. dif. Originally I was prescribed Flagyl, which caused a severe allergic reaction - my entire body swelled up and turned red. I had a very high fever and was severely dehydrated. After hassling with the insurance company and doctors I finally got insurance to cover Vancomycin. Bottom line - it is expensive but worth it. Next time I will ask for it right away.

After fighting with the company administering my prescription plan, they agreed to cover it but I still had to pay the copay of $536.  My wrist and hand turned red and began to swell after the 2nd day on vanco. It continued to swell with a lot of pain &amp; I still had diarrhea!!  Dr. had me stop for 3 days -it took that long for my hand to return to normal - am finishing up a round of flagyl (which costs me 62 cents).  I am praying this works as I am still not 100 percent.  I'm not sure what I'll do if it doesnt work.  Cdiff is horrible!

Other	sue, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/6/2009 6:00:39 PM	I was prescribed vanco after 17 days of unsuccessful treatment with flagyl (and its horrid side effects). I would have requested vanco the first time, but I read many scarey reports about side effects and agreed to suffer through flagyl. Since the flagyl didn't work, I'm now on vanco oral capsules. If I don't eat enough I get stomach burning and pain with vanco capsules. So I take vanco with food (small meals with fats, proteins and fiber, not low fat snacks) 4x a day.  After one day of vanco my c-diff symptoms all but disappeared. I wished I chose this drug the first time. Fortunately I could get vanco through my HMO (Group Health Coop) for $30 for 7 day treatment, rather than pay $555 which non members would pay. I hope the 7 days of vanco eliminates my c-diff, but I'd certainly use this drug again. VERY SATISFIED.

There are two kinds, liquid and pills, the pills cost about $4000 (that's right three zeros) for a 30 day supply, the liquid is about $420.  I live right outside of Albuquerque and from what the insurance company told me there are only a few pharamcys that can mix this med so that's a little hard to find.  Also let me tell you about the taste, it's horrible, make sure you have something to kill the taste to drink right after you take it.  All in all, it's worked, although it's taken a month longer than expected, but it does work.

The doctor then prescribed Vancomycin.  The cost quoted by Walgreens is $1650 for 10 days supply.  That's obscene.  We are retired and on Medicare and cannot afford this.  How can a drug be that expensive???  The pharmaceutical companies are just plain greedy.  There is no other explanation.

The information does not say if this is temporary or permanent.The physicians that treated my mother, never said anything about further risk to her hearing.  She has had a noticeable affect on her hearing from a 10 day course of taking vancomycin.Remember to ask the physician who is perscribing a medication about the side affects.  Also ask the pharmacist.  If your loved one has bad kidneys or vision problems or liver problems or hearing loss tell the physician if my loved one has this kind of disease or diability does this medication have side affects that might cause a higher level of risk for the patient.
