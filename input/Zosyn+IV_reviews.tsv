Other	gaitor, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		7/3/2011 9:25:47 PM	I am actually reviewing this for my elderly 92 year old aunt who was administered this after endoscopic common bile duct gallstone removal. Within couple of hours of Zosyn, she developed kidney failure, as well as thrombocytopenia, hypokalemia, and 4+ edema of her hands.  She was even placed on hospice! (Her close friend and neighbor had also had this happen to her with Zosyn; kidney failure, which thankfully is slowly improving.) Aunt Edie was placed in a Rehab facility much too quickly, but immediately worsened and was readmitted to hospital, for another 10 days. Total inpatient time was 3 weeks!
Appendicitis	anonymouse, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/20/2011 11:08:51 PM	I was given this in the hospital for suspected appendicitis because the hospital was too busy to send me into surgery. It seems to have cleared up the problem, oddly my symptoms disappeared. I had no side effects, which is great, because I react negatively to pretty much everything.

The doctors placed me on IV and gave this antibiotic. I knew immediately that that something was wrong. Within 30-45 seconds I could not breath! Always have them ready with benadryl or something to counter act this allergic reaction. I truly felt as if I was going to die.

They did have to add another antibiotic after my surgery, and either it, or the combination of the 2, made my mouth taste horrible! I also got pretty bad diarrhea, but that is clearing now that I'm off of it. The bad taste in my mouth remains!

Other	Quutipp123, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/26/2008 3:33:00 PM	I had a urinary tract infection that made its way into my right testicle and caused swelling and a tremendous amount of pain. After doctors tried some other antibiotics that did not work, they started me on Zosyn, and it began to bring my white blood count back to normal. After seven days of the drug every eight hours, I was back to normal and released from the hospital. I just wish there would have been a pill form available.
