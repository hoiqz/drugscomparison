Birth Control	BreRoss, 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	1		19-24	7/28/2012 3:52:45 AM	I started taking this pill due to a irregular period. I was on the pill for about 6 months with no problems whats so ever. Than around the 7th month i started feeling sick all of the time. I went to the hospital and was informed that i had a pulmonary embolism. I was hospitalized for 1 week. I was terrified because i never was a frequent smoker or drug user. But it happens to the best of us. Now i owe the hospitals 70,000.:|
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	7/10/2012 8:35:33 PM	Although there are negative reviews I say give it a chance if your body easily adjusts to pills. Naturally I have mild hirsutism, moderate oily acne skin all over my body, I have significant underarm perspiration, and I usually am a nervous person under stress. So, I thought taking Zovia would exacerbate my mild anxiety after I read the other reviews about it making anxiety or depression worse. Well no that was not the case for me. In fact, it significantly made me feel calm under stress (no longer waking up with sore jaw), and it balanced out all my other problems. I did not take it long enough to see it clear up all my acne because I had adverse effects (tingly/numbing in the arms, neck, legs, bad circulation and abnormal water retention near my ankle), but it stopped breakouts and increased healing in so little time. As for the hirsutism, it scared me a bit bc I noticed more growth, but it rapidly reduced in a few days. Only you know what works for your body, so pay attention to the hormonal levels. This is a high/moderate estrogen, moderate progestin, with the least androgen potency from the 1st generation of pills.  Best wishes :&gt;
Birth Control	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	19-24	7/9/2012 3:29:49 PM	I put a 3 for the effectiveness, because I havent been on it THAT long. But I can tell you this, my boobs have grown and are sore all the time... it hasnt made me too hungry, I have been watching what i eat tho.. as far as sex drive goes, I still have it! 
Birth Control	Ashleigh, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	6/22/2012 1:16:47 PM	It is obviously keeping me from having babies, (: but the side effects are terrible. When i dont eat i dry heave until i do, my breasts are always sore, Im always tired, and a complete crazy physco woman to my boyfriend, and i have no sex drive either. On the upside i have gained a few pounds which is mainly why i considered birth control as well as regulating my periods and things like that. I was confused on when to take the white ones and if i missed a pill what i was supposed to do, my doctor didnt really explain a whole lot to me so when i missed a pill i took it the next day but i didnt take two in the same day. and then ive gone through all the bc pills but i guess the water ones, i had no idea when i was suppoed to start taking those so i havent took one and i just got my period today
Birth Control	Squee!, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	3/4/2012 12:19:40 AM	The only reason I put a one for satisfaction is because 0 wasn't an option. I have been on zovia now for almost 4 years, and at first it was okay.  Then the panic attack started, which I had NO clue this medication could play a part in. Then there's the weight gain... OMG! Since I have been on this medication I have gained a total of over 50lbs!! Yeah. 50! Not only from the medication but the unsatisfiable appetite that comes along with it. Then there is the beast tenderness, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Half the time I can't even wear a bra because of how tender my breasts are!!! It feels like they are severely bruised. Then on top of that, I have a light period for a few months and then EXTREMELY heavy periods for a few months. I have sever acne now because of this, have lost quite a bit of hair, (at one time I only had to twist a hair tie around my pony tail 2-3 times, now 5-6.) and the cramps... It feels like I have something trying to escape from me!! Plus on top of all of this, I've have sever vaginal sensitivity and pain during sex so much so that it has put a stop on my sex life more times than not.  I can't believe that I was so naive that I couldn't put all of these thins together... I think that I will be switching the pill again! HORRIBLE PILL!
Birth Control	HMM, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/24/2012 9:07:07 PM	I started taking birth control to control my painful periods - Zovia is my second attempt at relief and I AM RELIEVED!  My periods have switched from very painful bleeding for 4-5 days, to painless bleeding for 2 days.  I initially gained a few pounds, but that all came off after I increased my water intake.  Unlike the BC I took before Zovia, I actually have a healthy sex drive with this pill.  I couldn't be happier.

Birth Control	JNH, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/1/2012 10:58:08 AM	I have been on Zovia for over 5 years now. I've never had any serious problems. I occasionally have spotting between periods (which is more to do with me than the medication) and I did increase a drop in my sex drive when I first started taking it. It has not returned to normal. My skin cleared significantly and I on this pill I know within a few hours of when I'll start and stop. I've never had that with other pills. It has also lightened and shortened my period over the last five years from very heavy and 7-10 days to moderate and 5 days. A wonderful experience for me. I'm very happy with this pill and though we will start trying for a baby in the near future plan on getting back on if we are able to have one to allow for some time between children.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	10/5/2011 11:20:37 PM	I am 21 and have been on Zovia for a month and a half and it has been absolutely awful. (This isn't my first birth control pill) I have never experienced this kind of bloating or insatiable hunger when on a pill. I constantly want to eat and rarely feel full or satisfied. I am bloated most of the time. I exercise for 60 minutes five days a week and maintain a healthy diet and I have still gained about seven pounds. These side effects terrify me because I keep thinking I'm pregnant, but I'm not. Switching immediately. 
Birth Control	Kaylee, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	10/3/2011 12:00:58 AM	First I need to note that I have terrible anxiety and have had it for a long time, but before I took Zovia, I was able to controll it. Ladys, if you have anxiety, please refrain from using Zovia. Ever since I've taken this pill, my simple one to two week panic attacks turned into an all nighter every single night, feeling like I'm not going to wake up in the morning. Literally I felt like if I went to sleep, I would die in it. I had this weird off feeling, uncontrollable of my body. Could not catch my breath, irritability, felt like my throat was closing up. Also mood swings. Another thing is, one momth I would miss a period, and another I would have around three with a one to two day break. Possibly could be that I'm young and more sensitive to the fact, but this is what I'm personally experiencing on a day to day and night to night basis.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/21/2011 9:50:08 PM	I've used Zovia for 8 years now. My periods are very very light....a couple regular tampons to just pantyliners for 2-3 days. I get no strange mood swings on this medication, unlike the past BCpills I've tried. The only PMS symptoms I get are mild bloating and literally, 1 or 2 pimples. Overall, my problems skin has cleared a lot....though that might be because I'm in my 30's now.
Birth Control	jb, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	6/2/2011 12:05:49 AM	I have been on Zovia for 5 months now and these have been the worst five months of my life. this is the first birth control I have ever taken and it will be the last. I gained about 15 pounds I am a college athlete that runs and works out everyday. I am never satisfied when I eat and I am always hungry. My periods suck and I have horrible cramps. I get under the skin acne...something I have never had before. I feel depressed and unmotivated to do anything. I get headaches all the time and all I want to do is sleep and lay in my bed. I have never felt this way ever before in my life. I can't wait to get off this birth control.

I cannot control my appetite! I am never satisfied. It's been a week now and I am sticking it out to regulate my periods so someday I can have kids. I feel sleepy lethargic and extremely unmotivated. I have probably gained 3 pounds in one week! Usually I am very regimented, exercise and am happy. I would not recommend this

I switched to Zovia and have been on it for about 2 years now. I am very happy as I have not had any weight gain, no ache, no mood swings and no pregnancy(which is why I take it). I did notice a small change in sex drive, but nothing significant.

I have experienced alot of vaginal dryness, little to NO sex drive, HEAVY 4 to 5 day periods, unusual depression and mood swings. On the plus side NO weight gain but I haven't been able to lose any either with regular excercise. So I will be researching a different method before 1 year hits!

I going to go my doctor to get on a different pill because this one is effecting my sex life too much. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	5/21/2010 12:22:38 PM	I went on birth control for acne and my previous birth control wasn't helping it. I switched to zovia and my acne did clear up a bit but i gained over 20 pounds in a matter of 6 months. I switched back to my other birth control (cryselle) and i lost 10 pounds in the first month without any diet or excersise change. The weight gain was definitely wasnt worth the small fluctuation in my acne.
Birth Control	Bambily, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	5/12/2010 12:42:09 PM	I switched from Yaz to Zovia. I have not liked this medication. I loved Yaz, but my insurance stopped covering it and I couldn't afford it. Zovia irregulated my period for about a month and caused me to have severe and odd acne that I've never had before. It didn't reduce my cramps, period blood flow, or acne. With Yaz I had a 2 1/2-4 day period, now I have a 7 day period. It's not fun, but everyone's body acts differently. 
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	5/9/2010 11:49:51 PM	I started taking this pill when I was 12 for an abnormal period. I was having it for 3 months and then not for 3 months. Once I started taking it a week later my period was normal. I rarely ever get PMS and I only get about 1-2 pimples a month. If you miss it in the morning and not take it till night time it's possible to start your period and it will not stop until after your scheduled period but if you still take it everyday it will stay light. Overall I'm satisfied with it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/29/2010 1:25:33 PM	I currently take and have taken Zovia (generic for Demulen) for many years at the referral of a dermatologist, and it did help my severe acne. My libido wan't affected, and I seemed to not get PMS at all. Only complaint was that it is SO effective and such strong medication, it took me nearly a year to get pregnant after being off of it.  Also, if you miss a pill and have to double up it of course is very uncomfortable (cramps or stomach pain and headache).

I'm 21 now and I still have no problems with it! I have no side-effects at all; in fact, when I went OFF the pill for a few months, I GAINED weight and all my old symptoms came back. My estrogen levels were below normal so essentially what this pill did for me was bring me up to normal, which may explain why I don't have side-effects. But I did switch briefly to a 3-month-at-a-time prescription and I hated it - made me anxious, gained weight, just generally didn't feel good. As someone who's been taking this for almost 9 years, I highly recommend it!

First three continuous use, then 1 week off for a w/d bleed. Now on again until next planned bleed. This is the first time a bcp has controlled my irregular, heavy, clotting, long (2 weeks sometimes!) bleeding. My 1 week off period was painful, but short and light for first time in my life. Side effect is weight gain and cellulite (yuk)that requires very close monitoring of carb intake and exercise to keep in check. I would like to go on the lower dose 1/35 in a few weeks to see if I can lessen the weight gain, but keep the good effects.

I know exactly when I'll be getting my period, my periods have gotten shorter. I've experienced no spotting and no weight gain (if anything, I've lost weight).  I get cramps about a week before my period and the first period I had while using it was pretty painful.  Since then everything has been great but I feel as though our bodies all have different  reactions to it.

The first one is i get really bad head aches when i get stressed out, they are very painful and throbing! Second after the suger pills and i get started on my 1st week of a new pack, my clit swells up... it doesn't to the point where it hurts but to the point where its very annoying!!! Its usually for 2-3 days. My doctor said its because of the horamones in the birth control.

It worked wonderfully in controlling my cylce, but with emotional side effects.  I've always had a bit of anxiety that I managed to control without medication for years -- however this pill set me off.  Very tense, depressed, sleeplessness and anxious all the time.  I do not recommend for anyone with a history of depression or anxiety.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	2/5/2008 7:58:23 PM	I have been on Zovia for 14 years now.  Never got pregnant, had no cramps.  However, about 8 years ago, I was diagnosed with severe depression.  None of my doctors ever made this connection, so I went on Wellbutrin as well.  By doing my own research, I discovered the connection and pointed it out to my primary care physician.  Not sure how the change will go (just starting out), but I hope I can get off the anti-depressant as a result.  If you are at all pre-disposed to depression, do NOT take this pill.  Like I said, it worked great for no cramps and no babies, but the other part wasn't so much fun. When I went on 14 years ago, depression wasn't as openly discussed as it is now, and I was never warned about the side effect (and never read the little side effects pamphlet).  Hopefully, this warning can help.

I've had problems with ridiculously painful cramps and this has helped them tremendously.  I like that you can safely skip a period if necessary (as advised by my doctor).
