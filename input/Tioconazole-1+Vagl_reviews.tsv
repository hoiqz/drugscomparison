Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	9/29/2012 9:43:35 AM	This is a great medication if you want to stay up all night with itching, pain, and swelling. I had a slight yeast infection and decided to get this med instead of the Monistat ovule. Worst decision EVER. After applying the ointment (half of which didn't get in my vagina) I went to bed hoping for relief. I woke up two hours later with horrible, throbbing itching. Upon closer inspection I noticed my labias were swollen and red. I rinsed myself off but I was still in severe discomfort. It is now morning and I'm still itchy and even more swollen. I feel like I just gave birth, only worse! (And I have given birth twice!). I would never recommend this product!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	8/28/2012 12:19:38 AM	HORRIBLE PRODUCT. Identical review to the others, pretty much. Nearly instant swelling, throbbing pain to both vaginal and labial areas. I too have used this product a while back, had a similar reaction, but figured it was from the yeast infection (WRONG).... The $5 I saved by buying this product vs something else was soooooooo not worth it. Next time I'm calling the doctor to get the pill. I'd like to slap whomever designed this cheap-shot product.

But I was more miserable after using it.. Itched so badly I felt like screaming.  So I took a shower, washed it all off and went back to Miconazole... Ah, sweet relief!

I have never had this issue with any other yeast infection product. Hopefully the pain stops soon stick with Monistat or go see your doc instead... 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	jengo, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	7/28/2012 6:01:38 PM	My experience is identical to the previous review.  Last night, after applying the medicine, I went to sleep, but found that within a very short period of time I had extreme pain, swelling internally and externally, and redness.  I regret not opting for another treatment even if it requires more frequent applications.  As the previous reviewer stated:  avoid this treatment.  I have found it to be far worse than the yeast infection itself.  
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	deenajoell, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	7/11/2012 1:45:30 PM	I have been having frequent mild yeast infections as a result of hormone levels and increased moisture in my vaginal area.  While I used the Tioconazole 1 product once before and had seemingly ok experiances, (although I was asleep after using it)my latest experiance has been HORRIBLE! I purchased Wal-Mart's equate version of Tioconazole 1, and shortly after using the product was unable to sleep due to itching and pain in my vaginal area.  At first I chalked it up to the yeast infection, but when I got up to go to the bathroom I realized that my labia and whole vaginal area were extremely swollen to the point I could barely sit down or walk.  I immediantly took a shower to wash away what i could of the product, and took Benedril and Ibuprofen.  Almost immediantly the swelling went down somewhat, although the next morning it is still swollen and painful. I have now found tons of information online of other people saying this same thing.  Ladies please do not use this product! Opt for something else instead. Apparently the Miconazole 1 and some Monistats are also causing this.  The manufacturer needs to be made aware of this and better warning issued and the stuff pulled from the shelves and/or information regarding this reaction inserted in the packet.!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Helping_Others, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	6/4/2012 3:00:29 PM	I had a yeast infection before, went to my doctor and prescribed a pill. I was fine until a few weeks ago. I began to have similar symptoms and basically self-diagnosed myself in to having a yeast infection once again. Used Tioconazole Equate and basically 5 minutes later, I was BURNING and ITCHING intensely. Worst pain/sensation I ever had in my life. I had to stack ICE together in a towel to relieve SOME of the itching/pain. Finally was able to knock out and woke up to being swollen. The swelling worsened over the day to the point that although the itching was gone (I thought, but it was only momentarily) I was too swollen to sit and even WALK RIGHT. It started to affect part of my behind area. Swollen, red, horrible. It began to swell down, but as soon as that did the itching came back and it just has been the worst experience. My skin got dry, irritated, continue to itch, very sensitive, and now I'm pretty sure other than the average HORRIBLE symptoms I'm allergic or just got continuing symptoms to smell. I take a shower 3 x a day since I took this ointment. Trying to keep as clean, cotton underwear, not tight clothes, but this is ridiculous. I'm setting up an appointment for this week. Hopefully I can get this straightened out, but ladies, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE... do not take this product. It is NOT worth the pain and disturbence in your DAILY LIFE!

It relieved pain, itching and gave me a quick feeling of calm.  I'd use it again in a heartbeat.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/4/2012 3:11:23 PM	Tioconozole 1 is the worst medication for vaginal yeast infection. I wanted a strong medicine to be proactive with a minor yeast infection caused by taking antibiotics for a UTI. I woke up in pain hours after using tioconozole and have been burning/throbbing all day. I feel worse now than before using it. I would not recommend this medication to anyone. Do yourself a favor and call your doctor for a 7 day prescription for yeast infection treatment. Dont be impatient and use this stuff for quick relief bc it only causes SEVERE pain in the sensitive tissue of the labia/vulvar. I wonder if this drug was truly tested properly; if it was, it was not on humans.

I do not advise anyone to purchase this. My vagina swelled up so much after using it, I had to seek medical treatment. What was a minor yeast infection turned into an entire night of horror. Alls this medication did was put me through much pain. Extreme swelling, redness, burning, and even more itchiness than before use. My vagina blew up 3xs it's size. Please go to dr instead of buying this over the counter nightmare! Never again

I wasted $11.99 on it!! Now am waiting for a few days so i can do the Monistat 7-day treatment. I would advice the women out there to stick to whatever you have used before..if it worked but don't try Tioconazole-1.

I just took it 30 mins ago and my vagina is in the most uncomfortable feeling. My labias are so swollen that I can barely walk or close my legs. I hope the swelling goes down and I gain comfort down there.

I have used this before, but forgot about the side effects. Luckily while purchasing this, I also purchased medicated wipes that will help with the itching and whatnot. While these are not the best fix, they are helping a little bit. It worked last time, but I just wish I remembered how intense this pain was. I'm not sure if I'll use this produce again (that is, if I don't forget again).
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	hmr, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1		35-44	11/28/2011 6:36:42 PM	-Treated right before bed-5 hours later - horrible pulsing swelling of the labia.  very painful.  Used ice pack and wet cloth to try to get medication off.-The swelling was mostly gone by mid-morning, but I did not feel &quot;right&quot; until the afternoon-The infection did go away by day 3, but it was a gradual thing, not a quick fix- I will use something else next time due to the extreme side-effects!

Burning and itching all night, hardly got any sleep.  Won't ever use it again!!!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	macfish47, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	8/6/2011 2:39:41 PM	I, too, had horrible swelling, redness, itching and burning. Wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing it.  Running water over the area; using a cold, wet wash cloth; or using an ice pack provides some relief if you have mistakenly used this med and have a reaction.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/24/2011 12:51:15 PM	Horrible. I started with a very minor infection the night before, and within a couple hours my labia was completely swelling to the point where I could barely walk. I thought I might just need to sleep it off but when I woke up it was even worse. The infection itself was better than this.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Holland, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/5/2011 8:18:33 AM	Avoid this cream at all costs! After having used it last night `i awoke with sever swelling of the labia minora (inner lips) and extreme burning sensation. The hospital prescribed me a steroid cream (unguentum triamcinoloni) I am in Holland, names may vary - and this has reduced the swelling and irritation over the past few hours. I'll stick to Canestan for yeast infections from now on.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	3/4/2011 11:15:57 AM	Like many others have reported, I also had severe irritation, redness, increased pain (itching stayed the same) with this product.  As a healthcare provider, I used it just to provide some relief until I could get the terazole cream at the OBGYN, but I will never use it again.  In fact, my provider thought I had another type of infection because there was so much irritation. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/30/2011 1:39:01 AM	I tried another type of 3-application yeast cream first.  I even took the pill the doctor prescribed.  Things got a little better and then rapidly got worse.  I used tioconazole 1 and wow...what relief!  I was advised by my pharmacist to take antihistamine (benadryl) for a few days to help with the itching and irritation I already had so I was on antihistamine before I used this cream.  I had no swelling like these other reviews reported, and my itching and irritation started to get better wtihin 24 hours.  I would definitely use this again.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	12/20/2010 11:30:01 AM	I took the medication at bedtime, as directed. When I woke up the next morning, my entire labial area was severely swollen, without pain, but there was some discomfort. It took about 36 to 48 hours to reduce back to a fairly normal size. I will never take this medication again.

Like many of the previous reviewers, I am experiencing more pain and irritation than before. And yes, I'm swollen to top it off. I think this medicine made my infection worse. I keep wondering if I can just apply Monistat to fix this situation.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	5	1	Female	19-24	12/31/2009 5:12:28 PM	this medicine made my genital area so swollen it hurt to sit the next day! It was red and very painful. Not sure if that is normal or what to do about it. I had to leave work i was in so much pain. I'm pretty worried about myself now and kinda freaked ... is this normal or do  I need to go to the doctor to get this taken care of? I really don't want to feel like this anymore... and it's very painful and uncomfortable. What should I do?
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	10/24/2009 4:09:57 PM	I used this medication last night to treat a yeast infection. When I woke up, my genital area was swollen, red, and even more sensitive than before. This has never happened before when using diflucan or miconozole to treat yeast infections. I am going to wait it out and hope that the swelling goes down. If not I will contact a dr tomorrow.

Almost 24 hours later, the swelling and discomfort has diminished, but I am still in more pain and more uncomfortable than I was yesterday before starting treatment.  I don't think the yeast infection is any better, either.  I will be going to my dr's office tomorrow morning for treatment of this side effect.  Definitely a case of the cure being worse than the condiditon!
