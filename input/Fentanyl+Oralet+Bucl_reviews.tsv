I would find myself falling asleep at my computer. YES it did help with my pain....was not the best for keeping awake.

It was difficult to wean off but now use Oxy IR and get very good pain relief and my usage is &quot;by the book&quot;

It is a very quick and efficient way to fight of the very nasty sharp shooting pains that come and go daily in my brain after my second stroke.
