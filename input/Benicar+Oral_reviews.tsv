High Blood Pressure	futuregirl54, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	8/28/2012 3:00:38 AM	Was prescribed Benicar 40 mg 6 days ago and it has been the worse six days of my life, the very first day I experienced increased urination to the point of pelvic pain, along with severe shoulder pain, leg hand and foot cramps cannot sleep because of the achy feeling of my whole body, I feel worse than I did when I walked into the doctor's office. I retun to the doctor in three weeks, but about that time I will have taken myself off of it!!! I HATE THIS FEELING!!!!!

Recently (June 22, 2012 - US News &amp; World Report - Health Day News)I found a study conducted at Mayo Clinic. &quot;Side effects can mimic symptoms of Celiac disease.Twenty-two patients - aged 47-81, average age 70 had symptoms of chronic diarrhea..... Fourteen of the patients needed to be hospitalized.&quot; Please be very careful.
High Blood Pressure	AMT Boss, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	7/31/2012 6:52:28 PM	I have been taking 1, 40mg Benicar daily for about 3 years now.  It keeps my blood pressure in check.  I'm not entirely sure other problems I have are side effects, but I can say my latest problems coincide with my latest refill.  I have been experiencing moderate to severe knee pain.  My entire left knee aches, the right knee less, but they ache the same way.  After reading some of these comments, I will back off the 40mg dose and report back.

After 4+ wks, had start of cataracts and start of vitreous detachment. I do not know if this is related to taking Benicar. Has anyone else had this experience? Had a leg cramp after 90+ days then developed arthritis in my left knee and a Bakers Cyst. It is very effective in lowering my bp.

New doctor told me that Benicar had done permanant damage to venous return in legs and would have chronic swelling in legs. this was 10 years ago and I now have to take diuretics to control swelling. also, hsve venous dermatitis due to chronic swelling. wish I had changed to a doctor that listened to me sooner.

It has done an excellent job brining my blood pressure down, however over the past month I have experienced the following symptoms. Light nagging headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, numbing of arms, tingling of feet and hands and once my face went numb. Feeling like I am having a heartattack mostly in the middle of the night when I wake up and I have shortness of breath and numbing arm then palpatations and sweating. Very scary. The diziness has gotten worse and it is taking a toll on my quality of life, I am exhausted. The only thing I have done differently since I started Benicar is I began an excercise program about a month ago. walking and weights, this is when I began noticing the side effects so I thought maybe I didnt need as much of a dose so I cut in half. Blood pressure went up..... confused about why I am having side effects now, but I am having what everyone else is having on this site. Kind of a delayed reaction but a scary ones. Also feeling very paniced all the time. Have doc appt on Monday and plan to discuss trying something else. I hate it because it controlled my blood pressure. Thanks for sharing this I was beginning to think something else was wrong, maybe I can switch meds and everything go back to normal. Did I mention nausea? I guess from the dizziness....

It has lowered my BP some but I still need to lose more weight which will help over all much more. I still wonder what side effects it might have. Every drug you take beware of side effects people!

It started as small circles and they began to get bigger.  I went to my doctor thinking I caught something at the gym or elsewhere.  She could not figure it out.  I went to her 3 times before I was sent to a dermatologist.  That doctor looked up the side effects of Benicar and found it does cause break outs on the skin. Once I stopped taking it, then my rash began to go away.  Of course I changed medication. I am not taking Diovan and all is well. Check side effects of  medication(s) you are taking.

Started with 20mg with HCT daily 6 years ago.  Blood pressure went too low within 4 months (dizzy and tired), so  Doctor cut HCT. Three years later, blood pressure down too low again so Doctor cut 20mg to three days per week.  I check my BP daily and is now at 117/72.  Insurance does not cover, but $80 is manageable when 30 pills now last 3 months.

I take 20 mg of benicar a day for past 3 months (use to take 40 mgs). My heart seems to be skipping a beat every now and than. No particular time of day nor reason for it to happen. dont know if cause is by medicine or coffee intake 3-4 cups a day. Cutting back on coffee now,  2 cups a day. Was wondering if other patients have had my symptoms while on Benicar?

After the first week I rechecked my BP and it was 134/82. I've been having lots of dizzy spells, especially after I eat. It's not when I suddenly stand up, it's when I'm sitting, or standing or just any time. I've been taking it before bed and I wake up nauseated and have a slight headache. I started cutting my pills in half, so now I'm taking 10mg at night now. The nausea has gone as well as the headaches. But the dizziness, it's to the point I'm afraid I will pass out. My pupils have been very constricted, and yesterday I was retaining a lot of fluid. I quit drinking alcohol a week ago, and have started a minimal exercise routine. I've put on 5 pounds in the 3 weeks I've been on Benicar. I skipped my dose last night and will check my BP at work again. I've been told by my Dr's nurse that all my symptoms were &quot;normal&quot; and my body was simply getting used to the drug, but I think she's wrong, especially the dizziness. It may be a normal side effect, but it's NOT a good one. I've read I need to contact my Dr if severe dizziness occurs, so I'll be talking to her today about it. I can't keep using this drug!

Today 7/27/2011 was the first time I experienced severe dizziness to almost passing out (it is over 95 degrees outside). My BP was 126/64. I dialed 911 but hung up because the condition subsided after I lied down for about 15 minutes.  I am so glad I was not traveling on Subway or Bus today. Overall it is very successfull in lowering my BP (140/90 to 126/76)

Unfortunately, after almost 2 years I'm having B.P.readings almost too low, dizziness, headache, muscle &amp; joint pain, itching and rashes when exposed to sun. When my pressure drops to 95/58, I just wilt and, if not actually, come near to passing out. No insurance right now as husband was laid off.

The side effects of sun sensitivity ,ED and fatigue are tough to take, but workable at this point.
High Blood Pressure	Fairbanks Sunworshipper, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/22/2011 12:42:16 AM	In combination with Bystolic, Benicar has been the most effective of the many medicines I've tried to lower my blood pressure over the past 15 years. Happily, my BP is now at a very acceptable level. The one distressing side effect is that the Benicar has caused a pronounced intolerance for sun. Even short amounts of exposure will cause extreme itching and permanent discoloration of the affected skin. The itchy skin seems to be getting progressively worse every summer that I'm exposed to sunlight (thank goodness I live in Alaska and have 8 months of winter!).

Blood pressure has gone from 120/78 to 165/91. Started taking Furosemide 40mg at same time. Increased Furosemide from one pill to two pills daily in second week. Was taking Tribenzor 40 but, it caused fluid retention.

Side effects I experiences are, joint and muscle pain, weakness and stiffness and cramps in legs and arms(felt like the muscles were going to break),irregular heart beat.  Origionally had feeling that I couldn't swallow but that went away after a couple of months.  I try not to read the symptons so I don't imagine I have them but glad I finally read and see I have the same reaction that I had with lisinopril. Cut down to .5 mil..bp ok and dr appt in 2 days. on for

I now know the leg cramps were due to the benicar because my insurance will no longer pay for it. Leg cramps stopped when they switched me to 100mg Losartan (Cozarr). BUT Now my blood pressure was 270/130 and my doctor wanted me to go straight to the ER. Dr. put me back on Benicar, some insurance will put you back on this drug if you fail at an ace inhibitor and a drug like Losartan.

I have occasional pain in one knee. Although I had this problem prior to Benicar, the pain seems more severe now. Every now and then an occasional migrane headache. Overall I still like this drug. I found that daily cardio exercise is the key to any sluggishness and fatique. Side effects to Benicar appear to be minimal to none. I wish it were more affordable. Even with insurance the co-pay is way too high.

My doctor wants to blame my age and menopause. Any drug can have a cumulative effect. Maybe it is time to change doctors....

Doc prescribed one drug after another to take with the Metoprolol and all gave bad side effects including water pills I could not tolerate. He put me on Benicar a very expensive ARB class drug - one of the newer meds.  It is currently a popular b.p. drug supposed to keep strokes from occurring and good for diabetics. (I am not a diabetic). What I experienced the entire month on this drug was an absolute NIGHTMARE and CHANGE IN PERSONALITY.  At first I slept soundly in several naps a day, morning afternoon and night - got very little done, but sleep was sound! Then the sleepiness morphed into NO APPETITE, could hardly get food down and lost 10 lbs that month as a result. VISION difficult to focus, and the WORST WERE THE HEART PALPITATIONS AND MENTAL AFFECTS. I COULD NOT FOCUS MY MIND, SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS, NO AMBITION - APATHY IN WHAT WAS GOING ON around me. CREATIVITY was squelched! Felt like a zombie! This is the worst b.p. med I have ever taken. And the 20 mg. pill only brought down my b.p. moderately - 150 over 100 - not goal!  Yesterday, I pleaded doctor to take me off this poison - he did. Now I am starting on Clonidine - so far so good! What a relief! Praying this one works out in less side effects as time goes on. If you take Benicar be sure to monitor it closely as perhaps these side effects could sneak up on you as they did me! Shameful big pharma for letting this one on the market!

High Blood Pressure	CholesterolScare, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	10/11/2010 11:32:45 PM	I wrote a review just last week after finding that Benicar had raised my cholesterol over 100 points in less than a year.  I also found that there was foot pain associated with taking this drug.  I've been off of it 1 week now, and the foot pain is gone!  The dr has me on Diovan now, so hopefully my cholesterol numbers will go back down to normal.  The Mayo Clinic web site lists the hypercholesterolism (large amounts of fat in the blood) as a rare side effect they found in clinical trials.  So,  please get your cholesterol checked often if you are taking Benicar, and beware of foot pain- it's probably also from the Benicar!

The last couple of bottles(used mail order drug company for this medicine)had a very strange odor. Was wondering if anyone else had notice this strange odor coming from their medication or maybe there was something wrong with the medicine I received. Could explain my severe fatigue. Worst feeling I have ever had. No longer taking this. Would not recommend anyone taking Benicar. Felt so bad I would rather risk a heart attack than take Benicar and deal with the fatigue.

Then I had my cholesterol checked on a routine physical.  After 8 months on Benicar, my cholesterol readings increased by 101 points!!  I've always had very low cholesterol readings, now it's at 218!!  And now I'm reading about the side effects others are having, and realizing that the pain in my feet, legs and joints may be from the Benicar as well.  Maybe also the recent heart burn- I've never had that before.  It started out just fine, but am calling the Dr about the Benicar -cholesterol connection.  Any one else have that problem??

I take 20mg 1x day and it works fine.  The only problem that I have with this medicine is that I have lots of night sweats.

I also experience a burning sensation on scalp, leg and toe cramps as well as insomina.  I am amazed that I am reading others have had same symptoms on this drug!  My pharmists told me yesterday that as of 6/2010 there is a BLACK BOX warning on this drug relating to cancer and heart failure.  WHY IS THIS NOT MENTIONED ON THIS WEB SITE??????

I still have a cough but it is less severe. I have been on benicar for about 4 months and I just started having right arm discomfort with some numbness and tingling in my right hand. I also am having foot pain and aches in my hip, leg, and back area. I believe that the benicar is causing these symptoms. I will be monitoring.

I have not had any symtoms becuase of it. I'm on 40mg/25mg hct. But back in 4/2010 I stated to work out at Gold's Gym. In 6/2010 I decrease my BP Med by half and my BP has remain within the same readings as if I was taking the full dose. Diet and exercise does help to reduce your BP. After a work out mine has droped as low as 74/56. Also since i stared working out I have been able to drop my weight by 45lbs. My goal is to drop another 25lbs and then try and go without my BP Med for a bit to see how I handle that. Yes I still like to eat at the buffets :-) from time to time, but I keep that in check by working out. I have been able to work myself up do doing 6 miles total on the summit and eliptical machine combined in one sesson(1.5 hours). I work out 3-5 days aweek. When I burn out I take a week off, then go back. Well I feel so good about writing this...I think I'll go do another 6 miles. Remember Diet and exercise are the key. No Bread No sugar, and stay away from the fast food places as much as possible.
High Blood Pressure	sailor1, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	45-54	8/2/2010 12:05:30 AM	After 3 years on Benicar(40mg)along with catapres, controlled bp very well. Side affects after 6 months were lower pack pain on and off every couple of months. Worst was right shoulder pain that got worse after 1 year. So bad that I could not raise a quart of milk above my waist and do a push up. After discontinuing med, after 1 week, shoulder pain vanished, 2 weeks latter I was doing over 25 push ups. Back pain is also gone. I have been able to work out pain free and lost 42 pounds since Jan. Needed to switch meds since my bp was getting higher and it's effectiveness stopped. Switched to a new bp med called Bystolic which after 7 months has been great for me with no side effects (so far)

When migraine went away, popping sensation has lessened a lot, until recently it went back and very evident when i'm lying on bed ready to go sleep. This med. made me dizzy and lightheaded so doctor advised me to take it at bedtime, so the popping occurs while lying ready to go sleep. Just recently I also had abnormal EKG (eversince have normal EKG), so i went through a lot of cardio tests but all turned out normal. Worried bec. it's my head and heart that bothers me now. I think this med. is not a long term med. good only for short term.I'm even taking 10mg.(very low) but the side effects are just toooooo much!!!

I don't have real high blood pressure, but it helps for what I do have.  HOWEVER, due to the change in my insurance it has become too expensive to continue on.  It's a shame they have to jack up the prices on drugs they know people need to survive.  Dreading the switch

I've been taking Benicar HCT for 6 years with very good results and no side effects. BP 125/65   NOW, due to it no longer being covered by my insurance, I have to change!  I am not a happy!

My scalp is crawling, like when you get the chills.  I am constantly aware of the feel of tingling of my scalp...this is not normal...you should not be aware of parts of your body all day while you are trying to work.  My doctor told me he wants to keep me on it since it did stabilize my BP and also recommended that I not read what is on the internet about this.  Blagh.  New doctor needed.

I didn't like their side effects and minimal effectiveness. No side effects with benicar and the BP is well controlled - from 180/110 to 120/70. I finally find an effective medication with no apparent side effects and guess what? Anthem BC/BS wants me to use a different medication. Since when do we allow MBA's to make decisions for our doctors? And I always thought the BS stood for Blue Shield!

I recently read that Benecar could cause bladder and kidney problems, and my bladder (chronic cystitis) has been getting worse and worse, so I discontinued Bemnecar and bladder has been much better.  My liver enzymes have also been elevated for unknownn reasons, so I wil see if going off of Benecar helps that. 
High Blood Pressure	BPndistress, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	11/23/2009 1:11:12 PM	I was using hydrochlorothiazide, dr. said my potassium was low, and switched me to  benicar olmesartan medoxomil. With the hydrochlorothiazide, bp was normalish, 120/80,127/82, but this benicar shot up to 150/110, dull headache, hard to concentrate. Benicar got me scared enough to go buy a bp monitor. My neck and scalp, have been itching like I have an alergy, can't prove it, but I think it is the benicar, and I feel weird, arm pain, and leg pain, like a walking stroke victim on my right side, hasn't helped me.I took for 1 month. My BP went up.My new Dr. put me back on the hydrochlorothiazide, and we will use a potassium suplement. I wasn't scared for my life with the hydroclothiazide.

I'm off the Benicar now, but my side effects were so bad that I spent 3 weeks not able to get out of the bed.  Sore throat, lost 13 pounds, muscle aches, heavy limbs, general fatique, dizziness, inconsistent BP with some major drops.  Went to the ER twice with 2 of the more intense panic attacks.  Been off that med (now on lisinipril) for about 2 1/2 months, but I still don't feel 100% myself or well and think I've hung on to some of the anxiety.  I would never recommend this drug and wish that I'd never taken it.
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	9/17/2009 12:29:39 PM	I had to drop down from 20mg to 10 mg because my BP was too low.  Now I am finding after 2 months that it is not staying down in the afternoon.  I will discuss taking 10 mg in am and 10 mg in pm.  Also, being a person with chronic anxiety, it has increased my anxiety 100% - back to where it was unmanagable when I was 15.  My doctor does not want to change it because she thinks it is not affecting my anxiety.  I may switch doctors.  You have to be your own advicate and I know my body.

High Blood Pressure	Active Grandma, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	9/11/2009 12:39:21 PM	I am a 62 year old female who is 5' 3&quot; and weigh 126 lbs, with a history of high BP.  Tried Lisinipril and had GI reaction to it.  Started out on 20mg of Benicar and was very light headed and dizzy and so tired I didn't want to get out of bed. My BP dropped too low, so I cut the pills in half and had same effects and same low BP.  So I cut the pills in half again (5mg) and now the BP is stable around 130 over 75.  I did that about 10 days ago. The dizziness and shortness of breath is gone, but I have a dry cough, now.  I am having sore muscles in my feet, but I am not sure that is the Benicar.  I like the lowered BP, and my energy is better on the low dose.  I am going to give this more time and see if the cough persists.  I cough a lot at night! I am in &quot;wait and see&quot; mode, but at 5mg, the drug is effective with little in the way of side effects.  If this is like Lisinipril, it will take a few months to discover if there are any persistent side effects.

I have complained to my doctor and today has me scheduled for a CT Scan and carotid artery test.  Now I'm not so sure it isn't Benicar causing these symptoms.

High Blood Pressure	jju, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	55-64	8/24/2009 7:15:54 PM	I was prescribed Benicar 20 mg. after an episode that send me to the ER.  BP was 150/96 which is very high for me. The BP is controlled and sometimes drops too low ( 92/56 ). The most troubling side effects are extreme dizziness, headaches, increased perspiration, and the feeling of hot flashes. I feel irritable and impatient which is not me. I have always seen the &quot;glass half full&quot;.  I am seeing my Dr. this week to see if I could cut the dosage.  I have tried taking the meds in the morning and at night with no difference. I do know there is a big difference if I do not take with food. Side effects much worse on an empty stomach.

I have been on benicar for 1 and 1/2 years.  My blood chemistry is better than it ever was and it is helping my kidneys.  The only problem is my Benicar comes from India by way of Canada where it costs me 100 instead of 270 in the us at walmart due to patent problems in the us.  I am a senior and money matters to me

On 12-9-2008 went to Doc with server cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Diagnosed with Asthma and prescribed prednizone, proventil, levaquin and Advair discus. Treatment worked for about as long as I was taking prednizone. However, as a type II diabetic my sugar level went out of sight.  Returned to Doc and he gave me another round of the same treatment with no better results.  After reading many reviews on the web, I have began to think Benicar could be my problem.  As of today, I will stop taking Benicar and see if the symptoms improve. I thing they will. I don't think my Doc will accept it very well but I am ultimately responsible for what I choose to put in my body and believe this to be a bad drug.  I have never had asthma symptoms in my life until taking this durg and immediately started a severe cough and trouble breathing. I will review later and give the results.

High Blood Pressure	Hannah, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	6/21/2009 8:34:54 AM	pStarted med in Nov. 2008 and felt good at first since it did lower my bp. As time passed, though, I began to feel various symtoms; a chronic cough, trouble breathing, sinus congestion, headache, neck muscle pain, fatigued/sleepiness. Recently, I went to the Dr. for stomach pains/inflamation, and rectal bleeding.  It tested positive for blood in the stool and a CT Scan was ordered and was shocked to find out I have liver problems among other things, like sugar in the blood, high level of creatinine, and bladder/UTI problems.  None of which I previously had a problem with.  I do not take any other medication on a regular basis, so I attribute these symptoms directly to the Benicar HCT, especially after reading the side effects that coincided with my symptoms and that regretfully I read after the fact. Don't make the same mistake I did, excusing the symptoms with other causes you think it might be.  Always read the contraindications and side effects first, so you can determine early what truly caused you the problems. Consequently, I don't know how all this will turn out for me in the end, but I sure hope that there is no permanent damage to any of my vital organs.I will not be taking this med anymore, that's for sure.

The cardiologist prescribed Benicar 20mg.  Within a week my bp has receded to 118 over 69.  I monitor  every day and notice an increase if I eat a salty meal or imbibe wine. A heathy diet and exercise along with Benicar seem to work wonders for me.

The only problem is - it's very difficult to get my insurance company to pay for this medicine when I need a new prescription.  I have to go through a big process to get my dr. to send in paperwork, then the insurance company has to review it; this can take up to 72-96 hours before I know whether I can get the new prescription.  Why is this so difficult?  I am on Medicare, with diabetes and COPD; also past history of CHF and pulmonary embolism.  I just don't see why this med is so hard for the insurance company to approve.  I have no problem getting the rest of my meds filled, why Benicar!!!!!!!!

No cough with Benicar and controls BP better. Now doing 3 months mail order to reduce cost. I bought a automatic BP cuff so I can monitor BP between doctor visits.  It's good biofeedback.  I can see how a salty meal affects my BP.  Can also see how moderate walking helps.  Some sexual issues that I never had before (vaginal dryness, probs with the big &quot;O&quot;), but not sure if it is age, the meds, or my boyfriend! LOL! :)

High Blood Pressure	Disgusted with meds, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	65-74	5/8/2009 7:37:54 PM	In '02 hospitalized 3 days with pain across back shoulders and bp of 210/90. Given metalprolol &quot;just in case&quot; I had a heart problem, HCTZ and liptor. Liver enzymes were then out of control for several years. Went to the ER for pneumonia...was bronchitis, coughing 'til dizzy. BP 238/100. Given hydrocodone (for pain I didn't feel), musinex for my lung congestion. Urine smelled from musinex. Did break up cough. PCP prescribed lisinipril (cough became worse) lowered bp. Stopped it because of cough. Prescribed tessalon for cough and benicar 40mg. Took only 20mg for 3 days, 40mg 1 day. Second day tired and ached like I had the flu. Cough increased. Lost voice when talking. Sinuses filled, drained yukky green mucous, I was cold and sweating at same time, bowel movements changed, headache too. 12 hrs after taking 40mg bp lowered from 200/84 to 160/84. But coughing got worse. Read the pkg insert! Bronchitis is a side affect; flu-like symptoms a side affect; sinus infection a side affect; dizziness a side affect...I'm tired of being a guinea-pig for doctors who either don't know the meds well enough or don't know their patients well enough or dare I say don't care!!! I'm looking for an alternative type of treatment!!! Could some of us have high bp as a normal part of life?! There is no history of heart problems in my family on either side; and I've had all the tests, scans, etc. I think I'm DONE with MD's and prescription meds that do more harm than the disease!

I hope the price goes down or my blood pressure will really go up.

I would rather deal with those side effect than the side effects I had with the Lisinopril. The Benicar controls my BP and I feel great..

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/11/2009 9:10:36 PM	Started on an ACE about 3-1/2 years ago.  Started having a cough, and my BP was not controlled.  Was switched to Benicar, and the cough was gone in a little over a week.  I read the posts on this drug, and had to respond.  This drug did what it was suppose to do, lower my blood pressure.  I have not had any side effects and I have been on it for over three years, no kidney issues, fatigue, etc.  In fact this is the best that I have felt in years!  I was a little dizzy at times for the first few days, but my DR told me that is was just the medicine lowering my BP.  He said that it took many years to raise my BP to 180/120, and I was lowering it in a few days.  That would cause the dizziness.  Sure enough in a few days it was gone.  My BP has remained at 117/ 75 for three years.  I cant ask for anything better.  Yes it is more expensive than a generic.  I pay $20 a month.  Ask your DR for samples, they will give them to you each visit.  For me the $10 increase in cost, over the generic, far outweighs the side effects.  As far as the people that have crazy side effects, and stop taking the medicine, and within a day or a few hours they are gone, I dont think it was the medicine.  These drugs take weeks to get into you system, and weeks to get out.  Even after you stop taking them.  Maybe it was all in your head, or was it something your friends at the local Bingo parlor told you that they experienced, and now you have it to.  The mind is a powerful drug in its own right!  Give the medicine and chance, and let it do what it is suppose to do.  I read that one lady said that her husband lost his libido on this drug.  Viagra, and the other ED drugs are failed BP drugs.  This drug should help his little soldier stand at attention as she said.  If you do research on this drug, you will find that it fights the hormone that constricts the veins.  If more blood is flowing to parts of the body, then...  Think about it!  Good luck with this drug, you will not be disappointed! A++
High Blood Pressure	barry, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	65-74	2/9/2009 4:55:28 PM	2/9/09---71 yrs old---In very good health---On 10mg of Benicar every morning for 5 years now (only drug taken)--- No serious problems for 1st 4+ years, and then started gradually having strange apparent side effects----lips and tongue would alternately swell up BIG every few weeks; fatigue leading to naps (I never took naps before Benicar); joint pain in knees; very sore throat and loss of voice which lasted for weeks; new acid-reflux started; vision has become blurry; mild depression and anxiety; and finally small red itchy rashes formed on soft-tissue of underarms, crotch, buttochs and belly, alternating from week to week. Doctor (and I) could not find ANY reason for all these maladys! Blood pressure did drop from 140/90 to normal (or below) while on drug----but I decided that side effects were not worth it, so quit the drug 5 days ago----will see what happens---blood pressure has remained stable and normal, so far (I monitor closely). Not positive that drug is causing all these problems, but have no other explanation as I have never had any of these problems before Benicar.  I am not on any other drugs. Very suspicious, to say the least. Pretty scary.

I initially had dizziness.  Over the past 4 months, I have developed horrible muscle fatigue, tingling and numbness in my arms and sometimes my legs &amp; feet, blurred vision and terrible shortness of breath.  Not sure what to do now.  My doc is very thorough but feels I must stay on this med.  I did not have any of these issues prior to this med.  I have also noticed weight gain and anxiousness.  Is there ANY natural dietary supplements that are proven to work with less side affects?

I have tingling in fingers, especially at night, very low BP at times- like 85/55, dizziness and almost fainting at times when getting up, very low sexual desire and erectile problems. I take 20mg and am also taking spironolactone and hctz. Alot of side effects I worry about- but BP had been as high as 225/130. There has to be a better solution.

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	35-44	1/5/2009 3:32:06 PM	I was diagnosed with high blood pressure in the summer of 2006.  My average BP readings at that time were approximately 170/110.  After being prescribed several medications that were ineffective my doctor prescribed Benicar which did lower my BP.  I initially experienced dizziness and hazy vision as my body adjusted to the medication as well as ED issues.  Later on I began to experience numbness / tingling in my face and extremities difficulty berating lightheadedness and an intense feeling that I was about to pass out and the end was near.  These episodes landed me in the emergency room twice prior to me learning how to bear them patiently.   I have put up with the side effects for one year now and just today (1/5/09) I have requested that my doctor find me a different medication.I am a little nervous about this decision because Benicar did lower my BP but I can no longer bare the side effects.

I had a dry cough that kept me up at night after taking the med for approx 2-3 months.  Benicar has been much better and I feel great.
High Blood Pressure	Bill E B, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	35-44	12/3/2008 2:59:54 PM	After first starting this medication I developed significant heartburn, a severe cough and some itching.  The Dr. felt that the cough and itching may have been an interaction with the Pepcid Complete I was taking to treat the heartburn.  I now take the 20mg Benicar at night before bed and a Prilosec OTC first thing in the morning with a glass of water 30 minutes before breakfast and the coughing, itching and heartburn side effects have all gone away.  However, I do get some muscle cramps in my calves with exercise.  I have also noticed a loss of libido and had not thought about Benicar as a possible cause until reading some of the other reviews.  This may be an additional side effect that I just found out about.
High Blood Pressure	Bruce, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	12/2/2008 12:17:39 PM	I felt dizzy when I first started taking it. I also felt very lethargic for the first 8 hours after taking it. Now I take it in the evening and I feel much better during the day (not so tired).

High Blood Pressure	pendutch, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	65-74	11/21/2008 7:05:03 PM	I was taking Cozaar for years and I had good results.  I retired and couldn't pay the price.  My doctor changed me to Benicar at my request which is 1/2 the cost of Cozaar.  Not a good move.  I have a chronic cough and so much itching skin.  I will trim the dose to 10MG and see if that works for me.  Otherwise adios to Benicar and I'll have to pay for Cozaar as there is no generic.  This website really helps.

No hair loss.  4 other types of meds before this, all with side effects.  This one is effective.  All HBP lowering meds seem to have fatigue and dizziness side effects...that's something to be expected.  Others here seem to attribute unusual side effects to this drug.  IMO, likely something else is causing the far-fetched symptoms.  All react differently, but, the science does not support what is alleged here by others.

Quit taking and Dr. told me to cut doseage in half, so I split the 20mg to 10mg.  Sometimes I have throbling in forehead.  BP under control but now inside of my legs beging to itch, though I might have been bitten by a bug, but no marks. This itching about two weeks. Don't know if this Benicar is doing this?  I take the Benicar at bed time and after awhile I feel cold and don't know if my system temp. gets too low?  Heart rate skips like flip flops but I change breathing and its settle down.  I do at time feels tired and naps a lot, I am 71 maybe the age factor is it?  Or the Benicar? I am still on it but if this continues, will drop this stuff and eat more garlic etc.

It seems that every time I look around there is hair all over my clothes and I dont even need to shave my legs anymore.  My hair is like half of what is was in a very short time.  I think this is from Benicar as I stopped it before because I thought that and it got better and then gave it a try again.

Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	10/1/2008 4:18:07 PM	I have been on Benicar for 2 years. For a few months, I noticed the sleepiness, but it's not bad now. It controls by BP very well-and I had tried several others without any success. However, I do notice the muscle/joint pain, although it improves throughout the day, but mornings are rough. I thought I had lost sexual desire because of the pain, but perhaps it's another side effect as well. Would love to know if taking it every OTHER day might help.
High Blood Pressure	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	65-74	9/21/2008 2:45:00 PM	After quitting several blood pressure regimes which caused heart beat irregularities I now take 40mg of Benicar plus a dirureatic.  Pressure is good and much more regular than before.  Noted lack of headaches, really bad joint pain (which I thought was arthritus until I read some of these comments) and general tiredness.  Would change because of the side effects if something else would keep the readings regular.

The 2 side effects that I notice are being tired most of the time and sleepy most of the time.  I can get 7-8 hours of sleep a night and I am still tired and sleepy most of the day.  This may cause me to have to switch to a different BP medication.  It did lower my BP from 140/95 to 110/64 though.  I still cannot handle being this tired and sleepy every day.

My blood pressure was normally 180/110.  About two week ago, I started taking Benicar.  I have terrible aches in all my joints, I have stomach pains, feel dizzy, sick to my stomach, sweat profushiosly, and my blood pressure plumits to 80/60.  I feel as though I am going to pass out.  I don't know which way to turn.  I gusess I'll go back to the Doctor, and spend more money on some other blood pressure medication.  Benicar is not the one for me.

I have tried alot of BP medicines, but none have worked as well as this one.  Some side affects: decreases sex desire and ability; standing up quickly on golf course...my head spins if sun is out and hot; I feel like I am going to black out.  Decreases your energy level. If you drink too much alcohol, it causes your heart rate to increase while you sleep.  If I get off this medicine, my BP goes right back up.  Even though I am taking it now...higher in the a.m.(165/90),  after the morning BP reduces to(140/80). I take the BP medicine in the a.m.  My experience w/ Benicar has been good, but there are a lot of negatives.  I wish I could get off all BP medicine.  I don't think it is good for anyone over the long-term.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/11/2008 12:33:29 PM	   When I first read some of these reviews I wasn't so sure that I wanted to take this med, but I gave it a try.   This is the 3rd med since Dec 07 and I finally have one that WORKS without any noticable or unwelcome side effects. My readings are nice &amp; low and STAY that way. With some of the other drugs my readings fluctuated so much from shortly after I took it to 12 or 16 hours later. It seemed like it only worked short term, not the full 24 hours.   One (Lisinopril) left me with dry coughing spells that were so bad I was coughing up blood from the strain. The other (Diovan) caused a 10lb weight gain to my midsection and unacceptable elevated liver enzymes for which I underwent more testing. Once I stopped the med, my enzymes went back to normal.   Hopefully, I have come to the correct medication for me. The results so far have been good. Now I just hope it stays that way.
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	2	Female	45-54	7/11/2008 12:19:50 AM	Beginning B/P in ER was 184/111.  4 days later, B/P was 126/86 on 10 mg per day.  Started falling to 93/59, 99/60--felt dizzy and extremely tired.  A few days later diarrhea began, continued now for 11 DAYS, with very strange &quot;medicinal&quot; smell.  I feel it is the Benicar, since I NEVER have diarrhea until starting this med. It does work VERY well in controlling B/P but I CANNOT tolerate this daily diarrhea---interfering with work and electrolytes!  Dr out of town until Tues but will tell her I want off this med---diarrhea not a tolerable side effect for me. My feet also stopped swelling while on this medication, a definite plus, but can't take the diarrhea!

Worked great at first.  Then side effects started to get worse and worse and bp started to creep back up.  Been battling high triglycerides for most of time on it despite taking statin.  They were fine before drug.  Side effects are not worth it and it is too expensive.  Dr refused to take me off it despite repeated requests, so I switched doctors and got on new med.
High Blood Pressure	Sid, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	55-64	6/8/2008 6:18:17 PM	Dropped from the 40 to the 20, but still having readings of 85/60. Prior readings were 140/90. Can't seem to find the ideal amount. Have been getting palpatations, especially at night-feels like extra heart beats and skips. I think this has also led to general lethargy. Don't think the tradeoff is worth it.

High Blood Pressure	goldy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	65-74	5/19/2008 4:26:26 PM	I have had high blood preasure for 36 years about 140/95. I have been taking clonidine. In the last two months it has gone to 250/180. I added Benicar 40 about 2 months ago.  My preasure is now 180/140.  It is just staying there after a freefall that was scary.  I can not get the bottom to go down so the top can go down.  My doctor got cold feet over it and wants me to go into a hospital even though it runs in my family and I have been fine for  years.  What to do. What causes this and I feel totally helpless and alone.
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/18/2008 7:35:42 AM	I was started on Benicar 40mg about 3 years ago after experiencing mild elevations in blood pressure. Dosage dropped to 20 mg shortly after starting. Has worked well for me and keeps my BP within range even if I take only every other day.  Recently, blood work revealed elevated liver enzymes.  After reading some reviews about reported liver problems, I will address this with my physician.  Am awaiting new blood results. I appreciate other reviews stating they have reduced their mg dosage.  I will address that with my physician, too.I always experience increased urination w/ this, but not too bad - controllable.

VERY expensive when you are only making 15G a year. Had to switch to Lisinopril which is working fine for me.
High Blood Pressure	B***J, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	65-74	5/7/2008 5:51:24 PM	I was on Benicar 20mg for several years.  My blood pressure was elevated and my dosage was changed to 40mg.  After a couple of years, I had severe pain in my heel and upper back.  I went back to the doctor several times about my heel, had it x-rayed and was told I have a small spur.(Not bad enough to cause so much pain) I asked her to change my bp medication.  Less than a week and all pain was gone.  2 1/2 months later back pain is back.  Heel is not bad. My doctor is working with me to try to find BP med that does not cause joint pain.  And I know that I have some problems with joints, but bp meds exacerbates it so much that I often wake up in tears.

It seems to work well to keep my blood pressure fairly stable. Recently though the insurance company has made it very difficult to receive this drug because they want people on Benicar to take a generic replacement. My doctor claims there is none and we need to continue on this one. My husband takes it also. The main drawback is that it is quite expensive.

BP still goes up &amp; down like a yo-yo...but not near as high as it used to be. Worst side-effect is being tired and lack of energy at times...plus its made my ED problem worse. It's just a trade-off I guess.
High Blood Pressure	Heyward, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	35-44	4/1/2008 5:56:34 PM	I was on the drug for 1 year and it helped reduce my blood pressure. However I developed severe diarrea that hospitalized me with dehydration. Doctors never could diagnose the cause, however I feel my body was reacting to the Benicar. I got off the Benicar for approx. 10 days. Once out of the hosiptal, I took 1 Flagyl and my Benicar. I developed  severe vomiting that I blamed on Flagyl even though I had no alcohol. After this no Benicar or Flagyl. Then I decided to take my Benicar again as I thought Flagyl was the problem. This time the same reaction to the Benicar 2 hours after taking it- sweating, vomiting, shortness of breath. This time I blamed it on my 6 year olds virus. No more Benicar for about 4 weeks, until I decide to take it again thinking ther is no way the Benicar is making me sick after using it for over 1 year with no problem. This time the reaction sends me to the ER. I experienced severe vomiting, sweating, dizziness, shortness of breath, tingling and numbness in my hands. I am 38 years old and in great health- I thought I was going to die.

If your doctor doesn't listen to you, then keep stressing to him/her what ALL of the symptoms are.  If you're not telling them EVERYTHING then they can not accurately diagnose a disease or condition.  If you can't remember then keep a symptom journal of what happened a certain day, and if you feel like being extremely accurate, put in times like when you took your medication(s) then any symptoms/side effects later on.  If you give a generalization of &quot;an hour&quot; or &quot;two hours&quot; when it was only 40 minutes, it would make a difference in the diagnosis.  The patient probably said too long of a time had passed for the doctor (who is really really smart and knows a LOT about medicine) to have connected the two.  If a more accurate time had been given, then there's no doubt in my mind that the doctor would have connected the side effects and the pill.  Why do people think they're so much smarter than their doctors when a doctor doesn't know what you're feeling and is relying on repsonses from you to make a decision about the probablility of a condition.  DOCTORS ARE SMART, BUT THEY ARE NOT PSYCHICS!
