External Genital Warts	mel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	8/5/2012 11:33:40 PM	Okay I started using veregen about 3weeks ago and when I first started it I was not very impressed since I had more warts show up than I started with. I continued using it and they started in 4 days turning white then about a week and a half later a bunch of them fell off. I was really excited and continued using it even though it did hurt and here I am 3 weeks total and my warts are gone. I would def recommend this product to anyone. Only problem I had was my insurance would not cover it cause they said it was not necessary so I contacted my doctor who gave me samples and I was able to complete my treatment....thanks veregen

I tried multiple other remedies for years (not freezing though, I knew it would hurt too much from previous experience) and after applying Veregen multiple times a day to the warts they slowly started to disappear. All 4 are gone and I'm waiting for the last bit of the 5th one to go away. I can finally paint my nails again and don't have to worry about hitting my warts on anything as they are very painful, especially on your fingers. The only drawback is that this medicine is very expensive BUT it does last a very long time as you only need a tiny bit on each wart. 
External Genital Warts	Fitz, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	25-34	4/7/2012 6:54:09 PM	I had previously been using Zyclara, which worked well, but since I also have Psoriasis my skin became extremely sensitive. I had stopped using Zyclara for about three months before I received Veregen. In the mean time I had used Tea Tree Oil, which actually worked but was very hard to apply. The Veregen cream is in paste form, making it very easy to apply. Within only 4 days, the warts began to turn black--this is where I am currently. I'm very impressed, and there is hardly any pain. I'm also a smoker, so I suppose quitting will help--as well as a proper diet and exercise. I'm not sure if my issues are more complicated by the fact I have Psoriasis down there too, but Veregen seems not to exacerbate the psoriasis.

I thought it was super weird at first but was willing to try anything to get rid of these gross looking spots right smack in the middle of my face and so far its working!! only been a week and my spots are reduced to scabs im super happy. 
External Genital Warts	hope, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	55-64	9/10/2011 9:23:35 AM	I noticed what seemed to be a single mole near my scrotum, then it became more.  I went to the doctor and he recommended veregen. I've been using it now for five and a half months.  I'm extremely compliant, and diligent.   I apply twice a day, morning and evening, and always after a shower for maximum contact. I have seen a slow, and I mean slow dissipating of the hvp over the months, then at five and a half months into this therapy of veregen there exploded, literally overnight, new areas of presentation just at the base of my shaft.  These were very large and shocked me.  I am continuing the treatment and hoping this is the 'death throws' of the hvp.  This new area seems to be in the state of almost crusting over after just a few days of treatment, something the other area took months to do.  After this stage, if it holds true, there is a scabbing and then healing.  But even in the previous areas where it has gone away, and now feels smooth, there are dark dots marking the areas they existed.  Hopefully this will go away over time. I have an appointment to see the doctor again in a few weeks, will report back.Hang in there everyone, it is just 'life'. And for those despondent over future relationships, this may not convince you, but people in generally are more interested in the bigger part of who you are than an issue like this.  And there is a vaccine. Funny, I asked my doctor for this vaccine some years ago and he said &quot;unless there is something about you I don't know, you don't need it&quot;.  I took it to mean that it only affects those who are gay.  I'm a male, and just took his advice as good advice.  I do not know why he shunned my request but I would insist if I could go back in time.Take heart! Think positive! Heal!  :)
External Genital Warts	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	8/1/2011 11:39:18 AM	I had began treatment for my external Genital Warts last fall, and was on a regiment of cryo treatment and Aldara. I did not have very large or pronounced warts but smaller ones mostly around the base of my penis, and on the backside of the shaft. Aldara did absolutely nothing except tear my skin up around my scrotum. I was very discourgaged as the cryo was working, but when other smaller warts would appear the Aldara was completely ineffective. I thought I would try Veregen, as my dermatologist had briefly mentioned it and gave me a pamphlet. I started using it as directed, 3x a day. Probably after the first 2 days I noticed a smaller outbreak of what looked like more very small warts. I was very upset but continued the treatment.To my suprise teh small spots started turning black and eventually disappeared, and within two weeks most all the warts were gone. I am very happy with the product, and my dermatologist is excited because he said to this point he hasn't really recommended it to many patients. Every now and again Ill get a small wart , and resume treating it with the Veregen and it will usually be gone within 3-4 days. I know everyone's immune system is different, but it's worth a shot! Good luck! 
External Genital Warts	gargamel, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	25-34	2/11/2011 7:50:51 AM	I've been seeing a dermatologist for several years now. On and off, I'll get one wart and he'll electrocauterize it. All of a sudden, I get a ring of very small ones at the base of the glans and on the foreskin. Doc tells cauterizing isn't an option because, He gives me a sample of veregen. I start using it, and not seeing any effects (bad or good) I decide to fill the scrip and keep trying. $150 for 15 grams - with insurance! This is Green Tea extract! How does a drug company rationalize a supply chain that brings the their product to end consumers at $311 retail? Anyway, continued using and developed contact dermatitis. Which SUCKED. Itching, burning, tingling rash over my entire penis and scrotum. It was awful. Took 10 days to clear up. It kept me awake at night it was so bad. And, a few weeks later, I sloughed off a layer of scan. Started looking like a white calculus, but soon separate flakes were visible. Some, not all, but some of the warts went with this. Since then, my irritation/inflammation has been intermittent, and I'm periodically sloughing skin even though I've stopped using the veregen. I'm hoping this is my body *finally* mounting an immune response. Maybe I'll be hpv-free again soon. If that happens, I'd change this to a 5* rating without a second thought.
External Genital Warts	not fair, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	1/29/2011 1:25:42 PM	Has done nothing. Larger place then when I started. My bloodk sugar is very high while I ahve bene using this and very sick at my stomach whe whole time. I drink green tea every day. No help at all. VERY dissapointed. Oh by the way I got this from my ex who was cheating on me in our 15 year marriage. I dont see any hope of another man wanting to ever be with me now. I mean.. How do you tell them!
External Genital Warts	hpvhaterrr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	1/21/2011 11:14:01 PM	I was so hopeful when I was given this medication.  I loved the fact that it was more herbal than most drugs.  I ended up being so disappointed! I was diagnosed in August. I was given Aldera but it did not work at all for me.  I only had a few. I applied 3x/wk. Just made tender but not positive effects. The gyno did not give me many treatment choices. After doing some online research, I read about having them frozen by a dermatologist, which I did.This was not as painful as I read. Hurt for a few seconds, but then went away. The worst part was the black dots that appeared. The doc also said that I could try Veregen. She said that it didn't burn like Aldera, but it had to be used 3x/day. I used Veregen one night, then 3x the next day.  Woke up on 3rd day and had huge red blister type spots that were totally worse than anything I had ever had. It was so painful, to the point that I skipped work After calling the nurse, I was told to come in. The doc wrote me a rx for a steroid cream but made the comment that it doesn't affect that many people that way, and if I really wanted to get rid of it quickly I would continue use because it was bringing toxins to the surface. After reading so many positive reviews I decided to tough it out and continue with the Veregen and not fill the rx. I continued to use for a wk, through the pain and taking many Aleve. At my follow up a wk later, the doc said that I was completely inflammed.  The doc didn't know how I was standing it. Some of the larger spots that formed while taking the meds fell off while wiping to leave open sore spots) but new ones appeared, more than dissapeared. I was taken off Veregen, but on a steroid cream, antiobiotic cream and oral steroids. I feel as if I am ruined and the pain and spots will not go away! If you fill this rx and have lots of pain after a couple of days STOP! I will so be throwing this med away and just continuing the freezing every 2 wks after I'm healed enough to do so. 
External Genital Warts	Mad , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	9/9/2010 11:00:42 PM	Have been using this ointment for over a month and I have experienced all of the side effects listed on the leaflet. Burning, soreness, swelling, hard spots and sores. This is very painful.  I am almost ready to discontinue this treatment.  There are days when it seems like the warts are getting better, the skin that develops on the wart will peel away and the soreness will go away then the next day a new skin develops and the pain is back.  I thought that after a month I would see improvement but it seems to be worse.  I'll check back in later.

I have flat warts over a large portion of my labia. I checked tonight and noticed white tissue paper like stuff everywhere (thought it was from wiping) but further examination revealed it was a very thin layer of skin peeling off. AND, my warts are nearly gone! After 2 times!!! I can hardly find them! This stuff is amazing! Go botanical/natural remedies! :) Hopefully there is more improvement to come! My Dr. didn't even know about this stuff. I did my own research and told her I wanted to try it. (after reading Aldara horror stories)
