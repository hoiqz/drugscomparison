I could not tell that I was taking anything at all. Unlike the Metanx, it did not relieve my symptoms of extreme fatigue and cognitive problems.

Its a wonder drug!
Other	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/3/2011 8:02:30 PM	This medication has totally relieved severe nightly leg cramps.  The only negative is that I have some itching on the trunk of my body.  It's worth the itching to relieve the leg cramps.

Other	Bluehair, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/3/2010 7:47:18 PM	I take tis for peripheral neuropathy AND restless legs syndrome and it works perfectly.  (My neuropathy is due to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a genetic disorder.) I find it works just as well as Metanx, and is cheaper!  I was taking Neurontin (Gabapentin) but had to stop due to very dangerous drug interaction with Morphine. Neurpath-B is roughly one third tne cost of Gabapentin, the dose is much lower, no conflict with any of my meds, I have experienced no side effects, and it is weight-neutral, unlike Gabapentin (which caused gradual gain of 70 pounds over one and one-half years despite a low-cal healthy diet.) I'm sold!
