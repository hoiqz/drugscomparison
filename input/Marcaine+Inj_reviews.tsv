Other	cdnmaple, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	3/31/2011 2:04:45 PM	I have severe swelling af a finger joint due to trama.  I was given a steroid injection with Marcaine added to block pain.  Injection stung like crazy. I was not looking at the needle when injected and felt when the Dr pushed meds each time.  Immediately after injection my finger was numb and painless, however, an hour after the injection my finger hurt 10x worse than before.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	5/20/2010 12:03:48 PM	I received my first injection today for horrible and very frequent migraines.  I had six shots in the neck muscles that run from my shoulder to my neck.  By the time the first three were injected, I could tell a difference.  By the time the second three were in, my migraine was GONE.  It was like a miracle.  Then I came home.  It has now been about an hour and a half since the shot and I can already feel the migraine coming back.  I hope it is coming back because all my triggers are present at this time (weather, horomones, stress) except the food triggers.  Even if it comes back full force, this was still a miracle drug/procedure for me.

I find the injections to be very painful, even after he sprays a numbing agent over the areas. I haven't had great relief yet from treatment. So far, I have had at least six series of injections.
Other	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	65-74	2/22/2009 6:31:38 PM	I had an injection in a hip for bursitis.  Marcaine and a steroid was used.  The hip pain went away but I had flushing of the face, slight temp, headache, elevated BP and couldn't sleep.  Could it have been a reaction due to Lisinopril for BP?  I didn't take the pill before having the injection but did the next day and felt worse. Could this have been the reason.Does Marcaine cause more problems in this respect then Xylocaine?
