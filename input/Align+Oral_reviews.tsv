Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/5/2012 12:52:02 PM	62 yo wm. started about one year ago.  I am a pharmacist.  I have tried everything to treat my IBS of about 30 years, even other pro-biotics.  It has worked like a miracle drug.  LL Quadrant pain gone and stools are regular.  I do have some regular reflux like indigestion which I assume is from the drug.  Unfortunately, I have recommended it to others and it does not work for everyone and makes some people's symptoms worse.
Other	Ellie , 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		5/29/2012 5:41:48 PM	This medicine has saved my life I do believe, as for 10 years or more I had BS and I have now got my life back.  The Dr. that recommended it to me, I have called him and told him how I have been helped, 90%. I take one Align a day and have been taking it for over one year and half.

Other	clownzRscary, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	5/14/2012 1:02:03 PM	I started taking this to become more regular. Was doing fine until I finished the first week. I had very bad cramps in my lower extremities. Not sure if I should continue taking it but I spent quite a bit on this product so I probably will. Anyone else experience similar results?
Other	Cate, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	2/14/2012 6:35:10 PM	I started taking Align about 6 weeks ago. In the last weeks I have had horrible bloating, to the point I have bought a larger size of pants. By evening I can barely stand it. Going to the bathroom does not help, even after a healthy bm I still feel bloated and full! Going to stop this maddness and toss this medication. Did not feel this badly before I started taking it.
Other	Satisfied Align user, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/9/2012 2:54:19 AM	I had IBS for many years, and tried to control it using Immodium.  Then I tried various probiotics (e.g., Culturelle, Dura Flora, etc.), but no probiotics worked until I tried Align.  It works very well, whereas some of the others actually made things worse.  Everyone is different, so it might not work for you.  But if you try it, you should use it for a few days, because it takes your system some time to get used to most probiotics.
Other	rz, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	2/1/2012 9:06:58 PM	Started taking this for intestinal problems following a course of antibiotics. After a few doses had bloody stools, cramps, aches all over my body especially my joints. Couldn't control my bowels or bladder. Took immodium and it helped. I will never take this again. Also it contains artificial sweetners, which are causing headaches and flushing.

I had been taking Align for my cc problem needless to say I  have been suffering with severe burning from my throat all the way down to my rectum, it feels like I drank battery acid or have been poisioned,my poop is yellow, I can only eat cream potatoes and drink water and I still suffer from this burning pain. I thought about going to the emergency room but kept thinking it would get better, it has not, I will probably go to hospital tomorrow. Just a word of advice there are no warnings on the Align Box that should have told me something. I hope I have not done permanent damage to my gastrointestinal tract. This is powerful medicine.PLEASE BEWARE!!!!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	8/14/2011 11:43:35 PM	My Dr. told me to take this to alleviate diarrhea caused by taking an antibiotic. That was the worst idea ever! It intensified the diarrhea. I only took it for three days, and spent those three days in the bathroom.  It was HORRIBLE! I have never been so dehydrated or felt so badly. Immodium wouldn't even control it. I will never take this probiotic again.

My entire digestive system was out of whack (heartburn, gas, stomach pains)so my dr recommended this. It has worked but my upper arms are sore and I am fatigued all the time. I may switch to another probiotic and see if Align was the cause of these side effects. I have severe IBS-D and take Lotronex, one mg twice a day. It has been a life saver. Ladies with severe IBS-D, ask your doctor about it. There is no generic and it is extremely expensive. I have suffered the IBS since 1981 and used to take Questran. Lotronex is wonderful.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	2/13/2011 12:39:17 AM	I started taking this drug 2 weeks ago because I was taking philips colon health and that was helping a lot and figured this would be that much better...After about a week of taking it my bm's were mostly normal and all was good there but I started getting the worst cases of heartburn!!!  I thought it was from foods I had eaten. I thought it was from taking advil for a AF. But I never thought it could be from this stuff until just today when I took it and within 10 minutes it's back!!! Now I see so many others posting the same messages....I am so done!!! I will be switching back to Philips colon health and going to be happy with good enough!!!! 
Other	BBG , 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	2/10/2011 5:14:34 PM	I started taking this med following surgery to help restore the &quot;good&quot; bacteria to my GI tract. It seemed to help restore normal regularity of BMs to at least 1 a day. Am in 8th week of treatment but have recently noticed that my sense of taste has changed and I am experiencing acid reflux. Not sure whether these symptoms are related to taking Align.
Other	Di , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	25-34	2/5/2011 11:32:58 PM	I started taking Align for gas/acidity (too high) and BM (too low or none) issues.

I hope my horrible symptoms don't come back after I finish my Align. 
Other	Denny, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	45-54	12/11/2010 1:32:45 PM	I have been talking Align for going on two weeks. The reason was that all my life I never have regular BM. There are times I go 7 days without going, but usually it is 3 to 5 days.Since I have been taking Align, I go anywhere from 3 to 10 times a day, depending on how much I eat. It is VERY liquid and I have also seen traces of mucus. I have also suffered some of the MOST intense and severe intestinal distress I have EVER known. Now within 2 hours of taking Align, I become extremely bloated, crampy and gassy. My lower abdomen is EXTREMELY tender to the touch. It feels like I have been repeatedly punched on the stomach. Can't sleep at night for my stomach rumbling, and gurgling, and cramping.I have quit taking this after, and DO NOT recommend this to anyone.

I have had more frequent headaches and blisters in my mouth. I still get some stomach aches, but I don't have to worry about rushing to the bathroom as much as I used to. Before align I experienced IBS symptoms and was recently diagnosed to be lactose intolerant (which if you don't know you have it can be horrible to live with). Overall, align has helped, but leaves me uncomfortably gassy throughout the day.

So this is added to my daily intake of meds for my UC.  I've been on Align for 2 days and I feel very nauseous and sleepy.  I've been looking everywhere on line to see what and if there are any side effects and I can't find any.  I think if I'm not feeling better by the end of the week I will stop taking Align.  Any helpful info would be great on side effects.

Other	Nicole1, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	35-44	1/3/2010 8:03:09 PM	My experience has been horrible. I suffer from constipation and hoped this would work. I have been taking it for a week and have such extreme bloating and stomach pain that I feel bruised from the inside. I have only had 2 BMs. I will quiting this treatment today. I made the decision to take it over my Christmas break (teacher) and have had an absolutely awful week. I researched opionios of others and thought that if I could just hang it there it would get better. However, it doesn't tell you that if you are experiencing pain to stop. It encourages you to hang in there. I am assuming that the bacteria in my body must be worse than anyones elses or else the Align wouldn't be working so darn hard and debilitating me in the process. I hope others have had better expriences. I wish that I could go back a week and never purchased this supplement. Best wishs-insane in Indiana.   
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/12/2009 12:24:10 PM	I've been taking Align for 4 weeks now. I haven't been diagnosed with IBS-D because I've been controlling it myself (3 years) without my Dr's help. Anyway.. I used to take Immodium about two times a week &amp; I think in the passed month i've only taken it 2 times.. So that's twice a week to twice a month. I definitely feel that Align his helping me. The only draw back i'm seeing is that i'm gassy in the morning when i wake up. Maybe i should switch to taking it at dinner (early evening) instead of before i go to bed at night (late evening). I won't say it's perfect for me because i had an issue just two days ago, however, i was having issues 2/3 times a week before i started taking Align. It is a pricey medication, but you can get a good deal (right now) by purchasing it on Ebay. I paid full price on my first box and then bought a 2 pack of 28 on-line for the same price I paid in-store. I will continue to take it unless it stops helping. I do recommend it for people to try who are as desperate as i was to stop the panicky feeling of *where's the bathroom?? where??* when you're out &amp; about. You know what i mean. :)

This probiotic has milk. So if you are a person like myself who is already suffering from gas, these two ingredients dont serve to help the problem. I have also bought the more expensive flora source and found the capsule hard to pass. CVS and most drug stores have an acidophillus that is inexpensive, 4.99 for 100. I take one after each meal and it has help cut down my gas and keeps me regular.  My doctor told me I could take 6 a day if I wanted, that it would not hurt me. Hope this info is helpful, Good luck and God Bless.

It's really just more like diarrhea. I bought a 7 week pack &amp; am almost 3 weeks into it... plan on taking it the full 7 weeks to see what happens. Hoping it'll do more good than harm.
