Gout	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	45-54	9/10/2012 5:53:32 PM	I've started to have gout episodes in my foot since I lost one kidney and my Uric Acid is always elevated. My primary doctor advised to start taking Colcrys and the first two days I could tolerate the drug well.  By the third day, I had severe diarrhea, mild stomach cramping and felt nauseated the entire day.  My foot doctor informed me to only take it twice a day and with meals and that helped.  But after I finish this prescription out, I am going to look for other ways to control my uric acid buildups even I have to become a vegetarian!!!

Two days later I have diarrhea and blood in my stool. This made me very weak and tired. They need to take a further look into this drug.

It worked wonders until a couple of weeks ago when I experienced 2 complex partial seizures. I was taken off this medication and the seizures have ceased.

Gout	Tawny, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	5/14/2012 8:50:44 AM	I have kidney disease already so I was a little nervous to take this med. I reluctantly decided to take it when my gout in my left foot got really really bad. I was taking it for 5 days and experienced bad diarrhea and was throwing up almost everything I ate/drank.  The gout is not completely gone but I can walk without assistance.  I still have some pain in my foot and toes and stand on it very long.  I also start experiencing pain in my right hip which I'm not sure if it came from the colcrys but it started when I got on this pill.

This time was different.  Two days after taking it I begin to experience severe diarrhea and cramps.  I am off the medications now, but an still have cramps with occasional diarrhea.
Gout	Goutman, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/26/2012 10:29:05 AM	As a drug predating the FDA, colchicine was sold in the United States as a generic drug for many years. In 2009, the FDA approved colchicine for gout flares, awarding Colcrys a three-year term of market exclusivity, prohibiting generic sales, and increasing the price of the drug from $0.09 to $4.85 per tablet
Gout	ingorex, 75 or over Male  (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male		3/18/2012 7:59:13 PM	I am 75 yrs. old and for the past 40 yrs. have taken .06MG of Colchicine and attained effective relief until recently when the pharmacy had to substitute Colcrys as the old Colchicine was no longer available. The cost of Colcrys greatly exceeded that over generic Colchicine, $475 vs #5 for a 90 day supply. It is not as effective as I now experience diarreha and increased tofus on my ears and face. What happened to the old Colchicine? I am bow retired on medicare  and can't afford the cost of Colcrys. I thought the government was trying to control increased drug costs? Where did they go wrong?

Now this one comes on the market and the other RX is no longer even being produced! My symptoms are under control but my bowels are NOT! I have under my doctors direction have begun to decrease my 3 times daily dosage down to one dose per day and I am still not able to even take my dog for a walk for fear of an &quot;accident&quot;--horrid medication

I then was given colchicine that was my life saver. I would be able to buy a month supply for $4 That was shot out of the sky when the name was changed to colcrys and the price went up to 5.00 per pill. With out insurance I was not able to afford it. Thank God a nice lady was able to obtain funding for me that was a life saver. Good for one year, hope I can again get funding for next year. Bring back the 4.00 dollar 30 day supply is what I say.

Gout	tommylee, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	11/18/2011 6:08:57 PM	I have suffered bouts of gout periodically over the last 15 years. Like others, I took colchicine with wonderful results and little side effects. No longer available, I have to take colcrys. It does not work near as well as colchicine and has terrible side effects. Now I have a sore toe and cramps and diherrea.  There shoudl be an investigation!!!!!!

Gout	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	9/1/2011 7:10:27 AM	This is my first bout of gout (pun intended). I took 1.8 mg on two conectutive days with no relief whatsoever. It might be possible that it was ineffective because I've been symptomatic for two weeks? I was diagnosed two days ago.

This version, however, does not seem to affect me as much. It seems to work for the gout with few side effects. 
Gout	Mary June, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female		8/7/2011 5:52:30 PM	I've been on Colchicine &amp; now Colcrys for Gout for a year or so. I won't get into my disgust of the FDA 's approval &amp; raising the cost. This past week I suffered greatly with canker sores in mouth &amp; swollen tongue. I was unable to swallow solids. The throbbing pain gradually eased over a period of 10 days.  My rheumatologist has taken this supposed allergy into consideration &amp; wants me to continue with Colcrys for the time being.

Gout	Tom R, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	65-74	6/7/2011 10:45:30 AM	My family doctor indicated this drug was a long time availability, i.e., early Roman ruins time frame. I am gout prone so i was Rx this medicine. At pickup, I had a $56 co-pay with the insurance paying $346. It used to be a very inexpensive generic. A company challanged the FDA for gout use and won leading to copyrighting protection and increase in costs to the user. Someone needs to take a hard look at this Rx cost.
Gout	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	6/3/2011 12:34:03 PM	I have been on Colchisine for years and it works just fine. Now all of a sudden I cannot get it and I have to switch to this garbage. My feet swell and I can't walk too good because of the pain. I had a few Colchisine left and within a few hours the pain and swelling were gone. Whoever made the decision for millions of gout sufferers to eliminate a med that works for this garbage should have their feet crushed with a hammer so they understand the pain we have to endure.

I do NOT understand why a generic drug has become a brand name -- especially as it is a very old drug used for gout for centuries.  Can anyone shed light?
