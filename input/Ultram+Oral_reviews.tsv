Then there was a sudden, very intense, sharp stabbing feeling starting at the bottom of the left rib.Then it traveled across my upper abdomen viciously,extremely sharp pain and severe nausea, dizziness, confusion, anxiety that caused my to stutter, effecting my speech, my ability to walk correctly was compromised.  As I attempted to walk out of the room to find my husband for help, the abdominal pain and nausea spread throughout my entire colon, a distended colon. My head felt tight and stuffed with cotton causing tremendous discomfort. I has been 48 hours since my last pill and I still have all of the symptoms I mentioned, but very slow dissipating.

I was in tremendous paid, so much that Vicodin 500, 6 times a day was not doing anything after sometime. My doctor along my pain specialist prescribed this combination of drugs and I have to say it is the best thing that has happen to me. Just like other members described. I had also had some depression/anxiety. After taking this drugs not only the oain was gone buy my depression and anxiety as well, I would have said this is the miracle drug, Also since young I always struggled to get off of bed and fully wake up, it was normally take me 1-2 hrs to get myself up and running. I found myself taking my dose the minute I opened my eyes and I would be up and running with so much energy and such a positive feeling as soon as the meds kicked in. I am still taking the same dose but I have found that my memory has really taken a toll and it just does not get me going like it used to. I have tryed uping my dose but I really try to just stay at one dose in the morning and one dose after lunch.
Pain	Broken Arm, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	7/13/2012 5:33:41 AM	Tramadol was Given for Severe skeletal muscle pain due to a fall causing impact to bone and severe muscle pull, strain and hyper-extension resulting in excruciating pain when shoulder and arm are moved. Due to the 'war on drugs' causing MD's to be afraid to actually give medicine that actually works and provides pain relief, this overrated, overhyped &amp; ineffective drug was given in lieu of real pain relief because its taunted as the wonder non narcotic pain reliever. When in reality, it has the same efficacy as high dose Ibuprofen. Needless to say, I suffered ALOT more than I should have and for days because of the clinic protocols in place now all across the nation. Give bare minimum pain relief with an appeasement drug like TRamadol and send the patient out the door because the MDS are told NOT to write for anything stronger by the DEA or face conseqences. In other words, no matter how horrible you pain, the DEA thinks you should suffer and youR pain should be underTREATED. I hurt severely for over a week because of these protocols. The DEA and  DRS and the makers of the woefully ineffective  Tramadol should be ashamed of themselves. I suffered for no reason what so ever. These ridiculous protocols should be reviewed...NO PATIENT should be made to suffer as much as I have because of the ridiculous restrictions placed on Drs by the DEA. Tramadol does not work on this kind of pain....at all!

Your reviews helped me to begin taking Tramadol with a positive attitude.  I have stiff, achy fingers, wrists and elbows.  I've tried everything from motrin to percocet and NOTHING has helped as much as Tramadol.  I can pull weeds and iron without wanting to cry!  I feel hopeful and happy once again.  I just don't understand why it took years for a doctor to decide to prescribe this for me.

The first one was ok, but the second one was my last!  The dizzines and nausea made me think I was having a heart attack.  Luckily the muscle had relaxed by then.  I went back to Ibuprophen for the residual pain.
Pain	AbigailB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	6/10/2012 3:04:32 AM	I take this drug for about 7 days every three months after receiving back injections for pain after a car accident. The first time I took the 50mg pills, they made me dizzy, so I started cutting them in half and taking them with food. They take away the pain from the injections and allow me to be a bit more comfortable. I also take them during flare-ups. They do make me very tired and I sometimes have an out of body feeling or become overly relaxed, causing me to be more susceptible to hurting myself, so I have to rest while on the medication. Overall the benefits have far outweighed any of these side effects and I am happy with the medication.

Doctors have tried me on everything else from percocet, to lortab 10 and these do nothing for me. I worry about addiction but with this medicine I don't. I take 1 tylenol with 100 mg twice a day sometimes a little more if I have severe pain. I have a damages sciactic nerve in low left back down left leg, two heriated disc at thoracic area, and two bulges in neck but as long as I stay on a regimen of ultram I can function.

It is not a medication that works for long-term pain relief. I have intense back pain due to 3 herniated disks in my upper and lower back which have pinched the nerves into my legs and arms. I have had a few different medications but this one is the only one that takes a bit of the edge off of the pain. The major downfall is that the tolerance has built up so fast that I was on full dosing at 2 months. Now 6 months in it might as well stay in the bottle because it just gives me palpatations and constapation. Does not last!

After 3 years of treating my muscle pain and spasms with vicodin, various muscle relaxers and weekly injections, chiropracty, and physical therapy, my pain was still increasing and my primary doctor prescribed percocet 4x daily. This medication worked well but was too short acting and my day was a roller-coaster of feeling ok to agonizing until I could take my next dose. My primary referred me to a pain clinic so I could get on a med management program of much stronger extended release narcotics. Unfortunately, since all of my pain was in my soft tissues, it didn't show up on any of my x-rays or MRI's, and the pain doctor thought I was drug seeking! He refused to prescribe anything other than tramadol 100mg 4x day. Right away I knew this med was wrong and was calling the dr with my side effects, but he said to give it more time. In 6 weeks, my nausea and vomiting caused me to go from 125lbs to only 95lbs and I had blood in my stools. The pain dr only said &quot;it can't be the tramadol, keep taking it because I WILL NOT prescribe you anything else. Several months of agony, two endoscopies, a colonoscopy, an abdominal CT scan, and a heptobilary scan all reported that it was the tramadol destroying my insides! The pain dr didn't like this and excused me from the pain clinic so I can never receive the types of meds I need. I am now back to only OTC meds and alternative therapies to barely get through each day.Tramadol (and the dr who prescribed it) ruined my life!

I also have Fybromy. and osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. I have been prescribed Ultram for pain before, and I may as well not take anything. This is not a narcotic and people with severe pain need to take at least a low dose PAIN MED, I have been taking some sort of med for pain since I was 17yrs old and I am 51 now, not addicted to anything. But I have a wonderful Pain and rehab Dr. (not a pill mill Dr.)That makes all the difference in whether you become addicted to narcotics, my Dr knows that I am fused from my neck to sacrum. those other Docs dont even ask. Set your self up with a pain specialist that is offiliated with a hospital in case you have problems and dedicate that Dr to handle all your pain needs, all in one office. Trust me your other Drs and the Hospital will take your pain much more seriusly.  Thanks for reading. Ive been in pain almost all my life. The Pain Dr. is the way to go, just make sure he/she is ligit.

It has very little affinity for the mu receptor and is actually an SSRI and acts on dopamine. It is about as effective as life savers to control even mild pain. The only reasons doctors prescribe it is because it is not controlled and doctors are more interested in avoiding the DEA than doing what's right for their patients.

I don't take it every day, just &quot;as needed&quot;, and haven't noticed any withdraw symptoms. I do notice a bit of insomnia after taking a normal 100mg dose after noon. I have also noticed a reduction in my appetite. These things aside, I have no complaints. The pain is greatly reduced and as a result I feel less fatigue and more focus. I don't want to take this medication for the rest of my life, but while the doctors are still trying to figure out what is causing the pain it is wonderful. I also have a diagnosis of PTSD and anxiety and I find that those symptoms are reduced when taking the medication as well.

Pain	lilmama30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	8/18/2011 8:51:28 PM	I suffer from fibromyalgia and pelvic pain. After 4 surgeries I am still suffering from pelvic pain. They cant explain it. I take 1-2 Tramadol 4 times a day. It definatly eases the pain from the fibro. Tramadol is great for joint and nerve pain. Still trying to find something to help with the pelvic pain. Because of soooooo many people wanting to get &quot;HIGH&quot; off of pain pills, I cant get anything BUT Tramadol for pain. Was on Vicoprofen for years (on and off) for pelvic pain and that helped, but after so long doc said no more. Tramadol is a good drug for fibro.

Pain	jerseymaleyoyo, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	8/6/2011 2:38:26 AM	I had been prescribed Ultram 50mg after a battle with chronic sacro-illiac disease.  It is a very painful arthritis which would affect either my left and right hip and leg every day.  There have been occasions when I was hospitalized from the pain caused by the inflammation.  When bad flare-ups occur, putting a slight amount of weight on my foot would result in stabbing and sharp knife like pains in my hip/leg.  The first 5 years of living with this condition were very difficult, and I had to change my lifestyle to accommodate for my reduced mobility and daily pain.  I had taken high doses of anti-inflammation pills along with pain-killers, like Hydrocodone.  I did not find much relief from this combination, and did not want to become addicted to the pain-killers.  My doctor recommended Ultram.  I have taken varying doses over the past few years, and since have been able to regain my life, focus on my job, remain clear and focused throughout the day, and live virtually pain-free.  I truly believe that this is my 'wonder drug' and it has really helped me gain my life back, and let me focus on the things I enjoy... rather than focus on the pain.  I recommend this to anyone whom has similar issues with back or leg chronic pains.

Pain	Lijah, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/18/2011 8:57:12 PM	I was prescribed this drug in 1996, initially as a non-narcotic &quot;cure&quot; for chronic migraine.  The drug was not helpful.  This pre-dates migraine-specific meds such as sumatriptin.  When I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia (FMS) the following year, I asked for Ultram again.  Again, there was little relief from the pain, but I saw an improvement in range of motion as well as stiffness.  I have stayed on Ultram for 14 years and have no plans to discontinue.  I recommend liver &amp; kidney function tests on a regular basis while on this drug.

Pain	painfree, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/18/2011 6:38:10 PM	Tramadol has been a miracle for my back and leg pain d/t L3-4 disc. I also feel more energetic as another reviewer noted. I do occ have nausea 8-12 hours after taking, but the benefits far outweigh the mild side-effect. It does take about 1.5 to 2 hrs to relieve my pain fully...but I know it will. I only take it once a day and it lasts 14-16hrs for me.

Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	5/31/2011 10:55:48 AM	I started taking tramadol after suffering a shoulder injury. Not only is it effective for pain relief, but also has a great calming effect at night (although it does make sleep more difficult). I have read reviews from others who are taking the maximum dosage, but I get solid relief by taking considerably less. I found that even 1/2 of a 50 ml. can provide satisfactory relief.
Pain	galveston, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	65-74	5/28/2011 4:03:49 PM	Beneficial side effect! My wife has had a chronic cough for over 15 years. The only cough med that worked satisfactorily was Tussionex @ $150.00 for 8 oz. No other cough meds did a good job.When she had a corneal transplant, the Dr. prescribed Tramadol HCL 50 mg. for post-op pain. We noticed that while taking it, her cough disappeared. Now she takes 1/2 pill in the evenings and it seems to hold the cough for 24 hours. We are thrilled.
Pain	Mickey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	5/20/2011 7:10:53 PM	Tramadol was only moderately effective in treating my low back pain. However, the side effects caused significant myoclonic twitching. This side effect led to a 2-day hospitalization. It was believed that I may have had a stroke or MS. The physicians did not pay attention to the fact that I was taking Tramadol, and I was not aware of this potential side effect of Tramadol until 2 years after the fact. I am certain the myoclonic twitches were from the Tramadol because it started 2 days after starting Tramadol and slowly decreased after discontinuing the medication. However, I am still have problems with twitching. I'm not sure if this is a permanent effect of Tramadol or perhaps caused by another medication I am taking. I may be susceptible to twitching and tremor side effects of medications, however, I believe that patients using Tramadol should be aware of this side effect. I had a friend who was taking Tramadol who had a seizure while on the medication. As with any medication, the benefits have to outweigh the risks. And of course, different people respond differently to the same medication.

Pain	KORA94, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/11/2011 8:36:26 PM	I was perscribed Ultram some 14 years ago after a roll-over car accident, thanks to an individual running a red light, and I must say it has made my life much easier. I understand the serotonin in it when combined with an anti-depressant which also contains serotonin really helps with the depression along with it relieving the chronic neck &amp; back pain I endure daily. I thank God for this medication.  Yes, I do agree with others that if you happen to run out I have succombed to awful RLS and that will put you in a panic attack.  There was nothing I could do to stop it other than get my refill and continue with dosage as perwcribed by my Doctor.  Funny, it was not on the narcotics list for many years and now all of the sudden it is.  How can they get by doing that?  For the most, I can say it has worked for me and it I pay $10.00 for the generic for 180 count.  Good luck to all who are suffering with chronic pain.

The first day I took the medication I was drowsy somewhat but still had severe pain; I was suppose to take the medication every 6 hours and I waited 7 and 1/2 hrs before I took my next dose. After taking the 2nd dose I got severely drowsy and then I blacked out, I felt paralyzed; I remember thinking to myself, I hope I don't stop breathing because I was having difficulty breathing. Then the next day came I started having pain, I contacted my doctors office talked with a nurse she advised me to split the 59MG tab in half and take every three hours, I did what she said and I had hallucinations and don't really remember anything that I did. I do not recommend this drug at all, it terrified me.
Pain	Lil A, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	4/16/2011 10:49:07 PM	While the pain was taken totally away with this drug (it took 3 Vicodin to do the same), I ended up having a severe reaction to it (extreme nausea, lethargy, weakness, and light headedness) to the point where I thought it safer to be taken off of it. My orthopedic surgeon agreed and put me back onto Vicodin, which is a lot less effective at higher doses. I wish that I didn't have the reaction I did, as it is the only drug that relieves my pain in my knee. I shouldn't have this kind of pain in my knee, so I am seeing the surgeon on Tuesday to discuss other treatment options. My advice: be careful when trying new drugs, as sometimes you can have a bad reaction after the drug accumulates in your system for a while. Take it exactly as prescribed, as this is a very powerful drug.

Since then I was diagnosed with a degenerative spine.  Again this sad medication as prescribed with a plea that I give it a &quot;real try&quot;.  It still does not work.  (I can take up to 300 mg a day.)  I can't wait for the end of the week when I can get a real pain killer.
Pain	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/3/2011 10:52:59 PM	I started taking Ultram (Tramadol is the generic) for neck and shoulder pain from an accident. I'm allergic to all codiene type pain relievers (stomach ache and itchy rash). I'm allowed 1 to 3 Tramadol per day, but I usually take one with two Tylenol before I go to sleep at night. It actually makes me a little drowsier at bedtime, but I can take it during the day with no drowsiness problem. I understand that Tramadol helps me &quot;perceive&quot; my pain differently and it works. I have read that it can act like an antidepressent for some people, which may be my case, as my pain is relieved and I'm feeling great.
Pain	lsacca9056, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	4/3/2011 6:08:56 PM	I was prescribed Ultram in the ER for an abscessed tooth. This medicaton's side effect was a temporary hearing loss concurrently with a feeling similar to being knocked out with nitrous oxide(laughing gas). I was at work when this occurred and had to warn my co workers of my possible hearing loss,spaceyness. It was a horrifying experience I didn't think it would give me &quot;opiate like SE's. I ended up throwing the meds down the toilet. Hopefully that won't harm the water supply.

It gets rid of the pain, but I can't sleep after taking it. It's a peaceful insomnia, but that's still no use if I'm working the following day. If I take it daytime, it makes me arrogant and short-tempered. So I use it only in the worst case.

Pain	Stephanie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/30/2010 5:35:16 PM	I have taken Ultram for several years now for treatment of migraines.  My headaches are caused by muscle tension in my neck, so regular migraine treatments such as Imitrex do not work for me.  I was taking Vicodin briefly for another issue, and even that would not touch my migraines.  I work for a physician's office, and one of our physicians gave me a sample of Ultram to try (before it was considered a controlled substance).  It worked great!  I take it in conjunction with ibuprofen when I have a migraine coming on (usually once a week or less).  Please keep in mind that each person is different, therefore pain meds will have different effects on each individual. Just because it doesn't work for one person doesn't mean it won't for another, and vice versa.  I am careful to only take Ultram when necessary due to the fact that it can be addictive.  Taking it as I do I have not had any problems with this.  I am much more comfortable taking this instead of a stronger pain medication such as Vicodin or Percocet.
Pain	Dpeach25, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/29/2010 1:23:01 PM	I was in a car accident in 2007 and had some minor yet longterm injuries. I was prescribed hydrocodone at the hospital which I did not like. It made me itch like crazy and the pain relief only lasted about an hour. So my doctor prescribed Tramadol. I take 400mg a day and it helps tremendously. Not only does it help with the pain it also gives me energy that lasts all day. Please note that it may take a couple days to feel the full effect of the medicine. Tramadol is not for someone who is looking to get a &quot;high&quot; from the drug. I have been taking this drug since 2007 and have had no side effects. I take it just like my doctor prescribes and have no complaints. The only downside to this medication is the withdrawal symptoms. I accidentally dropped half of my prescription down our garbage disposal a couple years ago. The withdrawal symptoms i felt were horrible. It feels like your skin is crawling. I couldn't sleep. My arms and legs could not stay still. Very restless. You definitly have to gradually lower your dose if you want to stop taking the medication. Other than that, it really helps with my pain.

I was researching its affects on my liver because it seems that even though I take my reccommended dose my doctors office acts like I take to much.  They perscribe it to me, give me refills and then make me feel like a drug addict.  I have done physical therapy, chiropractics and spinal shots are out of the question.  I am so tired of there additudes when I call for my script.  The ultram does its job and like another guy said its not to bad for just making you feel happier and energized.  I can't seem to find any liver failure information on this drug and it seems my dose 400mgs a day is just right for my pain level.  So I just don't get why they treat me like they do.  I have never taken another pain killer in my life and they even tried to put me on Vicodin but I told them the ultram worked and that was what I wanted to take.  That was after they took it away from me for six months no letting me off it easy (what hell that is when you go to bed) they yanked right away said I was to young to have that much pain (I'm 24) and I had to go another route. I may be young but I ride race horses that would crush anyones spine.  so I tried their suggestions.  After six months of eating Excedrin like candy they gave me an MRI and discovered my compressed disc and torn muscle but they still give me a hassle about taking my reccommended dose of ultram.  I am so tired of it but they are the only doctor in my small town and I really need this medication for my back.  None the less this medication is helpful to say the least and as good as it gets in the pain killer world if you ask me.

I have had the spinal surgery because all other options seemed like a waste of my time and there was alot of damage to my l 4-5 spine that the surgeon has fused with micro surgery. I have titanium pins and spacers along with the bone grafts. Nothing would help my pain before the surgery and now this has helped. I am also taking Gabapentin that seems to help but has more side effects. I am 3 months into this recovery and I have no use of my left leg and chronic pain. One day at a time is best and surround yourself with true friends. You will need the support of others to do this to recover.

It only takes the edge off and notheing more. You should only take this if you have pain thats less than that of a papercut becaue ibuprophen works better than Ultram.

Loss of consciousness, hallucinations, etc. My friend had to call the ambulance to take me to the hospital. I had a rough night and That was only my first pill. I got an allergic reaction and severe side effects from it. I suggest avoiding this pill at all costs.

Although very, very effective in killing the pain. Ultram also gives me energy to perform my normal daily task. Don't know how I will  live without it, but my memory and lungs are more important. Anyone know of medication withthe same effect ultram provides for pain?
Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	8/20/2010 7:58:12 AM	I am not sure if I had an allergic reaction but every time I had taken Tramadol HCL; I would get dizzy, nausea, the room or wherever I was felt like it was spinning. I would get hot and sweat. I would shake from time to time. I could not eat or drink because I would get sick because of the Tramadol HCL. It has gotten so bad. I had to stop taking it. And now I feel fine and better with out it. I still have my pelvis pain but I rather deal with that than be sick on the pill. 
Pain	none, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/14/2010 2:14:07 AM	I went to the Emergency Room with a dislocated elbow that happened at work, the doctor popped the elbow back in place and was told that I'd be sore for 2-3 days. He prescribed me ultram for the pain after giving me a dose of Percocet 10 mg at the ER which really helped weith the pain, when that wore off I took the ultram 50mg pill and threw up, I went back to the ER and was told that happens with most everyone who takes it, I asked if I could have some of the percocet 10 mg pill that the doc gave me there and the nurse returned and I was told No, I told her that I was in some pretty good pain and she said, &quot;I'm sure you are but sorry, the answer is NO&quot;. I put up a bit of a fuss and before I knew it the cops where there accusing me of trying to obtain narcotics with a made up injury, I informed them that I had dislocated my elbow at work and the pain meds they gave me made me throw up, thats why I came back to the ER. I guess they deal with this sort of thing all the time, thanks to those people who fake injuries to get pain medication, those of us with ligitimate injuries have to suffer because of the&quot;Real&quot; Drug Addicts

Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	8/5/2010 5:49:57 PM	I was given ultram 50mg's for knee pain, the first time I took it made me sick to my stomach and provided no relief for the pain, I figured I needed more in my system so I took 2 more at the same time and shortly thereafter I was wound up like a top, I felt like I has od'd on caffein, no pain relief and I was awake all night itching like crazy. I reported this back to the doc and what did he tell me to do, cut the pill in half and see how that works, HELLO!!!!!! IT DID NOTHING FOR THE KNEE PAIN AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO CUT THE PILL IN HALF? I have been on Lortab 10's in the past due to some surgeries and never had reactions like this, I asked if he could prescribe me some of them and he refused fearing I was hooked on them, so now I wait for a week to see the Orthopedic doc for my knee pain, totally pissed at my primary care doc for keeping me in pain. Someone recently told me that doctors prescribe ultram if they think you are addicted to narcotics, maybe thats true but I'm not addicted, my knee is the size of a basketball and I cant walk on it, way to go doc, thanks for undermedicating me and leaving me in pain, oh one more thing, he said if I was in that much pain, go to the Emergency Room.
Neuropathic Pain	Sha Sha, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/4/2010 11:34:36 AM	I've taken this off and on for many years. At first I did have hallucinations and itching and still sometimes the itching.  Now I have no problems with it but I have heard some people have terrible experiences with it.  I think maybe starting out at 25 mg then moving the dose up is the way to go until you know for sure how this drug will affect you.   The side effects lessen after awhile of taking it.  That is my experience anyway.  I am still tired from it I think.  Actually I'm tired whether I take it or not.

Then it was no longer effective.  I was put on another medication by a specialist who told me that I would need to come off the Untram.  Foolish me, I decided after 6 months to just stop taking it since it cause my stomach to be upset.  I had been taking 200 mg per day. I thought I was going to crawl out of my skin!  It made me very depressed and anxious. It was stupid I know but my doctor is no longer practicing pain management.  I would advise anyone who wants to come off this drug to seek professional medical care to do so.  Don't do it on your own!

Its my opinion that this medication should be restricted more due to its adverse effects on people. I took this medication for about 6 months until I had a seizure then promtly quit taking it that day. Although I felt groggy and tired I had no withdrawl or further seizures after stopping this medication. I hope that my review of this medication will help other people to avoid this medication if possible.

Pain	police414, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	19-24	7/2/2010 9:43:56 PM	I was prescribed this drug to control pain before having shoulder surgery. Which it does not help alot if your pain is severe. But if you take anything of a higher dose you want be able to control the even more severe pain after surgery. Long story short it works if you have a little pain but not alot of pain! What I did not know was that this drug is harder to stop taking if you have taken it for more than one month as I have. I was fine as long as I was taking a pill before I went to bed, but once you run out and the doctor says it's time to stop taking them and doesn't prescibe you a lower dose to get off of them you can hang up trying to get any sleep at all! It is almost unbarrable to make the pain in your legs and body go away....So if you taking tramadol aka Ultram Please be aware of what you are doing and how much you take because getting off of the pills will be a dreadful journey!

This medication is not effective for moderate pain or even a headache.  As a matter of fact it will give you one just trying to get rid of the pain.

This had no affect on me. My doctor tried Tramadol(Ultram) on me starting about a year ago. I have been using 50mg a day ever since. Occassionally I skip a day. For me Ultram has been a God send. I can function for about 12 hours on one 50mg tablet. Occassionally, on high humidity days I'll take two a day--but not often. I ususally get a small burst of energy from it as well. Although I have heard most people get drowsy from it. Occassionally I do notice a little nausea and sweating if I haven't eaten.

Have noticed balance and coordination loss when taking this.  Unable to perform my job tasks in an office setting when taking Ultram.

After my physical therapy was completed, I stopped taking this med, and went through horrible and drawn-out withdrawls! Sleepless nights, constant drowsiness, every night while attempting to sleep my left arm would involuntarily tense up and twitch and cramp on me, and I was very angry, also. I was told that wouldn't happen as this is a &quot;non-narcotic&quot;, but I have NEVER had those symptoms with any other drug in the past.....Even with Oxycodone post surgery. Beware!

Tramadol has done the job for me.  The only side effect which I notice is drowsiness.  If there is any other pain reliver that is compatible with Gleevec I would be interest in hearing about it.

I refused narcotics because chronic nature of illness and side effects as well as worry about addiction. Then my MD suggested Ultram. I have now used it for 9 years...and it has helped me so much. It works well at low dosage as long as I don't wait till pain out of control. I take 90% less of it now than I did.  When I am having a well time...I don't even think about taking it.  But when I feel bad and am hurting so much that I just don't want to even get out of bed...I can take 1 pill and generally don't feel much...I just find myself up and doing things for myself without making myself do it. I have had several surgeries and chose to just use Ultram and Tylenol (or)Advil. While it doesn't get rid of severe pain of surgery or gallstones...it does help without the horrible side-effects of most narcotics.
Pain	rxking, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	3/9/2010 1:49:45 PM	Woderful. I have used this medicine for ten years now taking the max dosage of 400mg daily. It manages my pain well and gives me the energy that I need for a full day. But, be very aware that this can be a very addictive and habit forming drug that can have very dangerous side effects if stopped abruptly, such as seizures , restlessness headache, chronic fatigue, and extreme stomach discomfort. If taken properly, though, this is the most efffective pain reliever for my injuries that I have ever taken.

Other	TramadolBlues, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	3/8/2010 4:03:52 PM	This &quot;drug,&quot; to use the term loosely, is yet another gawd-awful cocktail of chemicals that the medical community pawns off on unsuspecting patients as an analgesic.  There are so many bad &quot;side effects&quot; that they should be called &quot;primary effects&quot; instead.  Sadly, the world is barely one notch above Civil War medicine when it comes to safe, effective, pain killers.  This is most likely due to a combination of insufficient basic research, poorly educated researchers who are not taught a comprehensive understanding of human physiology, and a general acceptance of the fallacious idea, &quot;Well, that's all there is.  Take it or leave it.&quot;  If we took that philosophy as gospel back during WWII, we would all be goose-steeping and saluting the Nazi flag right now.  C'mon, all you research scientists... you can do better than this!!!

Neuropathic Pain	Shelby507, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	2/17/2010 3:06:39 AM	I am 35 years old and have degenerative disk disease, compressed disks in my L3-5 region, a ruptured disk, and arthritis in my spine.  This has also led to my sciatic nerve being pinched.  I have had back problems for the past 12 and began taking Ultram about 9 years ago.  It has worked wonders for me.  This also allows me to take this medication while at work too.  It makes me itch when I take 100 mg compared to the 50 mg and I do get headaches off and on, other than that, this medication has helped me tremendously.

Each person has a different response.  When it works, it works really well.  However, about half the time it doesn't work at all.  When you have pain, try everything that is available, then continue with whatever works.  Good luck!

Works well for pain, was constantly itchy for the first few days of treatment but that has since stopped, had nightmares for the first week or so as well, slept about 20 hours a day while starting treatment (makes me more tired than vicodin), definitely decreases appetite. Now as I'm having less pain on a day to day basis I find myself having withdrawl symptoms, I get nauseous and can't seem to get to sleep, to reduce the severity of this I'll take half a pill and that seems to do the trick.

My Mother said, &quot;If it works, don't mess with it&quot; I can't take most of the other drugs for arthritis,this works, and works great, now if you take more than the dose,yes you can get sleepy,amoung other things, I don't have nightmares,or dizzy but my husband did, gave him one to help with some pain and he got so dizzy,sleepy,etc, so with this and all drugs, some work, some don't, for me this is a life saver, and it does help with the mood, not sure if it's a &quot;side effect&quot; or just because the pain is gone but i'll take this any day, have arthritis in hips,lower back, neck, and hope that's all the places on me it decides to visit. If you haven't tried it, give it a try,you will know if it works or not, a cheap pain killer, Wal-Mart does Tramodol for $8.00 for 120 pills, I qualify to get the real deal Ultram free, check it out.
Pain	libralady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/13/2010 12:19:43 PM	I had a horrible experience with Tramadol when it was prescribed to me for pain associated with a partially-torn rotator cuff.  Within 20 minutes after taking one pill at 9 p.m., I became extremely dizzy, disoriented and nauseated, so much so that I could barely speak or move.  After finding my way into bed, I felt extremely tired but could only doze, with one foot on the floor to keep the bed from spinning.  The next morning I was still dizzy and felt &quot;hungover&quot; for the next 12 hours.  It was only after reading other reviews that I discovered Tramadol should not be taken by anyone who is allergic or had a bad reaction to codeine, as I did many years ago.  I'm happy to hear that Tramadol helps many people with chronic pain, although it sounds to be as addicting as some of the more &quot;popular&quot; drugs such as oxycodone, percocet, vicodin, etc. that are being abused every day.

I was hit by a car when I was in high school &amp; have arthritis from the injuries.  I've been on anti-inflammatory pills ever since (about 24 years now.)  I've been taking Naprosyn twice daily for about 3 years.  Within the past year I've had to take Extra Strength Tylenol along with it to relieve pain.  Pain got so bad I had to go to doctor to get something else.  Ultram did the job!  I had to quit taking the Tylenol but could continue to take the Naprosyn.  The Naprosyn takes away the inflammation and the Ultram is a pain killer.  They work great together!  I try to only take the Ultram as needed (cold, rainy days, etc.)  As a side note...I also have severe cramps from menstrual periods and Ultram works awesome on it too!

Each capsule is contain about 50mg. On the first I was quite impressive at this side effects, it can cause me to feel dizzy, more atractive, creative, hallucinating, blurred vision and somewhat like I'm using an ecstasy.The bad side is insomnia, constipated and on the other day I've got a heavy dreams, bad moods, uncontrollable emotions, nausea, light headache but still annoying, itchy skin and gastrointestinal problem.Right now I feel like I want to take Tramadol whenever I go out, it is makes me addiction to that.

I'm certain I had it for several years before.  I also suffer TMJ, RLS, and more.  I've been on Ultram for most of the time.  My prescription is for one 50 mg tablet up to three times a day.  I don't take them everyday.  When I am hurting, I want more before it is time. I have never consumed alcohol while taking Ultram.    I think the warning &quot;may increase effectiveness when consumed with alcohol&quot; may intice some individuals to do both: alcoholic beverages and Ultram.  I can picture someone thinking that an increase in effectiveness would be a good thing.  Ultram has worked fairly well; I'm satisfied.  It hasn't worked as good as I would like it to work.

I have been on various meds for the pain, Kadian, Vicodin ES, Dilaudid.  This seems to work as good if not better than the Kadian for my pain, and with less withdrawal if I am late for a dose than any of the classic narcotic pain relievers I have been prescribed. I do have some rather vivid and lucid dreams on this drug, and may or may not have had some localized skin reactions on one leg. Ultram does not seem to make me excessively sleepy, nor euphoric.

When I take Ultram, it effectively manages my pain. The pain management helps me to focus better at my job, I have more energy, I am able to move with less pain. I also have Degnerative Disc Disease and a torn disc. My back pain went from very disruptive to minimally disruptive of my life. This medication helps me continue to work 40 hours a week. I have less brain fog. I wish I knew how it worked to reduce muscle spasm -- without the medication, my muscles are so tight that I feel like I'm fighting to grip things, my wrist wants to spasm outward, and I have coordination issues. I have some neuropathic issues in my arms and I'm not sure what the cause is.I am also able to carry on conversations more easily while on this medication. In fact, it makes me more talkative. Without the medicine, I have a harder time putting thoughts into coherent sentences. (Due to the pain, lack of concentration? fatigue caused by pain? -- I don't know.) The quality of my life is greatly improved on this medication.When I first started it, I had some nausea, some euphoria (but I knew it was happening), and slight wooziness. Over time, these effects have greatly diminished and are entirely manageable. I take two 50mg pills a day, and have been on this treatment for about 5 months. I tried to only use the pill once per day but the benefits to my work life were tremendous and so I take two pills to allow me to function better during my work hours. I use Mobic in the evening if I need to. This medication may be what is keeping me functional enough to contribute at work. I have more confidence in my ability to be a good worker. Without it, I would be struggling and I would feel less secure about my employment. 
Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	11/22/2009 5:01:49 AM	Used to treat pain due to Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. I have tried using Asprin, Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Voltaren and Prednisone with little to no relief. Tramadol has relieved my pain and I've noticed I feel happier in general since I've been on the medication. I have not experienced any negative side effects.

I don't take this everyday...maybe once a week...so I should not have withdrawal symptoms like I do...I have taken actual narcotics and they have never given me these awlful symptoms like Ultram does. I would rather take OVC medicine and/or deal w/ my tension headache.
Pain	jrun74, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	11/19/2009 2:39:47 PM	I had surgery on my neck due to a herniated disk in my neck cause an extreme amount of pain down my whole right arm and into my thumb and index finger and I was on Percocet directly after surgery, then went to vicoden, and then to Ultram.  At first I felt that the ultram was not all that effective, but some of that could have been the fact that I had been on narcotics for quite sometime and could have been somewhat addicted to them.  Since then I have injured myself somehow and the pain was back, but on the opposite side for some odd reason.  I had an MRI, no herniated discs, maybe just overworked the left side while trying to baby the right side.  Now, I just take the ultram during the day, and flexeril at night(only when needed).  For me the ultram does seem to give me a slight burst in energy and mood, although I have noticed without it I don't function all too well at all, extreme fatigue and irritability.

Was very helpful with joint pain but, I apparently had a severe muscle spasm of the heart when taking this along with lexapro. Thought I was having a heart attack. Be cautios when using with other drugs such as lexapro.

So if you can get addicted to something so weak then why not just use something like vicodin or even codeine? This way you are not in so much pain. oioids are not evil and people who think they are are ignorant.

It is terrible!!  The pain relief is not good and you are better off taking another type of drug like hydrocodone for pain.  I was on tramadol for one month because my doctor said it was non-addictive. It did not work so after a month I stopped and the withdrawls floored me.  Nausea, cold sweats flu-like symptoms for over a week  all from this medicine.  Others on these websites warned me of the terrible withdrawls and addictive nature but I didn't listen  PLEASE do not take this!!  My doctor still thinks it is a great drug (maybe she needs to try it and see for herself)  I wouldn't let my worst enemies go through what I just went through this past week.  It's not worth it-go with the opoids and also look up tramadol withdrawls before you get off of the drug.  Good luck.

I have extreme pain in the back of my neck and extremely sharp pains that shoot into my head. The pain has made me sick to my stomach. My doctor put me on Ultram the extended release. I first took it on a Monday evening, then Tuesday morning and Tuesday evening, going through the same for Wednesday and also Thursday morning. I started noticing the side effects Tuesday morning. I was incoherant, had a hard time driving, was forgetting everything and unable to remember whether I done certain things or the drive into work, etc. The pain was still in FULL force and so were the side effects. As of Thursday morning, it had been in my system for over 48 hours. I was unable to stand at work, I would sway and tip over. I had problems walking as I would lose my balance. I am having a harder time driving and now have given up driving for a while and not going into work for a few days. I an flushing this medication, for me, it was about worthless.

A family member I have has been in the medical community since 1979. She says when patients come into the hospitals or clinics for pain if a doctor even suspects &quot;addict&quot; they through up the T sign. You know one hand over the other hands fingers, like time-out. There are some docs who do not believe the experiences people are having because of this. Careful, your name gets put into a national database if the so called gods of medicine believe your not really in pain. I have seven hurniated discs, degenerative disc disease and arthritus of the spine. I have been dealing with this since 1990. I only see the doc when flare ups occur. I seek physical therapy, massage, and early on a chiropractor. I do not want to be on meds at all. But, when I am in pain, I want something that works. Surgery??? My new neuro-surgeon has three hurniated discs, and she won't even have surgery because of known complications. So were dammed if we do and dammed if we don't. Good Luck to all!!!

I have been on ultram the entire time.  I take 3 50 mg tabs 2X daily.  I am very dependant on it.  I lost my script on vacation and went though what can only be described as coming off heroin.  I had bad diareia, insomnia, and a huge seizure.  But I am so hooked on this I am to afraid to tell my Dr, because it could mean I have to go through that again.  Anyone who has even the chance of dependancy ahould stay away from this drug.  Otherwise, it's a life saver.  I wouldn't be working or married right now if it weren't for its pain relief.

Mostly I could put up with it, but when I overdid an activity,such as carpentry, or car repair, or such,then I would surely pay for it the next day.At times I found it difficult to even cleana dozen fish, and so I began limiting many of my favorite activites...  Last year, during my annual physical, my doctor made the suggestion that I might want to consider using Ultram ER on a trial basis.I, as per usual, declined with the same oldexcuse that I didn't want to get addicted tosomething, just so I could do things I used to do.  Well, my wife chimed in, stating that I was to the point of doing little or nothing anymore because so many things tended to make me hurt.  So, why not give a try for just one month, and see how it went.I finally agreed.  I filled the scrip for a months supply, and after about a week my sister happened to ask how I was feeling, not knowing I was on a new medication.  It was then that I realized that my hands had not hurt for a day or two...  WOW, was I ever surprised a the realization!!!  So, Ihave know been on ULTRAM ER for about 50 weeks, and I am doing many of the things I used to do, and suffer little, if any, fromthe activity, unless I totally overdo it.My friends even have noticed how much better I seem to be, and how much more I cando without complaining or bellyaching about the hurt.  It has been a real godsend to me. And I would suggest others who may notwant to get &quot;hooked&quot; try it - it's great!!!

Hardware was used to set the fracture, and when the hardware was removed, I did not want to go down the Vicodin train again. This medication has relieved the pain completely. Makes me a little dizzy and in a good mood. I can see how it could be addictive
Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	7/30/2009 12:01:50 PM	I noticed several concerns from other people taking this drug but for me it has been great.  I have suffered from chronic back pain for years and was taking motrin, tylenol, and hydrocodone.  Nothing seemed to relieve it totally.  Once I started taking Ultram it is completely gone plus I noticed a strange side effect of actually feeling more calm.  I used to get stressed and anxious often but since I have been taking this I don't feel that way at all.Noticed side effects: Sense of calmness, slight constipation, more difficult to urinate (requires a bit of concentration), takes longer to climax during sex (again requires more concentration).That is it for me and the side effects are worth the benefit.  Others report nightmares, insomnia, etc.  I have experienced none of this.  In fact I sleep better since taking this drug.One thing to note:  I do follow the instructions exactly and am not taking any other medication.  I take 4 50mg tablets a day and take it with food and plenty of water.Seems like the side effects that others are reporting come from stopping the drug suddenly or taking it with other medications.For me it works great!

It is has been great for relieving my arthritis pain - it &quot;frees&quot; me up basically.  It has not worked that well on my mirgrane pain.  The caffine in it gives me a little kick and I am able to get around easily, clean house and take care of my children.  About 4 hours after taking it, I do get drowsy but usually a small nap will take care of that.

The medication doesn't help pain, causes loss of appetite and sleeplessness and severe itching.

The withdrawls are worse than any withdrawl I have ever had. It is not worth it. I went from 6 pills to 3 and still can not get off this medication. I think it should be taken off the market. Plus I am in more pain from the pills than I was when I started taking them. So please do not take these pills the with drawls are horrible. I tried getting off them only after 2 months of taking them and I still have not been able to handle the pain from the withdrawls. The longest I have gone was 5 days and the symptoms were only getting worse.

Initially I was prescribed Ultracet (Tylenol and tramadol) and I tried Physical Therapy which aggravated the pain. Then I had acupuncture therapy for a year, which made me very relaxed, but I still was in pain. Now am on the max dose of Ultram (tramadol itself), and although it gets rid of the pain, I now have an extremely low tolerance to heat and humidity, and sweat profusely at night. Winter is okay but I've finally cannot cope with the sweating. Has anyone else had this side-effect to Ultracet/Ultram? Now I've been prescribed Vicodin - I'm wary of its reputation for addiction, but if I stop sweating and it helps with the pain...

Was switched over to Ultram 1 month ago. It is a terrific medication for my back pain. I feel it works better than Vicodin. I had a traditional back surgery with a 7 inch incision, so alot of muscles, nerves were cut.  If I didn't take the Ultram I could not function.  By the way, the surgery was successful for the condition I had prior to it being performed.I do however take ES Tylenol also for my pain.

This was a real disappointment, as I switched to Ultram from opiates, hoping to avoid dependence.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	6/18/2009 1:15:15 PM	I've had severe chronic pain for about a year now. I have OA, DDD, tendinitis, bursitis, and I suffer from depression and migraines. Fun! This drug should be pulled. I had a bad reaction from just one pill.I felt like my brain was firing off dynamite, yet so fatigued, I felt weak. I also had mental confusion.I'm on several drugs that are contradicted. I feel like the doctor is not treating my pain adequately. Why will they NOT treat my pain?? I'm not an addict, and I would never abuse something that would help for real. It is horrible. I was once given this for migraines when I first started getting them, but they didn't touch the pain whatsoever. I think it is the perfect &quot;cop out&quot; drug for docs that are so scared to presribe something that actually works. Easy for them. I pay the price.

This is the only med i am taking. My arm hurt so bad i could use it. Took two pills and felt great.I'm sitting at my computer humming. I wouldn't say i'm ecstatic. But i sure am in a good mood since taking this stuff. It tells my brain i feel no pain. The best part is that i feel in a good, positive happy state of mind. Absence of main helps my state of mind. I'm wondering about withdrawal. Although1 with arthiritis i'll probably take this stuff forever. If i don't have the side effects i wonder if i'll have the withdrawal problems. I'll go off it and see what happens. Only been on it for a week. But i haven't felt normal in over 30 years and i do now.

I had tried Vicodin but found it made me too loopy and switched to Tramadol instead.  The pain relief is amazing and I am able to work a full day without any issue.  It also helps suppress anxiety, but this is a side-effect of the medicine and not an original indication of its use.  The only complaint, albeit a small one, is that it can cause insomnia.  Not a heart-pounding, restless type of insomnia, but a &quot;very mentally alert&quot; type.  I have countered that effect by taking the medicine in the morning so that it does not interfere with sleep.  My dosage is 50mg as needed (usually 5-7 times a week).  Tramadol in conjunction with physical therapy is helping get my back healthy again.  Tramadol is a wonderful drug when used properly and I highly recommend it for those who suffer from recurring moderate to severe pain.
Pain	kbrigan, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1		45-54	6/1/2009 4:54:40 PM	I can testify that allergic reactions can happen with one use. I wound up in emergency a half hour after taking one tablet. (This, even though I've never had any trouble with codeine or morphine.) My tongue, throat, cheeks and lips swelled, and I briefly had trouble breathing. This passed quickly, thank God, but I'm glad I was checked out anyway. (I was put on antihistamines for a couple of days, just in case.) Might want to test this one only when other people are around...

It has been a miracle for me.  I am able to work like I used to when I was younger.  My attitude has improved thanks to the reduced pain stimulus going to my brain, I believe.  Am I addicted???  Maybe but if that is what it takes to be able to maintain this quality of life, I will be an addict!!!!  People think that i a chipper and always in a good mood because I am!!!!

It was very effective in treating the pain, and he told me it did not have dependency associated with it.  I found that after 18 mos. I body was dependent.  I was trying to stop taking it and went into complete physical withdrawl (sweats, irritability, nausea, cramping, aggitation).  I am now weaning myself off the drug 20-30% at a time, so I can continue to work and function.  It is not a drug I'd recommend to others without complete information about dependency, side effects, risks, and benefits.

Does NOT make me feel high like other pain meds.  I take lorcet only when needed for breakthrough pain.  Have low back pain, leg pain/aches &amp; arthritis.  50 mgs 2-3 times a day as needed.  I see that some of you feel it helps with depression.  I totally agree.  I haven't been diagnosed with depression but Ultram absolutely makes my moods better (maybe because no more pain).  I actually feel like things I haven't wanted to do in a long time.  Lorcets only last couple of hours and pain back.  Ultram lasts much longer.  At first it would keep me up at night, but not any more and I don't feel tired.

My doctor told me to take Ibuprofen as directed along with tramadol a few days a month. This medication has literally been a life-saver for me! The pain that I used to have during my period is gone and I am able to function well while taking it. Although I have constipation and trouble sleeping on tramadol, I am very satisfied with this drug. Some people may complain of addiction but I haven't experienced this at all. Also, Walmart has this drug on their list of $4 medications which works perfectly since I don't have health insurance. I definitely recommend it under the right circumstances- talk with your doctor about what works well for you.

However; I'm also on Zoloft and Cymbalta for major depression. When I aslo started taking ultram, it was like I didn't need the depression medicine anymore. But!! the flippin FDA will not approve tramadol for depression, when everyone know's it works. It makes your brain feel calm, happy and not overwhemling. I guess the amout of seritonen in this drugs helps with the BIG TIME BLUES!!

Neuropathic Pain	MS and Nerve pain, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/16/2009 2:34:55 PM	I have Multiple Sclerosis and have been taking Tramadol (Ultram)for four years. It helps with the pain in my back and legs. Over the years I have stopped taking it for a week or two (several times) with no withdrawal symptoms. Because of my chronic pain I always go back to this drug because it doesn't make me feel hung-over and helps me deal with the pain - without it I would be in bed all day.I would suggest to those who have had a bad reaction, as with any drug do not take more than the recommended dose AND check to see if you are taking other drugs not to be combined with Tramadol - there are a lot of them. Also, I once had a doctor tell me that MS doesn't cause chronic pain and took me off the medication. After weeks of suffering I requested the doctor help me and was told &quot;It's not like you have cancer, so you don't need pain medication&quot;.  I was shocked that this doctor from a VERY well know MS clinic had no compassion. Needless to say, after leaving the office in tears I scheduled an appointment with a new doctor who knew the fact that chronic pain is a common symptom of MS and wasn't &quot;afraid&quot; to treat his patients. The lesson here is - if you have a doctor that refuses to treat your pain, don't suffer like I did - find a new doctor ASAP.Cymbalta also helps with nerve pain.

Pain	Jade, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/12/2009 8:36:02 PM	Interesting medication. Love it! I started taking Ultram after knee surgery. I had very minimal side effects. Worked well for the pain, but I also noticed something else. You see, I have suffered with paralyzing anxiety/depression for the past 10 years. Panic attacks, insomnia, lethargy...all that good stuff. Well, when I started the Ultram I noticed something. I actually felt GOOD! Not just good, great! It elevated my mood and you know what? My anxiety is all but gone. I am able to hold a good job, and am actually able to enjoy my friends and family. I have a life again and I am so greatful for that. I no longer have much pain but continue taking this medication for the other effects, basically. No, not because it gets me &quot;high&quot; or anything, and i do not increase my dosage and stay well within the maxiumum daily dosage of 400mg. I just simply like feeling energized, upbeat and generally having a positive outlook again.

Vicodin/Percocet work great for pain but make it impossible to function. Been taking Ultram for 6 months and am very pleased with the results. At times I do have trouble urinating, it seems like I have to go real bad but have to 'push' real hard to get anything out. A stool softner twice a day has helped prevent constipation. This med on top of quarterly cortizone shots has made the pain manageable during the day. The key for me on this med is to take it 4-6 times a day consistently. When I miss a dose the pain creeps up really quickly and it makes it miserable until the medicine hits my system when I finally take it. Overall a very good choice to deal with constant, nagging pain.

Pain	Tramadol Dependence Happens, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Male	25-34	2/15/2009 8:40:21 PM	After 3 weeks of Vicodin 6x/day following a rock-climbing fall, I was switched to tramadol and cyclobenzaprine(1st 2 wks).  Initially the transition was disorienting and with some pain ressurgence, but after slowly increasing the tramadol dosage to 250mg/day it sufficiently managed the pain.  Unfortunately the side effect of insomnia slowly became quite bothersome.  After a month on tramadol an additional medication was given to combat the insomnia, Ambien. Since attempts to reduce the tramadol dosage resulted in resurfacing pain after a week of ambien was switched from tramadol back to Vicodin.  I was completely taken by surprise when I experienced serious withdrawal from the tramadol.  The physical dependence that occured on tramadol was quite surprising, as no dependence to vicodin was ever noticed.

It does have withdraw effects such as problems sleeping, blurred or shaky vision, shakiness, irritability, etc. I started used using this to get off narcotics such as oxycontin and loratabs. It can be used to trick the mind like a placebo.

The dr first prescribed me percocet 10 mg , went back a month later and was put on ultrams. Ultrams are a joke, they dont take away the pain they just make you so sick and dizzy that its hard to think about it. I would suggest anyone on them to get off them as soon as possible, because they can give you long term problems. I just lay around in pain because i stopped taking them and the dr would not give me anything else.
Other	TiaMaria, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/5/2009 8:01:46 PM	Tramadol does have addiction potential (about as much as codeine) like any painkiller.  As long as you're aware of this before taking, you should be fine.  It does tend to make people jittery or nervous, and jaw-clenching is common.  It can also cause itching, which can be relieved by taking an antihistamine - but this combination almost certainly will cause drowsiness so be VERY careful if driving, operating machinery, etc.  This combo can be helpful if there's difficulty sleeping.  Tramadol stays in the system for a long time, so follow dosing instructions carefully.
Other	Annie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	2/5/2009 1:05:57 AM	I was given this drug for chronic kidney stones and kidney/ureter pain and took for approx. 3 months.  It took some getting used to but was effective for pain control in my case.  It was unfortunate however that it ended up being a horror drug for me due to its extreme addictiveness.  I was searching for an alternative from Lortab when prescribed this.  Once I noticed that my hands would shake, upset stomach and the general heeby-jeebies before each dose was due I worked on weaning myself off.  I dealt with 4-5 weeks of upset stomach, violent tremors, tightness in my chest and really feeling like I had an intense flu.  My body ached.  It was a nightmare.  I literally ended up shaving my pills down for the weaning process.  After discussing with 3 of my Dr.'s they assured me that this was not an &quot;addictive medication.&quot;  Unbelievable.  I could see a law suit in the future for the makers of this drug.  I am fortunate however that I did not suffer a seizure like the other posters I have read.  I urge any users to be very, very careful using this drug.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	1/31/2009 1:17:29 PM	I had a severe ear infection (inner and outer) and my canal was so swollen that my PA couldn't tell if my drum was perforated or not, so she prescribed an oral pain reliever instead of drops. My first dose was 100mg, taken at 8PM. I felt &quot;loopy&quot; and somewhat giddy, but my pain was gone. That night I slept through the night until 4AM when my pain woke me up. I took 50mg this time because I knew I had to try to go to work in a few hours, and when the time came to leave, I wasn't totally free of pain, but was certainly in control of myself. Later that morning I took 50 mg while at work and proceeded to feel dizzy all day long, but was mostly pain free.I am currently taking approx. 50 mg every 6-8 hours, whenever I notice the pain. I don't feel &quot;loopy&quot; and only slightly dizzy.

I had to cut the does in half because I could not stand without passing out. Hydrocodoion and other pain medicines never made me feel this way. Untram only takes the &quot;kick&quot; out of the pain. Enough where I can do what I need to do through out the day. But when it starts to wear off it feels like I have a really bad high. I like Vicodin A LOT better.

My Dr. prescribed it to me for a year and I became extremely addicted.  I then had a seizure. I just stopped taking it and am hoping the withdrawal won't kill me. Especially after reading about all of the withdrawal symptoms associated with this horrible drug. I suggest that anyone prescribed this drug rip up the prescription immediately and find an alternative remedy!

Anyway, now I have a swollen second toe on my right foot and I saw a different Dr. who took blood tests and is determining I am at the beginning stages of having RA (me? I'm only 41!!). But anyway, my foot is very painful to step on so she has written me a prescription for Ultram ER. I have read the reviews on it here and I am scared to take it now! I've had no trouble with Tramadol, I take up to 6 50mg pills a day. For some bizarre reason they give me energy and make me very talkative, sometimes I get itchy a little but nothing uncontrollable. I wish someone could tell me if Ultram ER and tramadol are the same thing except ER is an all day pill?

Have taken Tramadol off and on for several yrs. Takes the edge off of the pain, very little buzz (unlike hydrocodone). Better than nothing, with little addiction effects, BUT side effects are: trouble urinating (feels like an enlarged prostate), severe genital pain upon climaxing (again, I think it is prostate related), and I am less erect. Also causes decreased sensation during sex which prolongs the act. At first I thought this was a wonderful side effect, but the climax pain is now so bad that it is no longer enjoyable. Also causes sleeplessness. Withdrawal symptoms are a pain too....feel like I have the flu and it causes sinus drainage which causes me to cough all night.

For the most part it does alleviate or eliminate the pain within 30 minutes, although it does not seem to be effective in cases of extreme migraine pain regardless of the dosage.  One side effect, which I do not mind, is weight loss.  I've actually lost nearly 30 pounds in one year after using Tramadol.  While it's true that I have been dieting, I think Tramadol somehow eliminates hunger pains.  It also causes mild dry mouth and mild constipation, which I was able to eliminate with a spoonful of Milk of Magnesia a day.  Overall I rate it as equal or better than several other preventive treatments I have been prescribed and it doesn't seem to have any major side effects such as drowsiness, itching, etc which I have had with other painkillers.

I am very pleased with it.  However, it seems that when I miss a dose I am experiencing withdrawl symptoms.  I thought that since this was a non-narcotic drug that this wouldn't happen.  I am not too happy that I was not informed of this prior to starting this medication since I wanted to stop the percocet for that very reason.

I have taken this medication before &amp; it made me crazy.  I kept hallucinating.  I dreamt that my cat was underneath the carpet and when I woke up I kept asking my husband how he got the cat out.  I thought it was real.  My Pain Management Dr. prescribed it for me again this week and I feel like a zombie all the time.  Not only do I get the weird side effects, but there's no relief in my pain whatsoever.  It's pointless to take, but since I've had 3 doctors tell me there's nothing they can do for me, I figured I'd give it a try.  But I guess I'll just be living in pain for the rest of my life.  It's bad because I'm only 25 years old.

If you don't have to take this medicine don't or at least find out the withdrawl symptoms before you start.

First couple of days, I was thrilled with the results!  After that I began noticing dizziness and lightheadedness all day (taking 50mg every 4 hours for chronic knee arthritis pain), just yesterday I began feeling sick to my stomach as well.  Didn't take any meds for the last 24 hours and feel that those side effects have nearly gone away.

I have decided that I don't need this aid anymore and quit taking the one tablet.  I learned that I must be addicted to this small milligram amount as after about 2 hours sleep I begin aching...twitching and just restless all over.  Any suggestions as to how I can get over this?...Maybe with time?...I was just taking such a small dose I had no idea I would get &quot;hooked&quot;....Thank You

For the most part it works fine, provided I take it before the pain gets too bad. It doesn't work well enough at night though, so i have to take a stronger medication at that time.

It barely takes the edge off the pain.  Just enough for me to get out of bed... The one warning I would like to give is that this drug is HIGHLY addictive!  I was to the point where I was taking entirely too much trying to deal with my pain.  I discussed this issue with my doctor and we have slowly been weaning me down.  I now take 4 50mg tablets a day.  Does absolutely nothing to control my pain but I am so horribly addicted to it.  If I don't take it exactly every 6 hours I begin to have withdrawl symptoms (GI upset, sleeplessness, &quot;crawly&quot; skin, and total irate behavior).  We hope to wean me down to no Tramadol within the next few months.  I really don't want to have to go into detox for this!  If I had known then what I know now... Don't take this drug for any extended period of time-trust me!

I do have side effects but they are much more bearable than the constant pain from my Myofascial Pain Syndrome.  I could not get by woth out this medication. I have run out several times and even quit cold turkey.  There is a withdral period but it is not any worse than any other medication I have taken. This medication enables me to take care of my wife and 2 little girls 2 years and 12 months.  
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/25/2008 1:02:23 PM	Im 32 yrs old and I have been diagonosed with a degenerative disc disease. I have had 3 MRI's and their findings are (Spinal Stenosis, Spondylolisthesis, and Osteoarthritis) Im in alot of pain most of the time.  I have 2 children (ages 4 and 12).  When I had my 1st MRI the doctors were puzzled as the age on the results said 32 but they said it looked like a 60 yr old persons results, so they did a 2nd one and then a 3rd to confirm.  I have been taking Ultram for 4 months now and it has made a huge change in my life.  Before I started to take it I would just deal with the pain.  I could barley walk, bend, stretch, there was no way I could run and play with my kids.  Now I can do pretty much anything.  I have noticed that if I stop taking it, Im extremly tired, almost to the point that I cant get out of bed.  Its really strange and if I dont take it before I go to sleep not only do I wake up in great pain, I dont sleep very well, I toss and turn most of the night.  Overall Im extremely happy with the medicine as I hate to take pills period.  It just got to the point that I no longer could stand the pain and I felt I didnt have a choice.  Now some days I can take only 1 pill and some days I need more. Am I addicted, probably but now being able to do things with my children, take them to the park, be apart of their lives again, i wouldnt change it for anything.

I have a long history of back pain and severe migraine headaches.  At one point in my life(38),I was taking almost 15 Lorcet a day w/Xanax as well.  Obviously I couldn't go on that way.  I checked myself into rehab and got off the Vicodin and now am taking the Ultram ER, I know it can be a dependant drug, in order for me to get relief I have to take at least 4 a day.  My Dr. is aware of this and although he didnt agree at first, he now agree's its better than taking all that Vicodin.  Yeah, it doesn't work the best all the time, and sometimes the pain comes right threw the meds and the price is CRAZY..but I'm getting along ok..I hope its helping others in this fashion...get off the &quot;opiates&quot; for those who 'CAN', I know there are people who CAN NOT get off the opiates because of their pain.  My mom was that way and now my Dad is because he's 70 and has chronic severe back pain w/Arthritis...&quot;Good Luck &amp; God Bless&quot;!

Still take 50 mg twice a day - 3 times a day on golf days.  I'm 62 and intend to enjoy a good quality of life, with as little pain as possible.  Addictive?  Probably. Apparently more so for some folks than others - I prefer two tablets of Tramadol per day than a six tablet dose of Advil as do some of my friends - so does my physician.

I had been taking Topamax for the past 3 years to control my migraines along with either fioricet and darvocet when a migraine occured.He also switched me off of Topamax and onto Keppra. When I do get a headache and take the Ultram, it makes my head hurt worse!!!  I have gone back to only taking darvocet when i get a headache, it takes the edge off but the headache does not go away...I wll not take the Ultram ever again. The Topamax with all of its side effects works better for me to control the migraines adn hope to go back to it soon! Plz forgive my typo's as I am having issues since chaging Rx's.

I have been takeing this drug for about a year now for chronic back pain.  At first it worked great relived the pain, and even seemed to energize me.  After a few months I seemed to need more and more to help with the pain, so I figured I was becoming dependant on it.  I tried to stop takeing cold turkey.  What a mistake.  Horriable withdrawl.  Anxious, Nervousness, short temper, restlessness, the works.  This drug should only be taken in small doses, for short periods of time.  It is as habit forming as any opiate out there.  after many years of reserching pain relif I truly believe there are no quick fixes, and medication can only become another crutch.  Please try other alternitives. Chiropractic, PT, Massage, herbs, etc.

It has helped me resume a normal life with much less pain.  I ran out of the drug this month because I didn't get the perscription refilled on-time as usual...and after not taking it for 2 days I'm a mess.  I can't sleep at night and have that skin crawling feeling, and feel light headed/unsteady on my feet.  Even though I think its very effective for relieving pain, these feelings of withdrawal have me considering not taking this drug any more.

Pain	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	45-54	7/24/2008 6:01:30 PM	I have taken Ultram for tension headaches and arthritis of the knees. I can say it is slightly effective, but not something I would want to depend on to take care of moderate or worse pain. I take Lortab for pain, but I take a break from it periodically to keep from getting dependent on it, and to give my body a rest from the constant acetaminophen intake. During this time I take Ultram 200 mg. for pain, and have found it better than nothing, but not a great option for me. It does seem to interact with my Xanax, making me feel a little more relaxed, but I haven't noticed any other side effects, and certainly no craving, dependence, or withdrawal symptoms. I am glad to read that it helps other people, though.

Pain	Noneofyourbusiness, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	7/16/2008 2:25:30 PM	Well the doctor had me on a long run with Darvocet Oxycodone and other similar narcotic painkillers; they were given to me in small doses for my addiction to Morphine.I guess the idea was to ween me off the Morphine through small amounts of pretty much the same chemicals.After a couple years, I was experiencing the same withdrawal symptoms that I started off with; and I knew I was getting too old for this. He put me on Ultram about 4 years ago, and I havent looked back since.  Adding a small amount of alcohol when you take your meds really add to the effects, BUT I IN NO WAY CONDONE DOING THAT.What works well for some could hurt others, possibly fatally.

I was concerned about the narcotic use. Ultram works better than Vicodin for me and I don't have to worry about the narcotic effect.
Other	Sandythemoma, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/9/2008 4:15:06 PM	I have been suffering from fibromyalgia for 5 years and they have been years from hell.  I also am dealing with premature menopause.  I started self medicating with alcohol and almost killed myself (a car accident), then after recovering from that addiction I got caught up with Lortab.  Physiologically I kept wanting more.  I have odd reactions to drugs.  Antidrepressents depress me, sleeping pills keep me awake. Normally, pain pills do not work for me.  I asked my physician if I should try Ultram and it has completely changed my life.  I am sleeping all night (I hadn't slept for more than an hour at a time for years and had severe restless legs), I have much more energy again instead of feeling like I was dragging concrete blocks around everywhere I went, my frame of mind (which before the fibro was optomistic and upbeat) is almost back to normal rather than the depression I had been experiencing.  My brain fog has lifted.  Everyone is different and has different reactions to drugs so anyone starting a new drug should be extremely cautious but even though Ultram could be addictive, it's better than alcohol and it has made me feel like a worthwhile person again instead of a waste of space.  I also recommend Mona View (a dietary supplement) as an aid to boost the immune system. I hope that this helps others with FIBRO, but do please be careful when starting it or any new medication.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	7/9/2008 3:56:11 PM	I have a problem getting up in the morning with knee pain.  I have to crawl down the stairs in the morning.  I take Ultram first thing and it last all day.  I would love it but I get a headache late in the day.  It makes me feel asthough my head will explode.
Pain	motherof3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/8/2008 3:14:25 PM	I have been using Ultram for about 6 months now, and I love it.  I am a mother of 3 small children, and can barely walk due to knee pain some days.  I do not like keeping narcotics in the home, and this is something my mother recommended.  It works for my pain, and gives me energy, as well.  I do have unusual dreams, but not nightmares, and that is minor compared to the pain I have some days.  I love this medication, and hope it helps others as it has helped me.
Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	6/24/2008 10:25:36 PM	THIS MEDICATION IS DANGEROUS!!  Explanation in a minute.  I was prescribed tramadol for bad discs in my back.  I took up to 100 mg every 4 hrs with no relief in the back pain.  I did get very sleepy after taking it though. I have had to go through detox and rehab for opiates.  While in detox I found out that tramadol is opiate based and that it is VERY addictive, even though it is not marketed or prescribes as a &quot;narcotic&quot; pain reliever.  It was the start to my downhill road.  My wife had also been prescribed tramadol for pain and after only 3 doses had severe side effects including hypotension, nervousness, weakness and nausia.  She said she felt like she was dieing.  Be VERY carefull if you decide to take this medicine.

Ultram XR 300mg works better than the Vicodin/Soma regimen I was on for a year before this. A lot of other people with EDS from my support group prefer Ultram XR also.
Other	 on Treatment for less than 1 month	2	1	1			6/10/2008 4:09:54 AM	Horrible. Took only 2 in 48hr. Have been been so sleeping,feeling like I am in another zone. Have been throwing up constantly. All this for UTI pain. I would taken back the pain to avoid this anytime. 
Other	tramadol is the worst, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/2/2008 4:40:29 PM	This drug is evil!!!!!! please be careful if you are on it. I had a bad cramps and was prescribed the 50mg tabs for them, then i hurt my foot and had to take it everyday. At first i was taking 50- 100mg a day, then I was taking up to 200 mg a day. I was scared to get hooked because i felt the want for more in me starting to happen. I slowly started to take less and combine it with motrin. Dont get me wrong, it was great at first. Then after about 9 months on it, I got VERTIGO, i thought I was going to die, lasted for about 24 hours after taking 100mg. After that, I began to get vision problems, dizzy, felt like I was going to pass out. I didnt even think it was the tramadol because i had been on it for so long without problems. I got nervous, felt like i wanted to crawl out of my skin, headaches. I thought i was going crazy, but then i read about side effects of tramadol. I had so many of them, i couldnt even beleive it. I was shocked, they came so abruptly and without warning. I had trouble sleeping, and i was scare to drive, i have a little girl and was so afraid i would injure us. I then started to ween myself off immediately after reading the side effects. I was only taking 50mg/day or less, but i still had horrible withdrawal symptoms. I just completely stopped after taking 25mg and nearly passing out in school. It is such a scary drug, i have never ever felt so terrible in my whole life. This drug can do some serios harm, mentally, physically, and emotionally. I would  rather take narcotics and not have to worry about possibel seizures, they are so much safer and proven. Tramadol needs so much more research and dr.s prescrib eit without knowing the full effects, possibly putting your life in danger. I had no idea this all could happen to me, even after taking such a small dose, but over a year later, i am so glad to be off it and i am just goinbg to take motrin and try acupuncture with meditation, tramadol made me never want to take another &quot;popular&quot; med.

IE: they make me &quot;goofy&quot;.  With the 4 bulging disc's I have in my back, Tramadol is the ONLY drug that doesn't make me stupid, impair my thought process and WORKS!  I usually use it for the first week or so after my epidural shot wears off and I can get in for another, and then for the first week or so until the next shot takes full effect.  I love this med.  Without it standing, sitting and laying down in certain positions would be impossible.

Pain	nomadbychoice, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	5/8/2008 1:06:28 AM	I took this medication as prescribed in addition to Relpax for my migraines because the Relpax alone was enough to ease the pain (great med for all the other migraine symptoms).  It was a huge relief!  Until I started to get itchy all over. As directed I continued the dosage, and 2 days later my arms and upper torso were covered in an inchy red rash that lasted 5 days after my last dose!!  Check that as #5 on the pain med list I'm allergic to!  It is really dissapointing because I was very  happy with the pain reliuf it provided. :(
Pain		5	5	4			5/8/2008 12:55:13 AM	I've been taking Tramdol off and on since November for two herniated disc in my lower back. I like this medication because its effective without having to take narcotics. However, it knocks me out. I sleep well on it. I have to take a stool softner daily to prevent constipation and at times it leaves a little &quot;cross eyed&quot;  Most meds do me that way as I have a very low tolerence to pills. I'm happy with the results and sleep is a wonderful thing when your in pain..

My doctor gave me ultram and it worked. Not only did it work on my shoulder, it worked on my knee, back and foot. No more pain. I have a spring in my step when I walk now. I sleep good at night, I feel good and I haven't felt good in a long time.
Pain	Eia Mazri, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	4/11/2008 12:55:00 PM	I have been taking Tremadol for approximately 5 months and the medication seemed to be fine until I stopped it suddenly, just to gage my true pain level, that evening I could not get off the couch, no energy. Over night I had cold sweats and could not sleep. I laid in bed for 11 1/2 hours and when I finally got up I had flu like symptoms (fever, stiffness, fatuge). I do not like the idea of not being able to stop a drug when I feel I may not need it of to, like I stated, gage my true level of pain over a 24 hour period. 
Pain	edmanbohem, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	4/10/2008 11:58:06 AM	I was given this medication for severe headaches. It worked okay on my headaches, however I noticed while taking this drug that my knees and feet no longer hurt.  I have had a dull pain in my knees and feet for about 2 years.  I never mentioned it to the doctor cause I thought it was just from getting old.  Plus, I thought the only thing you could take would be either a NSAID or narcotic, and I didn't want to do that.  NSAID's irritate my stomach and I work long hours so a narcotic wouldn't be a good solution either since they my me sleepy.  Ultram has relieved my pain and if anything it gives me a little boost of energy.  Going to talk to my doctor next week about starting Ultram on a regular basis.  
Pain	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	4/8/2008 3:12:18 PM	Use for back, neck and jaw pain. Works relatively well, but a bit slow to react. Have had more than the occasional headache as a side effect, however.

Its either hard to fall asleep or impossible.  Also, it only decreases the pain in my back by maybe 10 percent.  I have two herniated discs so that may be why, but someone needs to tell patients that this drug may keep them up at night.

Although Ultram is high effective for some people it should not be used for a long period of time.

Neuropathic Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	25-34	3/29/2008 7:15:37 PM	Ultram was prescribed for pain. After taking this medication for a few years, it caused severe dependence and 2 grand mal seizures (I am not epileptic). For some it works, but if you begin to see signs of dependence, notify your doctor immediately and begin tapering off, as you will experience physical withdrawal symptoms that will last for about a week (sometimes more).

I had a codeine reaction when I was around twenty and it was bad, but this was so bad I thought I was going to die and then was afraid I would not.  I could not move, was nausiated, no control of my body could not speak.  I can not describe fully how bad it was and maybe no one would believe me anyway, but have to warn someone that it can be bad and not to take the time release version in case of a reaction because it lasts too long.Thanks for letting me give my review.
Pain	Steve, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	3/20/2008 8:35:37 AM	This medication was the most nightmarish thing I've ever taken. I have mixed anxiety and depression and after 2 doses of Ultram, not only did I experience NO pain relief but the symptoms of my anxiety increased to an unbearable level.I was almost to the point of going to the ER as I had no idea what was happening until a friend related a similar experience on Ultram. Needless to say I stopped taking it and while my Dr was puzzled by the reaction I began to feel some relief after stopping the meds.

I usually don't get much relief with the prescribed amount. A couple of times I've taken a little more &amp; that seems to help more. Probably not a good idea though. I've tried several times the usual dosage &amp; time inbetween but no help and my Dr. doesn't want to prescribe narcotics to me cuz of my being an alcoholic in recovery (18 yrs.). I'm desperate for relief.
Pain	darcynurse, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/16/2008 6:10:01 PM	I was in a car accident and had 7 surgeries to rebuild my leg, thus developing severe arthritis. I am a nurse and can't take narcotics, and can't work when pain gets severe. With Ultram, I find that I can function without getting groggy and dopey like vicodin made me. I do find that I talk quite a bit more with Ultram in my system and my nose gets cold?!? I have cut myself back from 400mg a day to 300mg a day and I do take Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen throughout the day too. I wish that there was something more effective for my pain though. I can't take ER pills because of weight loss surgery (gastic bypass patients don't absorb extended release pills), so I do rely on dosing throughout the day. Being a nurse, sometimes I get really busy and don't get the dose in right as the pain starts, then I am playing catch up, but for the most part, I have been very successful and happy with Ultram.

It helps for everyday aches and I don't feel like I'm in a fog.  I can function.  My doctor says tramadol is very good for bone pain so maybe that is why this works best for back pain sufferers like myself.  I have stronger medication for severe pain but I don't have to take that now unless I completely lock up.  Thank goodness for this.  I'd also suggest an inversion table for those suffering from chronic lower back pain.  A lot of time this helps better than any pain meds and it's cheaper(and more convenient) than a chiropractor over the long term.

I advise against Ultram at all costs.

The Vicodin as with the Ultram is now losing its effect and I am having a discogram next week to determine if surgery is the next step,
Neuropathic Pain	lucee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	2/19/2008 9:14:57 PM	I have been taking Ultram , around 200mg per day for a few years, first for chronic pain caused my piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve. I was diagnosed withe RSD after suffering a severe ankle break, all three ankle bones and complete dislocation. I need pain control without the &quot;narcotic&quot; side effects, nodding, scratching, etc. Ultram has helpled take the edge off the pain and allows me to function at work, remain alert etc.I did stop taking it to see if I really needed it and was surprised when I started having symptoms of withdrawal, you know the OH MY GOD I AM ADDICTED thing. I am fortunate to work in a hospital and when I expressed my concern re: addiction one of the drs. told me I was not an addict or addicted if I used the drug properly, he reminded me that you would not take Insulin away from a diabetic and I needed to look at my use of Ultram in those terms, I need pain control to function on a day to day basis like a diabetic needs insulin for their body to function properly. That helped me a great deal.I also have accupuncture with electrical stimulation on my ankle to help with the pain.. It really works and I would suggest that people give it a chance.

I will not finish the sample packet, since I started out on 100mg and after 4 days increase to 200mg. Don't know whats worse the pain or the side affects!

It took care of knee pain the first 2 days. The first day it even fixed a headache.  After the third day, it did take the edge off but I still had stiffness and bruising type feeling on the knee.  When off of the medicine, the pain was severe and sharp.  Overall, it did work to help through the everyday but 3 flights up and down a few times a day isn't any  match for this medicine.

After 6 months of this drug, w/ increasing dosages to max dose, I suffered 3 Grand mal seizures at disneyland.  I will never touch this medication again, beware of seizures.  Made me feel very hyper, spacey, friends noticed I looked different while on this med.  I havent drank in years and never had seizures before.  I have been on seizure meds since and 3 neurologists felt it was the tradamol that caused my seizures.  My small children, husband and friend were terrified by my seizures.  My mom and husband had to become full-time caregivers for 2 1/2 months after those seizures.  I was bedridden and could not work.  Did work well on pain, but seizures are terrifying.  use with extreme caution.

I took 2 50mg tablets and had a bad headache and felt like I was tripping. My Doctor said it would be safer than vicodin....but I have had vicodin before and it was way more effective for pain and well being. Though I admit sometimes vicodin would make my stomach upset....it is way better than a headache and a truly &quot;weird&quot; feeling

Within 12 hours I had a severe migraine headache with vomiting.  My eyes looked swollen.  This medication can cause intracranial pressure, which in my case lead to a severe migraine.  I tried this medication several months later for a similar problem and the same results occurred a Migraine Headache.  I won't take this medication again.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/22/2008 10:30:04 PM	I have been tking Ultram at different doses for almost five years now due to unexplained nerve pain in my foot. I also suffer from  herniated disk resulting in sciatica. This drug allows me to sleep pain free. Sometimes it does keep me up at night, but at least I can read and don't feel like I want to bang my head through the wall like before!! Four years ago doctors told me this drug was NOT a narcotic. Now they say it is. I say, whatever, just know that it is effectively relieving my foot pain, and helps relieve back and sciatic pain as well. For anyone who has found this drug does not work- I have found it works best for me when combined with naproxen or ibuprofin. Alone, it only gets rid of the electric shock feeling in my left foot. I hope this info helps someone else who is trying this drug. Ask your doc or pharmacist about what would be best to try. Ultram has given me my life back. No problem cutting back on doses when the pain is not severe, and I suspect I could go off without too much trouble IF the pain was managed some other way, or better yet, GONE. Doc keeps telling me I need sleep to get better, and I finally changed from retail to a m-f 9-5'er, so I'm anxious to see how the regular schedule affects the pain.Good luck, and know I empathize with any other chronic pain folks out there!!

It has worked great for him but has been a nightmare for me. It has caused him to totally loose his sex drive. But seems to be the only medicine that has helped his pain. He is afraid to try something new in fear of the pain returning. So I can say It has been a nightmare for me.

Since it is a synthetic opiate you can develop a severe psychological dependence! I've been taking this medication once daily, sometimes twice, and I can't think about going a day without. Its no longer helping as much with my back pain and I dare not up the dose for fear of greater dependence. Its almost as if I get a very subtle up high on it. Initially the medication was a godsend for the back pain I had when I was caught in a structure fire and had to make a ladder bail. I would be very interested in speaking with anyone who has had a similar experience.

Pain	CNixon, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	12/29/2007 12:33:52 PM	I began using Ultram for pain associated with fibromyalgia. I am a 40-year-old male who works out regularly, but still experiences achy and uncomforatble sensations. Ultram makes my mood better and increases my energy and motivation. Most importantly, it allows me to sit for hours and read or grade papers without feeling miserable. I switched from 200 mg a day to 100 because the higher dose gave me headaches and made me edgy; I am now detoxing and hope the 100 mg works more effectively. The detoxing is not pleasant: lethargy, headaches, chills/hot flashes, etc. are common. I also take Mobic, and the combination for my fibromyalgia has made life bearable.

Have been taking 50mg 3 to 6x/day of Ultram for 14 months as I've been going through treatments and physical therapy. I've been able to conduct my normal life due to this medication. I do hope to be painfree without medication someday but until then I am happy there is pain relief with only a small chance of addiction. The effect on mental state is similar but not as strong as vicodin but is almost as strong when it comes to controlling pain.Previous Dr. was concerned about drug control but now with a Managed Pain care Dr. and she has no problems helping me control my pain with this medication.

I took it for 4 days, taking the max dose every day, and did not have any &quot;out of body experience&quot;, seizures, hallucinations, etc... I was able to go about my regular activities during the time I was on it, because it didn't make me sleepy at all.

I had taken everything trying to get through the pain.  It was constant.  Took naprosyn and no help.  Was prescribed Ultram 3 x daily and it took the swelling down and gave me more movement of my arm it also took away the trobbing constant pain in the arm that I alway felt was muscle related.  After reexamination by the Dr. he said that it was definately inflamation if the med brought down the swelling and took care of the pain.  The only complaint I have about the ultram is it makes me dizzy.

Pharmacist told me to take the max of 400 milligrams a day...I still do less, but now it doesn't work at all, and now my body is suffering side affects for being on this medication so long. The Doctor won't prescribe me anything stronger for the pain for fear of addiction. But, they have now made my body &quot;addicted&quot; to Ultram. I take it very little as possible, just to relive the side affects and wean myself off this stuff.

I have found to get full effectiveness of the drug is to take with 8 oz. of water.  This pain medication for me will last for 12 hours. It may take a little longer to get the full effectiveness of relief but for me it really works good.  Remember it is a full glass of water.

As far as concious pain relief, it does little for me.  It does however let me sleep through the night.Prescribed to me at 50mg per dose.

When I woke up this morning my vision is seriously blurred. I was told I can keep taking it, that this is not uncommon. I work in front of a computer all day so that is unacceptable. I will not be taking this medication again. Not to mention it didn't help my pain at all.

Neuropathic Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	10/25/2007 2:23:09 PM	Ultram has alleviated my pain for 3 years now.  However, I question how much of my pain is real at this point and how much is rebound pain because I am struggling to get off this med.  I take the full dose -- 100 mgs. four times daily and know it is addictive.  I am struggling within 3 hours after dosing and need more.  I find now that I am exhausted right before I take each dose and once I take it there is a surge of energy for a brief while.  This is prevalent in addiction.

I just know that Ultram will help me. But this is the only reason I use Ultram (actually I used the generic version-I don't see the difference-except in price). I don't use this for acute pain AT ALL.

Knock me out for a few hours and then I was wired and could not sleep. In the morning when I got up I was very dizzy, sweating and sick to my stomach.  Vomited a few times and then slept almost 20 hours. This is 2 days later, still sick to my stomach and dizzy.Not worth it to me.
Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/23/2007 10:30:57 AM	I have a disc disease and osteoarthritis.  I was taking Naproxen for years and it wasn't helping.  The doctors proscribed me Ultram and Lodine.  At first, I had problems with the Ultram - dizziness, sick to my stomach.  I found that taking the Lodine at the same time as the Ultram alievated those problems and together they took my pain away.  There are days when the pain gets so bad that I don't feel like moving, but since I have started taking these two medications, I feel much better.  I have been taking these two medications for almost 3 years.

Then I fainted one day and went into a seizure. Had no notice what so ever. It just happened, went to the ER, they couldn't figure out anything. Then it happened again, and again. I realized it was the tramadol. I have ever other people experiencing this also. So, be careful, because I couldn've been driving when that happened. Very scary, because someone did, and now she's disabled and he children were with her, luckily their o.k.

I was unable to use other dugs to help control the pain. I experienced no overt side effects with the exception of some mild constipation which was easily controlled with the use of a mild laxative.

If I take only 1 of either pills, I get very little relief.  Taking both together makes my days more managable and I'm still able to continue working until the surgery.

It mutes the pain levels down to a point where you can concentrate on daily activities without feeling &quot;drugged&quot;....There are two very important points to this medication that cannot be ignored without side effects.Overdosage:  From all the blogs I've found, overdosage often results in sleeplessness.  Headaches and stomach cramps are also widely reported.Abruptly ceasing use:   If you take a moderate to high dosage of Ultram each day (5 to 8 tablets), then abrubtly stopping Ultram results in some fairly severe withdrawal symptoms...particular at the 36 to 48 hour mark after your last dose.In my particular case, I lost my prescription and went a weekend without it which resulted in some of the most horrible overnight symptoms I've ever experienced.Restless leg syndrome and/or acute insomnia seem to be the primary complaints.  The symptoms persist on and on and do not let up, no matter how tired you become.  You cannot sleep - and when you do manage to doze off for 15 minutes, you wake up with RLS/Insomnia in a sweat.  Headache and acute dizziness are also complaints associated with Ultram withdrawals.  Exaggerated pain as well.   It all adds up to a strong desire to do whatever a person has to do to relieve the insomnia and just sleep - especially when this cycle drags on for a number of days. Step down dosage over a long period of time i.e. a month.  Depression is also a widely complained about symptom - even for those who dose down slowely.  Make absolutely sure a doctor knows what you are doing and can help treat the symptoms.  You may very well need the help.
