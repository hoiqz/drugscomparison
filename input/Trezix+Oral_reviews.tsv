Although I am not allergic to any medicences, the caffiene kept me awake for 3 hours, no rest and therefore irritable. Irritibility is one of the warnings, also don't take with swelling which is exactly what is causing the pain. Taking if with food, but at lunch, had banana, choc chip cookies, two diet cokes because they tasted good and then this pill with lots of caffiene, I got very dizzy, but of course, could not rest as I was wired. Finally crashed. My wife came in from shopping, asked about the ceiling fan, and if I were feeling better, I would have probably ripped it out of the ceiling.

Pain	stylist74, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/8/2008 8:54:29 AM	I had extensive dental work done. We were unable to find me a pain medication without me getting tired or &quot;high&quot; before the dentist prescribed Trezix. This product is amazing! I was able to work (I'm a hairstylist) for 9-10 hours on my feet all day, and not 1 co-worker or client could tell I was on a &quot;narcotic&quot; pain medicine. If you like having that &quot;high&quot; feeling, you wont like this medicine. Prior to this I had tried Lortab (first 7.5mg.then 5mg.), tramadol, celebrex and the muscle relaxer Flexeril. Trezix worked way better for true pain control, relief and ability to function.
