I take it in conjunction with Diltiazem. I have been on both for several years. Cause / effect? I don't yet know.

Other	Muhamad, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	6/30/2010 11:55:44 AM	I was diagnosed with Menier's disease about a year ago. I'm a PhD candidate and had a lot of stress. After six months of  taking this medicine (once a day) it often caused me very painful muscle cramps, almost daily. My doctor encouraged me to eat banana, drink more water, avoid caffeine (especially coffee), and to drink a little of Tonic Water for muscle cramps. My doctor advised me to take it every other day and it works for me. My medicine is Triameterine 37.5 mg green tablets.
High Blood Pressure	Lovely1, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	65-74	3/11/2010 7:15:48 PM	It was only when I reduced the stress in my life, included grapefruit and bananas did this medication make any significant positive changes for me.  It kept me tired, blurry-eyed, painful ankles and feet even after lowering my BP. Skin rashes too.  I am tapering off it.  Magnesium Oxide (OTC) and Inositol Choline helps with no side effects at all.

I also am so tired I can hardly move. I was on no blood pressure med and went directly onto this with 140/80 readings. The readings have not changed that much, but my overall &quot;feeling&quot; has changed drastically. I am going back to my dr. to get off this stuff. There has to be something out there better than this!

Doctors seem to want to add you on to another med. right a away, without checking more than once. Before that dr.visit my preasure was fine.
