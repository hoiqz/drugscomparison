Epileptic Seizure	7-12 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	7-12	10/30/2011 10:19:19 PM	My daughter has had seizures her entire life. We have used almost every medication combo there is. She has absence seizures; she seemed to be having one every time I looked at her. Than we found a Dr. who knew what to do. I will be forever grateful to him. Our daughter still had seizures but they are just a handful a day. She can learn, play and has a great outlook on life.She is on Lamictal, keppra and felbatol. I am so thankful for this medication.She has gotten use to the blood tests.
Epileptic Seizure	jace, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/21/2011 2:46:46 AM	I have petite grand mal seizures.  Really hard to control because there so unpredictable.  I've been on every type of med's out there and Felbatol is the best by far.  It's the only one that has actually done something about controlling these seizures while not leaving me in a state of sleepiness, while keeping me in a decent state of mind. Loss of weight is a plus. I've been on it for 16+yrs.   Definately say the benifits out ranks any risk involved (for me).
Epileptic Seizure	Black Diamonds, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/7/2011 12:16:28 AM	The worst drug ever insomuch the Neurologist quickly took me off of it as soon as tirades of side effects began to show up; didn't even last 2 week on it and plus increased seizures as a result of it? Geesh - I would rather go to a Haunted House than to ever touch this drug again!
Epileptic Seizure	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/10/2011 3:02:09 AM	I was very wary of this medication because I was told about the serious side effects such as liver &amp; kidney failure, severe bruising, and aplastic anemia. I gave it a shot and paired it with 300 mgs Lamictal &amp; 500 mg Depakote. I am 20 and am finally able to drive. That is how well I have responded to this drug. I HIGHLY recommend it to any Epileptic who's at the end of their proverbial rope with medication options. The was a study done in London with Felbatol &amp; Lamictal users and it proved more times than not to be a successful pair. I stay on a low dose of Depakote ER to supplement the pair. Just Lamictal &amp; Felbatol isn't enough. My dosage is 2400 mgs of Felbatol, 300 mgs of Lamictal, and 500 mgs of Divalproex ER (generic of Depakote). Ladies, if you are on seizure meds for Epilepsy, DO NOT FOOL YOURSELF - pregnancy is NOT an option on these types of serious anti-convulsants!! I had to have a partial hysterectomy to stop my hormone fluctuation and extreme bleeding. Hormone fluctuation can cause seizures, no matter if you're taking Felbatol or not. With all this having been said, take your felbatol AFTER you have eaten and drank something such as milk or orange juice. Stay away from Grapefruit juices and Grapefruit in general. If you miss a dose of your medicine, do not double dose on your next dose you're supposed to take. It will have an adverse reaction and get you very ill and cause seizures, or so I have experienced.overall though I would have to give this drug two thumbs up!
Epileptic Seizure	dmbutl01, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/18/2010 3:09:42 PM	 i when there was no other drug to try I was placed in the PhaseIII Investigational  Study of Felbamate.  I have been 100% seizure-free since it has been almost 20 years now.  A new doctor now wants me to try one of the newer drugs, Keppra, I am very reluctant.  Felbatol has changed my life and I want to stay with what I know works!
Epileptic Seizure	CA girl in CT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/1/2010 12:08:10 AM	This was my last resort to controlling a 10 year battel with partial and grand mal seizures.  I have tried EVERY other medication on the market, both individually and as part of a cocktail.  I started taking this med a year ago (paired with the highest doseage of both Keppra and Topamax) and I have not had a seizure since.  I have now weened off the Topamax, which made me moody and caused problems with word-finding.  I am VERY happy with this med and wished more doctors would take the &quot;risk&quot; of prescribing it to epilepsy patients.  With careful and diligent screening, the high risk is a mute point.

Epileptic Seizure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/2/2009 7:50:29 PM	I have been on this drug for 20 years with no problems or side effects.  I tried some others but they made me feel like I was in a fog.  I wish more MD's knew about it and were comfortable with it.  I have been in pharma for over 27 years and understand how drugs work and SE.  This should be prescribed more often..at least give people an option.  I am not staying it's for everyone but it sure works for me.
Epileptic Seizure	Excellant, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/20/2009 9:55:42 PM	This medication has really did the trick. I was taking keppra and still had seizures. Since adding felbatol to keppra I have been seizure free.
Epileptic Seizure	Penny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/11/2009 4:26:14 PM	Be very careful when you begin this drug.  If you begin feeling sick w/ a fever &amp; a rash w/in a few days to  week of beginning this drug, see a doctor immediatrely, &amp; be SURE you tell them that you've just begun this rx.  It can cause Stevens Johnson Syndrome, whose rash has to be treated like burns, has caused some of my few eye lashes that still grow to grow in towards my eyes, creating the need for many ccrnea transplants, &amp; many other permanent, nasty effects!!! If not caught soon enough, it'll kill you. Unless you bring up your new usage of this medication, the physician may not diagnose you in time.
Epileptic Seizure	ADAX, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/5/2009 6:39:04 PM	I have been taking Felbatol for the last two years, it's the ONLY drug that works for me. Monthly  blood tests are required to check for aplastic anemia but  that is the only inconvenience. Losing your appetite isn't so bad, at least you lose weight!. It is the ONE drug that works for me!

I have no appetite, headache, cramps,  and very bad ??diarreaha??--but no seizures.  Go figure.  I have been taking it for 3 weeks now and it helps the seizures, but the side effects are getting to the point of almost making me give up on it.  I am extremely uncomfortable.

Since I started taken it I have not had any grand mal seizures. I have had only a few episodes in which I feel as if I may be starting one, but nothing has come of them.
