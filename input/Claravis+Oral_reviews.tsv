Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	HF_7, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	8/1/2012 12:02:53 AM	I have been on this medication for a week today. I have had acne since 7th grade. Although it isn't deep nodular acne, small bumps cover my face. I can't remember the last time my face was actually smooth. I've been on every medication (ProActive, Murad, Minocycline, Doxycycline, Nelson's Pure and Clear, Differin, Epiduo, Tazorac, Benzoyl Peroxide) in every form (pill, wash, scrubs, creams) but nothing has cleared my skin. I'm entering my sophomore year of college and I want to be able to wake up and not worry about putting foundation on to cover up my acne/blemishes before anybody sees me each day. As far as makeup goes, I've been using Clinque Acne Solutions as a liquid foundation then apply Bare Minerals as a powder. My face is naturally really oily so I tried to steer clear of liquid foundations but the worse my face got, the more I needed liquid to cover up. After a week of Claravis (60 mg/day), my skin is very dry and peeling. I have not experienced any other symptoms so far. I have been applying Curel to my face at night. Curel is what I have always used and tends to not be as greasy. My mom was terrified for me to go on this drug due to the warnings and extreme symptoms it has caused but so far, so good. I'm very excited about seeing the progress in the future.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	Simone, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	7/25/2012 9:49:27 AM	I have been suffering from acne for 12 years. Tried proactive, murad,everything over the counter, retin a,differen, benzaclin, spironolactone, tetra/mino/doxycycline,and even birth control. NOTHING worked. I decided to finally give Claravis a shot b/c my self esteem couldnt handle it anymore. The 1st month I started at 40mg and saw an amazing difference but with severe side effects(lips so dry they would crack and bleed)which I soon learned to control with increasing my daily water intake and Aquaphor. 2nd month, I was taking 30mg in the morning and at night, my acne came roraring back for about 3 weeks and then cleared up and only left behind FOUR pimples. I have been on this dosage for another month now and my skin feels SMOOTH. I am satisfied at this point but I do breakout a little around my period;it goes away very quickly. I should be on it for another 3 months and be completely clear by then.The med is also making the scars go fade away quickly. I have 2 issues with the med,1,it makes me wake up sometimes more than once to use the bathroom throughout the night and 2,I have developed mild eczema on my hands and arms, which my doctor gave me some cream for. If you have any questions about what type of moisturizer or makeup I use, or anything else please email me at simoneta6@live.com
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	6/26/2012 3:55:11 PM	I just finished my Clavaris today. My acne before taking this was awful, I had cysts, blackheads, whiteheads, just about everything. Each month was a different dosage for me. It ranged between 40-60mg each month. While on Clarvais, I had the usual dryness, but I used aquaphor and cetaphil, it really helped! I also had bad lower back and hip pain, and I did not have a menstrual cycle AT ALL while on this. The first month and a half, I did have pretty bad break outs, but they started to clear up by the second and third month. Now, after 5 months of being on Clavaris, I am now looking at acne-free skin for the first time in years. I am so happy with the results! It can come with some harsh side effects, but it was worth it in the end.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	ContinuedFromBelow1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	6/6/2012 12:06:38 PM	Day 16,  I no longer have the sunburn sensation and my face isnt as red (my face looks like Ive been in the sun, but not sunburned).  My hair is still not oily and Ive found that I have to condition it at least every other day to keep moisture in it.  Best of all: Vaseline has worked wonders on my chapped lips.  Ive read that some users are buying over-the-counter strength lip balms, but Vaseline is cheap and honestly does the trick  my lips dont feel as numb nor do I have chunks of skin peeling off them every 5 minutes.   They sell a tiny plasic jar (about 1 inch by 1 inch), so you can take it everywhere with you an apply as needed...like every 20 minutes.Also, I recommend Cetaphil lotion for the dry skin.  It truly lasts a really long time and doesnt cause you to break out (which amazes me because I have never been able to apply any kind of moisturizer or lotion to my face because it clogs my pores).  The problem I have, though, is that it makes your face shiny.  I have been applying it at night to cut down on the drying, peeling skin that happens over night.  I apply it to my dry problem areas in the morning, but not to my entire face.   I then cover it with a powder made by Clinque that hides the redness.  It works.  Im female, but I bet a guy can use it too without anyone detecting he is wearing concealer.  It will give your skin a matte finish after you apply the lotion to your face.  Clinque is expensive (about $35 for the powder), but I bet Target or similar stores carry a yellow-based powder that cancels out the redness.  I had to stop using my Clinque liquid concealer made for acne sufferers because the combination of the makeup and the drug was causing a burning sensation from drying out my skin even more.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	Pwntheth, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	6/5/2012 3:07:34 PM	I have been on Claravis for 16 days now (60mg dosage per day).  Although I haven't been on the drug very long, I can already see results.  The first 5 days, nothing physically changed.  But as I reached Days 6 through 13, my side-effects were terrible.  First came the chapped lips.  If youre about to start this drug, be warned.  Its horrible.  They were chapped to the extent that I was trying every imaginable product sold by Target, and re-applying the balm every 5 minutes).  That same day I started having dry flakey skin on my face that would re-appear within 30 minutes after having just cleared it.  The next day (as the first 2 symtoms continued), I had a TERRiBLE sensation that my face was sunburned, especially my forehead.  I was also very red, despite not being outdoors for long periods of time.  Other minor side-effects are itchiness and dry eyes, but I havent had to use any additional lotions or eyedrops as it hasnt become annoying yet.My face did break out more than usual, but its only been like that for about a week and its starting to clear.  The sunburn sensation lasted about 5 days.  Within 10 days, though, the most amazing side-effect took place: non-greasy hair for the first time in my life.  I typically have to wash my hair every day, sometimes twice.  The other day, I woke up, went to get ready for my shower, looked in the mirror and realized, I dont have to wash my hair, it looks the same as it did yesterday  not oily at all! (although, I still took a shower because who wants to have beautiful hair yet stink like a pig?)  
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/2/2012 10:49:35 PM	I'm a 28 yr. old female, and I weigh approximately 105 lbs. After several sporadic breakouts and then persistent daily breakouts, and at an odd age to have it too, I requested Accutane when nothing else seemed to work. (I'd tried Differin, Klaron, birth control, masks, Retin-A Micro, Pro Activ, Clarasonic, ... If I'd known Accutane (Claravis) worked so well with relatively few side effects, I'd definitely have insisted on it years before.) I was prescribed 20mg once daily for the first month and saw an improvement within the first week. By the month's end, my skin is clear - for the most part. I'll soon be taking 40mg once daily. Slathering layers of cream on at night help to counter the dryness.

More sensitive to the sun burn quickly i got 100 spf works great. I have never been so TIRED, headaches once in awhile take aleve i was fine. I get angered easier now but nothing to be conserned with just edgy at times. I have 0 pimples i haven't had a breakout since the last part of the first month i absolutely love it just hate the side effects i am pushing through it because when treatment is done it will subside and get better. i have been living in shame for 12 years so 6 months is nothing to me i am living with the pain so i can enjoy my life and start working on self esteem. Acne is no longer an issue its up to you to decide how bad you want it. 
Other	Renee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/8/2012 3:40:18 PM	I began Claravis on 3/28/12 30mg, increased to 60mg 4/26/12.  Used for excessive oil production, rosacea, pre-menstrual cysts.  I have had no major problems other than severe dry lips and cracking in the corners of my mouth.  I have found that Abreva and Dr. Dan's Corti Balm works great for the mouth area.  When it comes to going to the bathroom, a hemorrhoid coco butter suppository and a stool softener help with the drying effects.  Sukis Chamomile &amp; Echinacea facial oil is a must have to prevent any and all facial skin peeling.  My skin looks great!

All of the negative side effects have since ceased, and acne has slowly returned. However, it is much, much more mild and is no longer embarrassing to any degree. Be careful if you are considering taking this drug and notice any serious side effects, whether documented or not (doctors say mine weren't, but enough people reported the problem). It truly is an extremely powerful drug but has a ridiculous amount of possible side effects. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	raarrgghh, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	19-24	2/18/2012 2:53:09 PM	I was on claravis (20mg) for a little over two weeks (took 16 tables) and my acne has completely disappeared from my body and face. Had some side effects, such as severely chapped lips while on it, which was okay. The day or two after I stopped, I had my first outbreak of HSV-1 ever (at the sight of the previous lip dryness), and now, a week later, it is difficult for me to maintain an erection. I no longer wake up with morning wood, which is something I've had probably for the past 10 years. My hair also no longer gets greasy, so if I don't shower for 3 days, it's completely unnoticeable, whereas before it was noticeable the next morning.The dryer or less greasy hair is acceptable for me. The clear skin is great. The ED or beginning stages of it is so heartbreaking at this point in my life, and my girlfriend has noticed it too. For clear skin, this was definitely NOT worth it. I would rather my face look like the Himalayan Mountains than have to deal with this at 20 years old. If the side effects are only temporary, such as less than one month, I will change my satisfaction to 4 stars instead of 0. I will update this in one month

Started 20mg/day on first month. 40mg/day 2nd month. Minor and manageable rashes up to this point. On third month, it was upped to 60mg/day. But after two days of taking it, my rashes got out of control. It's all over my arms, elbows and spreading on my neck. Back and muscle pains are also starting to be noticable. At this time, I would prefer having acne than what I have now. I'm far in far worse shape now. Satisfaction is 1 out of 5 right now. It can go up to 3 out of 5 (at best), assuming these side effects disappear and that they're not permanent!
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	lifelongchange, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	1/25/2012 1:41:52 PM	The dedication to the iPLEDGE program and the monthly blood work I went through was worth it. At first the acne got worse. I was so embarrassed, but I pushed through it. By the 4th month the acne started going away dramatically. By the 5th month I barley had any acne and by the 6th I had none. I had extremely chapped lips, rectal bleeding, and rashes. Chapstick became my best friend and I learned to use Vaseline if I felt like taking a bowel movement. The bleeding of the rectum is only from how dry your skin gets, so it tears and no longer has the moisture for elasticity. This side effect didn't occur until 4 months in and went away after a month of being off it. My doctor gave me a special lotion for my rashes that worked great. I have been off Claravis for almost 2 years and it was seriously the BEST DECISION I HAD EVER MADE IN MY LIFE! I never wear foundation, I get compliments all the time on how perfect my skin is, I only wash my face in the shower once a day with normal body soap! I barley get any acne anymore and if i do its just a small red dot with no white head and it is usually gone by the end of the day!I have recommended it to two of my friends, a boy and a girl, and they too have had success stories. I knew about it because my older brother also took it and had amazing results. #1 must have for serve acne in my book!

After having kids, the nodular acne was worst.  I am sure that within the first few days of taking Claravis, I all of a sudden was having memory loss and was angered suddenly by things that didnt annoy me before the medication.  I am getting weird pains here and there and chalk it up to side effects.  You sort of second guess yourself in the beginning.  I am worried for sure about the long term effects and all the short term ones as well.  I feel a little paranoid at every little ache or pain as well.  Acne is debilitating when it is longterm and bad enough to go through all the crazy things we have to go through just to get a script filled.  Esp. woman.  I should start praying a little extra for myself and everyone out there on claravis.  I am very careful about not taking drugs of any kind and now have to resort to taking this toxin just to have a clear complexion.  We should start a support group so we all share our stories.  Thats if we can remember to go, dont get to angry on the way there.  We can pass out free vaseline &amp; lotion samples, have a suicide counselor there passing out tylenol for our aches and pains and a psychiatrist to help us deal and perhaps give us something to help with the emotional toll. I am concerned but willing to keep trying for now.  If my hair starts falling out and my mental capacity starts to go I may just move to California and apply for a medical marijuana card.  Ha!

I could actually look in the mirror and be happy with what I saw and I was getting compliments of how great my skin looked. HOWEVER SO MANY PEOPLE ARE IGNORING THE LONGTERM SIDE AFFECTS! Five years later I am still suffering with horrible bowel problems, hair thinning and joint aches. make sure you know what is in store before you start the medicine. Strongly consider any other possible options before putting such a strong drug into your body.

After using every topical and pill form I finally decided to try this. I was on Accutane for 5 months and the first month was awful. I had even worse break outs and then it cleared up and my skin looked great! Then a year later it started creeping back. So I did another treatment for 6 or 7 months and the same thing happened. I've been medication free for a little over a year and I am still struggling!!! Plus I have bowel problems now! This drug has so many awful side effects and I figured if I tried it twice, whether it worked or not I wouldn't put my body through that ever again. All the toxins from this are not worth it especially when the acne came back... Now I am eating better and using infrared sauna to sweat out toxins and doing acupuncture treatments. Hopefully that will work but I don't recommend this drug! IT&quot;S POISON!!!

My acne disappeared and started to clear after about 4 months on Claravis 40 mg. My dose is one/two/one and so on. For the past 5 years I have been fighting acne. I had flawless skin and now I'm scared pretty bad. This has been an expensive process. Dry skin, chapped and cracked lips, achy muscles and blurred vision are my side effects. I started using Dr. Dan's Cortibalm lip balm and it is the best on the market. Chapstick doesn't even come close to Cortibalm. I highly recommend buy several tubes. Ask for it at any drug store, they keep it behind the counter, no script needed. I can't wait to start feeling better about my skin. I will have to have lazer treatments to fade my scaring.

I have been dealing with severe pelvic pain since about 2 months after being on the drug. I am 25 years old and would like to have kids some day. The pain is coming from my ovary area. I never even though to correlate the symptom until I brought it up to my derm and he told me it is in fact a side effect and immediately took me off of the drug. My skin is cleared up, but at what cost? Now, I have to have all kinds of tests done and hope that I will still be able to have kids. Not worth it.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/23/2011 5:16:51 PM	I am a 20 year old female who has been dealing with acne throughout high school and college. I used to get big nickel sized bumps on my face, upper arms, and sometimes my back. Not only were these ugly (and killed my self esteem) but they hurt. They also left deep scars. I tried every tetracycline possible, topical meds and so on but nothing worked. This medicine has turned my life around. I have clear skin (maybe a small pimple here or there but NO big bumps). I have dry lips, flaky skin and sore joints but VERY much worth it in my opinion. I now wear short sleeves and less cover up on my face. Everyone notices how clear my skin is and my confidence is UP. I was a little worried about the side effects at first, but if you talk to your doctor (truthfully!) about anything that might be a problem (like family depression) and get it out there, then they can help you make the decision. I'm on my second month and have two to go at 40mg once a day. I definitely recommend it but make sure you tell your doctor if you have a bad history with anything (depression, anger problems). Thank you Claravis!

I went to the Derm in hopes of finding something to clear it up.  I went through months of creams and some meds with no luck.  Finally he suggested Clarvis and I have been on it 3 months.  This has worked!!!!  It has been BRUTAL to my skin, though.  I AM SUPER OILY and this dried me out so bad I blistered and peeled, had a fever blister outbreak all over my face, etc.  BUT IT HAS BEEN WORTH IT.  I had to stop taking for a few days to let my skin calm down by direction of my doc.  He said it is an accumulation in the body that constitutes it effectiveness...  I went through a it gets worse before it gets better too...ugggg that was awful but I will say again, This is the only thing that works and it is worth it to go through the suffering for 6 months  to get a clear face!Thanks!
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	Grad Student, 25-34 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	1/18/2011 11:12:46 PM	I'm a 26 yo male. Since 16, I've always had acne breakouts, ranging from mild to severe. I'm currently in law school and about 6 mo. ago I had about the worst breakout Ive ever experienced.Initially I tried treating the acne with over the counter topical meds, including Neutrogena, MaxClarity, and Murad. Nothing worked!! Eventually I went to my doctor and asked for Doxycycline. I had taken this antibiotic on two prior occasions for a period of 2 months each with great results. My doctor prescribed a dosage of 100 mg and I took that for 3 moths with little improvements. He also prescribed adapalene cream 1%, an expensive $200 tube that did nothing for me. After 3 months I decided to go to a dermatologist who only increased the dosage to 200 mg and prescribed a benzyl peroxide wash ($50) that dried my skin and did not get rid of the stubborn nodules I had. After 2 months of that regimen I went back and my dermatologist who finally prescribed Claravis (isotretinoid - accutane).I began with a Claravis dosage of 40 mg/day on and after the first day I began to notice a difference. The inflamed nodules began to go down and my skin look a bit better. By the fifth day, the improvements were obvious! I am on my tenth day and so far the improvements continue. I've had a couple of breakouts but nothing major and definitely nothing like it was before. Id like to think that like every acne treatment, it is expected since the medication is pushing out the acne that has already formed but hasnt yet hit the skin surface. Some of the side effects I am experiencing include dry mouth and lips and perhaps a bit of unusual tiredness. However, I am by no means depressed or suicidal! In fact, my self-esteem has improved tremendously. I am happy to say that this has been a very positive experience thus far and I hope to finish the treatment with the same momentum. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	zsmc07, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	12/26/2010 9:50:09 AM	I'm a 24 yr old girl that recently experienced severe acne (started @ age 21). I had tried everything under the sun before attemting Iso Rx. I'm still experiencing acne on my 2nd month of 30mg 2x daily of Claravis. I had initially started out at 30 mg 1x daily of Amnesteem. My side effects are pretty severe but I am learning to live with them. Knowing that taking this medication is going to end one day keeps me going. Side effects include: severe constipation and flatulant retention, dry face and scalp (don't mind at ALL!), dry lips, nose, mouth and eyes, back pain, excessive sweating when working out, loss of appetite, stomach aches, blurred vision (especially at night) and dizziness. I take a weight loss supplement along with Claravis (not advised by my Dr.) and yet my labs are still within range. Organs are fine it's just my body that is feeling the effects I guess. I did drink one time and I don't advise nor will I ever drink again while taking this medication. You will be less tolerant and blacking out is gauranteed. Good luck all! I will give an update at the end of my journey.

Her skin is the worst it has ever been in her life.  Her self confidence is very bad, she does not want to go to school.  She is taking 40mg 2 X a day as well as antibiotics because of the severity of her condition.  Hope we see some improvement soon.  Very expensive and difficult to get.  Lots of office visits, lab visits and money.  Anyone know when it will get better?
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	11/16/2010 4:38:27 PM	This has been my 4th month on Claravis, and i'm very pleased. It has taken away most of my acne, but still have a little left to go. I have the usual side effects of dry lips, mouth, and hands. I had to have some special lotion for my hands, they were so bad. It has made my face much less oily, along with my hair. You just can't do vigorous exercise, otherwise you might experience joint pain. It took the first couple of months to get rid of the redness on my face. I never experienced the phase, 'it's worse before it gets better.' For me it only got better since i took it. But overall, it has been a great drug for me. It could be different for every person, though.

I had not experienced acne this awful til I had my first child 23 yrs. ago. I have tried everything on the market, t.v., and internet. I am very insecure about my acne I don't like to go anywhere because ppl will stare and makeup doesn't cover it very good either. My doctor sent me to a dermatologist and she recommended this treatment. I also have severe depression and fibromyalgia so I am kinda concerned with the side effects.So I am praying that this will work for me, with little or no side effects. But I would love not to have to look at myself in the mirror and see all my acne cleared. I haven't seen that person in a while. Pray for me and I will keep you posted on all that it has done.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	8/20/2010 3:08:15 PM	I am a 27 year old mom of 3. I've had acne since I was 13 and its only gotten worse througout the years. Month 1, dry skin, lower back pain, skin got a little worse. Month 2, no back pain and skin starting to clear. Month 3, skin perfectly clear, hardly any side effects. Month 4, severe shin pain and a few pimples popping back up( not bad, but not clear like I was in month 3). Just starting month 5, shin pain still severe and now I am getting lower back pain, and still getting pimples. I'm not sure if its joint pain or maybe an inflammed disc. I dont remember doing anything to injure it, but the pain is there so now im just tring to figure out if the back pain is caused by the medicine or If I've done it to myself...I'm also hoping my skin will go back to being like month 3, completly clear. Just a wait and see game now.

I have only completed two weeks so far(30mg twice daily). Side effects so far include chapped lips, dry flaking skin on face, scalp tenderness, &amp; scalp flaking. Lips still constantly dry but regular chapstick and stopped severe cracking. I am a bit discouraged with the amount of peeling on my face. I havent had any new breakouts yet, but I also havent seen an improvement. I know it is very early but now i have acne and peely face. I am continuing treatment but I guess you could say I am experiencing a lack of patience.

I just moved to the west coast about 2yrs ago and have started experiencing cystic acne on face and back, I am about to satrt taking Clarivis 40 MG once a day and I hope it works as well as the Accutane did 17yrs ago, like a few people have said the medicine is very effective but I guess it wears off every 10-15 years, when I started the Accutane the Dr told me that it was a permanent cure but I guess not, however it was well worth it. I will keep you guys posted as to how well the Clarivis works.
Other	ShellyH, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/9/2010 10:12:13 AM	I took Claravis because of my extremely oily skin. My skin was so oily that with in 10 minutes of washing my face I was covered with oil.  This was extremely difficult to live with growing up as a child.  I've asked doctors in the past to please prescribe this medicine to me and I could never get it.  Well I'm 46 now and have been on Claravis for almost 3 months now.  I no longer powder my face throughout the day.  My oil has vanished and I couldn't be happier.  I can look at people in the eye now and have a conversation without feeling self conscious, its a great feeling.  I highly reccomnend this drug for someone who is dealing with this problem.  Also the side effects for me have been minimal.  I'm thinking that since my skin was so oily that maybe thats why I never got the dry mouth or eyes I don't know.  A little bit of dry lips and thats about it.  I highy reccomend this to anyone suffering from extremely oily skin.

I started taking Claravis two and a half months ago.  Started with 40mg daily with no results. Second month 80mg daily, skin worsened alot (the worst it's ever been).  Third month, began 120mg daily (two pills in the morning, one in the evening).  I've seen some very slight improvement in the past few days but far from being cured.  I have very light skin so every pimple scar shows.  So with scars and constantly getting fresh pimples, it's been extremely embarrassing.  Side effects so far have been the usual dry chapped lips and some hip pain.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that my skin will continue to heal.

Had many different medications, mostly Erthromycins, and various treatments with little or no lasting benefits.  A dermatologist prescrescribed Claravis treatment starting Nov 2009, up to a maximum of 60 mg per day. for a month. The worst side effects for me was dry mouth, dry chapped lips and slight difficulty in sleeping more than 5-6 hours nightly.  This medication was worth any amount of it's cost because my acne dissappeared and my skin cleared after the second month (Dec 09)of treatment.  I cannot say enough good things about Claravis, it helped my skin problem more than any other medications I ever taken.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/24/2010 4:11:15 PM	I am a 29 year old African American and I suffer from a rare skin condition classified as H.S., nodular acne. I am at the end of my 2nd month on Claravis 40mg one a day (2x's on M-W-F). I will say that the side effects i've had thusfar are: joint aches (knees, arms), minor fatigue, ashy/rashy skin on arms legs, and of course the chapped lips (if you use lip gloss on a regular basis like me, you won't have many issues with this). Ibuprofen and Tylenol can be taken for the pain and inflammation under the arms, groin, and other areas that are affected. I use Hawaiin Tropical SPF 50+ Sunscreen when i'm outside which will help the sensitivity to the sunlight. My condition has worsened and has not gotten better just yet, as was told by my Dermatologist. However, I am hopeful and looking at all these reviews, and I see that even though many do not find the drug easy to use, MOST find it VERY EFFECTIVE! I feel the drug will do well in that everything has gone already exactly how the doctor said it would thusfar. Please be aware and assured that NOT EVERYONE EXPERIENCES THE SEVERE MENTAL SIDE EFFECTS. I feel so sorry for the ones that do because that would only add to the discomforts we feel dealing with such worrysome Acne. I will leave feedback again after my 3rd and 4th months. I wish you all well!
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	3	2	Female	19-24	5/15/2010 2:31:39 AM	I have seen some amazing results from people who have taken Claravis, who had minimal problems with side-effects, if they even had any. This drug isn't anything to be played around with though, patients should be aware of all the possible side-effects and weigh the benefits with the risks. I have had acne since I was 10 years old, it has progressively gotten worse and after nearly every other treatment possible, Claravis was my last resort. Within the first month and a half, I noticed a pretty good improvement in my acne, but I had to stop treatment early due to side-effects. Not only I, but others noticed a complete change in my personality. I was irritable, unable to focus, constantly jittery and nervous. I couldn't even make simple decisions, and I was afraid to be left alone. I also started suffering from severe panic attacks: at home, in stores, in the classroom, they would even wake me in my sleep. They eventually led me to the emergency room. I have been off Claravis for about seven months now, and with the help of other medication I am about back to normal. Even with the short amount of time I was on Claravis, I still notice a change in my acne. Although I still have a decent amount of acne, I tend not to suffer from the painful nodular acne as much, and the acne on my arms and back has ceased to exist. I also had a problem with hair loss, which is a common side-effect, but that went away about a month after stopping treatment. There is no denying that Claravis works, but just make sure to take the side-effects seriously. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	25-34	4/26/2010 12:02:14 PM	I'm a 30 year old male who's had minor to moderate acne since I was a teen, and have spent so much money on over the counter things over the years. I finally went to a dermatologist and was on antibiotics, but still didn't completely clear up my face, and chest, which just started in the last year. I was hesitant to go on isotretinoin because of all the side effects I heard and read about. Got worse first 2 weeks like it said, but after 3 weeks it's completely cleared up my chest and almost my face. I can see my pores on my nose getting smaller, and my face is getting smoother.At first there was some minor lower back pain, but it's rare now. I do have chapped lips, but Aquaphor lip balm once an hour or so helps. My face gets dry at  but I moisturize twice a day with Eucerin or Cerave lotion. I do sunburn very easily, so should have done it in the fall/winter, but I usually burn pretty easily anyway, picked up SPF100 sunscreen.Overall, I'm still fairly early in the treatment, but it seems like a miracle drug so far. Haven't had any kind of depression or mood swings, actually have been in  a better mood than I have been in a long time. I really wish I would have done it earlier, could have saved alot of scarring, pain, money, and overall stress.

Nothing else comes close.  Dry skin and cracked lips are very minor and temporary problems compared with the battle with acne.  Go through the 3 to 4 month program.  You won't be sorry.

He play sports and wanting play sports when he goes to college therefore growing 4 more inches are very important.  He is 6 foot and 185 pounds.  He has very oily skin and big acne on his face, back, and chest. Tried two different antibiotic, proactive, OTC stuff. Not working.  Started to take Claravis four days ago 40mg daily. His face is still oily and see little improvement. I am very concerned that his growth will be inhibited by this meds. What do you think?
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	13-18	3/22/2010 7:36:26 PM	I'm a seventeen year old girl and I'm on my second month of Claravis. I am taking 30mg twice a day. I've had the basic side-effects. Severely dry skin, chapped lips, sore joints, and a touch of mood swings. However, my father and brother were both on Accutane and tell me that its worth sticking it out. They haven't had any acne for years, so I'm going to take it that it really works. I'm in the &quot;it gets worse before it gets better&quot; stage. So, as a warning to anyone else who wants to take Claravis, your skin WILL get worse within the first couple of months. I have acne worse right now than I ever did. But everyone assures me it'll go away within a month.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	3/16/2010 7:53:14 PM	This is my 2nd experience w/ this medication. I did Accutane 10 years ago as a senior in high school, but I was never fully cured. After having 2 babies &amp; trying everything on the market, it came time to give Accutane (Claravis) another shot. I'm now nearing the end of month 2 (month 1=40 mg 1/day, now I'm on 40 mg 2x/day), and I'm starting to notice remarkable change - I'm not fully clear yet, but the pimples that do pop up are not as painful or widespread as before. My skin is less oily, which seemed to just make everything worse to begin with! I've had some minor side effects but they feel completely manageable to me - dry lips (Aquafor or any kind of lip balm), dry eyes (I typically avoid my contacts), mild headaches...that's about it. I had a day or two where a red rash popped up on my hands, but cortisone cleared it up and I haven't seen it sense. My largest complaint is the iPledge program - I completely understand the importance of it, but it's not user friendly at all! Otherwise, so far, the side effects have been mild, and are completely worth the improvement in my skin so far. I can't wait until it's completely clear and I start looking like a 27 year old mother rather than a 12 year old!

I have had severe Acne since I was 11 years old. I have scars all over my face. I went to doctor after doctor dermatoligist after dermatologist and no one recomended this to me. I did the research myself. The first month on the pills I didnt not notice anything, I was so sad. I thought it was not going to work then in the second month I could see my skin clearing up DAILY. It was my miracle. 5 months later I did not have one pimple on my back face or chest, all places I had breakouts before. I would recomend this to anyone. I tried every drug you can name, I tire every thing at the stores in the face wash, pill, cream isles. I ordered everything off tv comericals. This pill was my saving grace. My 6 year old daughter came up to me not too long ago and said mommy you dont have those &quot;ow ees&quot; on your face anymore. Its pretty- and she touched my face. I would recomend this to anyone who suffered Like i did. (I had no bad side effects. I did have chapped lips - the whole 5 months but nothing lip balm in every coat pocket could not handle. And towards the end I did notice some joint pain in my knees, but it was so worth it) I would do it again in a second.

The benefits do go away after approx 10 years.  I have been on 60 mg/day (avg-80 one day &amp; 40 the next)for a week.  I have had very dry lips and pressure headaches almost daily.  It is worth it in the end because of the psychological effects of nodular acne.  I would not recommend this for teens though because they have less emotional stability and/or self awareness on how to deal with mood swings.

As a nurse I was very reluctant to start this medication beacuse of the possible side effects. He has some dryness of his lips (Carmex has worked well)some low back discomfort (Tylenol,Ibuprofen) He just started complaining of some itchy skin (Sarna lotion) After the first 3 weeks I noticed improvement in the redness of his face and no new whiteheads.Overall we feel it has been worth the minor side effects

I'm on my 2nd round of  Claravis.  1st round I took for 3.5 months &amp; my acne got worse throughout and after 3.5 months Idecided to stop due to the side effects. I contacted shingles shortly after discontining it this strong medicine.  It weakened my immune sys. terribly and I feel this is why I got Shingles which was 7-8 weeks painful hell.   My acne slowed only for a short time and came back full blown. Dr said I must not have taken it long enough. So we tried it all over again after several more months.  So far I am in month 4 and this medicine has not cured me yet.  I am worried it will never work.  My face is already severely scared and my social interaction has almost stopped. I am so ashamed of the scaring on my face.  I cannot afford fancy laser treatments to help this  condition plus I am not cured yet.  I still have severe acne and it is always there.  When one leaves a new one developes.  I have 10-20 bad spots every day.  I hate going to work and having to go to lunch with folks.  I am very distant because of it.  I will not go out with friends and don't ever ever let anyone see me without make up .  I do a lot of hiding on weekends.  I am not sure I am not one of those people this does not work on.  It is grueling on one's body and personality as well but I pray it will work soon.  Even though my scars are permanent I would just give anything if the acne would go away.  I don't look like anyone else I know and it is difficult to deal with.

We knew of the potential side effects, but decided to try it anyway.  His acne is almost completely gone, but he became almost suicidal, and his grades dropped from A's and B's to D's and F's.  The cracked lips and dry skin were a minor inconvenience, but the emotional toll of this medicine is much more than we expected. Please do not take this medication lightly.  We threw the medication out after about 3 months.  This medicine was effective in clearing the acne, but the side effects are horrible for teens.  A decrease in grades effects ability to get into a good college.  The depression can be severe.  Thank GOD  we tossed the medication before an actual suicide attempt.

Face is clearing better than back, but back is not having any new breakouts. Doctor states I am 50% of the way there. Month 3, rashes on hands and legs, extreme fatigue, managable dryness.

I was on Accutane in 1980 and on it again in 1995.  Now in 2010, I am heading into my second month on Claravis (pretty much the same as Accutane) and experiencing the same side effects;  dry chapped lips, dry skin, dry scalp, irritability and fatigue...but...it is all worth it if you have bad acne.  In my case, both times I have taken it, it has done wonders.  I ended the regimen with completely clear skin.  The problem is, it doesn't necessarily last.  You may need to take it every 10-15 years to maintain clear skin.  A few tips:  Try Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion.  If you're going to be out in the sun, by all means use a sunscreen (I use Cetphil SPF 15).  For dry lips, I recommend Kiehl's No-Shine Moisturizing Lip Balm -- it works wonders.  Aquaphor Healing Ointment is great to smear on your lips and other excessively dry areas before bed.  Best of luck to you.  It is a tough regimen...but I believe you will find it is worthwhile in the end.

The first month i took one 30mg pill and for the past three months I have been taking two a day.  After two months it began working and by the third month my skin was looking great.  However, the side effects for the past month have been awful.  Not including the dryness and nose bleeds, but the mood swings, hair thinning, crying spells, withdrawn from my family, and outburts have been awful.  I am very even-tempered, so this is extremely out of character for me.  I have a month left and cant wait to be done.  However, I wouldn't change anything, having clear skin is amazing as has greatly improved my confidence.  I am almost 30 and have never been able to look in the mirror without counting atleast 5-10 blemishes and now i have none...yes, none!!
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	rdg8336, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	13-18	1/3/2010 8:31:19 PM	Hi, I'm 17 years old and i've been taking Claravis for the past month (40mg) once a day! Tomorrow I get a new prescription with a higher dosage. I am satisfied so far because in the beginning my face was so oily and now its drying out! Some say that I am crazy for wanting my face to be dry! I experienced dry chapped lips, dry skins, back pain, i've been a little irratable but overall good! I take this medicine with prozac so that kind of substitutes the depression part! I recommend this completly but be aware to always keep your skin moisturized! I recomment Avenno and Eucerin; drink plently of water, and always always ALWAYS keep chap stick on because your lips will dry out so much they will split! So even if your lips or skin isn't so dry moisturize it anyway! HOPE IT HELPS

I have no energy, I don't want to get out of bed, and I just feel sleepy all the time.  This has just started in the last week, but I have to get back to work and my normal life. My face looks good for just being on it 2 months, but i'll take my chances of the acne coming back.

He is already showing signs of lip and nose dryness.  He is showing some signs of fatigue/irritability and muscle soreness (he does have a weight lifting gym class).  I am terrified of the potential side effects that are listed as many can happen during teen years in general.  Would love to hear more about other teens' experiences.

It worked wonders, my skin looks amazing and so much less oily.I  did get chapstick for my chapped lips and lotion for my extreme dry skin.It was worth it in the end, even though I did experience mood swings as well as joint pain. The afer experience is rough, I feel i should've been weened off because my sleeping habits are weird and mildly depressed. I would not change using it though!

I am in my 3rd month and getting a little frustrated. very dry lips and skin, some rashes on my arms, HAVE to wear sunblock all the time, some joint pain, headaches, i also get aggitated very easily(not like me at all). And its kinda expensive. But if i works in the end, it will all be worth it! :)Good luck to all users!
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	angellycakes, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	6/29/2009 9:22:49 PM	I have been taking 40mg of Claravis, once a day, for 27 days.  After about 1 wk my lips began to chap and dry out, and the sides of my mouth tend to crack if I don't moisturize.  My acne did get worse around 18 days in, so my dr. put me on prednisone to lessen the reaction.  And on week 3 I noticed my left knee joint starting to hurt (I exercise and run regularly and hear that that side effect is common for people who regularly exercise).  I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing anything similar, and if the joint pain will go away after medication is completed?  Just today (day 27) I noticed a rash on the back of my left hand! I hope the results are worth the side effects!

Even though it took such a long time it did exactly as described by my dermatologist. The first few months the acne did break out worse but around the 3rd month it began to slowly make the acne go away. Even though this medication dries out your skin i found Cetaphil lotion to keep me moisturized and regular chapstick, or carmex to help out my lips. I am extremely happy with the way it treated my acne and would reccommend it to anyone!!
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	4/2/2009 3:45:37 PM	I began with very deep, bumpy acne on my cheeks and chin area. It just looked like bumps on my face. By the beginning of month 2, I had very dry skin. During the next several months, I experienced very chapped lips, dry eyes, occasional rashes on the backs of my hands, and dry patches of skin on my arms and legs. I also experienced fatigue, headaches, and some nausea around the same time every day (3-4 hours after taking medicine). My acne got worse, then better as the treatment progressed. By month 4, most of the acne was gone, with only deep acne remaining on my chin and lower cheeks. It's month 6 (last month) and I'm 99% acne-free. IMPORTANT: Take this medicine with meals - one time I did not and woke up with severe vertigo and nausea for 24 hours.

My skin errupted in cysts that have left scars. My face and back are slowly clearing, but they are still worse than before I started on the medication! I am disappointed in this holy grail of acne medication.

Now I am 30 and after 3 children, my acne has returned.  I am in my 3rd month of 2 per day 40 mg pills and can tell a great difference.  Couldn't really see a difference until now.  The Dr. can give great samples for your dry and cracked lips

In the middle of the 3rd month I finally started to clear up and now (starting month 6) I am completely clear.  Chapped lips are the norm; dry scalp is making my hair look great; self esteem is higher than ever since I started getting compliments on my beautiful skin.  I would recommend this medication to anyone with persistent acne.

Skin is already clearing...will continue the course of treatment.

His lips are very dry, with the corners of the mouth cracked the most.  Makes it difficult to open the mouth to eat.  He has had a slight change in his demeanor.  He is aggitated easier.  His acne is responding well with his face responding better than his back.  He takes 40 mg. twice daily.  His nose is also dry, causing nose bleeds.  He has had his second blood draw to check for elevated cholesterol (results not known at this time).
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	414MP, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	3/18/2008 9:13:54 PM	During the first month I took 1 40mg pill daily. Week 1, no change. Week 2, sensative scalp and reddening of the face/ arms. Week 3 sensative to sunlight and dry lips. Week 4, dry lips and skin felt very tight. I have now started my second month and now take a 40mg pill twice daily. Week 5, My face is alomst completely clear, something I have never experienced. However, tender scalp, dry lips (just use lots of chap stick or petroleum jelly)Week 6, bright red arms with a dry rash(use Eucerin calming lotion), and I am beginning to notice some mood changes, I seem to get angry easier. All in all the medication seems very effective as long as you can manage the side effects.
