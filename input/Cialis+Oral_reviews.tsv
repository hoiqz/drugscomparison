Inability to have an Erection	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	7/8/2012 3:11:05 PM	After prostate surgery my doctor recommended to use some medication to achieve better erection.He gave me samples of Levitra, Viagra, and Cialis.I started with 10mg  of Cialis but it was not sufficient for a good erection.Then I increased to 20mg and it worked amazing for me.The good part of the history is that the medication work for long period of time. Usually it still working for two and a half day and also help my psychological feeling.I did not tried Viagra or Levitra and I don't know if I should do it because I have had no one single side effect using Cialis.I have read reviews from users of those three medications and all of then talk about head aches. Fortunately Cialis worked very well to me. I take it normally 2 hours before intercourse and it works fantastically to me.

It is great that effect lasts for 36 hours. I had some headaches in the beginning but not any more. It is very expensive at CVS so I get it from online pharmacy. I like www.atzrx.com as they have Generic Cialis 20mg for under $2/pill and you can get a free trial pack as well.

I have seen few headaches and dizziness but not consistent. Generally, it remains effective for at least 2 days so no worries if we go out of weekends. I found the price to be really prohibitive so switched to generic version recently. Turns out it works exactly the same. I found this website www.atzrx.com and they have a Genric Cialis at great price. Try it.
Inability to have an Erection	raging bull, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	65-74	9/6/2011 3:17:32 PM	I am 71 and sexually active.  Things have gotten a little limp so doc sampled Cialis 20.  I had a big night planned so I took one and was hopeful.  Within an hour I was a raging bull looking for the next pasture.  That &quot;condition&quot; repeated itself for four days.  I woke up each morning with a reminder of what may lie ahead.  I thought I was 17 again.  That was the &quot;up&quot; side.  Now, the &quot;downside&quot; is the side effects.  24 hrs after taking the dose there was a numbing pain in my legs, thighs, butt, and lower back. It was extreme enough to disturb sleep.  Guess everything has a consequence, but not sure I wold use the 20 again.  I will reduce the dosage to 10, then perhaps 5 as long as the erections are blue-steel hard.  But, I cannot endure that pain for the sustained period of time.  I recommend that you cut the 20 in half and try it.  You can increase or decrease from there.  Happy hunting!

She recommended cialis over anything else. I do get the stuffy nose, but nothing else I consider a side-effect. In fact, I actually was surprised to hear about leg and back pain because I have always had leg and back pain before I started using it, and in general I found both pains were LESS or non-existent while on cialis.I have no complaints. In fact I have become very popular since starting it.  ;-)

I have tried Foreign Pharmacy's and their product did not work as well. So I stay with the local ones.

Other	Robbie D., 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/14/2011 12:06:50 PM	 My first experience was perfect with the exception of a severely stopped up nose.   We had the whole weekend and we wanted to have awesome sex. I had been having problems keeping an erection for some time. I took a 20 and had an awesome night of sex, and then a world class aternoon of sex. 24 hours after I took the first one I took another one, but I dont think I even needed it. I was capable of doing things I never thought possible. I actually had the ability to keep an erection as long as I wanted and when I was ready to finish I would just do it. I thought about this for a long time. I was just wasting time. Do yourself a favor and try one. If you have a weak heart do not try one. You will get a workout. She will make sure of that. Your wife will idolize you as you guide her through a physical ravagation, and when she regains her composure, she will go fix you something to eat and do other stuff too. She will even start talking about doing things she wouldnt ordinarily talk about doing. I am writing this monday morning and we even had a session this morning. I dont know how long this will last but I feel like superman. So next time im going to try only taking 1 twenty mg tablet and see how long it last.  Thank you Cialis, you are BETTER than a cure for the common cold and you are a bargain at twice the price, and if you liked this testimonial and it makes you feel good, please respond by giving me a lifetime supply. My wife sends her love, Your friend always and forever! ..... Robbie D.

Unfortunately my insurance will not pay for daily usage,,so I take 20MG as needed,,limit of six per month.  No side effects like I get from other meds, lasts for approx. 2 days.  Very natural erection. Effective about 45 minutes after taking, and does not require empty stomach.

It has worked fabulous for me.  I start getting results in around 30 minutes and it usually lasts nearly 48 hours for me.  I am small in stature so not sure if that influences it's long lasting.  The side effects I get are a small headache at times, stuffy nose and some back pain but not all of the times and not too bad, definitely worth it for the given results.

Guys, I waited too long, 5 months before I saw my doctor.  There is nothing to feel embarrassed about asking for help with ED.  Remember, it means you're getting SEX!  I started with 20mg every 3 days because my doctor didn't want me taking it daily until more data said it was safe.  Today I'm taking 5mg daily.  I have had a 100% success rate.  My wife of 23 years is my girlfriend and we enjoy our intimacy at least 6 times a week.  This is a great product,  minor heart burn.

Viagra worked best.  When the daily use Cialis was available he gave me a sample of that to try.  It did not work as advertised and after about 4 days of use I broke out in hives.  Had to go to a dermatologist for a cortisone shot and some anti-inflammatory cream.  I am now 66 years old and Viagra works reasonably well but there are times when I wish that I had chosen the &quot;watchful waiting&quot; solution to my prostate cancer.

It works in one hour up to 48 hours for me.  Initially I had headaches and flushing - turning red in the face - but it worked, so I started taking an aspirin along with the Cialis.Over time (about 3 months) the headaches and flushing went away, and the effectiveness of the Cialis seemed to improve.I'd highly recommend it to anyone who meets the medical profile,  and who needs a little help.

No erection at all, a lot of frustration, getting my hopes up before I began to see that this was not going to work for me. I tried this medication on several occasions to see if it would work over repeated usage, but it did not have any effect on me at all. I am only 48 years old and I read stories about guys in their 70's getting help from this medication to treat their E.D. but I guess it does not work for everyone. The Doctor that Prescribed the Cialis told me the only people the pills do not work on are men who have had surgery in that area, but I have never had any kind of surgery at all in my entire life. I do have type II diabetes and I have it under control through excercise and medication, but I still can not get an erection. I don't know what to do any more I have not been able to have sex with my wife for more than 5 years now and it is getting impossible to deal with for my wife and for myself.  Thank You

It not only took care of my problems getting and maintaining an erection, it also took care of the annoying premature ejeculation problem I have had all my life.  Only side effects are minor stuffiness, slight headache (not sure if it's from Cialis) and trouble sleeping - probably because I was so happy.

I took one pill an after about an hour I had a hard erection I haven't had for years. If this is I hope it works I plan to use this. Only thing it cost so much. Is there a generic version? I heard others ask.

After using Viagra successfully for 5-6 years, a friend told me about Cialis and I tried it. I was amazed at the ease of attaining and sustaining a truely hard erection that reminded me of my youth. Cialis was giving me the confidence in being able to perform again. I was getting 4 days out of a single 20mg pill. Since my GF and I have sex every day, I began taking 20 mg twice a week (one Sat/ one Tues) and I'm good! I've been on this program for several months with no unwanted effects...just the 1 desired effect.

I had good results during the trial period but hit or miss since then.  When it's a miss I end up taking a Viagra (50mg)so as not to leave my partner hanging. Why Cialis is erratic is a mystery, but I'm going back to the sure thing.

My PCP put me on Levitra &amp; it did nothing.  Then he gve me a sample pack of Cialis for Use When Needed (20 mg) tablets.  I took a tablet in the morning &amp; nothing happened until early the next morning when I woke up with a rock hard erection.  Not only with an erection but really &quot;in the mood.&quot;  Great results!  However, it has now been three days since I took the pill.  I am waking up with erections all night long.  To boot, lower back &amp; leg pain started yesterday, which is really aggravating but not disabling.  I also experienced minor headache and really stuffy sinus passages.  I see on these posts that lower dosages work.  That is certainly the way to go for me.  In conclusion, Cialis works really well.  In my case, too well.  With all the erections I could have serviced the neighborhood!  (Not that I'm so inclined, mind you.)

After being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes I tried Cialis and have had very good results. Wish I'd asked about it a lot sooner. Side effects are minor and a 10mg tablet lasts at least 24 hours.

I get the Cialis from mail order source.  I have had nothing but &quot;out standing&quot; (pardon the pun)effects from this----HOWEVER, yesterday I took my regular doeseage (10mg half of a 20)....and absolutely nothing.  I had been told by healthcare worker if the tablets ARE NOT scored that means there are not equal amounts of medication disbursed throught the pill and shouldnt be broken, so Im opting to go ahead with my other half today and hoping &quot;it has all the goods&quot;. but overalll been very satisfied.  After taking blood pressure medication since age 15 it had taken its toll.  Until my first dose of cialis, I didnt have much faith in a medication with the claims they make....but def a believer.  Id be curious to know from others who have used other meds and their reccommendations etc.

It was bad enough begging a sample when visiting my docs, resulting in only a few pills a month, but now i became a victim of this horrible economy and there is no way i can afford the vulture's prices for them.  Can someone tell me when we can expect to see either to go generic? I desperately need access to the meds, but cannot afford them. HELP !

My wife asked me to go to the doctor to make sure every physical is ok.  After talking to the doctor, I chose cialis.  I took it and after 30 mins, I could tell the differece. I had a full erection.  My wife could tell and enjoyed the difference.  I definately got my confidence back.  I did have a slight headache, but that was four days ago.  I only took one pill.  Maybe all I needed was my confidence and it really helped with that.  Unless I feel the affects wearing off, I will wait until my wedding anniversary to take another.  So we can really celebrate.

I find the 10mg pill to be very helpful. The restiction of 4 pills a month is tough, I may try to go to 20mg and cut them in half. I had no side effects and was very satisfied with the product.

I get 20mg. doses and cut them.  If I use 10mg. in the AM that evening I will have a rock hard erection.  Actually its a little too much as I get an erection too easily.  With 5mg I have a more natural response - a little slower but more due to being stimulated.  I used to buy this drug mail order (probably from India) and it was just fine, but when my insurance started covering it I got it in the USA.  I am 58 and can have sex as much as I want with this drug.

Can have 2-3 sessions of sex per day. Only problem is he cost. Blue Cross/Blue Shield will not pay for it. Avg cost is $168 for 10 of the 20 mg pills. Only use 1/4 to 1/3 pill every 2-3 days. always ready with a raging erection. makes life enjoyable.

I did experience a slight headache a couple of hrs after taking it. However, 2 days later I experienced the most excrutiating low back pain ever. It would last for 3 to 4 days. Very bad! I had even cut back to 5mg instead of the 10mg dosage. Because of the side effects of the severe back pain, I will be experimenting with Levitra.

Very good weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.  So sex not a problem with attractive partners.  But tend to overdue when traveling so tried Cialis, 10 mg every day and a half, to help.  Does improve things; two sessions a day is easily possible but not always to completion.  Problems:  severe hertburn and often it feels like my throat is constricting.  Will carefully use up my supply and then try Viagra or Levitra.

It does not help with the desire to have sex, but it sure does solve the equipment part and that was the biggest problem for me. A true lifesaver. SIMPLY AMAZING!!!

Can get it up and hard but it goes soft after a minute or two. Cialis worked as advertised. I believe it lasted longer than 36 hours. The side effects were uncomfortable though. I felt flushed all over my body. My skin is normally warm to the touch but it got really hot all over my body which was bit of a turn off to my wife, &quot;like making love to an oven&quot;. I'm going to try cutting the 20 mg in half or quarters and see if what happens.

Tried Viagra and Levitra which also worked but sex had to be planned ahead, not as romantic.  No muscle aches but it does give me an annoying headache and stuffy nose for the entire time it's working which can take you out of the mood for more sex.  Wonder if the lower dose, daily pill works as well without the headache.

No mater what my wife and I did nothing would allow me to get an erection.

Had tried two &quot;natural&quot; dietary supplements, Zanerex and Orexis, neither of which worked for or helped me. Tried cialis this past weekend for first time. My doctor suggested that, based on the talk we had, I could get by with just half a pill, maybe even a quarter of a pill. He was right, half a pill was plenty (with NO side effects) - I might try a fourth of one just to see ... at about $16/pill (might be able to find them cheaper online) they're not exactly cheap - but then everything is relative. Bottom line - I'm very happy with cialis.

I had tried the 15mg single dose with poor results..it took about 18 hours to work and I got many of the side effects in the first couple of hours.  The daily dose is great in that it gave me back the spontaneity I had been missing for years.  That alone makes it worthwhile.  As far as maintaining a long term erection, it works most of the time for a fairly long time.  I had a radical prostatectomy which caused my ed and do not use any other drugs.  I get occasional short period of side effects, mainly flushing and heartburn, but they only last a few minutes.  If you really want that old intimacy back, I wholeheartedly recommend the daily dose.

Cialis solved the problem. Really great results. Within an hour of taking a 10mg tablet I can be very hard and not have to worry about losing it. We're enjoying extended sex again.

After using rings and Enzite for years my wife finally talked me into talking to my doctor. He gave me 20 mg Cialis. At first I cut it in two after reading where men were having a problem with leg and back pain. With it cut in two I to had the leg and back pain. I then decided to cut it in to four pieces and take a piece daily. This has worked great for me. I can just touch or kiss my wife and bingo. We are both very satisified using it this way.

Recently, my problem has been that I can get an erection but not keep it long enough to reach orgasm. Frustrating me more than my wife I think. My first dose of Cialis did the trick. About 1 hour after taking it my wife and I were going for it. My erection was hard as if I were in my early 20's again. I woke up the next two mornings with a nice stiffy. I'm sure I could have gone for round 2, 3 and maybe more if the wife ciuld keep up with me. Cialis works very well for me at 47.As far as side effects I did notice a little joint pain in one knee for a while but it was not bad enough to effect my walking or any other daily activities.

I saw an advertisment for CIALIS ORAL AND tried it. It worked very well for me and I do not use it daily but sometimes when I need some tender loving care it works very well and very fast. The only problem I have had with it is a very sore back the next day and that has been after each time that I have use it.

On top of that, too many hours in the gym left me over-trained.  Tried 10 mg cialis and boom away we went... between noon and 5pm we had sex 4 times.  Took a 2 hour break and then had sex 3 more times that night.  Ridiculously hard and I'd be erect again 10 minutes after climax ready to go again.  The girlfriend LOVED it and so did I.I did have some issues in side effects... had 15 minutes of ear problems and had a nasty headache for 4 days after... not good, BUT the results are worth it

Inability to have an Erection	whatever,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male		10/18/2008 5:58:24 PM	I'm wondering about advertisements for soft cialis, since I can't find any official sites that say anything about it.  Maybe it's just a marketing gimmick for people selling the stuff (or maybe a counterfeit?)10 mg just worked somewhat, so I took 20, and that didn't work much better.  However, I have noticed morning tenting four or five days later, much better than the original effect.I'm wondering, if I take it before a date, and don't score at all, do I get my money back?Or if there is a warning against grapefruit juice, if a glass of grapefruit juice would increase its effect?Since it lowers blood pressure, could it be used as a blood pressure pill, especially if other medications have side effects?  And if so, would Medicare pay for the daily dose as a daily medication?For that matter, does Medicare pay for it at all (considering that I got mine on the internet.)

Drinking alcohol with Cialis lessens the effect, not so with Viagra. I did not have any side effects with either drug. Cialis does not have the &quot;bigger penis&quot; effect that is a nice perk from Viagra, but I do love the lasting power of Cialis. Take Viagra on Friday then Cialis on Sat. if you want to make your lady smile BIG!

I was disappointed in my erection. My wife told me that was the first time I've climaxed twice in one day, in years, so it was doing something. It requires more stimulation for a hard erection than I thought.  I think that I will try the 20 mg rate and see if it makes a diffence. I've noticed penal sensations that I have misssed in the last 30 years of aging.  I've had no side affects, which was a concern for me. To me it is exciting to have ability to preform again; as when the birth control pill came out and we didn't have to use a condom anymore.

I do experience some of the milder side effects such as dizziness, headaches and sore hamstring muscles.  But, side effects well worth the results.I do find that it takes a little longer than 30 minutes to take full effect, but once it kicks in, I'm good for the next 2 days.I have low testosterone and take testosterone as well as Cialis.  I don't know if this combination makes it better or not, but I have no complaints and my wife is sore after two days.
Inability to have an Erection	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/8/2008 2:16:03 AM	I tried Viagra and had no erection, but did get an odd blue color to everything.  Friend told me I had to eat grapefruit... Can't stand grapefruit so something else was needed.  tried Cialis - only side effect is a feeling of being flush for a few hours and a stuffy nose.  I think it effect my adnoids.  Anyway - the reason I need it is because I can't stay erect while using a condom not really ED but still much safer for a single guy to be able to be rock hard and covered.  I use it only once in a while maybe 1 or twice a month.

Had to have laser treatment for both eyes and am still wondering whether it could be due to the pills.  Family has never had any history of floaters and I'm perfectly healthy at age 61.  Coincidence or side effect? The &quot;floaters&quot;, I was told, are permanent and I now live with these annoying objects or shadows...

Inability to have an Erection	Jrepairguy@aol.com, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	12/9/2007 11:47:06 PM	I have taken this drug several times now, each time with mixed results, ranging from very satisfied to very disatisfied.  So, what happened?  The only thing I can think of is that sometimes when I've taken it, I've taken it along with my acid reflux medication, Prilosec or Protonix (depends on which samples my doctor happens to have on hand)and other times I have either spaced the two doses several hours apart, or not taken the acid reflux drug at all.  Does anyone else out there have any similar problems with this drug, or can anyone shed some light on this problem?  Could acid reflux drugs interact with Cialis and render the Cialis useless? Drop me a line via email at Jrepairguy@aol.com and tell me if you have experienced this same problem.

All my friends from 20-45 that have tried either one of these products have also experienced the same symptoms. My visions was so blurred for abour 3 weeks, that I could not even read a menu in a restaurant. I am not diabetic, or have any health problems, and there is no history in my family of any eye problems. The longer you remain on these pills the the vision loss escalates each time. You have to decide what is more important, being able to see, or getting an erection.

I have bilateral testicular atrophy which means my testicles are shrinking and no longer produce any male hormones. I have been happily married for 37 years. Cialis allows me to have satisfying sexual relatione with my wife. She is also very pleased with this treatment. The medicine works 90% of the time. I have no complaints.

I take a pill cutter and cut them in 1/2 or 1/4 and make them last longer. The errection last longer with cialis than the other 2 ED drugs.

Erections are not adequately strong or long-lasting for sexual performance.
