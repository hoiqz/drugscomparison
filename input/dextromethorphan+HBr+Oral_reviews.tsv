Cough	Sandy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	2/10/2011 3:33:43 PM	Used Scot-Tussin DM (for diabetics/sugar-free)for coughing &amp; itching of throat during a cold.  Makes me sleep very soundly at night but have noticed the last 2 times that I took it, before it kicks in for the cough, that my throat closed up, leaving me gasping for breath during every cough. Scary! After I made it thru the coughing attack, it did stop itching in throat and control the cough &amp; apparently sedated me enough to sleep. Because the throat closing was such a serious adverse action, it means I shouldn't take it again and will report to my Dr. It didn't occur to me the first times (have used several times) that it was the culprit in making my throat close up. I looked it up on the web this time and found that serious adverse side effect listed. A number of meds work opposite on me than most folks. Most of the ones that make other people drowsy, usually wire me.  This one did not wire me, but made me drowsy which I wanted it to do (needed help with sleep), so now I don't know what can help me without this adverse effect.

I took the MucinexDM version which has 60 mg of Dextromethorphan HBr.  I do not do well with drugs that cause drowsiness but I did not realize this one would do that to me.  I am not so much drowsy as much as I am discombobulated.

Cough	tootired2think, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	3/31/2010 3:05:36 AM	Took this medication only oout of desperation and upon the recommendation of my pharmacist. I'm 8 months pregnant and never take medicine for colds but a terrible cough had kept me up for literally days. Took the 1 tsp dose instead of 2 tsp at 8:30. Became sweaty and queasy within the hour, became VERY nauseous shortly after and vomited. I'm disappointed that so many people can get relief from this medication but not me!

Cough	Read , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/28/2010 7:31:15 AM	My husband woke up feeling like he was going crazy. He was scared to tell me how he was feeling but he had to since he was breathing very funny at 5:30am. He was very dizzie but felt like he was going to die or be put in a mental instetute. We called 911 after checking his vitals they said he was just fine. But he was still not feeling fine. This drug needs not to be taken so lightly and should be treated like Sudafed...the pharmacist should give you a complete possible side effects review first or let you read it before buying ang walking off. Can't imagine a single parent or someone alone at home going through this by themselves.
Cough	Gigi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/27/2009 11:08:49 PM	Our neice died from using this drug which is in musinex which is what she was taking.She was an RN, and should have known what to take for a cough.  Throw away anything in your medicene cabinet containing Dextromethorphan!  It can and will kill you!
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	11/4/2008 2:43:18 PM	I have a pretty bad sore throat and cough, and I bought a liquid (brand name) medicine containing this and acetepemitphin.  I had taken this before and didn't really have a problem.  It didn't &quot;cure&quot; me, but this did help to soothe my throat and reduce coughing.  I don't know if they changed the formula or what, but I took a dose at 6AM and another right before 11AM (in the 4-6 hour recommended range).  This had me feeling like I was totally tripping for about 2 hours.  I have been completely out of it, unable to focus, my body just feels weird, sort of like on the verge of getting drunk or something.  It has been weird and I'm glad that I'm finally coming down from it.  I'd rather be a little ill than having my head completely messed up.  I felt like I was unable to walk straight and my eyes don't want to focus right.  This stuff is not good news.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	12/30/2007 7:44:08 PM	Adverse reaction: History of TIA's, a constriction of blood vessels in the brain. The medicine did releive the sinus congestion, but a side effect was a trip to the ER via ambulance. This medicine caused my blood vessels to constrict, causing numbness on my right side (stroke like symptoms). ER Dr. advised to avoid any and all medications that cause blood vessels to constriction, which include but are not limited to the following; Mucinex, Advil Cold &amp; Sinus, and other OTC's containing &quot;Migraine&quot; or &quot;High Blood Pressure&quot; medicines. Medicines which cause blood vessels to constrict. I was put on &quot;Cardizem CD&quot; to relax blood vessels.  
Cough	littlebittyme, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	12/24/2007 12:53:24 PM	I was found to have an &quot;adverse reaction&quot; to this drug. I had stroke-like symptoms after taking the directed amount. I had a loss of my entire nervous system. I could not hold up my head, lift or move my arms or legs, could not talk, could not even lick my lips, nor open my eyes. The ER doctor could not find anything wrong with me. My heart rate and other vitals were fine. Blood work, fine. Cat scan, fine. Nothing wrong. I could hear everything that was being said. I could comprehend everything going on. I could not respond when I was asked a question or asked to lift my leg. I felt very tired. I felt like I had a lead blanket on me &amp; could not move without a LOT of effort. Symptoms lasted 2 hours in a comatose-like state. These symptoms did not effect  the activity of my brain just my body. I was fine for about 4 hours after taking this drug. Then all of a sudden I felt dizzy and immediately started loosing control of my bodily functions. I could not walk. I had to be carried to a vehicle then into the ER. They had to put a catheter in because I could not urinate in the bed pan. I knew I needed to go but my brain could was not getting the message to the rest of my body. I basiclly was a rag doll and had no control whatsoever over any part of my body. There was nothing the doctor said he could do except what out the symptoms, and watch the vital signs for any changes. After two hours the doctors gave me a full IV bag and then sent me home. When the symptoms subsided I was left feeling very tired for the rest of the day. The next day it was as though nothing had ever happened. It was very scarry and strange the doctor said it rated at the top of the bazaar list.
