Parkinson's Disease	purple3, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	4/4/2012 1:51:41 AM	Although it took a while for the Mirapex to kick in and relieve my hand tremors, I was happy to know that there is something out there that can offer relief without breaking the bank.
Parkinson's Disease	George C, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	65-74	2/29/2012 10:10:24 PM	I was taking 4.5 mg daily at 6:30 am and it wears off at about 2:30-3 pm.  I informed the doctor and he has me 3.0 mg twice a day one at 6:30 am and second one at 6 PM. It seems to even out the effectiveness and reduces the tremors.  There no side effects.  The only negative is the cost for 60 tablets with insurance is about $284
Parkinson's Disease	bobby, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male		3/19/2011 8:10:00 AM	To beginwith I had trouble with the falling asleep side affect.  Then the timed releasepill came along.  we doubled the dosage and the side affects settled down quite nicely.the restless leg syndrome, and the parkenson'sdidn't bother as much.  I am very happy with the results.  My insurance will make me pa a high copayment.  when one is on a fixed incomeit is hard to make the copayments.  I have this drug and 7 others. Thank you.

I am not sure I have Parkinsons but I will question him when I see him this month.  I am wondering if when I take a nap I wake up finding things right in front of me when I am sleeping but they(the things) are gone.

Other	Happy Sleeper, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	8/30/2010 1:59:00 PM	I am taking mirapex for restless legs.  Sleepless nights for many years.  After knee replacement surgery, I kicked it out of place in the recovery room. (Back to surgery!)  Woke up with brace on my leg and taking mirapex for the first time.  Have been taking three times a day; recently cut out a,m. dosing, because I suspected it may be causing daytime sleepiness.  ( It is prescribed for every 6 hours, but except when hospitalized, I've never take the 4th one.)  Four years of GREAT sleeping!
