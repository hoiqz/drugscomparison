Severe Psoriasis that is Resistant to Treatment	marine1967, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	55-64	9/16/2012 9:40:35 AM	I have been on it less than a month and my insurance company would not give me the daily dose my Dr suggests, but it seems to be working anyway.  I am noticing severe chapped lips (when I never got them in the past) and a troubling change in the taste of food. And not a change for the good either. But, this is the last option for me.  We have tried everything else and either they didn;t work or the side effects were so severe I couldn;t tolerate them. Sooo, hopefully I can get use to the side effects of Soriatane Oral because, as I said above, it does seem to be working.

Severe Psoriasis that is Resistant to Treatment	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/10/2012 1:34:16 PM	I have had severe psoriasis since I was 11-affecting about 95% of my body &amp; psoriatic arthritis since 16..After yrs of topicals &amp; other meds,Soriatane has been the most effective for me.The side effects are awful.I lost almost all of the hair on my head(which was down the middle of my back), 60% of my eyebrows&amp;eyelashes &amp; haven't needed to shave my legs ever since I started the meds.My nails split, my clear areas of skin are fragile, my lips chap horribly, the inside of my nose is raw and my heels peel horribly and hurt. Not to mention so many other side effects that go along with it.However, my psoriatic arthritis has benefited greatly. I am still in pain, but it is at a tolerable level. My psoriasis has cleared to where I can actually feel comfortable wearing short sleeves or a dress (no turtlenecks in the summer!). My insurance has always covered the medication, although the copay has ranged from $30 - $110.Everything is not for everybody. I DON'T recommend Soriatane, but it does work for me. If anyone plans on using this, I would strongly suggest doing a great deal of research. I was not emotionally or physically prepared for the side effects. My hair has grown back to where I don't need a wig, but it has never returned to how it was before and is very thin. My psoriasis still goes through different cycles and stages, but it is manageable. Over the years, my dosage has varied from 25mg to 40 mg/day. I actually began on 50mg, which cleared my skin in a week 1/2, but then I felt like I'd been severely sunburned for weeks after and my dosage was reduced.There have been several months during this treatment that I have chosen not to use it, but then ended up in severe pain again.I do the best I can with it, my topicals are limited now because this works and I will probably continue it as long as my monthly labs stay ok.

Like others have said it caused dryness to the hair and lips,it also made his nails peel like paper. Later on he was dinosed with vascalitis, which I think was caused by the drug. the vascalitis caused many stroke which lead to his death. I recamend no one take this drug.I beged him for years to stop taken it but his skin was so bad and at the time he thought he had to have it. Wanda

Skin is mostly cleared after 6 months.  Did have severe side effects, but it was worth the discomfort.  However, I have now lost most of the hair at the top of my head.  Is there any hope that it will grow back.  Does anyone have any suggestions ??

Once off it my foot started to break out and peel again so the doctor wants me back on it.  Chapped lips and hair loss and soft finger nails are the biggest problems for me.

The &quot;off&quot; is because it is not affordable. I swear by it because for one summer out of 5 I have been able to show my feet. It's worth it. I just hope it does not do my liver in.

PRP is now gone and have stopped the Soriatane after 18 mos of use.  Easy to use but hard to deal with the side effects(itching and cracking).  Treated symptoms individually.

Severe Psoriasis that is Resistant to Treatment	Rena2010, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	4		35-44	1/25/2010 1:21:20 PM	I have been on this medication for 1 month to treat my plaque psoriosis resulting in terrific results! For once I feel normal again when nothing else has ever worked. The only symptom of psoriosis remaining is a little pink after show but even that goes away after about an hour. Side effects have been dry lips and fingertips( treatable with chapestick and lotion!) And my liver enzymes are starting to show a little abnormal slightly (keep you posted on that.) Last but not least is costly between the bloodwork, Dr. visits, and medication. Overall it has been worth it! :)

My lips got extremely chapped but went to taking everyother day. The only complaint is that it makes my hands and feet peel every few months. Insurance changed and now it is to expensive.

Which I can no longer afford.  On SS with supplemental insurance and the copay is much too great.  Thus I must discontinue using drug.  Due to my other problems I cannot use other medication which may activate my cancer, according to my doctors.

Doc said to wait 3 days &amp; then take pill every 3rd day. By the 2nd. pill my head felt like it would explode. Pain in the left eye, fingernails broke off, skin continued to peel, burn, itch. Stopped meds. After 2 weeks of headaches and eye pain went to eye doc. Medication had caused dry spots on my eye surface. Doesn't know if they will go away.Painful at times. Headaches continue. Psoriasis is better tho ! Not gone, but better.  It now just looks rashy and itches.I go for my blood test Thursday to see if there is any liver damage and can't wait to hear that good news ! NO MORE SORIATANE for me. The cure is worse than the disease.

Immediate clearing of psoriasis with use of medication but accompanying relentless itching.  Evidently not a common side effect, I was found to be &quot;allergic&quot; to the medication with feelings of bugs crawling under my skin; particularly troublesome on forearms and stomach area.   Had to discontinue and have had some satisfactory response with PUVA treatments.

Psor. not cleared completely but due to my severity I am hoping it will just take a little longer. I have RA too so trying Orencia due to Enbrel/Humira can actually cause flare ups. I don't like the toxicity factor but I am desperate. I also use topicals to keep moist and tar at night. Tar helps calm the inflamation. I will re-review in 6 months on Soriatane.

Every few months I exprince the peeling of the fingers, butt hen goes away.  I do have the lips that dry, in the summer they hands and feet get clamy, but I prefer this over the psoriasis.  It feels great to walk around barefeet.  The rest of my skin is so soft.If I stop taking it, it comes back but not as bad.

Nose is very dry and bleeds often. I have experienced red, irritated eyes. My psoriasis shows some improvement in that there is less itching and the skin flakes are larger than before.

I was using alcohol while on the meds and my triglicerides went up. I was asked to stop taking it. 3 months later I started again after non-alcohol consumption for 3 months and got Soriatane - non-generic and viewed entire pamphlete. I may have to wait 5 years to be able to donate blood/kidney.  My plaque psoriasis was on every limb and torso, front and back. Now, 3 months after using soriatane, I finished taking the meds and 95% of the plaque is gone. Leaving some darkened patches where plaque was.  My lips dried during medication period. And, palms and sole of feet dried, too.  Urine tended to smell slightly (as in high protein consumption). My lips went back to normal after two weeks and after four weeks no return of plaque to date. I tried to do UV-B light treatment while taking meds. First attempt - I was exposed for 6 minutes. I am olive skinned and take the sun well. The 6 minutes caused 1st degree burn to exposed areas and I peeled after 3 days. 3 months later I tried UV-B again and asked to tone down light strength by 2/3. I managed that UV-B fine with some tanning and went 3 times. That assisted the meds well. Better treatment than the next phase, Enbrel. I feel Enbrel is too much of a risk.  Using diet and weight training to boost metabolism and maintain optimum immune system function.

Heavy hand and foot psoriasis with swelling joints on hands. They are packaging this with Versa-Care a foam skin treatment. A great product that adds a dimension of a band -aid like covering to the skin.And the foam dries quickly.  I could never keep all the other creams on ... you use your hands all the time so if they were greasy the patients likely cannot use them or don't use them as regularly.
