Other	Dystonia Trihexyphenidyl, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	4/8/2012 3:08:00 PM	I have taken Artane for 16 years for Dystonia. At the beginning I was unable to walk one block. Nowadays I can dance the Tango on 17 to 21 mg/day. I discovered that in France, they make Parkinane LP (Lib&#233;ration Prolong&#233;e = Sustained Release). The advantage is that you don't have to take it all day but it takes effect all day. I can take 9mg with Breakfast, I experience no &quot;high&quot; and I can function normally the whole day at a desk job. Then, if I'd like to dance, I take another 10mg+ of the faster acting Artane. The Parkinane is very reasonably priced in France 3 Euros for 20x5mg.

After trying several treatment options over 2yrs, Artane has been the most successful at eleminating the muscle spasms and relaxing things. The side effects for me include mild depression, drossiness, constipation, memory loss, however the benefits do outweigh the side effects. I keep fighting!!

I was prescribed 10 mg of Artane. It was too much for me. It made me have EXTREME short term memory loss for a few hours.  After several doses, it started to make me naseous and the only way to stop it was to drink orange juice with lots of pulp.  Now I only take a quarter of a 5mg pill every now and it has kept my sypmtoms away. A note: the brand Danbury is better than the Qualitest brand. Danbury doesn't upset my stomach like Qualitest does.

It messed with my close up vision (extremely blurry), headaches, dry mouth and I started to become paranoid.  Started to experienced night terrors and had a very strange persistant feeling that I had forgot to do something important.  All this stopped within a few days after quiting the drug.  Just be carefull and watch for changes - it always helps to keep a daily journal as to how you are feeling day to day while taking any drug.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	10/15/2009 8:38:57 AM	I have benign essential blepharospasm and cervical dystonia. I was nearly blind from the severe spasms. I began taking artane about 8 years ago and it made all the difference in the world for my ability to see. The spasms better controlled and as a result I was able to go back to work. I also had much more energy to do things. The drawbacks from the medication were the dry mouth and constipation and surprisingly muscle stiffness. I also have problems with my short term memory. My tolerance level was also much lower than the recommended dose.Despite the negative effects, I still found that it was worth taking because it allowed me to function better than anything else I had tried. I would recommend the medication to anyone with dystonia who has a problem with either antro or retrocolis or benign essential blepharospasm. It really made a difference to me.

It does affect my short term memory somewhat but that is better than constant pain in my neck and my head being pulled to one side (very embarrassing)
Other	none, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	4	3	4	Male	45-54	8/8/2009 11:32:25 AM	Artane is an obsolete medication that was used extensivly in the 1970's &amp; 80's to control the extra parymital side effects of neuoleptics such as navane &amp; melaril.It is shorter acting than cogentin, which was also used. Dosage 2-10mg/Q day. It gets you high as a kite. The first hour seems great.Then you start wondering &quot;When is this going to be over?&quot;It effects your short term memory greatly,though it gradually returns. Artane is so old that is not generally listed as Artane but by it' generic name Trihexyphenidyl. It is available cheaply from India.
