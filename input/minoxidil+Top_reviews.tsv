Hair Loss	JMM, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	6/4/2012 12:42:13 PM	I am a 37 year old female who used 1 mil of minoxdill 5% twice a day for a year. During this time, my hair texture drastically improved and my hair was able to grow past my shoulders. I still was experiencing a decrease in the frontal hairline, however, but was satisfied with results at that time. Due to a trip, I interrupted use of this product for a week and upon continuing use, I experienced a burning sensation on my scalp that became painful and miserable so I discontinued treatment. Also, during this year, I experienced unexplained symptoms that happened only when I started my period, as I will explain below, but did not relate this to minoxdil until now.After being off this product for 6 months, I lost all the beautiful hair I had from the previous year but had normal periods during this duration.  However, since my hair loss was becoming more and more apparent, I decided to return to treatment. This time I began using minoxdill 4.5% and decided that I would only use 1 mil, once per day in the evening. After using this product for three weeks it was time for my period again which happened unusually late, starting at 32 days instead of the normal 28. And just as when using minoxdil previously, as I began to start my period, I felt dizzy, faint, nauseous, grew pale, felt an incredible urge to use the restroom multiple times, felt incredibly hot, profusely sweated, then got really cold, felt weak and had to lay on the bathroom floor to recover. The whole episode lasted around 45 minutes and then after resting briefly I felt fine again. This scary experience has happen regularly while using minoxdil.

Hair Loss	bklyn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/8/2012 11:37:59 AM	I started using 2% around 10yrs ago with good results and no side effects. I stopped during pregnancy and nursing, with eventual loss of all regrowth. When I restarted with 2%, I had no results, so started 5%. My hair is thicker and more dense than it has been for as long as I can remember.  Some scalp itching this time around, and facial hair too, but it went away with home hair removal treatment. I know I'll need it for as long as I want to keep the hair, but I'm ok with that.

Hair Loss	mar_da,  Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		3/9/2012 5:21:01 PM	I have been using it for two years.I am 55. I use double the dosage and massage it in my scalp. Irritation at the beginning can be treated with  almond oil. The results are incredible but you must keep at it twice a day and no cheating. I had visible results after 3 weeks and buying the no name 5% minoxidil is the way to go. Be patient and the results are well worth it. Yes you will have to continue using it for life but using it after a shower or shaving becomes second nature.Hair regrowth is not only in the back but also on the forehead.Good luck.
Hair Loss	honeybeeaz, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	2/29/2012 9:38:45 PM	I started using it while also taking cortizone shots for Alopecia Aereta (first time in my life, 50 years old). I do think it is helpful, careful about letting it drip on your face. After about 3 months I am considering quitting. I can't deal with the itchy scalp and I don't want to use the product for the rest of my life. I am afraid I'm going to shed and lose the hair, as the product only works as long as you use it. OH! I've been using the men's 5% twice a day, as recommended by my dermatologist.

Hair Loss	nana, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/24/2011 2:22:14 PM	I have been on Minoxidil for almost 2 years with no side effects and it is working for me, I only use it once a day. Iam thinking of trying the mens I  heard it works better. I am having trouble with perms they seem to last for about a month. You have to make sure that you wipe any excess from getting on your face. I got lucky so far no side effects

With Minoxidil, my skin would burn, irritate, swell up, get blisters... theres times where i literally felt loss of breath and chest compression. My doctor quickly put me on Fortalex PT and I was able to experience hair growth without those very uncomfortable side affects. After doing my research, I found out Fortalex is 100% natural and there are no chemicals, which explains the absence of side affects... I recommend Fortalex PT

Hair Loss	funlovelyt, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	12/27/2007 10:20:08 PM	This product does work.  I am a 35 year old woman with mild traction alopecia.  I started seeing results after about 6 weeks.  One side effect that I was not expecting is that I am getting hair growth in places I don't want hair.  Be careful to cover any minoxidil-treated areas before you go to sleep.  If it gets on your pillow, or drips from your scalp onto your face, you might notice small patches growing on your face.  It's not terrible, but I have noticed it.  I just shave it off and try to watch where I apply.
