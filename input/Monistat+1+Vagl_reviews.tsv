Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	sammay1224, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	8/6/2012 1:54:08 PM	Bought this product in order to get rid of a mild yeast infection, I have used monistat 3 and 7 before and they worked fine, however this product resulted in an intense amount of burning. It helped to lay down for the burning but I took it in the morning and I had to get up eventually.  All I can say is that it was extremely PAINFUL and that I will never use this product again. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	 (Patient) 	3	5	1			8/2/2012 12:37:16 AM	I would not suggest using this product. Shortly after using there was severe burning! Feels like it's on fire. Definitely will not use again.

I am on vacation at the beach and I wasn't gonna be fussing with 7 days of medicine...my yi is very mild and I'm not really that uncomfortable with the medicine.

The YI was mild and i decided to take this because it was one day. Worst decision of my life. I literally feel the burning sensation all day. Granted the infection is gone but this burning is worst i might just make a visit to the ER 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Sara, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	7/24/2012 9:33:31 PM	After reading several reviews I noticed that many of the women who complained about Monistat 1 were first time users or had never had a yeast infection before. Unfortunately I suffer from frequent yeast infections, possibly due to genetics since my mom has the same issue, and although I have changed my diet and take extra good care of my lady parts, I still have problems. I've used Monistat 7 in the past but I decided to use the 1-day to save the aggravation of using the cream for 7 days. Like many women said in their reviews I did feel some burning and a warm sensation as the medicine began to work, however it was nothing compared to the discomfort of a yeast infection. I think that this product is definitely stronger than the 7-day formula and it does take some getting used to, but for women who have used over the counter yeast infection creams it really isn't anything different from the 7-day formula. Also, Vagisil helps a lot with the external itching since it tends to have a slight numbing effect that dulls the itching. I usually use both products together.

I was mildly uncomfortable and thought it would help because I had used a product similar to it before. I went from mildly uncomfortable to crying because I was in so much pain from the burning. It went from a mild yeast infection to a nightmare. The Monastat seemed to feed it rather then cure it. Please spare yourself the agony!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	7/18/2012 5:06:47 PM	OMG I will NEVER use this again. I have had UTI's before but this is my first yeast infection. I wish I could rewind to a few hours ago before I bought Monistat 1, the burning and itching I had before using it is nothing compared to what I am experiencing now. I am itching and BURNING like crazy! Ive put a cold rag on it and even sqwatted in front of a fan to try to relieve the burning and nothing is working :/ DONT BUY IT! Its horrible, I have NEVER felt this bad. Cant walk, hurts to sit, and had to have my manager take me off of the schedule for tomorrow because there is no way I can go to work like this :/
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	ell, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	2	3	1	Female	35-44	6/21/2012 9:03:49 AM	DO NOT USE THIS DRUG. It hurts to even sit down. I felt mild discomfort before the application. After the application I felt like I was on fire.  I am so worried right now.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	6/17/2012 5:38:55 AM	Oh here I am wide awake because my croach is on fire. I can't sleep. I've taken a shower to try and rinse off but no luck, still burning and itching. I came online to see if this was normal. Seems like I'm not the only one suffering from intense pain. This is sooo not worth it, I won't use this product again.

I seriously though something was VERY wrong. Apparently it's normal for this drug to make you feel like your vagina is being burnt off from the inside. DO NOT USE THIS. Go to your family doctor.

It generally works; I've used this 3xs in 2 yrs now and have only been mildly unhappy once when my YI came back (probably the fault of antibiotics and not Mon 1).

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	5/21/2012 5:14:40 PM	After getting bit by a dog I was on antiobiotics for awhile and started to feel the symptoms of a YI. It was extremely itchy so I decided to go down to the store and grab a self remedy, I didn't feel any intense burning and the itching immediately went away; however my inner Vagina is extremely swollen and it's annoyingly painful to sit down. The burns is very mild, it is just a little uncomfortable. The drug is inconvenient but it works.

It has been 8 hours since the application. I noticed a little burning once the suppository was in but I thought it was normal. The pain and burning worsened and now the opening and inside of my vagina is swollen shut. I am now bleeding from it. I cannot rinse it out. I have no insurence and can't get to a doctor, the main reason why I needed to self treat. I can only hope this will go away and there will be no damage to me from this product.

But when that didn't work I got the Monistat 1 because i didn't want to treat for 7 days.  After i inserted, i got online and read some reviews and became EXTREMELY concerned.  I have had problems with the Monistat7 causing itching.  I waited and waited for the pain others had described, but it never came.  I was able to fall asleep and woke with no pain or itching. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	4/11/2012 10:36:54 PM	I felt I needed to write a foil to all the negative reviews. I used Monistat 1 yesterday for my first yeast infection. This did burn/itch for about 20 minutes an hour after insertion, however after wiping off the excess, the burning was mild and my symptoms started to clear in 4 hours. 24 hours later, my yeast infection is almost completely gone and I feel totally normal again. I used it in the evening, so I went straight to bed after inserting it. I had a mild infection and this worked perfectly, so it CAN work, it just doesn't appear that it works positively for everyone. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	2/20/2012 3:58:19 AM	I've taken this in the past for a YI. My Trivora birth control has been giving me clock work YI and in the past Monostat 1 has worked. However, I used it this past week for a particularly bad YI. I experienced severe burning and abnormal spotting. I normally start my cycle on the 24-25th pill; I started spotting abnormally on the 20th pill. It cleared up my YI effectively but it left my skin irritated and caused abnormal spotting. After a few days, I had sex with my fiance and afterwards I experienced intense burning and discomfort (highly unusual for me). After inspection, I found that my vaginal skin was so irritated and inflamed that it even hurt to sit down. I'm completely upset by this abnormal reaction. I expected the medication to work like it has in the past; it did not. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	2/7/2012 9:37:44 PM	*WARNING* I have read several reviews and even with hesitation I still decided to take this medication. First and foremost I made it a point to come on here and leave this comment. Second I thought I was going to have to seek medical attention. I did not take the medication at bed time (thank god) because no one can sleep through that type of pain. I will say this I'm not prone to YI so I've come to the conclusion that my experience was so intense because I had a very mild YI so the Monistat 3 or 7 day might have been better. Now back to the pain.... I took the medication mid-day and within an hour I felt some discomfort, within the next two hours my pain was so intense I begin to lose feeling in my legs and I was unable to walk straight the only thing I could focus on was the fact that when I got home I would do all that was humanly possible to get the medicine out of my body. As the day went on and the expulsion of the medicine took place I started to feel some relief, my final thoughts on this product is this.... My YI was mild or better yet irrelevant compared to me using the Monistat 1 this medicine caused pain that I have never felt before and I would never wish that on my worst enemy. BUYER BEWARE
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/21/2012 11:33:11 PM	I experienced some mild internal burning sensation, but it didn't bother me that much. It did clear my infection by morning though. I would say if you can handle the mild burning then use it, otherwise go for a longer day treatment.

I hate to write just to complain, but people need to know there is something wrong with this product. Do not take the risk, just call your dr. After an hour from inserting the &quot;pill&quot; I had horrible itching, soreness, pain, and swelling that was WAY worse than the actual infection. I went online and started reading all the reviews, and how most women are reporting the same experience. I took a bath trying to get as much of that stuff out as I could. I feel better now but probably will still have issues until all the medicine comes out. I wish I would have read these reviews first. Just some advice if you do use it and have the same reaction- I read a review from a lady who said just to douche and get it out immediately and you should feel fine. I can't even walk right now, so I will not be making the drug store run tonight to get some, but I do feel most of the pain gone just from taking the bath and trying to rinse it out. I'm calling my gyn in the morning to get some pills! Hope this helps!

Monistat 1 is super powered b/c you only take 1 dose. 3 and 7 will be less strong and are likely to not bother you as much.

I have never felt a more intense pain in my life. I was in my bathroom curled up in a ball bawling my eyes out in front of my entire family. Very embarrassing. I got up to use the restroom and it all leaked out out of me making it even worse! If you use this, use it with caution...or maybe try the 3day. I will never use another monistat product again. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	12/20/2011 11:55:59 PM	OK, my fiance and I should have read these reviews first before I desperately sent him to the drugstore to buy medicine. I agree: it feels worse than the discomfort caused by the infection itself. I'm on fire! To the point I was crying earlier. I hope this takes care of the problem otherwise it's not worth the torture. I wish they had something in the box that said that intense pain and burning could occur. They refer to mild symptoms. No, not mild, my friends...

Felt YI symptoms coming on,called Dr for diflucan but they never called it in so I opted for the 1day treatment which I never do. Saturday night inserted capsule and became a victim of &quot;fire crotch&quot; by Sunday morning, worse by Monday, even showering burned like %#!?@. Far worse that the actual YI.  Started to wonder if I had misdiagnosed so jumped online an see I'm not alone.  Currently Tues nite, burning less severe but itching terribly

Within a day all of my issues where gone, and my symptoms were horrible and painful, worst itch ever!  To previous reviews...how can you judge the medicine based on 1 hour after taking it...its 1 day not 1 hour... anywho, I had no reaction to it but maybe for others its too strong and they should go with the 3 or 7 day. I am actually about to head out to get some for my 2nd infection :(  this one is due to antibiotics and the first infection was from a heartburn medicine.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	11/14/2011 1:12:18 PM	Used this product before I went to bed and felt completely fine the next day.  No burning or itching like other users.  Only complaint is that it is a bit leaky and it's been two days since I've used it and I still have this thick white pasty medicine that is slowly making its way out of me.  I feel better so I guess it's the price I'll pay.

IM PISSED&gt; i cant stop scratching. i guess this is the price women pay. im effing MAD
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	10/26/2011 2:19:20 PM	Though it's important to consider all the other negative reviews, just be smart about taking this medication. First, make sure your doctor has confirmed that it's a yeast infection. Take it before bed or when you know you'll just be chilling out, and take a benadryl maybe 15 minutes before with a glass of water just in case you have an allergic reaction. My body was totally fine with it and I just had some minor burning--but that was to be expected. If you start swelling or itching really badly, wipe the excess medication off and sit in a warm bath without soap. Good luck!

This was my first yeast infection and a friend recomended monostat I will NEVER purchase this product again it has only been in my system about an hour and I am ready to go crazy from the discomfort. I wish I had read these review before purchasing the product. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	9/18/2011 1:41:28 PM	Should either come with a bold warning on the front of the box stating:  Causes extreme swelling, itching and burning far worse than your actual yeast infection, or it should be pulled from shelves.

I inserted it at 10pm and applied the cream, went to bed at 11 without any symptoms besides a little uneasy about having a large ovule inside me.  I woke up for roughly 30 minutes at 4am with slight discomfort- I felt as though I could feel the ovule inside me, but it was not painful.  Although it has only been 24 hours, I have no symptoms, itching, burning, or discomfort.  However, I am little confused by the the thick white pasty discharge, but it seems normal from all the reviews.  Its declining in amount as time goes on. But I feel normal again!

One hour after inserting, I was itchy, and on fire. I was crying so bad. I took Benydrl for the discomfort. It helped a little so i can get some rest.I would not recommend this drug to anyone.

I had increased itching and burning along with internal swelling. I found it difficult to stand or sit. I also noticed that after using this product I had an increase in discharge. I had to seek medical attention to find another option for treatment of my condition. Before I was able to see a doctor I had to take benedryl to try and decrease the swelling from the allergic reaction I was having to this medication. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	JA, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	7/16/2011 10:16:14 AM	The rewards are NOT outweighing the benefits. I noticed the early signs of a YI and took this product thinking it would resolve the issue in one day. WRONG! I blame my ignorance/lack of research for not knowing this product is simply a one-dose treatment...not a quick-fix. I even took the product in the evening, so the morning after was fairly mild. Since then, I've felt a warm, thick, cottage cheese-like discharge constantly. My vaginal area is red and raw, with a thin waxy film over my labia. Other reviews indicate it may be too strong, so if I can warn even one other unsuspecting female who has the foresight to research before trying this product (unlike myself), then my only suggestion would be GO NATURAL. The last time I had a YI, I took the 7-day cream which was messy, but much more gentle and combined that with a cooling application of unflavored yogurt for my lady-parts. The symptoms were gone within 3 days (but you must continue) and the yogurt worked tremendously better than the chemical soaked external cream included in my torture pack. I have no choice but to ride this out, constantly remove gunk-like egg ovule discharge from &quot;down there&quot; and wait the seven days I would've been waiting either way. Convenience certainly came with a price! I'm not looking forward to future YI's but if it ever occurs again, I'm looking more into the ACV douches and Acidophilus as a remedy.

However, after enduring about two to three hours of intense discomfort, I awoke refreshed and I have not itched or felt the usual yeast infection symptoms and I am now on day four.  So, I guess the discomfort was worth the pain for me.

It's been about 4 hours since using the ovule and I must say I noticed a difference within 2 hours. I don't notice itching or burning but I do notice a warm like sensation but it is not uncomfortable or irritating. I did have some issues with the medication leaking but that happens with the cream as well.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/1/2011 1:04:16 AM	omg this is the WORST yeast infection medication ever! don't know how its still on the market. i will never buy any monistat again just because they allow monistat 1 to be sold.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/22/2011 9:06:40 PM	extreme swelling and burning of vulva and vagina within hours of insertion. SCARY and willnot use or recommend ever again. This should be taken off the market. I also am a health care provider and didn't want to wait til monday for an rx for diflucan, hoping to get started on my relief over the weekend. As it is I will probably call in sick tomorrow because I can hardly sit or walk. This cure is absolutely worse than any symptom. With all the complaints posted on the web, I am stunned that the manufacturer hasn't reformulated the product or taken it off the market. This is a travesty for women's health!!

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	5/12/2011 12:31:04 AM	Monistat 1 causes a major burning sensation. I inserted the ovule last night and then applied the external cream. My external vaginal area now burns much more than it did before any treatment. It's bothering me so much that I decided to Google &quot;Does Monistat 1 work well.&quot; I wish I Googled that before I treated myself. I've come to learn that many, many women feel much worse after treatment than before - the burning is extremely uncomfortable. I've used Monistat 7 before and it worked great, but I decided to try Monistat 1 thinking it would cure me quicker. However, I've since learned that either way it takes about 7 days. It's too late for me to switch now - I just hope that by day 7 I'm cured. I wish I used Monistat 7 instead  - I remember the cream felt soothing (which is much better than Monistat 1's terrible burning).

I cried and had to rinse off the cream that I put on the outside. Im still miserable and have to tough it out tonight, honestly not worth it, I shoudl of just went straight to the doctors instead of trying to deal with the pain :( im not having a goodnight at all. By far the worst pain and discomfort ever.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	5/5/2011 11:18:33 AM	I self-diagnosed, based on many years' experience with occasional yeast infections.  I'd never used the 1-day before.  Within minutes of use, I was burning, inflamed, and scared that I'd done something horrible to myself!  The whole area, including my anus was swollen and stinging.  I don't recommend this to anyone, and don't think it should be sold over-the-counter!  I did try to sponge it off, and went to sleep.  When I woke up, the burning was mostly gone, but I still feel some, 12 hours later.  It remains to be seen whether it was effective in treating the problem.  I wish I had looked online at the comments BEFORE using it!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	5/1/2011 11:12:14 PM	Had a YI after taking strong antibiotics, bought Monistat 1 b/c I thought it would be the most hassle-free of all the Monistats. Wish I never took it, I'd rather deal w/ the YI, which wasn't even bad to begin with. The YI was nothing compared to the pain I'm in from this med. I took the ovule at 1 AM on a Fri and Sat afternoon I began getting extreme itching and soon after extreme burning. my vagina feels sore and raw both the vulva and inside the vaginal canal. Now it hurts when I urinate as well. I tried my best to get the med out but it didn't work. I can't touch anywhere in my genital area without severe pain. I'd say this is an allergic reaction but it seems too many women are having these same symptoms for us all to be having reactions. I think its just a very higly concentrated dosage, the 7 day cream probably would have been a better bet. Scratching like a lunatic for days probably didn't help my skin's condition when it came time to insert the ovule either...maybe thats why some ppl don't seem to have such bad side effects, they don't scratch beforehand? All I know is I'm not being a baby, this is literally torture, I feel like I have vulvodynia (I hope not!). I hope this goes away b/c I don't think I can take it much longer. I have some slight swelling but its not too bad. It hurts to sit, walk, urinate, even if my legs are too close together. I have to sit with my legs wide open, lol. Never again.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	justme, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/9/2011 7:43:50 PM	I've decided to write a review since there are a lot of neg ones.  I'll be honest, when I first took this I didn't have the most pleasant experience and reading some reviews freaked me out.  Here's my history -- I was diagnosed with yeast infection last year by my obgyn of which she prescribed a one day oral medicine. It took a few days for it to work, but I don't recall having any side effects.  Now recently I've noticed symptoms again.  So I used Vagisil to diagnose myself and it seems my pH level was telling me I have yeast infection. So I decided to use Monistat 1 because it seems more convenient and I hate taking medicines. So here's my experience with Monistat 1 -- I used this on a Friday night and was able to sleep. The next day, I noticed every time I used the restroom I get a LOT white pastey discharge afterward (so wear a pad)!  I was also somewhat sore (vagina) after I used the restroom, to the point where I tried to avoid going because I didn't want to feel the pain and deal with the discharge. By Sat night, I was in a lot of pain down there and very sore -- a soreness I'm not used to feeling and it kinda swelled. Yet, I was able to suck it up and have a night in downtown.  I used the external cream twice that day.  On Sunday, I still get the white pastey discharge, but it wasn't nearly as much as on Sat.. by the end of Sunday it was nearly gone. The soreness was very little this time. And I noticed I've stopped itching for the most part and used the cream maybe twice again. On Monday, I was really itchy in the middle of the day but it suddenly stopped completely and I had very little white pastey discharge.  I used the itchiness only once in the morning since I didn't take it with me to work. On Tuesday, I still used the external cream in the morning in case, but didn't itch at all.  And since Tuesday, I feel normal.  My body appears normal.  Although my experience on Saturday was at times unbearable -- it all worked out for me in the end.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	noodle202, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	1/31/2011 4:56:45 PM	I hope I provide some insight as I have a lot of experience: Used Monistat-1 Ovule three times, 1-pre filled applicator 2 times, 3 day creams 2 times... have had multiple yeast infections, diagnosed by doctors. Monistat-1 is a very concentrated, powerful dose. It does produce burning and swelling, but even the weaker creams have that effect to a point. And the more raw you are from the yeast to begin with, the stronger this reaction will feel. The first two times I used the ovule, it did feel intense for the first night, but quickly relieved the symptoms and did the job. This last time was four days ago... I'm not sure why this time was different for me, but I am convinced i suffered a chemical burn from this medication. The day of taking the med was fine, but the next day and for 3 days now I have been bleeding moderately. By that- I mean not as heavy as my normal peried but heavy enough that a panty liner isn't enough - I need an actual pad. There has been bits of tissue and skin in the blood.  Also, that next day, I was literally swollen shut and felt my heart beat pounding through that entire area... throbbing. I used cold packs. I will not say it was 'intolerable, i was crying/dying!' because I am too realistic for that. It was quite painful &amp; I'm sure I've peeled off the top layer of inner vaginal skin, possibly my cervix. I hope there is no permanent damage. This is not safe or healthy in the least, don't use the 1 ovule unless you have a severe, thick cream discharge. I will never use this strong of a dose again, stick with 7 or 3 day creams.

Although I was skeptical I tried Mon1 for the 1st time last year and surprisingly it did the job. I remember feeling a LITTLE burn after insertion but literally only for a few minutes. I used it 2 days ago for the second and LAST time. It made my symptoms worse and even caused more symptoms. I'm miserable now. This is what I get for trying to save time and money. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	1/20/2011 7:28:01 PM	after using this medication I had more pain than from the Uti or the yeast infection. I had to go to the Doctor,and it is 3 days after stopping this med and I still have a pain after uninating. It is ahorrible drug.

I have red chunks of myself coming out! It is unbelievably scary. Thank heavens I was able to get an appt. with the gynecologist tomorrow. This is one of the worst reactions I have ever had to any drug. I'm just hoping I don't have some kind of permanent physical damage from it.

After taking an antibiotic I knew what to expect...YI! Felt it starting up and was out of diflucan and new in town so I don't have a dr. yet (have an appt next week). Bought the 1 day Monistat and am in severe pain - burning, swelling, can't walk, can't sit, can't sleep. I even checked the area and it's disgusting - swollen ten times normal size, maybe more.  This is the worst product EVER! The only minor relief I get is taking 600 mg motrin every 4 hours but we are talking only &quot;minor&quot; relief.

I have taken it twice before, and never had a problem - the cream actually soothed the itching right away! HOWEVER, this American treatment is nothing short of HORRIFIC. My genitals are burning, and I am mortified they allow this to be on the market! And I can say from experience a 1 day treatment certainly DOES NOT need to hurt to be effective! I am disgusted. Women of America, you need to take the time to formally complain about this product!!!

I feel horrible, I took the product back to the store and the pharmacy told me that &quot;if it didn't work, than maybe I don't have a yeast infection&quot; that is total BS this product needs to be recalled. I want to just sleep and not be in pain. My mom suggested that I take a bath with tea tree oil and cover my vagina with &quot;live bacteria yogurt&quot; I did and it worked ! DO not use this product!

I felt a yeast infection coming on so I bought the 3 day monistat and within 30 of using I was in the shower cleaning myself because of the burning sensation. Go to your gyno!! I will never use again!!

BIG mistake. I had a little itch from the YI that I really only noticed when I wiped. I put in the cream and boy did it get worst instead of better. Itching and burning kept me up for quite a while. When I woke up this morning and went to wipe I felt like I had been kicked &quot;there&quot;. It hurts to touch it, hurts to sit etc. Feels like it's bruised or something. I haven't gotten the nerve to look at it to see if it looks like others have mentioned. I just hope this goes away FAST!
Other	sunnyone22, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	7/30/2010 4:20:26 PM	Well here's the thing...you have to make sure that what you have is actually a yeast infection!  I made the mistake of assuming that's what it was...because I had never heard of bacterial vaginosis.  I used monistat for three nights and it burned like crazy...I decided to stop using it and go to planned parenthood.  The clinician there thought I had herpes! She said she saw some blisters.... For Pete's sake! I was so confused....  when I went to another doctor she said that I had a bacterial infection but didn't see blisters.  I asked if it could have been the monistat that caused a reaction like that and she said yes.    By the way I was tested twice and I do not have any stds at all, including herpes...so all I know is that I used monistat and it gave me blisters, however they didn't see yeast when they examined me.  Of course after I used the anti bacterial I got a yeast infection but I used a prescription and it was much easier.  Use an anti fungal pill if you can...most creams burn you, though not as bad as monistat, and a pill can get rid of any yeast in your bum hole too.  Serious, yeast gets in there too ...  yeesh.

There was excess burning and itching once the product was inserted. I couldn't sleep. However, by the third night, the burning had ceased, and the itching decreased. This product has put me at ease. Im on day 4 and i feel like myself again, I will continue to use the external cream till day 7. The external cream also burned at first, but now it just gives a warming sensation.

However it DID say in the leaflet inside that pain, swelling and discomfort might occur and that it was normal for the medication.  However since then the wipes and the cream feel great and it seems to be working, however it hasn't been 24 hours yet.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		7/12/2010 5:43:04 PM	Take this garbage off the market!! I used this for an OBVIOUS YI with classic symptoms due to taking antibiotics for a dental abcess. NO STDS, NO bacterial infection, no agressive or permiscuous sex, etc. 24 hrs later I am now swollen internally, burning internally &amp; in more pain than before I used the product. I removed as much of it as possible and will probably have to treat the YI with the 7 day method whenever I can stand anything touching that area. At the moment I'd rather just have the YI.  
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	goawayitchiness , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	6/16/2010 2:10:40 PM	It hasn't even been 24 hours and I'm already feeling some relief. The first thing you ladies need to understand is that a yeast infection is a FUNGUS, not bacterial (I'm not sure but it might be possible to have a fungal and bacterial infection at the same time...do your own research). I loled at some of these reviews because of that misunderstanding. Get your facts straight first. Now the only thing that I regret is not going to the doctor to figure out what strain of yeast this is. That is important to know. Another thing is make sure that it is a yeast infection and not an STD. If you're experiencing blood/blisters with the discharge, it could be an STD or you could be having an allergic reaction to this medicine. It hasn't cleared up for me yet (obviously cause it has only been approx. 24 hours), but I'm trying to be patient. It can take up to a week to clear up. Fortunately for me, this medication hasn't burned too bad at all. According to my symptoms this is the first yeast infection that I have ever had. My advice is if you experience YI symptoms, go to the doctor first if you can and ask them to figure out what strain it is so that the right medicine can be taken. I didn't know that before I bought Monistat 1 (I was feeling desperate and wanted to start treatment right away). Patience is key. So far so good. Good luck and get well soon!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	5/29/2010 2:05:22 PM	NEVER NEVER never never ever use this product!!! I am not prone to yeast infections. But I had to take an antiobotic for a sinus infection and presto! within 5 days I had a very mild case yeast infection. Nothing major, but I new it was an infection. I bought Monistat 1 and inserted the egg with ease at around 10pm. Ok, everything seemed fine...until around 1am. I woke up and it felt like my vagina and vulva were on FIRE!!! I have a high tolerance for pain, but this left me in tears.  I was contemplating going to the ER, but instead I jumped in the shower and doused my vayjayjay with ice cold water.  well that helped a little.  I was finally able to fall asleep after applying a cold wash cloth soaked in cold chamomile tea to my 'area'.  NEVER buy this product and tell any and all women to NEVER buy this product.

So much for having quick treatment!!!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	Heather, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	4/12/2010 4:08:40 AM	I read others' reviews directly after taking this product and recall thinking to myself, &quot;Wow... They're being such babies.&quot; and went to bed. Two hours later, I wake up in severe pain with EXTREME itching in my vaginal canal. I have NEVER been in this amount of discomfort from taking a medication. I highly suggest you not use Monistat 1 unless you know you can take a medication that will knock you out through the pain &amp; itching!!! 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	3/29/2010 4:05:50 PM	I have used the Monistat 3-day before with no side effects but the 1-day has been extremely painful.  Inserted at bedtime and in the morning had severe stomach cramps lasting a full day and slightly into the next day.  Also, severe pain &quot;down there&quot; with inability to sleep or get relief.  I would not recommend this medication.  The itching has stopped but the pain continues and is miserable.

I'M GOING TO GO SEE THE DOCTOR TOMORROW.  MY INFECTION WASNT EVEN VERY BAD TO BEGIN WITH. THE MONISTAT 1 MADE IT JUST AWEFUL.  I USED IT THRUSDAY NIGHT - WAS UP ALL NIGHT WITH SEVERE BURNING - I EVEN SAT IN A BATH AND TRIED TO WASH IT OFF AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF, BUT IT DIDN'T HELP MUCH.  IT'S NOW SUNDAY EVENING AND IT IS STILL KILLING ME.  I HAVE BLISTERS AND SOME OF MY SKIN IS PEELING.  PEEING, WALKING - EVEN WEARING CLOTHES IS EXCRUCIATING.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. I STRONGLY CAUTION YOU.  THE ALL OF THE OTHER REVIEWS ARE RIGHT ON THE MONEY.   
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	2/11/2010 1:34:34 AM	I am a freshman in college and bought this product after realizing i had a yeast infection. i would never comment on a medication, but i am warning. the monistat 1 i took may have been the worst experience ever. i am lying in bed right now in severe pain due to the horrible burning. it feels like someone struck a match and shoved it up my vagina. i do not recommend. i have read many reviews and some were positive regarding the 7 day treatment; perhaps that is less harsh. also, some reviews that were written by those with reoccuring yeast infections OR in their 40's/50's were fine. i applied the external cream to see if it would help the itching, but it feels even worse. i just want to sleep =[ i advise you to take any other medication but this one. you may react fine to it, but trust me, it is NOT worth the pain if you don't. i called my mom crying. this is terrible.

It's 3 am and I am up on here crying and writing a review to warn you guys that I am having a severe reaction to this medication.  It's burns, itches and I am so uncomfortable that I can't sleep.  I am so miserable.  This has happened before and I was just so desperate to get rid of this infection that I went against my better judgement.  This really sucks...
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	1/27/2010 11:11:51 AM	Ladies, PLEASE only use this treatment if you are also okay with fire-ants in your vagina. I never write product reviews, but I was compelled to for this one. Awful.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	25-34	1/8/2010 4:17:20 PM	I am plagued by yeast infections and have been for years.  I usually use Diflucan and find relief after 7 days, only to have them return every 3 months.  Once, I used the Monistat 7 day cream and it made my infection worse - burning, itching, painful mess and swore I would never use Monistat again.  However, I got a yeast infection when I was out of town and had no refills for a diflucan and couldn't see my doctor. Out of desperation I tried the Monistat 1 ovule instead of the cream and to my relief started feeling a little better after 3 days. Was still a little itchy on day 5 but the symptoms were definitely lessening. It's now the 7th day and I'm not having anymore symptoms (other than discolored discharge from the medicine I think which I hope goes away soon - having to wear pantyliners was a pain) so I hope the infection is completely gone. I also ate TONS of yogurt so that may have helped too. Normally my infections are severe but luckily this one was mild. I'm not sure if it's because of the medicine or what but I am proud and excited to say I think it worked!!  So I think the only way you'll ever know if Monistat works for you is to try the cream and the ovule because one worked for me, one didn't.  HOORAY for finding an OTC yeast infection cure!!!!!

So....I purchased this as I wanted a quick solution to an infection I hadn't gotten since high school (I'm 28). I read the reviews on this site AFTER taking the medication and was petrified! However, I was pleased to learn that it worked withing 2 days-my symptoms had disappeared! Yes, there was some burning but nothing near to what some reviewers have claimed! Anyway, I reviewed this product because it worked for me and its common knowledge that u will not find many good reviews on products because of the reason I listed above. Everyone is different and good luck!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	11/30/2009 7:46:21 PM	I took this last Tuesday. It is now Monday. I have had burning, swelling, blisters that have all burst and have left raw pink skin that makes me cry when I pee. I will never take this again. If you have sensitve skin do not take this product. I have never felt this kind of pain. I don't even know if the yeast infection is still there, all I can feel is the external iching and burning left by what is clearly a reaction to medication that is way to strong. After 6 days I still feel horrible.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/9/2009 9:22:09 PM	I used this product for the first time never even bothered to read any review or anything I just knew I wanted the infection gone fast.  About an hr in I was crying a bit it hurt so much I wanted to take it out.  I stuck it out and it got a bit better. 9:22 pm the next day and I almost dont feel anythign anymore.  Only pain I still have is when Im wiping but its getting better too.  For everyone who said its a bad medicine, it not it just puts you in pain for a while for me it was for a half hr.  When the pain starts its because the medicine is working and killing off the bacteria.  Make sure your willing to stick it out before you buy the product.  Hope this helps Good luck to who ever read this.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/27/2009 3:52:06 PM	Ok,I think I have read all 41 comments. Every one of them is accurate. I used this medication 3 days ago. My symptoms has worsened and I am feeling miserable. The burning is unbearable and it seems as if the medicine leaks. It doesn't seem to have cured the original problem which wasn't that bad to begin with. Thisis a horrible product. Be advised before using. However, looking at the comments, it seems asif most of us don't do research until after the damage is done.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	8/10/2009 4:43:54 PM	I took this at 930am and it is now 445pm and I feel almost completely better.  I read these reviews right after I took it and I was terrified.  I had already take it, though, so all I had to do was wait.  The only thing that happened was I got better.  The burning and itching went away almost immediately and now the swelling is almost completely gone.  There is still discharge, but it is decreasing.  I strongly suggest this to anyone with a bad yeast infection.

My vagina felt like it was on fire...it worsened my condition...as soon as I used it (3hrs ago), I felt a slight itch relief followed by an intense burning. I had to wash it all out in a warm bath...it was the only thing that helped...I then applied a topical antibiotic and I feel much better now. DO NOT USE...medicine is very strong...it will burn your genitals...i was even bleeding a little bit..AWFUL!!!!!!!!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	7/27/2009 11:32:57 PM	i havent had a yeast infection since high school, and was excited to see they now offer a one time use treatment. however, that excitement quickly diminished. within five minutes of inserting the ovule and applying the 'soothing' cream, my vagina felt like it was on fire. i had to immediately wash it off, which provided a little relief. but, the medication from the ovule continued to irritate the inner vulvar area for days. there was swelling and it literally looked as if the top layer of skin was removed. it has been five days since i took this medication. the pain has subsided and the yeast infection appears to be gone. but the skin is still rough and sore. im going to my gyno to make sure it didnt do any severe damage. i would not recommend this treatment to anyone. take the longer cream treatments, or just go to your doctor for a pill. this was agony.

I can't imagine there being a yeast infection bad enough to justify the burning and sheer suffering that ensues after using this product. This needs to be under review by the FDA!

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	7/1/2009 11:43:18 AM	I felt a yeast infection coming on due to medications. I stopped on Monday to pick this up and used it Monday pm before bed.I woke up during the night on fire!!! So very sore which as of today, Wednesday still continues. The last few days have been terrible. I would not suggest this to anyone. I wish I could get my money back. Today I'm off for pills so I can try to get some control on this.

Sitting on an ice pack never felt so good. This should be banned from store shelves. Buyer beware!!!! Do not use! Infection was 20 times worse after I used this medication. Just pick up the phone and call your doctor! 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	6/22/2009 4:23:49 PM	Within hours of inserting the ovule, i was on fire.  i felt like i had acid inside my vagina.  i had to go in late to work because couldn't sit still or stand comfortably. i even called my doctor to see if she thought i was having an allergic reaction and she said i wasn't.  she said she hears the same thing from her patients all the time and she thinks it should be off the market.  next time, i will stick with the 7 day. 
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	6/4/2009 12:55:38 PM	Ahhhh! What a nightmare! This stuff is killing me...not literally, but it definitely is a big NO NO for me. I took it last night, forgetting my doc had prescribed me Diflucan. It kept me from sleeping because of cramping, and increased the itching! I had to take aleve and a muscle relaxer this morning to get rid of the cramps. Luckily, my doc said I could also take my prescription today. By the way, one dose of the Diflucan cleared the symptoms in less than 24 hrs, last time I took it. Anyway, I will NEVER use this crap again!!!!!!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	5/16/2009 12:51:59 PM	Wow.I really wish I would I have read these reviews. I took this at 9pm last night so I could sleep through any discomfort... the pain was so bad, I woke up and could not sleep. I wanted someone to just knock me out with a two by four. The itching increased dramatically, almost to the point I thought I was going to pass out. It's not 12:00pm the next day and I still have itching and burning... I'm hoping that this is just a side effect and it will start clearing up by tonight. I really don't know that it's worth it to go through this pain caused by this medication. It's absolute torture.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	5/1/2009 6:29:04 PM	This treatment was a NIGHTMARE!!  I don't know why it's on the market.  I've used the three day before with no problems, thought I would try the one day this time.  BURNING, SWELLING, misery.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	4/30/2009 10:52:13 PM	Everyone was correct in saying that it made the condition much worse, BUT that was right before it got better. I did it about 3pm. By 8pm that night i was in terrible pain: burning and itching. But by the next day...NOTHING. the infection felt like it was completely gone. I suggest you buy separate Vagisil wipes. They really helped to numb the pain at night and helped me fall asleep. This drug was painful but it actually worked!

I've always in the past successfully fought yeast infections on my own using natural treatments, some of which came recommended straight from my doctor. However, this infection seemed worse than any other before, so I caved and went for some OTC medication. I figured I'd go with the 1-day since I wanted to over with as fast as possible.Had I known how I'd suffer, I'd have chosen to suffer less for longer. Within an hour of inserting the ovule, I thought I was losing my mind. The itching sensation went from about a 2 up to a solid 10!! I found myself pacing the room, then using a cool damp wash cloth to try to sooth my poor lady bits. I love the statement, &quot;If you have these side effects, discontinue use.&quot; That's pretty hard to do there, Monistat!!! Thanks for the taunting! Next time, I'll choose to either do my own treatment or use the 3-day form. This 1-day, make you lose your mind, want to scratch your inside out thing is the PITS.

Swelling, burning and blistered!! Dr. called in oral meds...2 weeks later still trying to get after effects under control. This made the infection so much worse!! BAD BAD STUFF!!
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	3/27/2009 8:07:08 PM	I WILL NEVER USE THIS DRUG AGAIN!!! This 1 day prescription caused the burning and itching to get a million times worse.. I would not reccomend this to anyone!!! I could barely go to work today!!!

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	2/19/2009 12:04:30 PM	I agree w/ previous commentors and say go with the 3 day treatment.  I took the one day before bed and woke up feeling 2 times worse! Definetly increased the swelling and burning! I could hardly sit, stand, walk, or move at all within the following 24 hours.  A friend suggested zinc oxide cream in the baby isle to help the external burning and swelling.  Thank god for the suggestion, it helped some.  This medication is only good if you enjoy the pain of a yeast infection and want more!

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	none,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female		1/13/2009 11:33:14 PM	So basically it's really easy to use - and by &quot;use&quot; i mean burn the crap out of your vagina! I can not believe that this is on the market. I haven't had a yeast infection in 8 or 9 years so was happy to see a 1 day option. But wow...I had to take a friggin' loratab to get the pain under control and thought I might end up in the ER. I wish I had read these reviews before. There should be some MAJOR warnings on this thing. Whomever is responsible ought to be ashamed.
Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	1/13/2009 1:05:06 PM	One evening I started to feel a little itching.  That next morning I picked up some monistat 1 from the pharmacy.  After I used the monistat 1 the feeling went from a little itching to severe burning way worse than any yeast infection I had ever had.  I used it during the day and hopefully that was smart because after the burning I wanted all of it to leak out ASAP. The next morning the burning was a little better but still there. I am waiting for it to go away. I called and got a prescription for an oral medication that actually treats the infection without the severe burning...would recommend calling a doctor to get that or using a monistat version that isn't as strong.  Never again.

Haven't had a yeast infection in years so I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was 1 dose treatment.  I had temporary relief then the onset of burning around the vulva.  Going back to the 3 day dosage.  Monistat, take note.
