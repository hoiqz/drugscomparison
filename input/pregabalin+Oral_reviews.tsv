Neuropathic Pain	OMSHRI, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	4/8/2011 8:34:52 AM	I am 64.5 years male and have flashes electrical current in the brain when I go to bed that lifts my torso from the bed. It is bewildering, and methinks it stops heart and brain function immediately momentarily. I am unable to sleep despite medication with Clonzepam and Pregabalin with Methylcobalmin once daily. Only when it is day-break I can sleep for an hour or two.Also, prior to this sometimes, I hear sounds like hissing or the one that we hear before the water boils and it suddenly becomes the one mentioned above.I am unable to tell what ailment it is. All tests have been found normal except MRI, in which, normal changes due to ageing are apparent. I have pain for thirty years in lower abdomen and waist, in thoracic region and also in neck for last few years.

My husband said it was like a seizure.  the doctor ran all kinds of tests, and they ran heart and brain tests which all came back negative.  it was very costly to me, and the only thing i got from this crap was lots of medical bills and loss of work and couldn't drive.

At 150 mg. daily, saw some improvement in the neck pain but none for the adhesions. Started noticing increased drowsiness. Dr. upped the dose to 250 mg. day and the drowsiness got much worse - 2 hour &quot;naps&quot; in the afternoon and extreme difficulty waking up in the a.m.

My starting dose was 150 mg per day. After the first 2 weeks there was an improvment in my daily functioning, as well as my pain; however, after 4 weeks my rheumatologist had to double my dose to 300 mg per day. I am 3 days into the new dose and although I am a little foggy-brained, I believe it is beginning to make a difference. The cost is a concern because it is not a preferred medication for Blue-Cross. So far, so good!

I do not think it has really helped with the constant pain. My doctor has now increased my dose to 100mg twice a day compared to 50mg three times a day. that's an additional 50mg per day that I will be taking. I'm not really expecting much in the way of any pain relief from this but I am willing to give it a try anyway just to get some pain relief.  I will report back in the future.
Neuropathic Pain	Ian D Samson, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	10/6/2008 3:50:48 PM	Within 60 minutes of taking 150mg I notice a dramatic reduction in pain, and a dramatic increase in my ability to move, bend over, and go down on my haunches (squat). Getting back up is still very painful in knees and lower back. The medication is very good, has no side-effects, but I have noticed improved mood, &quot;waxing LYRICAl&quot;, becoming more eloquent (very similar to a Marijuana high) and have moved from 75mg bd to 150mg bd very easily. Still, I have to see a Neuro-Surgeon next week as I have two slipped discs and pronounced bulging of spinal cord. Have shooting pain into both legs, sciatica in sacro-iliacs, leg pain like a wrench is tightening every muscle and tendon, and sometimes it's impossible to walk. But LYRICA remains an excellent medication and I applaud the manufacturers.

This medication works somewhat well (better than the anti-depressants) for my anxiety, but not as well as Benzodiazepines that i have used in the past, which ELIMINATE anxiety.  It is also now without its side-effects.  I have widespread muscle and joint pain and i feel weak and lethargic all day.  It also has some sexual side effects which i will not go into.

Was taking Gabapentin before which worked well for the pain but couldn't shake the nasty side effects even after 2 months. Am having no side effects (that I'm aware of) on the Lyrica. Expensive if not covered,$180 for 100 (Canada),but its been worth it.
