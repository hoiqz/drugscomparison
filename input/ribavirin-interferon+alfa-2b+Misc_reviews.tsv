Immediatly after the treatment I tested with no virus dectected, 4 mths later I am back at 2 mill. The emotional devistation of this treatment failing is immeasurable. I also have fears that this drug regiment is known to cause cancer and I cannot find enough information one way of the other to either support these fears or eliviate them! During the treatment my red blood count was dangerously low. To the point of feeling like I would have a heart attack just walking across a small room. My doctor relied too much on her assistant who was very young and inexperienced. If i had not been persistant I could easily have died.  If you are planning on doing this treatment make certain you have a doctor you can trust.

Chronic Hepatitis C	John, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	2	Male	55-64	11/2/2008 11:44:21 PM	Difficult treatment!!!  Did 20 weeks last year (2007.)  Had to quit due to a staph infection.  Viral Load went to undetectable, but was above 10,000,000 in about 6 months.  Have now done 44 more weeks of tx and viral load is once again undetectable.  I have had just about every side effect possible.  Nasty treatment!!!  I am hoping this 48 week tx will truly keep the virus undetectable.  Could not go thru this again.
