Epileptic Seizure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/15/2009 6:18:23 PM	I have been taking Dilantin Ex for over 17 years now, with no problems. But, due to a loss in drug coverage, I am now having to switch to generic, and my pharmacy only carries TARO brand... which does not look familiar to me... Has this specific brand been rated/reviewed before? I need help...

Insurance soon forced me to use generic phenytoin by refusing to pay for dilantin, which became unaffordable. Since taking Phenytoin Sodium Extended Caps at the rate of 800mg a day, (400mg am &amp; 400 pm) I haven't felt like my old self in years. Who makes this stuff anyway?

I have had 10 seizures total and only when I have mistaken, tried to change medication (by doctor suggestion), or had one too many drinks!!!I take 350 MG daily with virtually no side effects-no gum problems-however, I am 59 and sometimes have memory problems, but that could be due to my age!!!!

Convulsive Seizures	winesong, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	45-54	10/16/2008 12:06:28 PM	July'07 I suffered a hemorrhagic stroke accompanied by a grand mal seizure. I was prescribed phenytoin for approx. 6 weeks and allowed off the drug. Aug'08 I had a single mild seizure episode and have been taking 460mg. daily. along with 1000mg. keppra. I have not had anymore episodes, yet the side effects have been difficulty with short term memory, restless sleeping, slight mood swings and obvious problems with putting words together. I had been known for my articulation and excellent speaking abilities yet today I am very concerned with my inability to construct sentences. This may very well be aftereffects of the seizure, and or stroke. But I have gone this past year without these symptoms until the latest seizure and continued use of the current medications. I am also taking hypertension meds. and exercising regularly, along with a major reduction in alcohol consumption. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner 2 to 3 times a week. I feel great yet the lack of proper sleep is evasive to everyday life. The further I investigate these drugs the more I am suspicious of the phenytoin. At this time and point I must say though, the risks of stopping the prescribed doses against reoccurring seizure far outweigh a reason to stop the drugs.
