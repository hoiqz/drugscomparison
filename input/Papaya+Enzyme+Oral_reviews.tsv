I don't know if it is working or not. I think it is too soon to tell. I have taken the 9 a day which is recommended, sounds like alot for no benefits. I haven't had any good or bad experiences yet. It is too soon to tell. I guess it will effect everyone differently.

However, I began having a sore throat and saw a Dr who told me not to take this product. Am being treated for reflux but it is stronly felt that the Papaya caused me greater problems. Still have sore throat even though I am on omeprazole.Papaya initiated this reaction.

Since that episode, I have been to the ER two more times for continuing side effects &amp; two doctors, one specialist. I would seriously concider speaking to a health care professional before taking this.

I saw that it was good for digestion, but didn't know specifically what it was for. I started taking it and noticed that my heartburn and acid reflux were greatly relieved.  I had been taking two Pepcid every day. I wondered why my stomach felt so much better w/o the meds.  Then I realized it was the papaya enzyme. I take the chewable tablets, about tree or so a day.  If you have GERD, you should try it.

It works so much better than the chemical remedies like tums or such.

I have a lapband and occasionally have heartburn with acidic or difficult to digest foods. I started taking 3 papaya enzymes after food, no more heartburn. Very happy with the product.

This natural remedy has been more effective then doctor prescribed medications I was on and I've had no side effects like with the doctor prescribed meds. I take 6 pills most days but some days a few more (never exceeding the max dose) if I eat more tougher foods like meat and high fiber foods.

Papaya Enzyme will significantly lower the blood sugar, so watch and check your levels carefully. I take 5-7 tablets a day. Absolutely no side effects either! May not be able to take this supplement with most diabetes meds cause it will lower sugar too much! I am also losing weight since I am watching my diet more closely too to help with the sugar control. And don't neglect the exercise. I walk at least 30 min. each day. P.S. The supplement is much cheaper than the diabetes pills also. One bottle of 180 tablets lasts me a month!
