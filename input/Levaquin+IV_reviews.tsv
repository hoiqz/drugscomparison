The drug companys,hospitals, and doctors want you to usethis as a first line antibiotic.PLEASE for your own safety and that ofyour loved ones DO NOT USE THIS DRUGor fluoroquinolone drug class. Itcaused debilitating muscle wasting,loss of quality of life, and more.
Bacterial Infection with Bronchitis	unhappyrunner, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	5/3/2012 12:24:43 PM	Was prescribed Levaquin for sinus infection (500 mg  for 7 days) - muscle pain in hips and hamstrings and lower abs started on day 3 , by day 5 pain and cramping and muscle tearing so bad i could barely walk.  Pain would increase within 30 minutes of taking the medication and let up significantly after 12 hrs.  Asked on-call doctor to take me off it - he said I was imagining things.  Saw my doctor day after I fininshed prescription.  could already move better.   HAve been taking calcium, magnesium and potassium supplements which are helping and gradually increasing walks etc. It is 7 weeks after now and i still cannot run, in fact for firs time i tried to jog ( i could have walked faster) and could barely move after but at least I am slowly improving.  Apparently I was having severe muscle damage which may have affected my kidneys.  DO NOT let them give you this medication if you are an athlete.  I have since found several runners in my area who have had muscle and tendon problems from Levaquin. If Anthrax is not your problem - no reason to take a fluoroquinilone.  I have also heard that people have fewer problems with Avelox from that same family.
Pneumonia caused by Bacteria	Momo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	55-64	3/19/2012 2:29:49 AM	Received 3 IV doses of Levaquin in Hospital..4th dose was infusing and I had an anaphylatic reaction. I seriously thought I was going to die. Couldn't find nurse button, couldn't see, finally pinched off the IV line and the machine beeped. 15 seconds after pinching line symptoms begin to subside. Scared me witless.

Pneumonia caused by Pneumococcus Bacteria	Heather, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/23/2011 10:43:30 AM	One year ago I was treated in a hospital with Lev 750 mg, with prednisone(600 mg) NSAID's 2000 mg daily...was not told what drug was used but became crippled, inflamed IV site, thumbs would not work, wasting and weak. Drs. knew, did not stop, refused to tell me why I, having been a physically active healthy person, now crippled, my ADR was recorded in my medical records One year ago at this site, Levaquin was black boxed against giving to me and stated not to be given prednisone or NSAID's concomitant. I have a full thickness torn rotor cuff - along with several other drug induced ailments. Am in constant pain on opiates. The health care providers told me my &quot;bad infection&quot; did this to me...not true, Levaquin did this to me and they knew it. It is a black boxed drug with info to not give with certain other drugs as it intensifies the risks. It was not effective against the pneumonia. Where is the info? Why are you not publishing it anymore? I went from physically active - tennis, golf, kayaking, hiking to wheel chair bound waif. People are being crippled, suffering excruciating pains by a known risky drug. Shame on you!
Pneumonia caused by Bacteria	Atticus, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	2/26/2011 8:33:53 AM	I was given Levaquin IV in a hospital, not consulted. Nine months out - torn rotator cuff, adductor and gluteus maximus tears - excruicating pain which is treated with pain pills. I experienced a servere 'adverse' reaction within 24 hours - in a hospital. They then threw in Prednisone, blood thinners, NSAID's, depressants. I was 64 years old, on no meds and with no pre-existing conditions. The quality of my life is zero now. The black box warning is ignored by every watch dog agency - it has no meaning to physicians or any health care regulator. They all deny my tendinitus, ice pike headaches,and crippled gait was caused by this drug. Please know this is a real problem that all in the health care entities know about - just refuse to take it. That is the only recourse you have. If it does not get you the first time - it will the next. It's poison, happens to the young as well as elderly. It's a popular drug because it gives the physicians permanently disabled patients - they do not tell you it's the FQ's that did this to you - not one federal agency acknowledges the known dangers of this drug - lobbyist are in control. Refuse to be poisoned.
Other	Randy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	9/10/2010 5:47:29 PM	Treated in hospital for pneumonia - IV port site became inflamed, burning pain, lost use of thumbs, legs would not support me after 1 bag. By third day I went into resp. failure , rapid heart beat, no strength at all. Lucky me - they gave me 500 mg - yes, 500 mg. of predinsone for 3 days. The doctors can't read medical guides I guess. I now have a torn rotator cuff, hands and wrists painful. I have been tested for arthritis, Rheumism, vasculitis - neg. The drug is not effective against pneumonia - do not take unless you have no other option. 
Bacterial Pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus	Crippled, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	8/18/2010 2:05:25 PM	Treated in hospital with Levaquin IV 750 mg along with prednisone, NSAIDs. I was not consulted about the drugs used. First day my hand with IV port reddened, burning sensations, I could no longer walk nor lift my water glass. Nurses knew this, after five days of treatment, I went into acute resp failure, failure to thrive, acute toxicity. They changed IV port to other hand, I now have a half inch scar on my left hand.  No one told me any of this. They discharged me in worse shape than when I arrived. But it got much worse at home and I had no explanation for the burning pain, fevers and chills, sleeplessness went on for weeks. I called the hospital for some answers knowing this was not recovery from pneumonia. They said they had no clue and the doctor who treated me had left(they were still there). It took me 3 weeks of fighting with this hospital to get my records - but I did and there was all the explanations. This drug was given to me against manufactures warning and both the hospital and the doctors refuse to take any responsibility for my now being crippled. I have lost the use of my left arm, in constant excruciating pain. It makes no sense that they prescribe this drug as it was not effective against pneumonia. There is a tremendous amount of push back in this area regarding the facts which are easily provewn by the hospital records. Both say it is their standard protocal to use - never a problem. Excuse me, This is not a frontline drug - it is posion to many many people. Please do not risk these crippling reactions - save yourself from the excruciating pain.  
Pneumonia caused by Pneumococcus Bacteria	Boo Radly, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	7/25/2010 11:25:02 AM	I was treated in a hospital by an ER doc with Levaquin IV 750 mg along with Prednisone, NSAIDS.The first day the IV port started burning, hand red and swollen, my legs would not support me and I could not lift my water glass . By the 4th day, I was in acute respatory failure, failure to thrive, worse condition than when I came in. I am a 64 year old - healthy and active when I came, I am now crippled, can't walk, shoulder has tears in tendons. The first 3 weeks at home I thought I had contracted an exoxtic disease while in hospital - Extreme burning pains all over my body, each organ was roiling. I could not even potty myself. The hospital did not tell me I had an ADRS, let alone what drug caused this, as they changed my RX when I left the hospital. I had to order my medical records and those came in dribs and drabs - the patient advocate complained about my request - I then demanded to see the full and complete records and those told me what happened. This site's commenters provided me answers, not the treating physicians or hospital - as a matter of fact they obfusicated. Levaquin was poison for me and to be given it along with just about every drug stated to cause adverse reactions really angers me. Do not take fluoroquinolone antibiotics - even if you have taken them in the past and had no reaction. The risks are far too great and they were not effective in treating my pneumonia. I am in extreme pain today and it is the 10th week. I suffer from life theatening reactions and they may be life long. There are many safer drugs that do work. If you want to know all the drugs in this group and all the ADRS check at fqtoxicity. The entire medical community, along with the FDA seems to be protecting this drug since it is still on the market and these reactions have been documented since the 70's. Why not - it's the drug that gives them life long debilitated patients - they require care forever.   
Pneumonia caused by Pneumococcus Bacteria	Hate Levaquin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	4/20/2010 10:48:06 PM	I only took ONE pill before bed time and woke up with sharp pain in my right upper arm. It has been over seven months and the pain has remained ever since. I was prescribed this after I told the doctor I felt 95% better from having had the swine flu turn into pneumonia. I took it that night and the pain woke me up in the middle of the night. I have had numbness and muscle weakness ever since. For weeks later, I felt like my ankles wanted to give out on me when I walked. I am having to use my crutches off and on more often since. I also felt a severe increase in dizziness, headaches, fatigue, nausea, and loose bowel movements. How could I go from feeling 95% better to feeling 5% better literally OVERNIGHT? I called my doctor and he told me to stay on the medication. I refused to take a second pill and switched doctors. I can't help but wonder if the steroids I had been prescribed and had finished the day before helped Levaquin to take over my body in a very bad way. I was on prednisone for seven days for pneumonia.

My MD said she still heard crackling in my lungs so she prescribed for another 5 days.  After the next day, I woke up with a very sore right shoulder - thought I'd slept on it wrong.  Next morning woke up with same pain in my left shoulder as well as continuing in my right shoulder.  I was 2 more days on the meds until I realized that it was it that was causing my pain.  2 months later and I still have residual pain and lack of full movement in my right shoulder.

Did not recognize me, her sister or the lady who was caring for her.  She was swearing, rambling on about killing herself...the doctor insisted it was not Levaquin, but after stopping it, she started to get better...switched to other hospital, given another antibiotic and started all over with not talking and being irrational.  Disgusted with doctors, on 3rd hospital and cannot shake the UTI's she got in 1st hospital.  As her mother, I'm angry that she has to be such experimented on.

Since then have had increasing chronic tendonitis effecting both knees and elbows, requiring surigcal treatment. I have no other risk factor or common relation to these problems other than IV Levaqin. I am in pain daily and it has effected my overall ability to do daily activites and is effectiving my quaility of life. It most likely helped save my life but the long term effects are chronic.

The pain is virtually gone now &amp; &amp; if I didn't follow the rules - I could quit taking it today &amp; think the condition to 100% effective.
