Dry Mouth Secondary to Sjogren's Syndrome	brunhilda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	8/25/2012 2:16:43 PM	Salagen works OK, that is, it helps me most of the time.  The problem is they need to make an extended release version.  I find that after about 3 hours my mouth is getting dry again.  The way I use it is to take 5mg every three hours which ends up being 5x day.  Obviously a pain in the neck.  It also seriously increases the urge to urinate frequently which is another inconvenience.

It's almost immediately effective and has improved my life immeasureably.  The SS makes swallowing and speaking nearly impossible.  The only negatives are the times between doses as they've worn off and the &quot;drying times&quot; return.  It's my plan to seek either more frequent dosing or some other change so the dryness relieving effects are extended.  I can't imagine functioning without pilocarpine but the generic is costly though less so than the name brand, of course.

It actually run out my mouth. Broke tablets in half and only take 2 x day. I stopped and would wake up with my tongue and mouth so dry I thought I would choke, had to take tiny sips of ware to make mough wet.

It worked for my dry eyes immediately, my mouth after a couple of weeks.  So far, I've had to have a chest x-ray and CT. I can't get over the chest congestion that has developed.  It's constant and the drs. think I've had pneumonia. I skipped the drug the last 2 days and already can breath better.  I've wakened in the night feeling as though I'm choking. It's worked but, I am going to quit taking it.  I need my lungs and from what I understand from reading pulmonary edema is not uncommon. I don't know what I'll do now. Good luck.

For years I've had Sjorgren's and had the driest mouth, so dry I had trouble talking, swallowing. With the first dose my mouth watered so much, I  panicked a little, not knowing what was going on.  I'd been told it would take several days or even weeks to notice a change.  For the first time in years I could whistle!  I believe that it has even improved my dry eye symptoms.  The dose I'm taking is low and so far I'm at a once daily dose, I'm wondering what will happen when I have to increase the dose!

That is when it turned on me with heavy sweating then the cold chills, the shakes, blurred vision. I discontinued usage when the constant tearing of the eyes started which I still have problems with upon waking even though the doc tors say it's half life is only four hours. I also found without insurance it to cost prohibitive, along with remembering to take it 4 times daily.

The name brand SALAGEN cost $80.00 at WalMart. I have tryed to find Generic form at Publix, and a number of different stores no luck. I heard the company that makes SALAGEN bought the rights to company that made GENERIC brand.

When it is working it produces so much saliva i have to continualy swallow, when in bed it makes me choke on the saliva it creates and the small amount of thick saliva already there.I get the sweats shortly after taking the pill.I also get the chills occasionaly and a very runny nose. Im going to talk to my doc. about stopping its use.

It was remembering to take it often during the day.  Doctor upped my dose to 7.5mg 3 times a day and the side effects are much worse. I'm asking for the lower dosage but take it more often.
