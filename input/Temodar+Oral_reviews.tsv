I completed a series of radiation first. Extreme fatigue a lot of non listed symptoms. My hair is increaded in loss from when it did from radiation. Has anyone experienced hair loss from Temodar? I was told it would not happen.
Malignant Brain Tumor Glioblastoma	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	1/31/2012 12:36:33 PM	Diagnosis on 12/24/09 with surgery on 1/4/10.  6 weeks of radiation with 180 mg of Temador.  Continued Temador for another 8 months.  MRI every two months.  From the beginning I saw a naturalpath that specialized in Glioblastomas. Took ~100 supplements a day, down to 50 now.  Recurrence in 10/11 as expected.  I was told that there is an expectation that 90% will have a recurrence within two years.  I am unable to work due to the memory issues.  A 15 min nap at lunch solved the tiredness issue.  I feel great and am living an otherwise normal life.

My doctor opted for Temodar.  So far, my &quot;aggressive&quot; tumor has not grown anymore.  The only side effect I have experienced is a little fatigue after the 5 day cycles each month.  I have been on Temodar for a year and my doctor checks my blood count each month and it has been great.  He is taking me off of the treatment to see what happens but is still going to monitor me closely every three months.

Malignant Brain Tumor Glioblastoma	vfae, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female		11/2/2011 10:47:38 PM	In June of 2011, my Dad was diagnosed with Stage iv glioblastoma.  Treatment? - Temodar.  Other than he lost a lot of weight and yet bloated up, no real side effects UNTIL August 23rd, 2011.  He was admitted to the hospital because he was having difficulty breathing.Very short yet long story made short, the following Monday, he died.  This &quot;miracle&quot; drug which was supposed to give us at least another year on the 6 months he would have had without it, KILLED him in two months.  It cost them $5,000.00 for this medication - and it killed him. Make sure you read EVERYTHING before taking this drug.  MY Dad was 80.  Apparently they had not really tested it on over 70.  You might say, &quot;he lived a long life&quot;, but he had so much more to do and live.  His parents lived 10 years beyond his life.  Just think about it, 10 years is a long time.

Fatigued after taken was only side effect while using it. Taken ffor about 2 yrs and it no longer was effective for me. Now I find myself having pain in my stomach, on right side by ribs and back area, disorientated at times, unbalanced,insommnia,hungry all the time, feel very very weak..Dr. started me on Decradron for swelling in brain area because of Radiation Necrosis of the tissue surrounding brain tumor that Radiation reduced to 1/2 in size, then Dr, said tumor was not there but Necrosis was, so tit for tot, change one for the other???I do feel the Temodar was beneficial for me with very little side effects( not unless Temodar side effects are associated with what I have now but just took time to show up)..

He took it during radiation, and then only twice following that. It has been stable for the past several months. He hasn't taken the drug in about 6 months.  He is now experience severe and almost constant stomach pain... I'm just wondering if this has anything to do with the drug because none of his doctors can figure out why he is having this pain.

Began 7 days on, 7 off of 220 mg after radiation did not work.  220 reduced to 120 after having problems with low platelets. Last MRI said tumor is no longer visible!  Staying on another few months for safety.  Side effects: awful fatigue! with no apparent pattern, some days good followed by some miserable days where I sleep all day. Also, constipation, loss of appetite, bruising, possible slight memory loss(?), slight changes in math and language ability (could be surgery/radiation remnants).  All bearable if it makes my tumor go away :-)

Chemo week began as not too bad, non-chemo week was great but not I do get tired if I don't control my activities. I am on my 6th month of temodar and so far no signs of another tumor. I don't know if it is too soon to rate temodar but I have nothing bad to say about it.

I'm about to start my 5th month of 5 days on, 23 days off, and so I hope I don't jinx myself, but so far my experience has not been as bad as I had feared. The first 2-3 of 5 days go pretty well; after that, fatigue, constipation, loss of appetite increase, but so far, not too bad. Nausea has so far been controlled by zofran. White cell counts are affected so I have to have Neulasta injections after each cycle.

Has been on 340 mg Temodar since February 2008, taken 5 days on  and 23 off immediately before going to bed w/Anzemet  to avoid nauseated feeling.  Very fatigued but keeping the tumor away.  Short term memory is affected but can't say it is from the drug and not the surgery itself.

Expect similar effectiveness and more rounds in subsequent years. Every 5-6 years is hardly something to complain about.In terms of ease of use, can't beat it (oral at night vs. IV/portacath) and the side effects have been limited in comparison to previous IV-introduced therapy.I'm satisfied with the drug. If you prefer more agressive therapy, read cancer research articles for something to augment Temodar. In my case, I'm taking EGCG tablets; a study at USC suggests EGCG increases chemosensitivity to Temodar. (survival:13 years, 3 months)

I've been really tired and experienced bad side effects during 3 of the 5 days of treatment on average. I'm disappointed because my tumors (two locations) were inoperable and have barely shrunk. But the stabilization is perfect. I would hate having to take this drug for the rest of my life as the symptoms caused by the tumors have not disappeared (seizures, vertigo, dizziness and distorted apprehension of space). What's the use of two years of fatigue in your life for this????
