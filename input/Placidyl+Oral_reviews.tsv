Severe Trouble Sleeping	AliRay22, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/27/2010 5:27:36 AM	After so many years of going without sleep, or the adequate amount of sleep my body was needing, I immediately felt at ease, enough so that I was sleeping in a short time. Only good things can I say, but one must take caution when using this as it is chloral hydrate of some manner and can be dangerous,..as in any other medicines. Use discretion, take early enough that you do not wake up with the hang over feeling. Other than that, it has been a GodSend for this one who went prettymuch sleepless for years. I highly recommend it.
