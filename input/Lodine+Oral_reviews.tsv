The rash is severe with large raised welts that are difficult to remedy-aveeno bath helps. It's a shame since it's great for pain.

I was previously on ibuprofen 800 mg. every 8 hours.  This works much better, however I do make sure that I eat with the medicine and drink plenty of water when I take it.  We'll see how the long term outcome is.

I have tried other meds but find Lodine to be the most effective for me and it only requires one pill a day. Try it, you'll like it!

It seems no more effective than a generic anti-inflammatory  for both dental and 'middle-age' back/hip/knee/feet soreness. I have noticed mild diarrhea, but nothing to upset my day or fluid levels.  I think for inflammation/soreness you're better off to pay $3 for 50 generics at the discount store.  
Pain	dissatisfied , 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	25-34	6/14/2011 2:26:11 AM	Have been on this drug now for three weeks due to a torn ACL and Meniscus.  Does nothing more than the Ibu 800 I was on previously. However now it seems to be causing severe insomnia. I am only sleeping two to three hours a night and the pain is there constantly. Going to go back to the Ibu and hopefully sleep again.

Pain	Pat828, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/9/2011 10:03:06 PM	I took it initially because my knee (broken cartilage) was swollen and painful.  Lodine really helped tremendously.  However, Lodine turned on me.  I am now quite ill from the effects of it.  I have improved some since getting off of it.  In one week I will be having an endoscopy and colonoscopy to see what is wrong inside me.  If you are going to take this medication, please be aware that it can cause all kinds of problems.  My symptoms are diarrhea (4 months now), indigestion, bloating, gas, asthma, wheezing, stomach pain, trouble swallowing pills, nausea, and bad taste in my mouth. I had been on this for 8 months and then all of a sudden I got all kinds of symptoms that no one seemed to be able to figure out.  I went to a specialist who recognized it right away.  I now am praying that whatever problems I am experiencing can be corrected.  Please be careful!

When I finally got home, I threw-up 2 more times and my headache finally eased off later on that evening. I actually flushed the medication down the toilet. I don't recommend this medication to anyone.

Her Dr. thinks it muscle pain, but she has numbness in the leg all the way from the lower back to her foot. This sounds like a nerve may be involved. A GP, and a friend, stated that she would be better off taking tylenol instead of this Lodine.

I was using Celebrex, and we switched.  It has been as effective for me as the celebrex was and has allowed near normal activity and typically mild or controlled pain. I can still overdue and have severe pain (no jumping or running), but if I am careful, the pain is minimal.  Forgetting a dose confirms that it is doing its job. No side effects that I know of.

Do not take this medicine if other anti inflamitory medicines upset your stomach.  This was the most horrible experience I have ever had.
