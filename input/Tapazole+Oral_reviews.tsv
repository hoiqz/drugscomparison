Overactive Thyroid Gland	Simba, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	7/4/2012 11:18:20 AM	I have been taking this medication for nine months with few side effects; at the initial period I experienced some nausea and vomiting, which has subsided. My bowel movements returned to normal (previously, occasional diarrhea) and I began to regain some weight. Overall, this is a good way to judge weather surgery is necessary. Between taking this medication twice a day or the operating room, recovery and scarring, the pill was a no-brainer! Thank you for your enthusiasm and I hope you become well again, soon. You should see total results within a few weeks. Good Health, Simba
Overactive Thyroid Gland	angiw, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	5/1/2012 11:08:39 PM	I found out in mid-March that I have Graves Disease and started taking Tapazole for it. The first subscription was for a generic or something, it tasted so bitter I could not take it but my doctor gave me the tapazole and the taste was much better. Reading through these reviews, I am so thankful for the lack of symptoms. I had the swollen neck, racing heart, labored breathing, buggy eyes and some irritability but no night sweats, depression, etc. The good news is that before meds my T3/T4  was 20/5 and after a month at 30mg, my T4 was actually low - meaning the medicine was very effective. The bad news is almost 20lbs in weight gain. Obviously, I am thankful I am not dying or have PK like I feared but having had gastric bypass surgery 10 yrs ago and being very careful with my weight, this weight gain is depressing me. There is no substitute for my health but is there a natural remedy for reversing the weight gain side effect of this med???
Overactive Thyroid Gland	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/5/2012 3:26:47 PM	I was prescribed Tapazol by a endoctronologist, Dr. Larry Cantley, in WS, NC. Bottom line, I almost died from this drug. I developed drug induced hepatitis &amp; was told by this doctor &quot; not to be concerned...my body was adapting to the RX&quot;. In the meantime, my urine was turning almost black, i itched horribly...even behind my eyelids. It became difficult to hold my head up, I was so weak. In addition, I became jaundiced. Had it not been for my pharmacist, I am certain I would have died from this med. He immediately recognized my symptoms as severe side effects from this medication. What I was experiencing had nothing to do with whatever condition I was being treated for. It took me 6 weeks to recover after ceasing this medication. It also turned out that I NEVER had hyperthroidism in the first place! Be extremely cautious before taking this, or any med. And, always get a second opinion...even if a &quot;reputable&quot; specialist makes a diagnosis.

Heart racing, weight loss, blurred vision, extreme fatique, sleeping 2 hours a day. Take 3 5 mg every morning for first few months. Everything got better but tired around 11 am. Take it at night now and sleep 6 to 8 hours every night. Starting to get real tired during the day, fall asleep while standing in line at checkout. Think the MD has to start cutting me back on meds. I would much rather stay on Tapazole for my whole life than to get surgery or RAI. I think it except for the hairloss.

My T4 values which were &gt; 100 fell to 30 within 1 month of using this medication. Overall in combination with propranolol, tapazole remains my drug of choice for my overactive thyroid
Overactive Thyroid Gland	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	8/15/2011 10:03:32 AM	I started to take this medicine three months ago and I am so tired and gained 12 pounds, which I am very upset about. Otherwise no other side effects. The cure woese than the disease? In my case; yes.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	ellen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/11/2011 2:33:38 PM	Started 30 mg day, then up to 40 mg day. It's been 5-6 months. No side effects of note. Feel more relaxed, gained moderate amt of weight. Last blood test Dr told me to stop totally for 2 weeks, then begin 20 mg day. I was feeling tired, achy, distant. Probably should have reduced it earlier. I haven't taken any for 4 days. Still tired and feeling 'distant' but overall I believe it's been a good experience thus far.

Overactive Thyroid Gland	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/2/2011 10:30:52 PM	I am a long term user of Tapazole for Grave's Disease for over a decade now.  In low maintenance dosages, 2.5 to 10mg risks of serious side effects are very low.  Treatment is inexpensive compared to surgery or RAI, and you don't have to take weeks off from work.  If you are not allergic to it, there's no science backed reason you can't keep taking Tapazole every time you relapse. finding the right doc though...that can be harder.

This dose may be too strong b/c I have nausea, stomach pain, some vomiting and a major 2 day headache (i am not prone to these). I have only been on this med for 3 days.

Overactive Thyroid Gland	Angela, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	11/15/2010 2:10:14 PM	I didn't realize at first I had a problem with my thyroid because I assumed the symptoms were caused by recent surgery for cancer of the pancreas and I am also diabetic.  Once I went on the medication I realized most of my problems were caused by toxic goiter nodule of the thyroid. I am also assuming this came about from many Ct Scans before and after surgery.  
Overactive Thyroid Gland	Anti-TAPAZOLE, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	11/8/2010 7:05:07 PM	This occured years ago, but it did happen:  After taking Tapazole for only 2 to 2 1/2 months, I ended up in the hospital in isolation with no white blood cells, low red cells, failure/breakdown of immune system including bone marrow failure.  My doctor specializing in hemotology only gave me 5% chance of recovery.  After 15 days, I finally was able to go home, but my recovery was considered a miracle.  Be very alert if you take this and insist on frequent/at least weekly blood tests to watch for severe reactions.  They don't happen very often, BUT THEY DO HAPPEN.

My doctor said it could take 6 months to work and I am just starting to get my energy back since he raised the dosage. I no longer have the edema either. I do still have the &quot;sweats&quot;.My doctor has done several tests including eyes and heart because thyroid effects those too. I check up with the endrocrinologist my doctor has been working with next month.I am thankful for this medicine because any side effects are better than Graves Disease symptoms.

Overactive Thyroid Gland	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/4/2009 10:08:56 AM	I have been taking Tapazole for 4 months.  It has worked well to drop my thyroid hormone levels.  My doctor and I are still trying to find the right maintenance dose.  I started at 30mg/day and am now at 7.5mg/day.  After 3 months I experienced abnormal hair loss.  I've lost about 30% of my hair and continue to loose.  Hopefully the hair loss will subside.  Overall the benefits of this medication out way the hair loss side effect.

Before my diagnosis, my endocrinologist was not sure that I had a thyroid problem due to lack of symptoms.  The only noticeable symptom I had was loss of weight. A thyroid scan and further TSH test revealed that I have an overactive thyroid.  I have been on Methimazole (10 mg) a day for a month.I am grateful that have not experienced any side effects.

Overactive Thyroid Gland	anon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	7/4/2009 2:18:04 AM	I have been taking 10mg of Tapazole daily for six months to treat Graves disease. I have gained 35 pounds--what I'd lost and some extra. My heart palpitations have stopped and most of the tremors. Also improved depression symptoms, decreased bowel movements, and cleared up my skin problems.I was feeling better, but the last four weeks, I've noticed increasing muscle weakness and hair loss. At least 50% of my hair has come out. Last time I had blood work done (March), the thyroid levels were &quot;getting better.&quot; I'm going to ask about my side effects and potentially adjusting my medication dosage when the office re-opens after the holiday.The first two weeks I took the medication I had nausea about an hour after taking it. The taste of the pill is awful. It also makes me very sleepy, so I take it at night.
Overactive Thyroid Gland	liliji, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	6/16/2009 9:10:23 PM	I have only been on methimazole for a week (for Grave's disease) but about 12 hours after starting it I got severe abdominal cramps which I've had now for 6 days, and which are incapacitating (and I've been unable to eat during this time as well). I've been to several doctors and the emergency room and no one knows what's causing it. Since I've never had this before and it started the morning after I first took methimazole the night before, I'm wondering if this is the problem and I should switch to another medication.

I saw my endo. doctor and he said it showed on a 6000.00 med bill that one side of the thyroid was not as big as the other. A touch smaller . I have not lost weight but gained. I am losing hair. and the after taste is awful. Not sure if the risks outweigh what might occcur in the future. I am prone to ostoprosis, and the md. said also heart desease. So what does one do? One md said take it out the other nothing and the 3rd doctor said take this pill 1 time a day 5mg. I am so not sure.

I usually take it after I eat.  I pinch off a piece of bread, squeeze the pill inside and literally throw it down my throat, chasing it with water. Hours later, I have this horrible taste in my mouth....like I've had galvanized nails in my mouth.  Has this been a problem with anyone...and any solution???  There are no other side effects....althought I think my immune system is down...I've gotten the stomach flu and a severe sore throat during these last 2 months.....

The doctor that prescribed it was an endocrinologist and we trusted his specialty in this area.  But within a month it had wiped my white blood cell count out.  I ended up hospitalized for 7 days on strong antibiotics for infections.  I know it works for lots of people but make sure your doctor keep a close check especially when you first take the medicine.

The benefits of it have outweighed the side effects. I get a little drowsy from it sometimes, but before I started on it, I thought I was going to die of a heart attack! My heart pounded all the time, and I had trouble breathing sometimes. My legs swelled and ached so bad, and my back kept going out to the point where I could not walk for over a week. Since I've been on it, none of that has happened!

It did show less side effects by splitting the dose half AM / half PM. Now a year later my TSH is very good and I am starting to wean off the medication .... I feel very good.
