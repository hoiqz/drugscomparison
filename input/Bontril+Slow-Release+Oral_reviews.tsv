Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	2/2/2012 9:00:22 AM	This medication works but be careful. Because I was eating less food I wasn't replenishing my vitamins and minerals as quick as I was burning through them. I ended up being hospitalized overnight because I started having symptoms for very low potassium and calcium which can cause heart arrhythmia among other things.I also experienced restlessness and rapid heartbeat while on it.

But I have noticed that the medication isn't working for me at all.  The ease of use, was simple. I have not felt the &quot;effectiveness&quot;, even when I paid close attention to what I was feeling in my stomach.  Regardless how I had taken the medicine, it wasn't working for me. I had to struggle to not to over eat, that was harder than exercise.

Overweight	Chason, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	9/17/2009 5:29:39 PM	This drug is pretty amazing. I went from 218 lbs to 190 lbs in 7 weeks. It slashed my appetite so I just eat once a day most of the time. I definitely am having some side effects including the shakes, aggression, strong heart beats , and increased sex drive.

Overweight	kate, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/4/2009 1:36:01 PM	this worked great for me while I was on it.  However, since I've been off, I've gained all my weight back.  It's very discouraging.  I want to take it again, but the more I read about it the less likely I am to go back on it.  I was on this for almost 2 years and everything I've said states no long term use.  I'm concerned about long term affects of this.

Overweight	dollyspot, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	6/24/2008 2:59:56 PM	well I have been on all of the diet medications and I am immune to all of them.  Phen/fen was the only one that worked,so I figure I could handle this one.  After 3 weeks of being on it, my blood pressure sky rocketed and I am dizzy beyond belief.  So I stopped the medication and will see next week if I need to follow up with a cardiologist.

I have lost 12 lbs so far and looking forward to dropping more. I have plenty of energy throughout the day but no jitters. The only problem I have with it is my sex drive has diminished quite a bit.

Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	11/8/2007 10:07:16 PM	This was my miracle drug. For the first time in my life, that part of my brain that kept telling me I was hungry after having just eaten final stopped. However, the first time I took one dose, I was awake for two days and nights. It caused constant feelings of anxiety and I started getting heart palpitations, but I considered that a small price for the 20 pounds I lost. However, I have not taken this medication for over a year and I still have those palpitations which I now have to take medication to control.
