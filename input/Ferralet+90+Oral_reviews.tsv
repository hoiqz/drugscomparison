Anemia from Inadequate Iron	ViciousMik, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	25-34	2/3/2011 2:28:20 AM	I begin taking this medication during the third trimester of my pregnancy, and had significant problems with the timing of the doses. Any earlier than two hours after eating and I was violently ill. Same if I took it with too much fluid. Now I take about three hours after eating and with a half a glass of fluid. Has greatly improved my anemia and didn't cause any other problems.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/13/2011 5:53:43 PM	I have taken this for as long as it has been available...after my prenatal with the same 90 mg of Carbonyl Iron was taken off the market.  Contact company for coupons.  It is worth it.  I have to pay out of pocket with insurance that won't cover it.  It works great.  If you are having gerd from it, check your liver function.

I actually threw up a couple times.  This one is working very well so far for 15 days. I find it's best to take it 2 hours after eating with plenty of water.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron	hawkchick, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	9/27/2009 10:26:31 AM	I've had to take iron supplements before &amp; was concerned that this would give me constipation (as iron has in the past).  I am pleasantly surprised that it doesn't. I like that it also includes Vitamin C, B12 &amp; Folic Acid.  I would suggest following the instructions - take 1 - 2 hrs before food and drink lots of water to help with the burping that follows (as described by the other reviews).  I've found that the key is to continue to drink water, not just with the tablet.  I drink 8-10 oz with it and continue to drink water in the hr or so before eating.  I'm very regular &amp; still am but I've noticed a different consistency in my stool which doesn't bother me as much as being constipated would.  I feel the difference - energy level is back up, etc. &amp; would highly recommend this.

I have always had anemia. I wish now that my Dr would have given me this all along. I hope my Dr will now let me take it from now on. It works great, and I have not had any side effects.
Anemia from Inadequate Iron	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	4/18/2009 11:09:06 AM	Ferritin level was 10.9. Was prescribed this drug one week ago. Slight after taste and burp for a couple of hours after taking. Dr. instructed me to take on empty stomach w/ orange juice in a.m. Eat breakfast one /two hours after medication. If taken w/ food iron will not be absorbed, according to my Dr. If no improvement in symptoms (dizziness, leg/calf pain, headache,fatigue,etc.) within two weeks, I will call Dr. for re-evaluation of medication.Also take 1000 mcg B-12 weekly.Hope this helps.

Anemia from Inadequate Iron		1	1	1			7/14/2008 11:54:28 PM	Within one week of taking this drug, I became so sick with diarhea and bloating.  I was miserable but I thought maybe it was from something else and started back on the medicine.  Once again, the same thing happened.  This time, the vanilla smell of these pills would make me feel so sick before I even choked the thing down.  I would recommend looking into other therapies.  My doctor put me on a product called chromagen forte, and I am feeling fanatastic.  I would not recommend this product based on my experience.
