My family thought they where going to lose me as I was virtualy a cabbage, couldn&#180;t speak properly sleeping all the time falling over. I decided to come off the Drug and am now nearly back to what i was before, still have stiffness in back of legs but getting less as time goes on. I now think I have misdiagnosed, but Dr&#180;s won&#180;t listen to me.

I am stopping medication not worth it after 30 days. Now I barely can walk and &amp; am a healthy underweight person!
Other	Not sleepless but horny, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	65-74	6/2/2012 10:14:28 PM	Generally speaking, the drug does help me with restless body syndrome.  My case seem severe and I take 8 mg of generic Requip each night. I also take gababapenten and trazadone.  On top of that I drink three glasses or so of wine each evening to get to the point of being able to fall asleep.  In the morning I take 259 mg of Nuvagil to help with the previous evening's drugs.  I also have sleep apnea.I could probably live with this (for a time) but I am and have been all my life a very sexual person.  Requip does increase sexual &quot;urges&quot; but then shuts down (for the most part) a man's ability to (a) hold an erection and (b) ejaculate.  A viscous combo.  I'm so frustrated with Requip and would love to find either another drug to takes its place or another program to get off the stuff all together.  I hate racing around my house all night, eating to help me in some way, and then finally at 6 AM finally finding a way to get to sleep.  So, if you have a healthy libido and have RLS (or whatever) my advice is to take no drug and just resign yourself to not having a good life -- except on those rare occasions, you can have quality sex and truly enjoy your sexual body.

I found that taking half mg tablets spread over the day starting at about noon allowed me to avoid increasing dosage. Recently however I have had to up dosage to 3 mg per day and the drug dosen't seem to be working. Up all night in constant missery for two nights now and even increased to 4 mg but is not stopping my RLS symptoms. Those of you with RLS know how terrible that can be. My poor wife.

Tried Mir-apex, and Klonipin. Didn't work. Been taking Requip for 5 yrs. First symptom was nausea. I take 3 mg with motion sickness pills (4 of them) and it stops the nausea. Now I am having kidney problems, eye problems (epi-schlaritis), severe diarrhea for 6 months or more, high blood pressure, and dizziness. Dr's can't figure out what is wrong with me. Plus, I had lap band surgery over a year ago and have only dropped 23 lbs. After reading the reviews, now I know what is wrong!!! But what can I take for the RLS? Is there a reason why we have RLS? And yes, the RLS has worsened since taking the drug. I now occasionally have to take during the day. My husband compares sleeping with me is like sleeping with a soccer player.

Most of the time Requip 12 mg. works, however, there is an occasion bad night when I have to take an additional medication.  I am  unfortunately extremely sleepy during my waking hours.  If I stand or sit still, I fall asleep.  Strangely enough though after ten o'clock P.M. I am awake and often cannot go to sleep until after one o'clock.  No, I don't take naps and am usually up by seven thirty in the morning

Could be from one of the many meds I must take, but that is irrelevent. I started out on 2mg; soon up to 6mg in evening. I works well, thank goodness. I do have extreme nausea, sweating and overpowering sleepiness, and need 12-15 hours of sleep per day! I've tried to reduce dosage but that expierince was horrible. Thankful for Requip, I could not live with no sleep, ever! One review said 'feel angry, with the world after taking and very weird'. I also have this symptom and literally want to die??? Have to go right to bed. I have controlled the vomiting by taking with complete meal, and only can eat small portions. My RLS is much worse if I walk a lot.

I am aware that this drug does not effect everyone the same way, however I think that patients should be warned and carefully obsreved regarding ths very serious side effect.

He was moved from ICU to a regular patient room today (11/8/11). After taking Requip for about six months, his kidneys began to lose function, and the medicine built up in his system. He was basically comatose much of last week (10/31-11/6). He is undergoing physical therapy, having (temporarily) lost use of his arms and legs. The swelling throughout his body is tremendous. After seven days in the hospital (including ICU), doctors have determined Requip to be the cause. He went from being an independent, active person to someone who is now totally dependent on others to feed him and care for him. His progress over the past two days is incredible, but he has a while to go. A full recovery is expected, but this ordeal is completely the fault of Requip.

Extreme Discomfort in Calves when Sitting or Lying Down	75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male		2/20/2011 5:17:04 PM	I have been taking this medication for RLS for about 10 yrs. On the whole it has been effective although my GP has had to increase the dosage from 2x.25mg at bedtime to 3x.25mg but has my RLS attacks are getting more frequent (ie. daytime), he has increased the dosage yet again to 4x.25mg. However I have the option to add one more tablet if I need. One point of interest is that just recently I have also been taking Champix (a quit-smoking aid) and it is possible that it has been counteracting the effects of Requip (My Doctor's opinion)

Other	amhamman, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/21/2010 1:40:52 AM	during a sleep study in 2005 I was diagnosed with RLS. My husband was glad to have a name to go with my kicking him out of bed everynight sometimes leaving him with  bruised shins. The doctor I had then gave me a sleep aid and sent me on my way. We moved to another state and for two years I continued to just take the sleep aid. this past year my husband asked our doctor if there was something I could take that would keep my legs and arms from thrashing every which way. We started out with one milligram and today are at 4. Sleep has finally returned to normal for my husband and his dog. Requip has been a lifesafer!!
Extreme Discomfort in Calves when Sitting or Lying Down	Lucytwo259, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	12/19/2010 9:08:35 PM	I was diagnosed with RLS in 1998 and originally put on Sinemet.  In 2004 I became very ill and was taken off all medications.  Sometime in 2006 I began taking Requip.  My doctor started me on a low dose and worked up to the 2mg dose I take today.  Because I feel nausea and overall weakness if I take the entire 2mg at the same time, I usually split the dose taking half in the late afternoon (which helps at work and commuting home) and the remaining half about 1/2 to 1 hour before going to bed.  Unfortunately, without Requip, I am unable to sleep.  Not too long ago I ordered a refill through my Insurance's  Mail Order Program.  It was a holiday weekend and my prescription was delayed and I ran out.  I went three nights without the medication before my pharmacy, doctor, and insurance company could work it out to allow me to have a few pills until the mail order arrived.  Evidently, it takes a while for Requip to build up in your system and a while for it to clear your system.  What I went through was worse than any time prior to this medication.  In other words, it is much worse to run out of it than not to have it at all.

Requip definitely helps relieve my symptoms, but I do feel the side affects of the medication. I get severe nausau, headaches, sweating, and dizziness and often I have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning because it makes me so extremely tired. I have to take it though, because nothing else works and the jitteriness can be unbearable.

I had to go right to bed because I became sleepy so quickly.  I shortly developed these awful &quot;tics&quot; in both legs during the day whenever I sat down to rest or whenever I lied down.  I notified my doc who increased my dose to 0.5 @ 12N - 6p - and 1 mg at bedtime. During the day, I had nausea and I don't know any other way to put this, but I hated the world and wanted to climb in a cave for about an hour after I took these things.  Weird, huh?  Then I was ok. I have had to adjust my own dose frequently since then and the weird symptoms have lessened, but the nausea remains and now I have developed gawd-awful heartburn, which I have rarely ever had in my life (except when pregnant, and there is NO chance of that being the case).  I'm waiting for what develops next!

When I finally heard of RLS and the symptoms I knew that is what I had.  I have lived with it all my life untreated until my late 30's. I just could not take it anymore so I decided to go on the meds.  I would only have RL once in awhile - and I treated it with a hot bath etc..  Mirapex was first and did not help so I went to Requip.  It worked amazingly!!  I finally got good sleep and felt rested. But now I HAVE to take it!  If I do not take it every night - I do not sleep at all.  Started on 1mg now on 2mg and scared about augmentation. My RL are definitely much worse than when I began treatment and now I am suffering from leg, knee and hip pain!  My tendons or muscles are sore to the touch and I wake up all through the night in pain.  I do not want this to get any worse - I hate the thought of a pill making it worse - I have tried to stop taking it - but my body goes through withdrawls and I am awake for days and finally give up and take it just to get some sleep.  Have never been to a neurologist or a sleep study - I think that is where I am headed to figure this out.

Parkinson's Disease	HARLEYPA, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	8/8/2010 6:47:20 PM	Strangely enough both my husband (currently age 73) and my brother-in-law (currently age 51) BOTH were diagnosed with Parkinsons a little more than 3 years ago.  REQUIP was prescribed for each of them by separate doctors in different cities.   BOTH had serious complications from REQUIP.   My husband's heart rate went to 30-50 beats per minute which caused more heart damage and resulted in him having to change his defribulator to a defribulator/pacemaker.   I seriously thought I was going to loose him.   My brother in law, after seeking a second opinion from Mayo clinic, was told that Requip was NOT what he should be taking for parkinsons.    Both are now using Sinemet and it is working much better.   BE SURE TO SEEK SECOND OPINIONS IF YOU HAVE FURTHER COMPLICATIONS USING THIS DRUG!

The Requip has only limited effect on the shaking in my right limb.  It has not reduced or eliminated the progression of the disease.  It seems to have more effect on the RLS.  I only have those symptoms when I've lost sleep, but lying down reduces the jerking, as opposed to sitting down.  I have changed my prescription to Ropinirole to take advantage of the generic pricing.

I noticed these other comments have a variety of doses, with the higher dose (some 4mg) needed in some cases and to take 2 hours before bed.  I notice it doesn't kick in for a few hours so have been taking mine earlier.  I wake up every hour it seems and am not happy with the results.  I may increase the dose tonite and see what it does.

I recently went to a sleep specialist and found that I was taking it wrong, because I wasn't on a high enough dose, was having &quot;breakthrough&quot;.  I now take it on a full stomach after supper (2.5 mg) and have been experiencing severe nausea.  Took it with milk last night, which helped, and am going to dry chewing it tonight.  It has been a godsend to not have RLS symptoms after 47 years of nightly creepy crawlies!

I have had Restless Leg Syn. with it. The pain this last year has been ongoing and I have not been able to sleep longer than 30 min.and always a restless sleep. I started Requip 2 weeks ago and it has been wonderful! What an answer to prayers! I slept 4 hours straight through the last 2 nights and am finally rested. The only problem with taking it is that it causes cramps in my upper legs and I have to drink gatorade. I finally feel almost normal again! Thanks Requip!

I began taking it shortly after it went on the market, and have taken both brand and generic. After approximately 2.5 years taking 3-4 MG daily at bedtime, I began vomiting almost immediately after each dose. I tried taking it in the morning, before food, with food - nothing worked. I switched to Mirapex, which was not as effective, and am now taking Klonopin just to sleep through the agony.

I take a about 3 mg a day, but I think my dosage needs to be a little higher.  In my case, I do get some partial relief from my symptoms for short period time. Requip can make you sleepy shortly after taking it.  So you have to plan accordingly if working or driving.  I have not experienced nausea, which has been reported by some people.

The only side effect that's difficult to manage is the drowsiness that comes along with it. I take it a few hours before bed and sleep soundly through the night. However the next morning I have trouble getting out of bed and it takes me a while to get going. I've always been a morning person so this is a big adjustment for me.

However, I am now getting the RLS during the day while sitting at my desk so the problem is worsening.  I amy have to up my current dosage of 1 mg/day to 2/mg a day; 1 in the afternoon and 1 before bedtime.  Without Requip my quality of life would be abysmal.

Talked to Dr.about it and he wanted to increase to 12mgs daily.The Doctor would not listen to what my husband had to say about where the pain was located.We knew he could't handle anymore of this medicine so he came off of it. Family doctor had x-rays taken and sent him to an orthopedic doctor.  Doctor showed us the problem which is not RLS! He has an actual problem with the cartlage in his hip joints.  Make sure you have a doctor who will listen to what you are telling them.  I believe this drug could have had severe consequences if he had kept taking it.

It worked well to take care of the problem, but caused me intermittent dizziness during the day, lethergy and strange dreams at night.  I don't want to say nightmares, but bizare dreams that had me wake up with severe anxiety. I waited for the side effects to subside and when they did not I got a new prescription for 1/4 mg dose.  This helped with the side effects but did not relieve them.  I stopped the medication and the restless legs returned with increased severity for a bit.  However, the lethargy continues and according to the pharmacy notes that I missed previously, I discovered that this can continue for up to one year after stopping the drug!  Not a side effect for regular type, but bold type in my humble opinion.

I've cut dosage in half hoping it will help symptoms.  Tried not taking it but RLS was very bad.  Hoping doctor can suggest something else.  It's hard to sleep when you can't breathe and keep coughing.

I was given Requip in the hospital last month but I was still up and walking most of the night.  My new PC doctor (he is an O.D.) told me on the 14th of March that he belives it is all in my brain.  My old PC doctor (who moved out of state to remarry) had me taking LorTab and that is the only thing I've found that works in about 20 mins after taken.  At least I can sleep for 4-5 hours.  I've taken Neurontin + a few other scripts, all wasting money I don't have.  I seriously think that a bigger dose of Requip would be helpful.  I have experimented (one time only) by taking 3 0.25mg tablets.  I recently printed  &quot;Dose Titration Schedule for RLS&quot; off the RX List.com/requip-drug.htm which shows &quot;Days 1 &amp; 2, 0.25mg, Days 3-7 0.5mg, weeks 2-7 the schedule shows 1mg, then 1.5mg, 2mg, 2.5 mg, 3mg and  the 7th week, 4mg.  Requip was prescribed for me in the hospital at 0.25 and that is what my script was for. Thanks.

Requip was first prescribed for me to treat this condition.  The dose is 4 mg taken at bed time.  I am NOW using the generic form of Requip:  ROPINIROLE in 4 mg doses taken at bed time.While the drug has been VERY effective treating my severe restless leg syndrome I have developed ED: erectile dysfunction.  As a result of ED I cannot have an erection, ejaculation or orgasm; this side effect is EXTREMELY disappointing.  Please provide me with any recommendations to cope with the ED.

I have had Restless Legs Syndrome for as long as I can remember.  I took Requip for about 6 weeks.  Yes, the RLS was helped somewhat, but I believe this is a DANGEROUS drug for some people. It caused me to have severe heart rhythm problems and nausea.  When my sister took it she passed out...the only time in her life.  She also had severe nausea.  I now take Mirapex with much success. I hope the right people read this. Good Luck RLS sufferers.

However, I will put up with the side effects because of the relief of RLS is worth it.  My life was a nightmare of insomnia, churning legs, leg spasms during the day and inability to sit for even short periods of time.  I hope it continues to work.

First week requip was marvelous, my sleeping improved, and headache intensity diminished. Second week I woke up with extreme nausea, stomach cramping, broke out in a sweat, and got very light headed. Exhaustion and migraines seem better than sleepless night of extreme nausea and cramping. I would not suggest this drug to anyone. Try something else first.

I have suffered with RLS since I was 12.  I have tried anything and everything under to sun to relieve the symptoms to NO avail, until Requip came along.  I will happily take this med for the rest of my life if it means NO MORE RLS. The only downfall I've had is the very strong nausea sensation if I take the med and stay awake.  I normally take this before bed at 8am (I work nightshift) but on days I am not working and take it in am, I do get very nauseous. I got phenergen for those occasions.  I very much accept the nuasea feelings to never have RLS again.  I give this med 5 stars all the way!!!!!

Since my mom has had it for even longer, I was aware of Mirapex, Sinemet, and then Requip. I initially only had the restlessness in my arms, but then legs started, too. I have been taking Requip, then switched to generic, for maybe 4 years.  It does not make the RLS worse for me; I've read that it just seems to start earlier and earlier in the day. Very true! Used to start around 7, then 3 or 4, now starts as early as noon. I logged on here to check on side effects; I only found one comment about my main complaint - about an hour after taking, I get totally blocked sinuses and a feverish feeling, also the  extreme drowsiness. The drowsiness is only a problem if I am sitting. If I stay up and keep going til 7, then drowsiness does not bother me.  I almost always only take it once a day, but take 4 mg., a whopper dose. Works fantastic on the RLS, though! I don't think I could stand to be without it.

My Rls has gotten worse since I started Requip, earlier in the day and stronger, and now I'm having the same symptons in my wrists. not often, hope that doesn't get worse. Think I will try the Bcomplex,along with Requip,I might be able to take a lower dose, or stop the Requip. Ya Right!

I felt the effect in my muscles.  I am now taking it again at regular interals but have not been able to contact my doctor to find out if there is something else I need to do because of the missing pills.  Does anyone know the answer to this?  I can speak with my physican tomorrow.  Thank You.

Only found out it's name a few years ago.  Took Robaxin (muscle relaxant) for years when needed and it worked great.  Last few years RLS has gotten worse.  Just in time for Requip.  I'm on 1 mg at night.  Works well most of time although symptoms have gotten worse as times progresses.  Also, now have severe aching in feet and legs at times.  Take Tylenol/Codein AND Robaxin at times to get pain and jumping to stop.  Need Requip during daytime ocassionally now and KNOW I'm going to be sleepy for a couple of hours. The tiredness has been the worst side effect.  Also, don't do anything in evenings that requires sitting - i.e. movies, theatre, etc. Legs get so bad I have actually tried marijuana for faster pain relief than the 1/2 - l hour it takes Tyl/Code to work when symptoms are out of control.  Aching comes and goes.  I've found that if I take Requip in early afternoon, I need another 1/2 an hour or so before bed as I'll wake up in middle of night with leg aching or jumping.  Seems 12 hours is the extent of it's effectiveness.  I too have the 'hot flashes', didn't realize it could be the requip.  Absolutely can't get through a night without the meds.  So far seems there is no serious side affects.  I can't imagine trying to function without the requip/generic (I've used both and they seem to work).  Will ask my neurologist about this awful aching and pain when I see her next month but I'm assuming it's all part of the disease.

I knew I had sleep apnea but was unaware of the need for requip. Dr. said I had something like night limb movement that was disturbing my sleep.  Started Requip with .05 and now up to 3mg.for last 2 wks.  For past week cannot keep any food down in the morning.  Am O.K. the rest of the day.  Also very, very tired during day. Dr. says that my &quot;low&quot; dose of requip would not cause daytime sleepiness.  Someone please respond if this has happened to you. Because of daytime sleepiness I now take 100 mg. of Provigil to stay awake during day. I hate doing this!

I am the daughter of a patient who took Requip for RLS.  It originally helped Mom, but it seemed that the RLS became constant rather than just at night.  Doses were increased to 2.5 mg three times per day, and Mom was still having sporadic RLS symptoms.  She was also very sleepy all the time, and her memory appeared to be failing.  Her balance steadily declined, as did the strength in her legs.  Finally, after a bout of septic shock from chemotherapy, she became bedbound.  She was in a nursing home from 12/4/07 until her death 6/2/08 at age 66.  One of her facility doctors suggested she may have had the beginnings of Parkinson's disease, which this drug also treats.  I'm wondering if she actually HAD Parkinson's, and the Requip was masking the symptoms of it.  I agree with those who have said that it sometimes works, and there are hellish side effects.  Make your doctor do his/her homework to see if you have something other than RLS. . .all the symptoms I've seen on this board are symptoms I've seen in my mother.  I'm not sure I'd recommend this drug to anyone.

In school I was a musciular athletic girl and assumed it was the strain I put on my body, however when I had my fisrt child 6 years ago the RLS became so severe I wanted to die.  I used ties to to apply pressure, three or more hot baths in the A.M, falling asleep in the bath at 8 months pregnant.  I fear Requip because I dont twitch, shake, or even jump in my sleep.  Why not a muscle relaxer, whats the difference?

Make sure to get tested for iron deficiencies before starting this med. I had never known a good night's sleep before I started taking Requip. I started with .25mg and only at night (which is when RLS is the worst for me), as I am sensitive to medications. Usually begin to feel the effects after a half hour. Word of advice: don't be alarmed if for the first two weeks you have significant nausea that goes away after you rest for a while- it does go away completely after you have adjusted to it. If you are very sensitive to medications that cause drowsiness, only take requip at night. It's better to take it  only at night than feel like you're walking in a drunken fog during the day. I had taken it for about three months when I began to have episodes at night again, and needed to increase the dose to .5mg. Another tip: don't get the generic, lol, as now since I have been taking ropinirole (the generic) I have been having trouble sleeping and the side effect of anxiety is pretty strong. Overall, I can't live without my Requip!

I began with a small dosage of 1/4mg x3 and gradually increased the dosage to 3mg x3 which masks my leg symptons most of the time. There can be some periods with minimal to very slight leg symtoms on some days. The only side effect seems to be a dry throat.

Extreme Discomfort in Calves when Sitting or Lying Down		1	4	1			5/16/2008 5:45:58 PM	First off, make sure you REALLY do have restless leg syndrome before you buy into the Requip fantasy. Restless leg has become a catch all diagnosis just like fibromyalgia. I was diganosed with both over the past four years. Turns out, I don't have either. I have a rare genetic autosonomal nocturnal seizure condition for which I must take an anticonvulsant. When given Requip for the misdiagnosis of restless leg, I went into what can only be described as tweaking. Force your dr to do his homework before pumping you full of drugs you don't need.

After a year on Requip the RLS became unbearable and was 24/7.  My doctor switched me to another medicine, but the withdrawal period from the Requip was maddening. Requip made me so lethargic and irritable that I feel like I lost a year of my life to it.

I thought it wouldn't hurt to try the meds, nothing else seemed to work. Well, I've had the best sleep I've had in years. It wasn't insomnia, it was RLS. Thank goodness it was diagnosed, now no more sleep aids, only Requip for rls.

Re-Quip helped at first but now it seems like my &quot;jumpy legs&quot; are more severe and around the clock rather than just at night. I even have &quot;spasms&quot; in my lower back. If I don't take the medication I can't go anywhere without severe discomfort and embarrassment.  Flying would be out of the question as no one would be able to sit next to me without getting kicked.  If there was any other drug without the side effects I'd be moving on.

It is somwhat a wonder drug for my moving legs but I have noticed the longer I take it my RLS has become more frequent.  I use to only experience it in late evening and bedtime but now I am having difficulty driving anywhere after 3:oo pm if the trip is more than 30 Min. sometimes just 15 minutes away.  If I get too warm the RLS gets worse having me to take a pill (just had a air flight for 5 hrs very warm on plane) so I had to take a pill just to get still.  I also have alot of calf pain, sick to my stomach (not throwing up actually) and itching deep in my legs.  I have considered stopping this medicine BUT.. I think the side effects may be worth it due to the fact when my RLS kicks in I COULD HAVE JUMPED OFF THAT PLANE.  It is bad when you cannot go to dinner or sit through a movie without taking a pill (which will make you sleepy)  Someone wrote vitamen B works natrually for RLS  I may try it.  Good Luck to all who try this Drug as said before right now I cannot live without it.  It is a wonder drug even though the side effects can be a nightmare.( dreams seem so real even if they are not bad dreams )

If I'm driving and get home almost at bedtime, I've got a problem because I can't take it until I get home and then it won't kick in for a couple of hours.

However, the medication did relieve my RLS which I suffer from 24/7. I had to take 3 doses a day to cover the 24 hour period.

One thing that is good to try is stretching before you go to bed. I do not like the sheets to touch my feet, they are very tender.  The RLS always starts as soon as early evening comes. Another thing that might help is to get into the tub fill it full . and just move your legs back and forth for about 15 min, that will help also.  RLS is very painful and annoying and keeps you awake during the night and then by am your so tired and your day is ruin, just need to take the meds are prescribed, stretch  and keep moving.  Good luck  let your doctor know if its does not work on the meds they have you on.

I was having vivid wild dreams, and God knows what else was happening to my mind and body from this poor excuse for a medication.LISTEN UP FRIENDS !!!!!!!I found a natural cure for Restless Leg Syndrome!!!!  Vitamin B Complex!  It works!You don't have to be on any medication!Try it!  It works for me and I've been on clonazepam for my RLS for 10 years.  I wanted to try something else and get off the addictive clonazepam, and tried the Requip, but it was just another chemical giving me more side effects.  Vitamin B Complex is the best way to rid yourself of the RLS and no side effects and no chems!Go buy some now, you can thank me later.....:)

If I skip 2-3 days and try to take the medication I become very nauseated.  I have tried to lower the dosage with the same result. As long as I take the medicaation regularly it is fine.

On the first night I was on .5 pills and thought that it wouldn't work and I would need to move up to the next dose soon.  No sooner had I fallen asleep, than I was being awoken by the most vivid, real, scary dreams and this happened all night.  I eventually got to the point where my dreams were so real I was becoming violent and didn't even know it!  This was just on my first dose and I am honestly scared to continue with it if this is what happens on this medication.

I also noticed that I am very forgetful at work which is NOT good, and my dreams, boy oh boy do I have weird, vivid lifelike dreams, it is very hard to discern what is real and what is dream. On the upside, I sleep thru the night, something I have not done in years and my RLS is not a factor the past week. Does the side effects outweigh the relief? The jury is still out on that one. My concern is I am getting these horrid side effects on .5mg (the sample pak .25 - 1mg) but my script is for 3mg - going to take that on a friday to gauge any possible increase in side effects so I do not have to deal with them at work if they are bad.

Other	chipingdale, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	1/25/2008 6:18:03 PM	I complained on a creepy crawly feeling beginning usually on my legs, but going all over my entire body including the scalp.  I am constantly itching and scratching usually beginning in the evening when I sit or lay down to watch TV.  It does cause me to loose sleep, but usually fall asleep due to exhaustion.  Recently the doctor diagnosed my symptoms as RLS; however, I do not experience the pain in my legs that most people describe.  My is more like a creepy crawly itching and scratching and goes over my entire body once I start to itch and scratch.  It moves from my legs, stomach, chest, arms, elbows, eyebrows, forehead, scalp.  It is driving me crazy.  I have been on Requip starting out at .25 mg for a couple of days then .5 mg for several days.  I am currently taking 1 mg. and so far I can not say much for the medication.  I will be questioning my doctor regarding the diagnosis and medication.  According to my doctor I was expecting a noticable difference right away (like right after the 1st tablet).  It didn't happen.

As I am bipolar I with very refractory symptoms, my psychiatrist was confident that it may help. I have been on it (as well as Ritalin and Soma) as adjunct therapy to lamictal, cymbalta, and abilify. It's success, in my opinion, has been good to very good.

I thought I had a vitamin deficiency! I worked dialysis and found a lot of my patients that had to sit 4+ hrs used Requip for RLS. Since most were pushing 70 I thought this was something only older adults had. I asked my doctor joking about how I was too young and he said actually even children have RLS. When I started taking the Requip it was amazing to me the difference in my sleep and I didnt realize how that was affecting my partners sleep. Even now if I forget to take it he will say &quot;Did you take your medicine?&quot; I take it and it usually relieves it and sends me into a restful sleep in about 30 minutes. I use to sit up for hours being tired then irritated then angry and eventually just exhausted. I was definitely someone that was having sleep deprivation. For years I thought I had depression I had no idea the way lack of sleep was affecting my mood, my job, and my attitude, especially toward my kids, they were ready for the day always so rested and I didn't have the energy to interact with them. This drug has been a life saver on all levels for me and is the only medication I have to take on a regular basis. I recommend it to anyone. SLEEP MATTERS :)

But, recently I've felt the need for it...restlessness...earlier in the evening and wake up with the &quot;heebie-jeebies&quot; in the morning.  I'm wondering if dosage should be increased and plan a call to the physician who prescribed it.  But, &quot;wiggly&quot; mornings are more than made up for, by hours and hours of uninterrupted sleep.  I recommend this treatment for anyone suffering from RLS.

Other	anynomous, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	9/29/2007 11:24:28 AM	I am taking Requip for Depression &amp; Anxiety.The drug has lifted my mood, but made only a small dent in anxiety at 1mg.  It does cause some sleepiness for me.  Too much sleepiness at 2mg (which seems to help anxiety), but workable at 1mg (which only helps depression.)

The only draw back of it is that it takes 2 hours to work for me.  So if i wait until bedtime to use it, I am usually awake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours until my legs calm down.  It would be nice to have the med work faster as I only want to take the med if i need it.
