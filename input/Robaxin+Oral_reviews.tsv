Two days of rest and easy activity coupled with ibuprofen did not help. Then took 7 doses of Robaxin 500 mg over two days which did not seem to effect any change. Immediate relief obtained through heat (hot water bottle) and rest. Discontinued Robaxin.

I was getting steroid and trigger point injections which only work for a brief period.  I was in the hospital and the doctor put me on robaxin 500mg and with an hour of taking it noticed an incredible difference. For those who have muscle spasms that is contributing to their pain then robaxin works. No nausea (which for me is a miracle in itself) and it does not make me sleepy during the day, but does help me relax at bedtime.  Give it an honest try. I was very surprised.

While the daytime presence of these symptoms was relatively manageable, the disruption of my sleep was very problematic. I started using 1000mg of Robaxin (methcarbamol) with 400mg of ibuprofen at night and my sleep has been sound and mostly restful. While I can't attest to daytime use, I've got to say that the combination of these two has given me an overall improved quality of sleep, much better than sleeping medications!

Must be taken with physical therapy to get the complete relief, heat adds increased comfort. Chronic bad posture and hydration must be addressed for long term success. Keep in mind that this is muscle relaxer, does nothing for actual vertebral or joint degeneration.

It is constant, I cannot breath in fully, I'm in SO much pain. I'm so frustrated. I can BARELY move and need assistance walking. I started to take Robaxin for this and it doesn't even TOUCH what I'm going through. Nothing. I've taken Flexeril and Soma in the past and those work 1000 times better than this stuff. I'm stuck in bed, cannot work, can't drive and can't breathe. And no thanks to Robaxin.

It does not make me drowsy like some other muscle relaxers. It isn't quite as dramatic in it's effect but the alternative is worse; like taking Flexeril and having to sleep! Skelaxin works about the same if not a little better but is really expensive so I am glad this much less expensive alternate works for me.  This medication allows me to function and receive some moderate relief.

I have 2 herniated discs, and Deg. disc disorder. I am upset that is for short term only. It's the only thing I have taken that works very well. I have been on it for 3 years but my Dr. recently took me off of it. Haven't found anything else that works yet.

I also broke my tailbone and chipped my L3, and have 2 bulging discs in T2 an T3. I have really bad muscle spasms and muscle discomfort. I was prescribed this med and have felt a lot more relief than with flexaril.

I can work and take it.It does help me sleep at night, when I have difficulty going to sleep, due to chronic pain.

My Dr. prescribed 500 mg and it gave me more flexability in dosage than the 750.  There were no side effects/sleepiness and I could slowly taper off the dosage fairly quickly.

This drug worked miracles on my back pain (along with Piroxicam)--pain I've had for months was gone in 24 hours!
Muscle Spasm	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	45-54	9/21/2007 5:01:35 AM	bad nausea, even if I eat
