The Dr. gave him this and he is a happy baby. I love him. He is breastfeed. He sleeps well for a 2 month old. I love it and would tell anyone.

I was reluctant to give him a daily medication, but he really needs it (spitting up, burping, sleeping disturbances, fussiness).  It has helped him a lot and has had no noticeable side effects.

After trying three other acid reducters by Doctor remandations; We were prescribed THIS medication and the results were miracle like.  He has been on the medication for a year now and he is 18 months old and is slowly gaining weight as he is a little over 20 lbs now.  He is a very small child, BUT we are so happy to have finally found a medication he takes once in the morning prior to eating and NO problems for the rest of the day.  He is our little angel now, with sleeping and eating like a normal young toddler.  THANKS for reading this...
