High Cholesterol	environomxii, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male		5/27/2012 7:45:51 PM	As a previous user of Cholestyramine, I find it necessary to emphasize my terrible experience. I used it for about 4 months as directed but encountered remarkable adverse effects, including passing out during my failed attempts of bowel movement due to intestinal tract blockage. Consequently, I needed to do Upper GI Endoscopy as well as Open Heart Surgery. Pulges were found in my artery vessels and advised to be produced by severe strain during bowel movement. 
Chronic Diarrhea	mooie72, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/16/2012 1:29:08 PM	I have only just picked up my prescription for this drug so I'm not sure how it will work but hoping for the best after having severe IBS for 11 years. After that many years of dreading the trip to the bathroom I'm hoping it will work! Just wondering what time of day is best to take it? I'm on no other meds other than the contraception pill that I take at night.
High Cholesterol	MGW, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/11/2012 5:02:35 PM	My Cardiologist started with 4 grams daily, then increased to 8 grams daily. Each pill is 1 gram. For the first time, my combined cholesterol count was finally below 200. I've been taking this drug for 3 1/2-4 years with consistent results. I'm motivated to follow the DASH diet; not as difficut as I would have thought now. 
Other	stfntony, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/14/2011 12:23:41 AM	I had my gallbladder removed November 2010.  My X/doctor told me that I wouldnt have any troubles.  I was frustrated and completely in disbelief that he said that.  I clearly had major issues from the start.  I spent seven and a half months with constant diarrhea.  I began taking the Cholestyramine Oral in June 2011 and it has made a tremedous difference.  The problem is how long to you have to take it?  My current doctor said you never know unless you just take yourself off the medication. WARNING TO ALL...Let me tell you...I will never do that again.  I was off the meds for three days recently, and almost ended up in the hospital.  I was throwing up my food...like acid reflex..bleeding from my bottom, extreme severe diarrhea...I am not sure if I my body will ever correct itself or if I will ever be ok without it.
Chronic Diarrhea	hanras, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/10/2011 3:32:51 PM	I have been using the powder for over a year due to colitis. It has been wonderful! I have tried at least 10 other pills and none have worked for my diarrhea but this. It does not cause constipation and I am sensitive to all meds. The only side effect I have had is sensitive teeth.
Chronic Diarrhea	wintergarden, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/10/2010 7:11:11 PM	I suffered for years from chronic diarrhea with no relief from other drugs. Some drugs are mood-altering and I am in recovery for awhile now and did not want to relapse. This drug immediately stopped the diarrhea and I can tell if I forgot to take it. Just found out from my doc yesterday it lowers cholesterol, so I am very pleased!!!!!
Chronic Diarrhea	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/10/2010 1:29:24 PM	I had been suffering with diarrhea for at least 8 months everytime I ate something. Been to my regular dr. with no results after numerous tests. Referred to Gastro and was perscribed this only after talking with him and that I had my galbladder removed 14 yrs ago. Scheduled for a colonoscopy and in the mean time started with this just after the 1st time I took it I was amazed that it worked. Had my procedure and found nothing (thank goodness!!) It has truely given me my life back, now I don't have to worry about eating while out and finding a bathroom immediately.

Chronic Diarrhea	mrbtek, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	2/19/2010 1:59:02 PM	After having my gall bladder removed, I was having problems with frequent diarrhea (up to 5-7 times in a morning.)  Now, I am taking this each night and the diarrhea is a thing of the past. One or two times I forgot to take the medicine and was right back in the bathroom the next morning.  I no longer forget.

This medicine began working after just 1 dose. I only gave 4* for ease of use because it is unpleasant tasting &amp; has to be mixed in a beverage. This medicine has been a life saver!

Chronic Diarrhea	Ames, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/14/2009 9:27:22 AM	3 1/2 years ago...long story short, I had a surgery performed then 8 days later my bowels obstructed.  During both surgeries, the doctors had to cut off 3 ft. of my small intestine, 6 inches of my colon and take the valve out that attaches the small and large intestine. This caused me to have major bathroom issues because the valve is what keeps your food from going through you.  After seeing numerous doctors, losing a ton of weight and developing hemrhoids...6 months later I was prescribed this medication and was finally able to go back to work. The reason for the 5 stars is because this medication has been a miracle drug for me.

I had chronic diarrhea for 30+ years!!!   I thought it was my nerves. Then I thought it was food allergies.  After seeing 3 GI specialists, one finally recommended this. He has since moved out of state but if you ever run across Dr Zuyrowski, give him a big hug for me.

I spend 2 years with chronic diarrhea and intense stomach/intestinal pain everytime I ate.  This kept me from enjoying life.  Doctors said that I had gastroenteritis and/or irritable bowel syndrome.  Eventually my doctor realized that all of this was due to the fact that I had my gallbladder out 15 years ago.  Now I drink a pack each morning before work.  I have finally gotten my life back! I am so thankful for this medicine! 
Chronic Diarrhea	artskiwendy777@gmail.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	3/6/2008 10:42:02 PM	I had been using the Cholestyramine without the aspartame in it and when I got the refill the pharmacist gave me the light instead of the regular with sucrose.I took the box back and the pharmachist thought I must be stupid and just took the light out of the box an dgave it back to me. I can taste aspartame and get headaches from it. I DO NOT THINK ASPARTAME SHOULD BE GIVEN TO HUMANS CONSIDERING THE SIDEEFFECTS. WHen I took it back they told me it was the one without the aspartame and I had an old package that had a different color and took it back. I don't know what to do. Is it illegal to give me a drug that I said I didn't want the phenyllanline in it. I don't know what to do.
