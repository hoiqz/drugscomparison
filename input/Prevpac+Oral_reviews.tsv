Other	whytakeit, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	6/13/2012 10:12:20 AM	I posted the review here on 5/22/12 when I was on 6th day of taking Prevpac.  After completion of the 14 day therapy of this drug, the better taste was gone. But, starting from the last 2 days of on this drug to this day, I have been feeling nausea, weak, lower back pain and stomack disconfort.       I was a very healthy &amp; active person, and I was not on any prescription drug before I started taking Prevpac. I regret having taken this drug solely based on the Urea Breath test.  How reliable are the breath tests?
Other	whytakeit, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	5/22/2012 2:03:35 PM	I told my doctor about my dry mouth during an annual routine physical.  He gave me a blood test for H. Pylori.  The result was inconclusive.  Then he gave me a breath test which was +.  He perscibed me the Prevpac.  But I do not have any of the symptms of stomach ulcer caused by H. Pylori.  Since most people with H. Pylori have no symptms and I don't want to have the high risk of getting cancer.  So, I decided to take it.  I am on the sixth day of Prevpac.  I have experienced bitter taste since taking the Prevpac.  I don't know if it works for me or not since I didn't have any of the symptoms of this ulcer before I started Prevpac. My dry mouth seems worse after taking Prevpac. 
Ulcer of Duodenum caused by Bacteria Helicobacter Pylori	Danielle , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	4/30/2012 3:15:39 PM	I was diagnosed as having the H Pylori infection after having a month of dull and sharp pains in my left side and sour stomach for weeks when my stomach was empty. My doctor gave me Prevpac to which I was very weary of taking because of the reviews I read. I took my meds at the EXACT time every day. I took them with a pretty high dose of probiotics which helped SO MUCH with any possible side effects. I took my AM with breakfast and my PM right before bed. The only effects I had were the first two days were really tiring and I had a headache. I took these first two days on a weekend and took some pain meds. After that the two weeks werent bad. I had small bouts of diaphrea on and off but nothing to cry about. The only constant thing was the metallic taste in my mouth that kind of messed with my tast but mint gum helped a lot with that as well as taking it before bed so that it really didnt bother me. Needless to say... my pain went away slowly and nearly disappeared after stoping the meds. I took my 2 weeks post antibiotic test and came back cleared of H Pylori so my experience wasnt all that bad. I hope this helps.

But my labs came back positive for the bacteria and i def. wanted to get rid of it. I have been on the treatment for a week now, and the first couple of days I felt very nauseous after taking the morning portion. I also had a horrible taste in my mouth that would almost make me gag and it would also wake me up in the middle of the night because it was very disgusting, but its gotten a lot better now. I have been eating sugar free oatmeal with 2% lactose free milk in the mornings and having two yogurts from the only brand i found that actually mentioned the active cultures on the ingredients to prevent yeast infection that other people mentioned. So far, all this has worked, and i have been feeling no pain and ive continued my normal activities and normal food. I have also had normal bowel movements. I would say this treatment is agressive but if you make sure that you eat things to prevent an irritation in your stomach you should be perfectly fine.

Ulcer of Duodenum caused by Bacteria Helicobacter Pylori	Chrislieu, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	9/23/2011 4:58:50 PM	I was given this medication over 7 years ago, it cured my ulcers and h. pylori infection. But, 2 years ago I started to feel ill and had constant sinus infections &amp; horrible fatigue. The fatigue caused depression, anxiety, etc. I recently went to a dr. and found out I had candidiasis from prolonged antacid use. Be careful to not become reliant on the antacid, I was told I only needed it for 2 weeks, but I had taken it for close to 6 years. The pac works, but can cause future problems, be very careful and eat a really healthy diet with lots of water.

It is intense but liveable. Every DRUG is not for everybody.  I think, however it's unfair to rate this drug on Day 1 or 5 of use.  I agree it does leave a bad taste in your mouth but I have not experienced other symptoms. It has worked for me because I have dealt with an Ulcer and Heartburn for years.

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	4	Male	35-44	7/17/2011 1:59:23 PM	My doctor prescribed this after a positive H. Pylori blood test. An ulcer has not be specifically confirmed, but symptoms seem to indicate that I have one.My doctor ordered the three medications separately. I honestly don't know if they come combined. 20 mg of Lansoprazole, 1 g of Amoxicillin  and 500 mg of Clarithromycin. The instructions from the doctor's office for taking them were to take the Lansoprazole a half hour before a meal (breakfast and dinner) and then take the two antibiotics after the meal.The only side effects I had from the meds were some minor diarrhea 24 hours after the first dose that lasted a few hours. I was feeling all better 36 hours. I did have ravenous hunger about two or three hours after the meds for the first two or three days but that went away. I did have a bitter/metalic taste in my mouth that would start about three hours after taking the meds and last for a few hours. It wasn't anything that affected my appetite. While I was eating I couldn't taste it. One other thing I did notice is I tended to feel more full then usual after eating. Other then those side effects I didn't have any others. No nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, etc.Since I just finished the protocol a few days ago I can't say that it has completely rid me of the infection. However, my heartburn has subsided quite a bit. I did read that it can take two to eight weeks for ulcers to completely heal after treatment.The biggest pain about the whole experience was remembering to take the proper pill at the proper time.I highly recommend doing the treatment. Chances are you'll have the same side effects I did (they are the most common) and they really aren't that bad considering the alternatives with having an untreated H. Pylori infection (bleeding ulcers and cancer).

The doctor asked me to stop on the 14th day when I had an allergic reaction to it.   Baically I ended up with hives and severe itching.  I've had this allergic reaction before so I knew exactly what to do.  Its very stroong and leaves a filmy taste in your mouth but that goes away when you stop taking it.

Although the first day is awful!!! I would describe it as the worst pain I ever felt, but it goes away around the third day. One tip is milk!! It helps so much!  I would suggest taking them with milk. The only question I have is did anyone have an affect on their menstral cycle?

I also have a bad taste in my mouth.  I pray this gets better because I need the healing of the meds, but I don't know if I can handle the sickness for 14 days.

Other	vanillabean, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	10/13/2010 11:40:15 AM	After having read some reviews on the prevpac I was apprehensive about taking it.  I have problems with anxiety and I don't like to take medication.  I'm on Day 7 and haven't had any problems.  My symptoms are gone, my appetite is back and I'm able to eat.  The only side effects I've felt are that funny taste in the mouth and a dry mouth.  I remedy that by sucking on hard candy or chewing gum.  I also drink plenty of water.  I take probiotics with my lunch and have had no problems with diarrhea or stomach cramping.  Please keep in mind that the majority of people who take this drug have no problems and feel much better after taking it.  People who have side effects are more likely to write reviews on websites.  Don't be afraid to take this medication.  People who are symptomatic and positive for H Pylori need to take this treatment.  I love homeopathic/alternative medicine but there are no proven studies that any of that works to get rid of the H. Pylori once you've been infected.  For me I will probably look to alternative/natural therapies (diet, herbs, honey, etc) once I complete the treatment.  For me the motivation to stick with this treatment was the realization that I could become much sicker and develop ulcers or worse!  Best wishes to everyone who is fighting this infection!

I am taking this for an ulcer caused by H.pylori. I ate something on day 7 that caused me to have a minor ulcer attack. Not too helpful. I have been afraid to try anything else since then. I am hoping one treatment will do it. The first week I had nausea which caused me to vomit and also headaches. Durning the night I get the horrible taste in my mouth and also experienced extreme vaginal itching which was the worst part.

Bad taste in mouth, only at night.  Nausea and diarrhea that seems to happen only in the middle of the night.  So, sleepless nights, tired. I am taking probiotics to counter the possibility of any yeast infections.  I suggest using no less than 50 billion once a day and don't take it with the meds.  Wait until an hour or two between the two.  I am very skeptical regarding this treatment as it is proven that GERD, acid reflux, heartburn, etc., is caused by LOW acid.  So, taking prevacid makes your acid even lower.  I'm afraid in the end this is going to do more harm than good and I will forever be seeking medical advice for an ailment that won't go away.  Hmmm, money train for the docs?

Had the bitter taste as soon as I started the treatment. Subsided a bit now.  Headaches got worse, I cringe to even think of touching my eyelids. Had to start taking tylenol and flonaze nasal spray to relief some of the pressure in the head. Sore back of the neck and upper back area.  Nausea was tough at the beginning, subsiding a bit now. Very fatigued/tired.  I noticed that if I eat first, the medication isn't as hard on the stomache.  If I eat after I take it the meds take a toll on the stomache. Gastroenterologist initially had me on the 10 day treatment but added 2 more days. Have lost already 5lbs..looks like a lb a day.Taking all this medication doesn't bother me as I'm used to it as I have ulcerative colitis as well, diagnosed 3 yrs. ago.  I'm hoping this treatment works...keeping my fingers crossed.

It takes 8-10 years to blood test to show the real result. your doctor should know this. There is a breath test that could be done during this time.

I read a lot of these before starting it.  I take in the AM on an empty stomach.  Don't eat for 2 hrs then eat very light.  I do get loose bowels, not diarrhea.  Lasts in the AM maybe 15 minutes.  Never in the evening.  I do not eat 3hrs before the evening dose, and I do not eat after.  No problems.  Sleep well.  Do have slight headache, one tylenol cures.  I get some nausea in AM only.  Use cold compress on back on neck, stops that. I take the doses with a full 16 oz's of water and I drink water all day. One 8 OZ glass an hour. I am post kidney cancer (one kidney), no gallbladder. I am followed closely by my Kidney Dr.  Overall, the meds do not really effect me as some have said.  I suggest an empty stomach for each dose.  Works for me.

While I can't rate how effective it is for getting rid of the bacteria, I can say I feel so much better.  My stomach has felt messed up for years, and it now feels better than it has in years.  I didn't have very many side effects- bad taste, slight nausea, lack of appetite.  I had really severe nausea the first night, but my fiance figured it was because I overate at dinner, so it might not be the Prevpac.  Overall, I absolutely love this medication!

Ulcer of Duodenum caused by Bacteria Helicobacter Pylori	Red, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	11/20/2009 12:28:21 PM	I'm on day 4 of this medicine.  Like others, I too am experiencing the metallic taste in my mouth, but no headaches or other pains.  Taking Immodium has helped me tremendously with the cramping.  I also find it easier to take this medicine on an empty stomach as another reviewer suggested.  I wait at least 2 hours to eat after taking the medicine which has helped ease some of the side effects.  I hope this stuff works because I don't think I could handle another round of this.  This is absolutely the worst medication I have ever taken and I'm dreading the next 10 days until I'm done.

Worst taste in my mouth...ever!  Nothing gets rid of it.  I also have been feeling pretty nauseous and running to the bathroom nonstop.  I have no appetite.  If the meds work then great it was worth it.   
Other	manylander, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	35-44	11/1/2009 8:48:15 AM	I had an EGD and tested positive for H.Pylori. I have no ulcer or gastridis just general dyspepsia complaints.I am into the 7th day of this medicine. Last two days I've started to experience softer stools that require &quot;immediate&quot; trips to the bathroom. Plus every now and then I feel nauseated. I am also sleeping very bad, bordering insomnia but that might be due to stress or anxiety.Generally I nearly never suffer from side effects, but PrevPak is really testing me. The bad taste in the mouth is there every now and then too but that is not a big concern compared to the nausea and the runs.I am eating a lot of yogurt wit probiotics and will go get a probiotic pill later today. My research shows that the runs are due to the death of helpful bacteria in the intestines and probiotics and or yogurt is a good way to replenish those...I hate H.Pylori and hope that PrevPak, despite its horrible effects, will eradicate it from my system.

Have to admitt the worst is this horrible taste that doesn't go away. even chewing gum and sucking on hard candy doesn't help. this morning  feel really sick to my stomach. If it works after being in such pain it will be worth it

Yet even with my good Blue Cross insurance, my copay was $140!!!  Unbelievable, I will never get this RX again, there is no way that buying individually would cost me $140!  RIDICULOUS!
Other	Bianca, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	9/15/2009 10:46:52 AM	Medicines usually don't bother me but Prevpac is an exception, this is the most horrible medicine I ever used.  I got all the side effects listed and it has made me very sick.  I almost stopped it several times but did not since I do not want to go through this another time.  The only thing that gave me relief was mixing honey and cinnamon that calmed my stomach and I could sleep. This mixture also gave me temporary relief from bad taste in my mouth.  Some other side effects like blurred vision, head ache, and chest pain, and anxiety does not go away with anything. I am hoping this will all go away after 14 days treatment is over. To my opinion, they need to come up with something better.

I'm still waiting for my CT Scan appt .

Other	fourbluesxipink, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	2	2	Female	35-44	6/3/2009 1:30:30 AM	My daughter took this drug for 30 days because of a h-pylori. She was 14 years old. I will never forget those 30 days, nor will she. She had such severe stomach pain while taking it that she was rolling around on the floor in horrible pain many times. That was two years ago.Now my husband is taking it (14 days) with horrible stomach pain as well. He can't leave the house because his pain is so severe. He is incredibly uncomfortable, and I hear him moaning many times. It was the same way for my daughter. This has been a very difficult treatment in our household. However, it did work for my daughter, and cleared up her h-pylori in her stomach and she felt it was worth it.
Ulcer of Duodenum caused by Bacteria Helicobacter Pylori	PAINFUL BUT I HAVE THE SOLUTION, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	5/20/2009 10:56:31 AM	The first 2 days, I received every side effect possible, except for the bad taste in the mouth. Vomiting, excruciating stomach pains, dizziness, weakness, diarrhea and nausea. Then I realized, it only happened in the mornings, right when i ate. At night (which is about 2-3 hours after I ate) I received no side effects. What worked for me is this: Give at least a 2 hour gap from when you eat and take the pills. Meaning, if you ate at 8am, don't take the pills until 10am. Then don't eat for another 2 hours. You also need a full 12 hour gap between the morning &amp; evening treatment. 10am/10pm works best for me. Drink lots of water, and be on a high fiber diet during this 14 day period. You will get frequent headaches &amp; trouble sleeping/bad dreams. I do promise though, if you stick with the 2 hour/12 hour regiment I explained, it will work much better.I still, however, hate this medication. It's the worse I've ever took in my entire life. I never get side effects and this is the first time. Those first 2 days, when I took it as directed, my symptons were worse than LABOR.

I went to the E.R. and they did a blood workup. They prescribed this to me. I took all of it and went back home to Texas and made a checkup with my family physician. He took more blood and still came back as I had h-pylori. He prescribed another 14 day Prevpac. Going on my third dosage now I still have it. The second time around I was starting to get the side effects as deep depression, runny stools, and adominal pain. I told my doctor the side effects I was experiencing but he still prescribed the third dosage. I've taken 10 doses of the third and the side effects are coming back. I don't know if the medication is working at all since I've taken it three times and the blood work still shows I have it. I'm scared to think that if it doesn't treat it that this could turn into stomach cancer. After the experience that I've been going through, I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.After living with the pain for a little over seven months and taking three dose packs it isn't clearing up what my doctor said &quot;wasn't a big deal.&quot;

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	35-44	2/25/2009 1:52:00 PM	I was diagnosed with H.Pylori after having an upper endoscopy. This medication has so many side effects. I have 2 days left and I can't wait to be done. I experienced extreme fatigue, metallic taste in my mouth,sometimes it feels like my throat muscles tighten up and I can't swallow right. It lasts anywhere from a few minutes to an hour each day. I hope once I stop the meds it is not like that. I have had to run to the bathroom a couple times and had no control over holding it. Hot flashes, cold flashes, &amp; it must be the meds because I had extensive labs done 6 days ago and they were all normal including hormone levels. I never want to do this combo again!! I hope it works.

The first day I took it I had extreme nausea and chest pains. I ended up going to urgent care and they gave me something for the nausea and the chest pains did go away. I did have trouble sleeping and the metal taste in my mouth strangely only occured at night. However, 11 days in I am having the vaginal and rectal side effects (sorry). I was advised to avoid certain foods and alcohols during treatment which i see a lot of websites have left out. It was tough treatment but i think it worked.

There is constant dry mouth(worse than i ever have had) and a metal type taste in my mouth-constantly.  It doesn't matter what I drink or eat, i cant get rid of the taste and dry mouth-its really terrible!!  Dealing with this for 14 days(length of my treatment)is very hard, but I have to get better!  I would rate this a 3 outta 5 overall-it would be a 5 outta 5 but the taste and dry mouth thing ruins it!  Plus it makes me tired,and I have been getting horrible headaches!

Nexium with the two antibiotics probably works just as well to kill the bug.

I have had heartburn syptoms for over a year, but my previous doctor just gave me prescription Zantac and sent me home. Finally, my new doctor told me to try this and I have had zero heartburn ever since. I do experience dry mouth and a strange taste in my mouth more than any of the other side effects, but it's definitely worth the benefits. Just make sure to read all of the warnings before you take this medicine, there are a lot of meds and other random things that can not be combined with these ingredients.

Starting with the horrible nauseating taste that will not go away. Lack of energy, back pain, loss of appetite, constant trips to the bathroom started on day one. Sweats and weird dreams are a night occurance. Lately the headaches have become unbearable to the point of affecting my vision. This is day 14 for me and I am hoping I can tolerate the last dose. Not wanting to go through this again has pushed me to take this awful medication.

I had the stomach cramps, itchy skin, headaches, back pain, rash, hives, tight-swore throat and a little dizziness.  Im not sure why I had experience all these side effects but I am thinking maybe its because of my size considering the recommended dosage.  I am only 5ft 1 and weight 110 Ibs, so maybe thats a big factor.  Overall, I must say that I started feeling some relief of interjection and a little better as far as my stomach go.  However, I decided to stop taking the medication after I broke out into a rash and hives.  I have contacted my doctor and I am awaiting his recommendation before I continue.  At present I do feel like I need something for the itching and hives...Im thinking Benadryl, but I wont take anything until I hear back from my doctor.  In all, this medication seems to help my initial problem but created other problems stemming from the side effects.

I lost 8 lbs. total during the course. After finishing meds noticed am now having difficulty swallowing as if though the muscles in my throat have been damaged. Next time i am diagnosed with any infection will seek natural cures. i believe prevacid weakend stomache acid so much that now my digestive system has been negatively altered. Use precautions with any pump inhibitors. Stomache acid is there for a reason.

The depression &amp; terrible dreams are not worth taking the drug. I did switch the Precacid to Nexium. I had taken Nexium previously without side effects. The drug companies should be notified as depression is not a symptom of a side effect.

They did an ultasound and my gall bladder was normal.The nausea is 100% caused by gas production in my stomach. No other symptoms but bloating and nausea.I forgot to take the medication this morning and almost felt normal the whole day. Took it at5 pm and was sick in one hour. Larry McGovern
