High Blood Pressure	eaglemom59, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	1/25/2010 4:49:38 PM	I started on this med because HBP 210/104 and very swollen legs. After two weeks of feeling very sick, blurred vision and chest pain, I ended up in ER. I was admitted for 5 days, Angiogram, stress testing. Ended up with BP of 86/52 AVG and had many bags of IV fluid ran in to up blood volume. Taken off med and bp went to normal after the iv fluid and DC of this drug. I wanted to break my husbands neck, this drug made me so angry and raised my BS to 496. I am now off the drug, on Insulin, I can see again, and I am no longer feeling like a witch.It did not work for me, it did lower the BP but the diarreha and sore joints and everything that happened just scared me off. I am to switch to plain Lisinpril and HTZ seperate and I'm scared to even fill the scrips. I think for those this works for, Yay! For me, NO.
High Blood Pressure	noelvm, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		1/12/2010 8:07:37 PM	The original version of this drug without the mix was made by Merck 20 years ago. It was hawked as a bp drug with no side effects. They were right. It lowered my bp and had none of the usual male side effects of ED and being tired all the time. Everything worked fine.Once the generic came out lots of people started to switch to it because it was cheaper.I, and many others found that the generic made me tired and the original did not. There are several cases where individuals sued their HMO to get the original. I just pay the extra. It's much cheaper than it use to be, especially if you use a Canadian Pharmacy.My doseage has gone up and the doc added the dual version pill with hydrochlorothiazide which is just a water pill additive and it still works fine. I'm now 65 and my bp is 130 over 80. I've been on it a long time and I'm doing fine, but I don't on the generic version and never have.noelvm

High Blood Pressure	sakorox, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	10/7/2008 11:32:53 PM	I am 26 and had moderately severe hypertension (190/110) and it was really affecting my anxiety... when my blood pressure went up, so did my anxiety. After numerous trials with other BP meds, I was put on this combo.  I am taking the  10-12.5 dosage.  Worst side effect for me is tingling of my hands and sometimes feet. My hands seem to fall asleep in any position above my heart after 10 seconds or so. It's pretty annoying, especially when just laying around.BP and hear rate are completely normal, however! 
High Blood Pressure	jajohnston@sbcglobal.net, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	7/22/2008 5:05:10 PM	The problem is that pharmacies keep changing manufacturers and each new one makes the drug appear different.  For example, the manufacturer that I last used was Lupin Limited which I found out was located in India, which really blew my mind. NOw it has changed, mostly because I changed pharmacies to the manufacturer, Watson and I have no idea where they are located.  Lupin Ltd. put their tablets in a child-proof plastic sleeve which was somewhat safer but more difficult to get the tablets out.  Those tablets have, for the past 10 years been a yellowish brown color.  These new tablets made by WAtson are blue. Same strength.  This is extremely confusing to people, especially older people.  There should be some consistency in drugs, especially the color.

High Blood Pressure	Patient PhD, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/6/2007 7:22:19 PM	I currently take Zestoretic in combination with Verelan PM for high blood pressure. This has been an effective combination of medications for my hpertension for nearly five years now. No major side effects so far, but I have to plan my mornings carefully since it does make me urinate more often than usual shortly after taking it. Generally, if I take this medicine when I wake up, before leaving for work, my bathroom routine returns to normal by noon or so.

Then the 1st of this year, 2007 I got the new doctor, and right away he changed me to ZESTORIC &amp; VIOLA! My BP has been normal for the past 10 months! So, I love it!  Thanks to the company &amp; people who make this great medication! &amp; Thank you, Dr. David ~ PATTI M
