Stuffy Nose	lesley, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	2	Female	35-44	3/11/2010 10:42:30 AM	I took this medication last night due to stuffy nose/ headcold/sinus headcold. my husband said I was talking out of my head, saying crazy things! All I remember is I felt like I had drank a 12 pack of beer!! I did not like how it made me feel. This is the strongest med I have ever taking for cold! I would not recomend this at all!! especially for kids! I am 35 years old and it knocked me out! It was kinda like a date rape drug. I couldnt remember anything after I started feeling so drunk I couldnt even hold my head up!!

Cold Symptoms	mom2cait, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/31/2009 9:26:47 PM	I gave this medication to my daughter, who is 11 years old (Dr. gave us some to relieve cold symptoms)....... a short while later, she said &quot;this stuff works but I'm NEVER taking it again&quot;. She was VERY groggy and didn't like the feeling. Then she was totally passed out on the couch for a solid 3 hours. I'll never use it again. She felt awful and 'drugged' the rest of the night.
Cold Symptoms	Tiffany, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	4/17/2009 12:54:06 AM	When I gave this medicine to my son i was expecting him to finally get some sleep, since he and I had both been up because of his illness. Well, the complete opposite happened. He was running, screaming, and just acting like a crazy person. I will not give this to him anymore. I call it baby crack! 
Cold Symptoms	3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	3-6	2/21/2009 3:01:48 PM	My 3.5 year old was on this for cold symptoms.  It made him absolutely crazy, no joke.  He would scream/cry for no reason and he was very &quot;evil&quot;.  He's never like that at all.  He's a calm, well-behaved, loving child yet while he was on VazoTan, we called him the &quot;little demon&quot;.  It also made going to sleep and staying asleep almost impossible.  I stopped giving it to him and threw it all in the trash.
