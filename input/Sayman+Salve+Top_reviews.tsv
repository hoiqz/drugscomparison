Diaper Rash	BenMom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	6/9/2012 7:35:23 PM	My son was teething and had a bad diaper rash. I remember my parents using the salve on many skin irritations and I bought it to use on my son. It soothed the diaper rash pain right away and the rash was gone in no time.

Skin Irritation	jerrytt, 65-74 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	2/26/2012 3:03:11 PM	Like others, I've bragged about this product as I am now doing: It's the best salve available on the market for skin irritations, diaper rash or rashes anywhere on the body including the booty. Having used it since 1969 I will not only attest to its effectiveness and wonder, I will go as far as say it, besides penicillin is mankind's answer to quick healing with certainty. As a walking salesman, I had many problems prior to using it, not excluding Vaseline and a potato in the back pocket (haven't figured that out yet, but it sure was wet and messy). Once Sayman is applied, you immediately feeling a rash going away with relief. To me, it was gone in hours. A miracle drug? You be the judge if you're prone to jock itch, rashes and other irritations.  On the downside, I only wish it were less expensive than $10 for 2 oz and $20 for 4 oz. jars.  Still, when confronted with cost, nothing, I say nothing I've ever used comes close to healing as this powerful miracle of the 20th and now 21st century!

Other	Vickie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/17/2011 7:57:32 AM	I've had a small tub of the salve for many years. I use it sparingly.  I found that the instant you get a burn from hot grease, touch of an iron any kind of burn you put this on and it will draw out the heat, and when the pain is over you won't have a blister, pain or scar.  It's a wonder drug.  I just wish I could find more.
Skin Irritation	yakabobalu, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	2/13/2011 9:36:11 PM	I am over 70, and like other reviewers, I grew up with Sayman Salve. I have always found it very effective.  Interesting that an earlier reviewer reported using his/her last jar on a cat with a sore butt.  My father swore by Sayman Salve and one of his favorite claims was that it would &quot;scab over a cat's butt in 3 days&quot;. 
Skin Irritation	Cami, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/22/2011 4:38:49 PM	As others have said, we have used this salve for generations for any/all skin problems.  We've used it on our animals for skin problems, too, with the same outstanding results.  Miraculous salve.   I have jars in every room and a few pre-mixed with antibiotic ointment and/or hydrocortosone as a precaution when needed.   It's rare that the salve by itself doesn't do the trick almost instantly in many cases.
Skin Irritation	babawa, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/8/2010 4:48:28 PM	I grew up using Sayman Salve for almost everything. I can remember my family always having a jar of Sayman Salve. It is very effective at treating a wide variety of skin irritations and always worked very quickly, most of the time overnight!! I am having trouble finding some, we used the last jar we had on one of our cats who had a problem with a sore butt.

We use it on bites,scrapes, diaper rashes, and even diabetic ulcers on my legs. It has also been used for altheletic feet and jock itch. I use it for everything. A great old-time remendy that works for just about everything. My Blessing to cracked feet.

We use it on our animals for small skin problems.
