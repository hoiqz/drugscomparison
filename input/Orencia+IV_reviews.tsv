Rheumatoid Arthritis	Murph, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	8/9/2012 9:47:21 PM	I had my first Orencia Infusion on July 30.  There was no problem the first 24 hours.  I became increasingly sick with severe flu-like symptoms.  My white count at the time of the infusion was 12, (high because of a back injection I'd had one week prior).  After getting sicker and sicker, I went to the ER on August 5 and my white count was 15.5.I have all-over body pain, mouth pain (but no sores) headache, and fatigue.  I was given a shot in the ER and put on Keflex for 10 days.  I had bad chills which went away after the shot.  All other symptoms remain.  I am frightened.  The hospital personnel said they have never had a patient who had bad side effects.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	:)marie, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		6/29/2012 8:39:18 AM	I have severe RA. Inflammation #'s off the charts.Orencia has been a lifesaver for me.  My only complaints have been extreme tiredness, and VERY sensitive skin on my arms and legs.  Feels like constant sunburn - never lets up. I'm not sure that it's from the Orencia, but can't imagine what else can be causing this.  I find little or no info from others regarding this issue.  I would certainly appreciate any feedback.Thank you.:)marie

I got it again and was fine, but after about 4 doses it stopped working.

Prior to Orencia I was on Enbrel for a year and Humeria for another year and had major side-effect with them.  So far I am very pleased with Orencia.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/25/2012 4:54:03 PM	BEWARE....I'm a 35 year old female who has had RA for 3years. I had my first infusion Jan 24, 2012. After my first couple of minutes into it I had a reaction my ears started itching. Then they slowed my I V down but it didn't help by the time I knew what was going on my throat was swelling shut. I had to be rushed to the ER my eyes was bloody and I had swelling on the brain. So be VERY careful not saying this will happen to you but don't think anything is little when it comes to having a reaction. The doctor said that they had never had anyone have a reaction to this drug. I started with my ears itching then hives around them then wheezing started then the bloody eyes. I'm counting my blessings and I'm so greatful for my husband and my doctor and only being a few feet away from the hospital. I was very lucky!!!!!!

I just started 2 1/2 weeks ago and I still feel stiffness and pain 4/10 in both wrists and right ankle. I feel blue and very scared that this treatment may not work for me, I have tried several other treatments. I've been dealing with RA since I was 17, now I'm 35 so if there's anybody that has tried this treatment that has felt the same way please let me know. Thank you in advance.

I was told that Orencia takes at least 6 weeks for it to &quot;kick in&quot;.  I used to be on Remicade but my liver enzymes (ACT &amp; ALT) both began to spike.  I was taken off Remicade as well as all pain meds and alcohol for 3 months....it was a very difficult time for me.  I like that the Orencia infusions only take 30 minutes.  I'm feeling even better than when I was on the Remicade.  My liver enzymes have been staying normal.  I'm praying that I can continue to stay on Orencia for a long time to come!

I had used Humira for 6 months but I was constantly sick on it (colds/flus). Never experienced any increase in illnesses on Orencia, not to mention it restored my mobility and gave me back my life. Unfortunately, upon my 15th administration of Orencia I had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock!) and discontinued use. It has been hell without it and I'm scared to try anything else now but am considering Simponi because I don't want to live like this.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	65-74	9/29/2011 5:29:20 PM	I was diagnosed with RA at 21. Have been on Orencia for 3 years. It seemed to help initially, but it apparently does not stop further deteriation as advertised.  I have a sore that has not healed in 3 years.  Also had a rheumatoid nodule removed a year ago that still hasn't healed.  I'm unable to fight infection as Orencia has lowered immune system. I'm presently on heavy duty antibiotics.  Also have high blood pressure for first time ever. For the last year or so, treatments have not curbed pain. However, it's hard to know if RA would be worse without Orencia.  My feet are way worse now than when I started treatment.  Have taken prednisone for many years and also methotrexate. Now prescription pain pills are my only relief.  What to do now? God only knows!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Tina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/24/2011 11:40:10 AM	I have had arthritis since I was 5 and I'm now 38. Have been on more drugs than I can remember taking. I took Orencia for 6 months. And developed cold/ flu like symt. After seeing my family dr and rhem. they treated me for broncthis. After 4 months of none stop coughing and be sick I went to the hospital. Was admitted and was diganosed with COPD and Asthma. And before the infusion I was healthly other than my RA. So please be careful if you plan on taking this medicine. If anyone else has the same smythoms I would like to know. Thanks
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Dana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	8/8/2011 11:13:24 PM	I have had RA for ten years. Was on Enbrel for about 7 years and did well but had to switch to Orencia due to severe reactions. The Orencia was much slower to work than the Enbrel- and during the first year or so I developed nodules but now they're getting much better. I do seem to have more of a problem with infections including a methotrexate mouth ulcer that became abcessed, more tooth cavities and an infected IV site. But the Orencia is finally working as well as the Enbrel (humira and remicade did not work at all for me).

I think I will stop the treatments.  My RA is not serious except for knee pain.  Depemedrol shot once every 4 months works for me.  think I will continue this treatment until it does not work.  Have tried all the pill meds and nothing seems to work really well.

However, I now have lung complications and am currently checking that Orenciia is not contributing to this - I will be very upset if it is. My pain levels, ability to move freely and my energy levels have all improved during the time I have been having infustions

It took six weeks to fully start the medicine to begin with. I have taked several different medicines over the years and learned that one will not continue forever. Prior to Orencia, Humira was the thing that lasted for three years, then quit working. I take 15mg Methotrexate per week. No special diet or other meds and have tried several over the years. I do not live in an ideal climet to soften the arthritis peoblems. Michigan is not ideal as some warm, drier location. The type of RA is called Severe Acute Active Rheumatoid Arthritis and its all over. I got use to constant pain so the pain scale does not count any more. But doing well most of the time.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Grateful, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male		12/21/2010 3:27:08 AM	I am 76 and I have been on Orencia for 18 months.  When I started Orencia I could not dress myself or get out of bed un-assisted.  I have been through all the other drugs including Mexotrexate and Embrel. Only Prednisone gave me relief, but the terrible side effects.  After starting Orencia, I have no need for Prednisone.  I am back to hiking at least a couple of miles per day.  My Rhumethoid nodules have just about disappeared.  God Bless Orencia. For me it has been wonderful.   
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Chris, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	12/6/2010 4:01:40 PM	It has taken 3 months but finally I think it's working. No flare ups recently and the side affects are decreasing too. I have had a lot of colds but it is worth it considering the pain relief. I was wondering if anyone else has cold symptoms a the time. Will it pass?

I feel a little better but the side effects are beginning to take it's toll.  Hair loss  (taking folic acid for this), fatigue (try to sleep as much as possible), I've gained weight and can't lose even if I eat salads all the time. The worst side effect is the sinus headaches!!! They have turned into 2 day migraines that I've had to go to the ER for.  I am happy I can move but what good is it if I'm sick with debilitating migraines.

Five yrs ago had breast cancer (L breast removed &amp; several lymph nodes) So far she's a 5 year survivor.  She's been on several RA meds and for 6 months has had Orencia infusions.  She feels her movement has improved a little.  She's now in the hospitl with breathing &amp; lung problems.  She had a quart &amp; 1/2 of bloody liquid from her right lung.  She's supposed to get the results of that tonight.  She has a blood clot on her right knee and is being treated with a blood thinner (Lovinox).  Has had a port inserted for easy access for blood work &amp; IVS.  Fluid flows in but cannot be pulled out.  ie for blood work. ?? I ask that anyone who considers these meds to REALLY consider all the side effects.  She thought that they would help with her RA pain which, did a little.  But she's now thinking they were not worth the risk of these serious side effects.  PLEASE consider them carefully. My sister is 70 years old and has always been healthy.

On Humira for 4 years and it also worked well then all of a sudden quit working. I do notice some discomfort and some constant pain of which is well tolerated. On Methotrexate for over 15 years taking along with other meds and now with Orencia. At 72 in August I think I am well adjusted to Orencia.  Was at first afraid to take it. If Medicare and my insurance should take Orencia away I have not idea of what to do yet. Over the last two months my doctor and his crew that I have seen for 20 years got let go at Borgess Hospital, bad deal for all of us seeing this doctor.

First a tooth abstract, then an infection in my right foot.  The One joint that is better is my left wrist!! I am undergoing foot surgery at this time and am taking time off of Orencia.  Do not know what to think??

Remicade worked, then stopped.  Started Orencia about 2 years ago and it has been a miracle for me.  With it and pain meds I have my life back.  Before, it was a struggle to walk; couldn't hardly use my hands.  Now most people would think I am &quot;normal&quot;  Only I know about my pain.  I have my knees drained 2-3 times a year.Side effects;  aggravating headache; dry skin; Weight Gain (yes it bothers me, but I choose it over severe pain); fatigue; red dots some pimple-like on my face; ringing in ears. BP is very good!! But like I said, I have my life back with some restraints; but not constant, disabling pain. I am very blessed and hope you will be if you try Orencia.  Don't be afraid, it might work work you.

I have noticed a change in my symptons. My levels have all come down. I have even come off of prednisone. Which I am happy about. I still have a lot of swelling in my ankles and my knee hurts a lot. So I almost believe it is something more then RA. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	JoAnn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	55-64	6/1/2010 8:23:43 PM	I am on Orencia for 11 month now. First 9 month I felt much better, stiffness and pain were manageable. The only thing is: I was always thin and now I am 25 pd heavier. My RA Dr tells me that she did not see anyone gaining weight on this drug, but I do not believe. I met so many people who complain about same thing. And because I gained so much weight I developed high BP. I had to say good bye to 90/60 (for all 55 years) and now I am 165/100 for most of the time.  Plus, for the last 3 month I developed bad side effects: sore throat, thrush, severe sweating,swollen glands, dizziness, severe pains all over my body especially my legs, hands and feet. I am very unhappy about this treatment and will definitely ask my DR to switch me to something else. I was on Enbrel shots, they did not make me sick, but did not help at all. I was also on Prednisone + Meth. I was sick, but at least I did not gained any weight, in fact I lost. My Dr says that i have to choose if I want to feel better or worry about my weight. I think this is wrong, because having high BP from gaining weight is a killer for me, I have heart condition. So what good does it do to me if instead of RA only, I also get other health issues from it? The whole situation is very disappointing to me. Sorry, I wish to give you better news, but i believe we come here to get right information so I am honestly give you my personal opinion. All the best to all of you!

First 7 month I did feel better, no doubt although I gained a great amount of weight. I do not believe my Dr when she says that you don't gain weight from it. I eat very little, move same as always, no way I can gain this much in short period of time. But the last 3 month I am suffering with more pain especially the first 4-6 days after the treatment. The first 2 days I hardly can eat or move at all, I don't know if this worth to take anymore. I am totally disappointed in this drug and wouldn't use it again. For all above reasons. Thank you and feel better all!

But it DID cause weight gain - for ME. I gained a pound a month, every month that I was on it. Now that I'm off Orencia, I have lost five pounds in eight months. The doctors can explain it away any way they want. The drug causes weight gain FOR SOME PEOPLE. It did for me.

My blood pressure is always too high.  I have had a Sinus Infection for about 3 months that I cannot get rid of no matter what antibiotic I am given.  This medication has been a great disappointment to me.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	CathyJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	4/6/2010 5:58:44 PM	I've had two infusions of Orencia.  I dont feel better at all.  I feel somewhat worse in a different way.  I keep getting pains through my legs and hands.  After infusion I was very sick to my stomach.  And during the infusion I kept getting terrible pains all over my body.  So far I'm waiting for a positive reaction!  I have been on Enbrel, Humira, Remicade and large doses of Methotrexate which I can no longer take because of its adverse reaction
Rheumatoid Arthritis	ladybo7, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	35-44	4/6/2010 5:48:01 PM	Just started orencia month and half ago. I have had energy, and less pain. I tried Humira and it worked some at first, but the injections were painful. I was very fearful of the infusion cause I hate IV's but just last weekend, I walked a little over a mile with my family. I haven't been able to do that since I have diagnosed over a year ago. Life has been restored back to me. I will CONQUER this disease. I will not allow it to rule my life anymore.  Remission here I come. :-)
Rheumatoid Arthritis	LindaV, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/30/2010 3:41:18 PM	I am 55 years old, was Diagnosed with RA 2 years ago. Was on Methrotixate (sp?) for 5 month, did not work for me at all; instead was making me so ill, I couldn't eat and got bad case of anemia and also lost my hair. Than I went on Ebrel shots and tried them for 4 month, but did not get any relieve. I am on Prednisone for 2 years, on low doses at this point.After starting Orencia I felt good after about 4th treatment. Even though I have to travel once a month to NYC, I don't mind to do it because it working for me! Finally I can walk better, have less pain, have more strength.I was very worry about gaining weight. My wonderful Rheumy explained to me that Orencia doesn't make people gaining weight. It's our overall tiredness and pain prevents from moving and being more active. In some people pain causing depression and depression well known for causing overeating. I am not a Dr by any means, but I think she is right. I did not gained any weight even though i am on high doses of Orencia plus Prednisone.  Maybe cutting calories and become as active as we can may help with weight gain? I wish to have the answer. But this is my experience with Orenica IV infusions.Best of luck to all of you as well!

For the most part my RA pain and fatique have disappeared.Now, today, advised by my infusion center, that Noridian is suspending medicare coverage for the drug, while they review it.Don't know what that is about, but nothing else has worked very well for me.

Started Orencia 1 mo ago and will receive my 3rd dose in a week. I have had a great change in my symptoms, back at work, no side effects accept headache. I have gained 8 pounds, not since Orencia but also on high doses of Prednisone for 3 months. I have a moon face but I am encouraged by the results of Orencia. I hope to be weaned from my Prednisone and will not have the severs flare up I have experienced.  I feel these treatments are so individual. I thank God I can get out of bed each day! Time will tel, and hopefully i will continue this drug with minimal side effect. Thought I would never be able to function again.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	35-44	2/20/2010 9:42:19 AM	I have lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and started Orencia when it first came out. By the second infusion my pain was gone, my energy returned and the damage stopped getting worse.  The medicine may be more effective for people like me who have both RA and SLE.  I haven't had any infections and don't get sick.  I have gained some weight (from size 2 to size 4).  I am trying to get it to level off since I can work out now.  People just starting it should watch their diet and start a workout program as soon as their symptoms improve!  My only complaint is that it requires an IV.  I am a business executive and it is hard to carve out the time every month.

I had been on it for two years and gained twenty pounds - had ALWAYS been thin. The good news is I haven't gained ANY more weight since I stopped Orencia. The bad news is I only lost a few pounds so far in five months on another RA med.

The first few months I did start losing my hair but it has stopped.  I did gain a few pounds but I am starting to lose it now. I get headaches with each treatment so I just come home and rest for the rest of the day.  I can work 40 hrs a week now instead of 25-30, I can do so much more with kids and can plan more activities throughout the day.  I hardly ever swell anymore and I haven't had to take presnisone for 11 months.  I think that the side effects are worth me being able to spend more time living a normal life. I have had RA for 10 years.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Good2Go, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	11/16/2009 3:21:10 PM	I was diagnosed w/ RA in Feb. '09.  Have been on two 5 mg. of Prednisone since (now mid-Nov.).  I was reluctant to try Orencia IV due to reading webmd and seeing how many women have complained of hair loss and weight gain from it.  I have had 2 Orencia infusions and have been losing hair right about the time I had the first one.  My dr. thinks it's caused from what my body is experiencing at this time (incl. Prednisone).  Spoke w/ Bristol-Myers rep. and they report that they did not find hair loss a problem in their preliminary studies. They took a report from me for documentation. Will probably have to change RA med. Has Prednisone cause anyone hair to fall out??

I have used Humira for 5 years and it worked wonderfully until it wore off. I tried Enbrel and it did not do a thing. I also take metotraxate, mobic, and cymbalta.  
Rheumatoid Arthritis	saranac3, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	9/22/2009 4:50:39 PM	I am 55 and have had RA since the age of 5. I have been on most of the drug treatments there are for it. Prednisone is the most consistantly helpful but it has nasty side effects long term. Enbrel worked very well for nearly ten years before wearing off as all RA drugs seem to do. Humira did nothing but it was the first time I experienced the facial rash. I thought it was a lop-sided cold sore as it was near my mouth at first. I switched to Orencia in March 2009. Ten treatments later, I am now having a severe flare, a facial rash by mouth, cheeks, and eyes (including top eyelid), more frequent night urination, ringing in my ears, and extreme fatigue right after treatment. It is a very expensive treatment with no improvement so far, actually worse...may quit soon but not sure what there is left to try. Is anyone trying to perfect prednisone (it's side effects) or is all the research going toward the genetically engineered, high tech stuff?

My quality of life went from a very active person to one that could barely walk, dress myself, or do many of the everyday things that a normal healthy female adult takes for granted.  I have been through a lot of the meds out there.  Asprin, prednisone, methotrexate, embrel, and a handful of others to name a few.  I was almost at the end of the line for medications when my rheumatologist suggested I try Orencia.  I can vouch that it did take about 6 mos. to kick in, but the results are very positive.  My side effects are a bit of high blood pressure, cold sores that come and go, and a nodule that I have just noticed.  But overall, my quality of life has improved 80% compared to what RA could potentially do to me.  My X-rays have shown that my joints have not been affected since taking the drug for over two years.  Give this a try if you are out of options and hang in there because it does take time.

Wondering if this happened to anyone else?
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Carole, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	8/27/2009 3:40:26 PM	I consistently wore a size 4 and blasted through wearing a size 6.  Now I wear an 8 or 10 or 12.  I gained approximately 35 pounds since April 2009 which is when I began Orencia.  I do not have any other side effects.  I don't know when the gaining of weight will end so I may stop taking this drug.  I am miserable because of the weight gain.

Still have some pain, but no swelling. No side effects. I do experience fatigue and depression but that could be from having the R.A. Was hoping that the Orencia would help more with the pain.My medicare insurance does pay for this.I am running out of options as the med insurance will only pay for IV infusions and not the shots like Embrel or Humira. I tried Remicade and it was wonderful! I felt human again and was able to do most everything but like so many others I became allergic to it.  I hope this review helps someone. All the Best!

I've tried it all, and been on Prednisone for over 6 yrs., with a 40+ weight gain.  Became a grandmother for the first time this past Oct. and wanted so much to hold my granddaughter with no pain.  Orencia is wonderful! My hands feel the best the have felt in many years after 4 months of treatment.  My feet still a problem. I have dropped my Prednisone down to 1mg, and not even every day.  My weight is dropping finally! My hair loss I blame on Methotrexate, for I still take this also. My hot flashes I blame to Menopause! My only side effect I have, and I'm not sure it is the drug is severe heart burn.

THE ONLY NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECT I EXPERIENCED WAS WEIGHT GAIN. NO HAIR LOSS. NO DEPRESSION. NO OTHER NEGATIVE EFFECT AT ALL. Many good effects, but I couldn't stand the never ending weight gain, so I switched off and am hoping to lose the weight.

I have gained 35 pounds and feel am out of my mind!  Nothing fits and I now feel horrible because of my weight!  I am so tired of trade offs and the expense of all of it.  I just want to get off of everything.  I have hired a personal trainer but will I be shoveling $$ against the tide because of Orencia??  I do feel more energetic; my hands feel swollen but useful; my feet hurt; RA MD thinks we are on the right path.  Unbelievable...I was not aware weight gain could occur on Orencia.  The drug is expensive; new clothing every few months, ai yi yi; a personal trainer $$$$.  I am now depressed!!  
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Linda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	45-54	8/1/2009 6:16:42 PM	I was on Meth for 6 month; I felt very sick all the time and very tired. Started to loose my hair, nausea prevented me from enjoying my days at all. Than I was switched to Enbrel shots, I had no side effects at all, but my Ra told me that if it did not work for 3 month most likely it will not work for me and suggested Orencia Infusions. This wasn't a good experience at all: nausea, hair lose, weight gained and very rapidly. After each treatment I was in bed for at least 3 days with flue like symptoms, nausea, dizziness, headache every single day. I wasn't as tired as I was on Meth, but other side effects made me very unhappy. I always been skinny, so all this weight gained made me very unhappy. I been on  Orencia for 8 month. Pain wise I am absolutely the same, I did not notice any help in that department, but for me personally side effects are not worth to go on with this medicine. I read other rates and I am happy to read that some people get good results with it, but I have to stop and try Enbrel+Prednisone again. I don't believe that gaining weight is good for anybody, it can cause other problems especially if you have heart condition like I do.Best of luck to everybody on Orencia, hope it will work wonders for you!

I have been slender all my life, yet I have gained 1 to 2 pounds per month (for 22 months) since I started Orencia. New clothes every few months are not easy to afford! I knew I wasn't overeating, but I didn't understand it because weight gain was never listed as a side effect for Orencia. I told my doctor that I couldn't take the weight gain anymore. So, I am getting ready to switch to a self injectable drug -- probably Humira.

Hair thinning and hair loss, hot all the time, break out into sweat, and I have on and off tingling/prickly sensation all over my body.

I have been taking Prednisone, then Plaquenil was added and finally Methotrexate and Folic Acid. I continued to have joint pain, inflamation and fatigue. My doctor suggested Enbrel last spring. I was on it for 5 months. It did not help. I started the Orencia in November of 2008, it tooks about 5 months for it to finally start working but for the last two months I have had little pain and don't need to sleep as many hours.I am taking little or no vicodin for the pain.  I get a headache for several days after the treatment but that is the only side effect I have noticed and the headache is manageable with Tylenol or Vicodin, if it is a really nasty one. I see my rheumatologist at the end of this month and he plans to take me off the prednisone if I am doing well, which I expect he will agree I am. I would recommend anyone who has RA that has not responded to other treatments give Orencia a try if their doctor recommends it. It takes 4-6 months to really start making a difference but it does help!

I can make plans for social events usually without a problem.  I have more energy, less fatigue, and seem to have more desire to do things. (because I feel better)  Generally, about a week before my treatment is due I can feel its effectiveness decreasing, though not to the point of where I was pre-treatment.  Then, for a couple of days after treatment I feel more fatigue and achy.  That gradually subsides and I have 2-3 good weeks where I can visit my friends, go to the store, and feel pretty productive.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Paula, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	6/10/2009 3:07:36 PM	I have had RA for 5 years now.  Embrel was a joke, Remicade was heaven (has to stop because of tingling in feet), and Orencia is OK.  I am much more tired, still swell somewhat.  Since I have been on Orencia I have had a sinus infection every month, a rash on my face, bruise at a touch, and am getting little, red dots on my face.  I see the Doctor on MOnday and am going to demand Remicade back.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	SKC, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	5/24/2009 4:40:30 AM	I am 56 years old. Was diagnosed with RA in '93, Crohn's Disease in '91, MS in '89. I have taken Methotrexate since '93. I tried Remicade but stopped because my BP would bottom out each time.  Also tried Humira but stopped after 1st treatment due to an alergic reaction-my arms felt like they were on fire or filled with hot lead, and then it began to spread to my legs and spine.  I just took my 8th Orencia treatment and the only improvement I see is that I am sleeping more than 2 hours before the pain wakes me.  I don't feel as fatigued, but the pain is still horrendous.  I have gained 15 lbs., have a recurring itching rash all over my face, and a recurring yeast infection in the folds of my skin.  I always have a nagging cough and a bitter aftertaste for about a week after the treatments.  I haven't been able to find anything to control the bad breath or heartburn. I promised my Dr. I would stick it out for 6-8 treatments, which I have done.  I don't think the price is justified, nor the claims the drug makes.  I wonder if it is just another selling hype by the drug company. I wish the best of luck to anyone who tries Orencia or any of the other drugs I mentioned.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  I do believe that Methotrexate has been the most help to me, but alas, it seems to have lost it's strength. Thus the reason for trying others.  May God help us all to find a relief from this nightmare, and in the meantime, may he help the Dr's and the drug companies who continue to help us conquer the diseases that seek to destroy our lives.  So try what you must, and GOOD LUCK!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	joyful-journey, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/23/2009 9:51:31 AM	I have been on Orencia for 2 years.  It  has taken over 10 years to find a medication that works for me.  If it is on the market, I have tried it.  I also take Clinoril and Plaquinil, along with Vicodin when the pain is extreme. It took 4 to 6 months to work but now I am able to work a full day without naps, I have been able to start going up and down stairs, a previous impossibility without taking forever.  I can walk long distances and don't have to park in the h/c spot or not go out at all.  I have been able to join a gym and start swimming and have lost 64 pounds.  I was very discouraged at first because it didn't seem to want to work, but I stuck it out and am glad I did.  It does start to wear off the last week and I find the chronic pain (which I am able to deal with since it is still better than it was)gets a little bit worse.  I have, however, weighed the unsuccessful treatments of 10 years and the associated pain and am quite happy.  Since there is no cure for R/A, I am willing to accept the pain since I can once again move and do the things I enjoy with less pain and effort. It still becomes a balancing act.  If I do too much one day, I know I will not be able to do much the next.  That is all part of the disease that I have learned to deal with.

I am off Orencia now and trying to lose the weight.  Has anyone experienced either of the above? Thank you

Been on Orencia since August 2009--doing much better, no cane now and able to work full day.  But, I do have to watch festering for minor scratches and my weight is up 30 lbs--don't know if it is connected.  All the drugs I have ever taken have side effects that must be managed...but I am able to dress, work and most importantely hug my children and stand to be touched by them.The infusions are an hour away--only 30 minutes long (Remicade were 3.5 hours) I make a day of it and do errands in that area. I feel it is better than taking up 17 tablets a day or 2 to 3 self injections per week.Has anyone else gained much weight on Orencia?  How have you managed it?

I do not believe this drug lives up to patient expectabtiions and will probably discontinue it after this next dose if I feel no better.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	4/16/2009 7:12:22 AM	I was on Remacaid and had to stop because of side effects (flu like lasting 48 hours after infusion)  Started Orencia per Dr's recommendation and at first it didn't work, got worse had to go on prednisone. Dr asked me to hang in there for six months.  This month is number 5 and it has kicked in!  I am not in as much pain and I am quite pleased.  I also take methotrexate.

This was my last hope.  I was on it for 6 months and feel worse than ever.  I feel that even my pain meds stopped working.  I'm going back to Humira where at least it took the edge off my pain.

Previously I have been on Humira, but my doctor thought perhaps Orencia might work better. I have all the common side effects, but in addition have gained about 15 lbs. since starting the Orencia program. Are there any others out ther who have experienced weight gain with this drug?

A little nausea, fatigue and mouth sores, but that is just part of the Methetrexate injection 1x week.  Tried most everything else in the last 4 years...51 yofemale.  This is looking good and I am delighted.  I can turn over in my sleep.

So far it's helped.  I'm mobile and generally don't experience alot of joint pain.  I haven't noticed any negative side effects except for a mild sore throat the night of the day of my once-a-month infusion.  I also take methotraxate and Plaquenil.  
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Frosted Lady, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	2/16/2009 7:07:41 PM	I am a 66 year old female. I have been on various meds in the past several years. Last year, it was Methotraxate and Remicade for 6 months with no results. Then, it was changed to Arencia and the Methotraxate. I must drive an hour each way for the infusion. It has been nearly 3 months, but nothing has changed. In fact, pain is worse. After each infusion, my blood pressure sky-rockets, and I have a rash on my forearms that looks like a diaper rash. I have had a constant cough since I started with the Remicade, and it still has not ceased. They still claim I must stay on it for another 3 months to give it a real chance. I am very tired all the time it seems.

I am very lethargic and want to sleep forever after a treatment. I also have a perpetual intensive cough. Going to see pulmonologist soon to see if related.

I can finally close my hands,get up&amp;down from a chair and dress myself. I get a little headache and funny taste in my mouth, but I can walk and walk and lift my grand kids without hurting. What a blessing

Has anyone ever had this problem when switching these medications.I need some info before I decideto try this medication.

It is given to me once a month.  When I started being treated I never associated a rash or dryness of my skin or scalp.  I went to a dermatologist because I started to get a red line around my hair line and the dermatologist told me it was stress.  She gave me a cream and I used it.  It would clear the redness but only until I received another treatment of Orencia.  Now for the past few months I have been getting worse with a terrible rash on my face and neck.  I coutinued using the cream from the dermatologist but seem to believe it is the Orencia that I am getting this reaction from.  It itches and I try to take Benadryl to stop the itch.  I can't sleep because of this.  I am also loosing my hair.  Thank you for listening.

Humira quit working switched to Orencia in July 08 so far working reasonably well. Infusion is simple and no side effects. Still get mild pains and swelling. On Methotrexate injection also combination I feel is super so far.

I feel very good and have no side effects that I am aware of.  I have high energy and a small amount of pain.  It seems in the fall I have pain but then it passes.  I take this inconjuction with Methotresxate and folic acid...no sores in my mouth, no nausea, just tired the day of the infusion.

( after being on Humira and that didn't help too much)I noticed that after my fourth infusion my body aching has subsided but joints still hurt a lot. I am not giving up on this drug! Doc. says it takes time to work well, but does continually. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	11/10/2008 7:32:17 PM	I experience extreme nausea-so after the 1st treatment they give me an anti nausea shot and I no longer have that problem- also if I spend the day doing very little I have found less fatigue.  I am one who is allergic to 98% of RA Meds-so still have a few flares, but just had 6th treatment and am doing pretty good- but I can tell when it is wearing off- and look forward to the treatment.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	11/10/2008 6:46:44 PM	I could not take Humira because I had, and still have Histoplasmosis present but dormant in my lungs.Although Orencia is not contraindicated with Orencia use, I am taking an antifungal to be on the safe side. So happy to be on Orencia. I have had 4 treatments. Only side effect is a strange taste in my mouth for the first 4 or more days. Last treatment a soreness of my tounge . Always a headache on and off for week or so. Frequent urination at night. Very effactive in treating my RA. High energy level and little severe stiffness and joint pain. Best of all no more feeling like I have the flu all the time. Life has promise again.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/18/2008 3:47:45 PM	I am 44 year old female and have had RA since I was 29.  Been through most all of the meds - Enbryl worked with the Arava until I developed a possible side effect and thus doc switched to Orencia.  It took 1 month before it started to help and then works great until time for next infusion.  I still take with Arava.  I had pain down front of my legs almost nightly until started this and it went away.  Also, the manufacturer has a great assistance program - one for those without ins. and also to cover co-pays if you are covered.  It is a lifesaver as otherwise I could not afford it.

I have some new tendonitis but overall better movement.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Jim, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	5/11/2008 2:05:35 PM	 I was diagnosed with RA at the age of 31. I've been on remicade,enbrel,humira,&amp; all the pills. This Orencia so far has kept me from having those nightmare flare ups that used to make me contemplate having my extremities simply amputated. That's how bad it got when the other meds stopped working. I was at the end of my rope. No one really understands the severe pain I was having. Orencia, so far has brought me back to the living, but so did all the other meds for periods of time. I pray that this Orencia will continue to stay effective. Its great to walk among the living again!!!!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/17/2008 9:28:52 AM	I have been on the drug for 6 months now and I feel great!!!  My hands hardly hurt at all anymore (I'm typing better than I ever have).  No having to stick myself with a needle - I let my doctors office do that.  It did take about 2 months to start feeling the improvements but it was worth it.  My energy level is way up too.

I have used just about every drug available. I have been on Orencia for about 9 months. I take it in addition to Arava and Mobic. I am very happy with the results. I have not had a flare for several months!

Doctor says I should keep trying for another 3 months...  Anyone else have the same reactions?I've had R/A for 22 years....

I also take Mobic and methotraxate injections once a week (easier than pills/less side effects). It has helped me get back to my hobbies and a more normal life.

Using the in home care infusion program and they don't show up, or call.  The medicine is having so far about a 68% success rate with all joints but wrists and elbows.  Wouldn't advise starting the program until they are able to accomodate the patients they currently have.

So Im trying to find help so I can keep getting my infusions. It is a wonderful drug because I don't hurt nomore. I hope it helps others. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	sstewart, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	10/16/2007 1:26:03 PM	I've been on Orencia for three months now (four infusions). My doctor feels I should give it six months to see whether it is going to help, but my RA symptoms are getting increasinly worse. I'm trying to find out whether anyone else has actually experienced a worsening of symptoms due to Orencia, to help me decide whether to give this more time.
