Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/9/2012 10:07:54 PM	I was having a lot of problems with oily skin and breakouts. I use the basic neutrogena liquid or bar cleanser first to remove make up, then I use the cleanser once a day at night.  I make sure to massage the cleanser into the skin and let it sit there for at least 20 seconds.  I follow up with a toner and either lotion and spf, or aczone at night.  So far my skin has been significantly less oily with close to no breakouts.  My skin feels very soft and clean, and is never dried out excessively as I found with all the benzoyl peroxide based cleansers.  This is a sulfur based cleanser with slight exfoliation properties.  I am still having a problem with some blackheads/large pores and hoping my doctor can help me again at the next follow up appointment.  Other than that, it has worked wonders!  I will definitely keep using the product. 
Acne Rosacea	Bmoreguy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/22/2011 4:40:25 AM	I have a mild case of rosacea inherited through my family. My &quot;raccoon&quot; eyes are gone, my skin is softer . I finally decided to put this drug to test in the shower. Why slave over a sink?

Acne Rosacea	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	7/9/2011 12:14:07 AM	I have used this medication for my rosacea for several years.  It works well as directed.  My only gripe is the cost (without insurance).  
Acne Rosacea	paige, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/8/2011 1:20:16 PM	I used this Rx for several years.  For the most part it controlled my acne rosachea.  My dermatologist recently took me off of it because she said my skin may be getting immune to it.  There were occasions when I had to supplment with an oral antibiotic, but I think Prascion really helped.  
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	11/16/2010 1:34:08 PM	I've only been using this product for about one week and its already cleared stubborn breakouts that have been around for months! It actually makes my skin softer rather than dry like i thought it would saying as how before this product i suffered from dry skin. The only thing i don't like is the fact that you have to wash your face before you wash your face.
Acne	supagrl, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	2	Female	13-18	7/30/2010 7:58:52 AM	This product over-dried my skin, causing it to break out even more and leave red spots all over my face. I only used it on my skin for 10 seconds or less at a time and it still left my skin super dry.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/5/2010 2:17:54 PM	This product has been amazing. I used to have moderate acne, and now I hardly ever break out. When I do, my zits clear up within 2-3 days. However, there is a major side effect. It smells terrible and stains clothes. It stained my pajamas and sheets, so I stopped using it on my chest and arms, and only use it on my face. Also, my room smells really bad and it is impossible to get the smell out of my bed, pajamas and robe. I use Glade or Febreeze air freshener in my room and on my bed which helps. (note: it only stained and stunk up my pajamas, robe, bed and room, not my regular clothes.)

Acne	SweetFace, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	19-24	9/6/2009 10:44:12 AM	I have been using this medication for about a month now. At first i started to see my skin clear up but now its like my skin has got use to it, i'am starting to break out again and not sure why. I cleanse twice daily after cleansing my make-up off then apply differn gel before i go to bed, i also take doryx daily and skin vitamins. I'm trying to be patient and maybe my skin just takes a little longer to respond....
Acne	acnefellow, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	13-18	8/12/2009 4:04:37 PM	This is a great acne alternative to pills. Less convienient than the pills, but just as effective.
Acne	rjones, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	5/8/2009 10:18:36 AM	I have been on this medication for 3 weeks now and I have already noticed some good results.  I have moderate to severe acne and have not had any breakouts since I started using this.  I also noticed that my skin is brighter and the texture is improving.  I should also note that I am African American.  The smell is not the best but tolerable and I have sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions.  I use it twice a day along with retin A micro gel at night.

Other	LoriBethrr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/11/2008 5:08:12 PM	I use this medication for very mild acne and some cysts on my chin.  It's great, the cysts have gone down (they were small to begin with) and I very rarely get a pimple.
