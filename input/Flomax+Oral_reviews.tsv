Enlarged Prostate	Tamsulosin, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male		8/28/2012 7:13:45 PM	This medication worked too well.  After 10 days I had urination problems, such as; feeling I had to urinate, then in seconds, I did. No pain, no dribbling, just a large stream, but too often. I will check with my Doctor if it continues.

Other	Gillygaloo, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2		55-64	8/8/2012 1:08:48 PM	My Urologist put me on generic of Flomax because I get frequent bladder infections.  Because, after much testing, and no other known reason for the chronic infections.  The hope was that the drug would help to widen the neck of the bladder so that I could have an easier time urinating.  And therefore not much stale urine left in the bladder would reduce the infections.  I have been taking this drug for about 10 weeks now.  I have had 2 more bladder infections since starting taking it!  Side effects: Although my Dr doesn't think it is from this drug, I experienced slight swelling in my ankles the first week.  That has almost completely disappeared now.  What is very troublesome (and painful) are severe and almost nightly leg cramps.  I would get them occasionally prior to taking this drug, but not as bad as they are now.  Also, I've had blurred vision, and, just very minimal dizziness occasionally.  I see my Urologist next week.  I will certainly discuss the leg cramps with her.

Flowmax had very positive effect on these symptoms, and I was pleased to find that it made my erections more frequent and stronger than usual. However, I was completely unable to have an orgasm or ejaculate, no matter how long I tried. Stopped taking it a week ago and still can't enjoy sex yet. I'm hoping function returns soon. My advice is approach this drug with extreme caution.

Enlarged Prostate	organic, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	55-64	4/16/2012 5:57:22 PM	I began to have difficulty urinating in early 2011, to the point of requiring a catheter.  My urologist prescribed Flomax and Avodart; after about six weeks, I could urinate without a catheter, but my side effects were similar to others on this forum.  About two months ago, I replaced Flomax with cranberry extract (about 1350 mg per day), and the Flomax side effects went away.  About a month ago, I replaced Avodart with a prostate support formula that includes saw palmetto and other nutrients.  During the last few weeks, nighttime urination has been a little more frequent, but the benefits of no drug side effects have been well worth it!

I took ONE 4mg tablet of Tamsulosin (Flomax), and within 15 minutes I had facial edema, itching, blocked sinuses, and difficulty breathing.  An obvious allergic reaction, and I knew to throw out this poison.  I could hardly breathe, and my wife made me use nasal spray to open my sinuses.  I started to get dizzy when getting up from bed, and later in the week, I got what appeared to be pneumonia.  All of this from one lousy dosage!  I can hardly believe there are positive ratings and positive comments for this drug....must be drug company shills.  Stay away from this stuff....it's NOT worth ANY of the side effects, much less all that I experienced.

Enlarged Prostate	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	3	Male	55-64	5/3/2011 9:06:29 AM	Worked almost immediately to limit night time urination. Then the effect tampered off in a few weeks.   Dr doubled dosage and the same the pattern repeated itself.    Now I take flomax with a combination of vesicare for overactive bladder.   Cystoscopy revealed that BPH was not the main culprit.   Had a benign tumor removed from bladder. Immediately after surgery frequent urination was every 15 minutes.  Now that bladder has healed, frequent urination has gone from every hour to once or twice a night.  Daytime urination is about every 30 minutes.   Vesicare cause dry mouth and some constipation.   Flomax causes dry ejaculations and reduced sex dry.  Tried to get off Flomax under drs direction but it still helps reducing night time urination.  I hope there are some other possibilities. I don't like the side effects and having to take medications all the time.  Glad I have a persistent Urologist.

I was nearly in retention and had noticeable improvement literally overnite. While I did not have any of the other side-effects others described, the sexual side-effects were unacceptable. Switched to Uroxatral which took a few days to a week to kick in, but without the sexual side-effects for me. Unfortunately, had to discontinue use after 5-6 months because of acute shortness of breath, which is not even in the literature. The key to this is Avodart, which shrinks the prostate. Once its size is reduced enough to release its strangle-hold on the bladder, I found I could discontinue the other drugs.But continue to take Selenium and Saw Palmetto. While surgical procedures continue to improve, I was not willing to run even a small 5-10% risk of permanent sexual disfunction.

I was initially perscribed Finasteride(Proscar) for my symptoms. Worked very good at first. Took away 90% of my symptoms. They gradually started coming back after about 3 months. Dr put me on a combined Tamsulosin(flomax) &amp; finasteride(proscar)treatment. Worked good as far as increaseing my urine stream. Noticed side affects from the first week, and they incresed as treatment went on. I've been taking both for 3 months and stopped taking the tamsulosin(flomax) 2 days ago. I was experiencing drowsiness at first but after a week that started going away but noticed increasing problem with insommia. Nose was alwys stuffy to varing degrees, decreased sex drive, itiching bowel sack, shortness of breath, stated feeling like my heart was becoming almost restrictive. 2 days off and stuffy nose, heart problem, shortness of breath all have gone away. I am going to see my doctor today about this problem but probably will not go back to the tamsulosin(flomax).

At first the change was dramatic, my stream was better, stronger. I could start and stop better. The last year however the symptons have been such that I now get up 5 to 6 times a night and it feels as if my bladder is never empty. With in the last year I have also started taking finisteride along with the flowmax with no improvement.I think its time for roto router.

I was put on this because of a kidney stone and after talking to the urologist am discontinuing it.  If I ever have prostate problems later in life, I am asking for something other than this pill!  I totally agree with all the commenters who have said the side effects are not worth the good effects of this drug!  AMEN!

It reduced night time trips to the john, but I got better results when I used it in combination with finisteride or Avodart.  All of these drugs have diminished semen and reduced sexual desire.  I'm considering surgical options now.

I had undergone 3 other in-patient surgical procedures prior with no such problem.  The Dr. ordered Flomax, and I was again able to urinate within 24 hours.I consulted with my urologist after relase from hospital, and discussed with him my experience in the hospital plus prior experiences of frequent nighttime trips to bathroom and dribbling after finishing. He ordered continuation of the flomax, and the nighttime trips reduced over time until now I sleep through the night without getting up to go.  The post-urination dribbling has also stopped.I have not noticed a perceptible change in my sexual experience, or any other unfortunate side effects.

Instead of straining to urinate I was flowing like a garden hose. However, I had a stuffy nose, headaches and tingling/numbing/itching of the right side of my face and all extremities.  Decided to discontinue use after three trips to the Doctor for the tingling/numbness in my face. 
Enlarged Prostate	Bob, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	65-74	12/10/2009 1:51:27 PM	Interesting that one review mentioned blurry vision in the right eye. This is my finding also. My opthomologist said a very small cataract was to blame but I intend to stop Flomax and see if vision clears up. Flomax works but not 100% in emptying bladder. Worst side effect is retro-ejaculation into the bladder. That's hard to deal with phychologically.

It began working within 24 hours of first pill.  It has been three weeks now and I have not had any of the side effects others report (vision impairment, prolonged erection, smaller or no semen during ejaculation, no sexual side effects).  So far, I am well pleased.  The only thing I have actually changed is to NOT drink a lot of fluids after around 7 p.m. ... thats been a plus because I am sleeping 6 to 8 hours (my normal) without getting up to use the bathroom.

At that time I was unable to void, after taking this drug voiding was not a problem.  However, I have noticed that every time I take it, my bowel movements have been changing to extremes: Constipation to Frequent Urgent bowel movements.  My Urologist says that Flomax has not been noted to cause these changes.  But it seems funny that my bowel movement problems show up only after taking a Flomax capsule.  I have stopped the drug and increased my &quot;Saw Palmetto&quot;.

I was going up 2 or 3 times a night. The Flomax wasn't consistent. Some nights good some I should have just stayed up.  So Dr. put me on Avodart about 2 years ago. The avodart seemed to reduce the prostate size. and stopped my need to get up at night. But I need both. I have found that taking 1 flomax(M,W,F) and 1 avodart(T,T,S) works best. I have found that by altenating each, every other day, my PSA stays in the normal limits and my trips to the bathroom are during the day. Seldom at night.

My md started me on a combination of Avodart (30 days) and Flomax. I was unsure as to whether the Avodart had worked initially and was worried that it WASN'T working. But my prostate size is reduced and the flomax is definately aiding with my urination. I get up from time to time at night to pee. I try to watch my drinking habits at night to manage that. Sexually, I have had no effects. I had reduced ejaculate with the Avodart. With the flomax I have not noticed any reduction in that area and continue to have sex regularly. So, I am having good results with this drug.

Have you heard of this side effect. What can I do about this if the drug has caused a visual change that cannot be corrected?  I am not taking this anymore and hope maybe things will improve.. If not I guess I am stuck with loss of vision in my right eye.. Do you know what can be done about this. RM

I was prescribed Flomax and it worked the same day returning urinary function to normal.  That continued for the last 5 years until several weeks ago when the weak stream and frequency symptoms showed up.  Then yesterday, I went through 10 hours when I could not urinate.  I went to the local ER and waited 4 hours for them to apply a catheter.  They never did, but I did finally manage a weak urination which relieved some of the pressure.  Last night after a light dinner, I took 2 Flomax capsules (I normally take 1) and managed to get through the night with 3 trips to the toilet.  So, until I get medical treatment, I intend to continue to take 2 capsules after dinner. I hope that my problem can be alleviated for the short term.  But, are there any long term consequences from doubling the prescribed dosage?Hal from New Orleans

Side effects are my nose runs and at times is stuffy. Ejaculation is weak. I am supposed to take every day but I went to every other day and that cured the ejaculation problem and I still have decent stream. Runny nose and small rashes are still a problem.

This drug helped so I didn't have to wait so long but frequency increased and now after 2 years I'm getting leakage too. I tried ditropan for the overactive bladder and it helped. I have discontinued that. I don't know how I will end up here but I find that coffee, alcohol (just one or two drinks) and spicy food affect frequency. I take hypertension drugs and cholesterol drugs too. I just don't want so many drugs. I may try to come off all urinary drugs and work on diet and quit coffee and alcohol. It's discouraging and doctors are just doing the trial and error anyway. Everyone is different which makes this a difficult problem. Good luck all.

Started at  rectum, then groin, genitals, underarms, back of ears, scalp. Stopped Flomax for 4 or 5 months and most, but not all, of reaction cleared up.  Went back on Flomax for 1 month and toward end of month reaction started to return.  Stopped it for good now.  Too bad - it worked well at the intended problem.

My urinary symptoms improved noticeably within 10 days of starting Flomax treatment.  However, I experienced sexual side effects about 18 days after beginning treatment, having no or almost no ejaculate.  I realized that I had stopped using Saw Palmetto a couple of days previously since I was on Flomax.  It occurred to me that the on-set of sexual side effects might be related to stopping use of saw palmetto so I went back on saw palmetto the next day. I saw an immediate improvement in ejaculate volume that night which was Valentines Day (volume of ejaculate appeared to be normal).  I have stayed on both Flomax and Saw Palmetto since and have been free of noticeable sexual side effects.I just wanted to pass on my experience although this is strictly anecdotal evidence without Doctor input.

I started to take Flomax earlier this month. My doctor told me to take for a minimum 7 days and I would feel some improvement. Early in taking the Flomax, I have experienced dry ejaculation. First time happening and a uncomfortable feeling. I stopped taking. A week later I started taking again after seeing the same doctor who prescribe it. In the last couple of days out of nowhere, I've become stuffy and then my heart starts to pound in my chest.It makes me feel as if I am having a heart attack. Prior to taking Flomax, I've not had these symptoms before and the amount of urinating has not decreased. I will stop taking the Flomax immediately. Personally, I am very uncomfortable with this medication. I rather take nothing and deal with the original problem.

Was prescribed this medication for Kidney Stones that would not pass and i could not have surgery to take out.  It worked to get the kidney stones out, however the side effects are maddening to say the least.  Dizziness, extreme fatique, blurred vision, back pain, nausea, vomiting, trouble sleeping, etc... works but the side effects weren't really worth the cure.

I have been taking it for 3 weeks.,  With the passing of 2 stones in the middle of that 3 weeks now I have more severe pain now on both sides. Will the flomax give me symptoms of fitigue and nausa? I am extremely tired and am having a hard time breathing.

At times I can pee a good stream. At night not good at all usually. Up at night as much. I thought this one was better than the rest. At first it was. I was on Hytrin (or terazosin) untilmy Heart rate plumited to 38 and I was Hospitalized. Outside of this issue the Hytrin was OK for a fare number of yrs. I think I will get off this drug too.

I subsequently discontinued taking Detrol LA due to lower abdominal (super pubic) discomfort. Upon advising my Urologist of the Detrol LA issues, I was advised to go back to &quot;Flomax&quot; for a 21-day trial. Same problem as before. I have discontinued all prescription medications, minerals and supplements for the time being.

Took Flomax initially (two months)--with almost immediate positive effect, then switched to Uroxatral for two months. It seemed as if the Flowmax was more effective, so I have been using it again for the past 8 months (1x0.4mg capsule/days). Noticable side effects include significant reduction in semen output and moderate sex drive reduction. Haven't experienced other side effects noted by others here except very rarely I experience runny nose and ear ringing.

Enlarged Prostate	Eric T., 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	65-74	10/16/2008 11:16:24 AM	Because of frequent painful urination my doctor precribed 4mg Flomax daily. I took for a month. Side effects were terrible so I stopped without telling the doctor. ED developed and I lost my sex life which is not tolerable. Constipation came in, 12 years old sinus returned, frequent wake up at night, exhausted easily. It relieved me of difficult urination and that's all the benifit I got. I tried Saw Plameto together with Cranberry extract caps instead. Works wonderful. All Flomax side effects gone. ED is no longer there and I got my sex life back. If the side effects of a drug outweighs its benifits, I consider the drug to be useless. Drug manufacturer should know better than that. My side effects are not isolated because you will find them in most other reviews.

Then my wife suggested not taking the medication for a few days to see if the symptoms were related to the Flomax.  On day one I still had some symptoms but they were mild and by day two they were almost non-existent. On day three thesymptoms had completely disappeared.  I have not taken any more Flomax.  I will deal with the slow start and flow of urine before ever going back to having those side effects again.  I return to the Doctor in 3 months and report what I have said here.

I was unable to urinate after laproscopic hernia repair and this helped me pass the urine. Today was my first orgasm since surgery and it freaked me out when i produced no ejaculate.  I thought they cut something during surgery they weren't supposed to.  It was early morning and left a message for the urologist, he assured me this was a possible side effect.  This is a disturbing side effect to me.  Where does the ejaculate go?  I feel like I am ejaculating but it never travels up through the penis.  Is it really happeneing and backing up into the bladder or is not happening at all?  Is there any danger to this?  I will have a bunch of additional questions for the doctor on my next visit.  Other than the ejaculate, I had minor dizziness the first couple days but I was also on pain killers and dealing with a catheter at the same time.
Enlarged Prostate	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	35-44	8/10/2008 5:54:43 PM	35 yrs old male, on Flomax for 3 days now.  The urge to go during the day has decreased a little, but orgasms and semen production are drastically affected.  Going to speak with my urologist about Avodart or Cardura as I want another child (which is impossible if I'm taking Flomax).  Though it's only been a few days, the benefits definitely are worth the side effects.  I'd rather continue using toilet paper to catch the 'dribble' than to completely lose my ability to climax (which is what Flomax is doing.)  Not to mention the mental affect of not satisying my wife the way I could just a week ago.  Dr. said the side effects only last a few days once you stop taking it, so I think I'm better off stopping now before my body becomes dependant upon it.

Went to my GP and he said it would not have been any benefit in passing the kidney stone as it does not cause anything to &quot;open up&quot;, but causes the muscles around the bladder to perform properly.
Enlarged Prostate	DoctorD, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/27/2008 1:05:19 PM	I have BPH as a side effect to another drug I take for an unrelated condition. If I don't take it at night, I simply can't urinate easily nor empty my bladder fully which leads to frequent urination. On flomax 5+ years and the increase in stream strength and effectiveness is excellent.  (Note, I am on Tenormin, a beta blocker) and flomax is the one drug that does NOT also cause my BP to lower as some of the recommended &quot;cheaper&quot; repacements such as terazosin and doxazosin.  When trying to reduce costs I tried switching to doxazosin (alpha blocker), but the ternormin, which is used to control tacacardia (yet another size effect from a medication I need), caused my BP to drop too low.  If the tenormin was eliminated the doxazosin didn't do a good enough job at controlling my tacacardia, so I stick with the ternormin (beta blocker) and flomax and it does the job flomax was intended to do.... treat BPH.

Enlarged Prostate	BobG, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	55-64	7/15/2008 8:25:01 PM	Drug worked great within 24 hours. Its effectivness slowly decreased over the months.  I get up at night to urinate about 2 times.  I noticed the need to get up at night worsens when drinking liquids in the evening.  Have experienced two instances of blood in the semen but that disappears in a couple of days.  I'm 61 years old.  Sex drive is still there but weakened a little. 
Enlarged Prostate	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	2	5	1	Male	55-64	7/13/2008 5:20:00 PM	I am 63 and tried Flomax for help in  re lieving discomfort of BPH.  I read several reviews and was aware of the side effects but I was not prepared for the attendant sinus problem I encountered.  To be fair, I have an ongoing sinus problem but hoped for the best as I began treatment with Flomax.  My problems started within 24 hours of initial dose.  I couldn't breath at all through my nose and as a result I couldn't sleep.  I noticed insomnia was a side effect as well, so, in my case, it's possible this condition was brought on by the stuffed sinuses.  I found some, but not total relief from the BPH problems.  Overall, I took Flomax for 2 weeks in hopes that either the urinary problems would improve appreciably, or the extreme sinus side effects that began with initial dosage would diminish, but neither happened.  In summation, I was very unhappy with my results from Flomax.

However he also has a kidney stone blocking a duct. After starting this medication, He was extremely tired, &amp; had excruciating headaches,neither of these problems that he ever had before.and something I haven't seen here...constipated .Which hasn't happened since the removal of his small intestinal tract years ago. He suffered from chronic diarrhea,until now. I believe, this is the worst thing to have given him..and he'll never take it again...

It interupted my sleep in the middlen of the night. It also negatively effected my sex life.....erection, libido, and duration and intensity of orgasm and ejaculation. Changed to Cardura. Sleep and sex is much better. It did take several weeks to get past unpleasant side effects of Cardura. Main side effect is tiredness in lower legs. But now I am fine with it.

The morning after I took the first pill, I was dizzy and had to sleep it off.  Other than that, it has worked very well.  I used to get up 3 or 4 times a night.  Now I might get up once a night.  My urine flow has also increased, and I can hold it longer.  My sexual desire has definitely decreased, a definite decrease in semen, along with a decrease in hardness.  I am also on an anti-biotic for an infected prostate.

But have no ejaculate with a fairly decent orgasm, now that is really weird. I read someone else's comment in here that said it would come back after getting off Flomax. I'm going to have to try that and see what happens because its just a little too much to handle right now. Except for that one thing, I'm pretty satisfied with results, although there were a few other typical side effects that were not too bothersome (runny nose, tiredness).

Plus if I leave off the caffiene after lunch and the artificial sweetners altogether I could stop treating the prostate condition. After stopping the Flomax and going to 2 mg of cardura (doxazosin) my libido and erection and climax is much improved. There is still less semen but I can live with that as I know it goes into the bladder.

Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	12/21/2007 8:20:50 PM	Now 53, I was diagnosed with chronic Prostatitis at age 26 and have suffered from recurring prostate infections requiring frequent treatment, especially during the &quot;cold season&quot; (when I would get a common cold it always resulted in Prostatitus) and resulted in treatment via  full spectrum antibiotics in the tetracycline family.  I have been on Flomax .4 since the FDA approved it and have never had another prostate infection since. It does reduce and sometime eliminate ejaculation and often reduces sexual drive and full erection but there is a pill for everything, Viagra does the trick for me when needed. My urologist instructed me to take it every other day but sometimes the lack of flow due to enlargement requires a daily dose. I will happily be on this the rest of my life, unless something better comes along. Hope this helps.

It made me urinate before the infection. This drug seems to be helping while the symtoms are fixed. The ejaculation deal is very odd for me. I'm only on the drug for one month.

Enlarged Prostate	Buz279, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	45-54	10/31/2007 3:32:34 PM	Started taking it on 17 Oct, todat is the 31st. Still getting up at night, but half as much. Erections are good as with orgasms, but ejaculation is gone. Not very happy with this side-effect! But hey, No wet spot to sleep in :} I had a vasectomy 12 yrs ago, so having more children are not an issue.
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	10/29/2007 7:45:13 PM	It works - for me the challenge has been remembering to take it daily. I notice that if I miss a dose, the affects are felt within 12 hours.

Orgasm is still atainable, however ejaculation is nill to none. Although at first it was psycologically troubling I have accepted this side effect. I am 58 and have had a vascecomy 15 yrs ago. I would not recommend this drug to a man who was still interested in having children!

Other	titum, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	10/13/2007 11:29:53 PM	I have a condition that I produce excess calcium and  have many kidney stones. I pass more than 2 per year, sometimes I've passed 2 at the same time or in a weeks time and just recently my Dr. prescribes Flomax and it has helped in passing the stones. I believe it helps because it relaxes the muscles. The important thing is that it helps.

And have become very disheartened with the fact that my ejaculations went from strong and substantial amounts to completely no ejaculations at all. I hope this is not permanent

My uroligist ordered this for me when I was suffering from kidney stone.  (even my pharmacist questioned this one) It did help open up the flow, and gave me some relief,  so altho it's a drug made for man it is also helpful to women.
