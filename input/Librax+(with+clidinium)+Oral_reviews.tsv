I have tried everything . My Dr. finally put me on Librax and I think that it is going to be the right thing for me. I have only been on it for two weeks and it has helped slow down everything. The only draw back is, that my insurance doesn't pay for it. and it is costly, even in generic.
Irritable Colon	donnah, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	7/4/2012 5:16:41 PM	I have been on Librax for 2-3 years now and it virtually does not help anymore.  I have been hospitalized for esophageal spasm, which it does seem to help, but not the IBS.  I decided to put myself on a gluten free diet after talking to a person that has gluten allergy.  The blood test they do does not detect it.  You have to do DNA testing that tracks if you inherited it. Of course medical ins. does not pay for it, but it is worth it.  I feel 100% better and the less fiber I eat the better.  I know this is not the general rule for IBS sufferers, but I am telling you their thinking is being re-evaulated.  It is harder to shop since gluten is in everything, but more and more you can find gluten free items.  I have been on it for about 2 weeks and already feel better.  I was out of choices since I had been on so many medications all my life and one jerk doctor told me it was all in my head since I am a woman.  Give it a try and see if it helps.

Headaches, nausea, increased anxiety, increased bouts of like symptoms. While on Librax constipation was the most obvious side effect. Would not do this again....It was prescribed by an ER doctor after seeing me for 15 mins with no lab work and a very very brief medical examination.

Irritable Colon	Something Ironic..., 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	6/11/2011 10:58:52 AM	Prescribed Librax (chlordiazepoxide/clidinium) when I reported to my general practitioner that I had had diarrhea for a solid month.  I'm not &quot;benzodiazepine-na&#239;ve&quot;, so I didn't experience the somnolence many people report.  But it also was completely ineffective.A surprise later was when I had a mysterious colon infection, at first believed to be an attack of diverticulitis.  I had a colonoscopy which revealed no diverticulosis at all, and only two tiny benign polyps.  My GI doctor suggested, as a general good health regimen, to begin taking Fibercon, which I purchase as the generic calcium polycarbophil for much cheaper.  While calcium polycarbophil is a bulk-forming laxative, it had the ironic opposite effect of halting my diarrhea.  I take two tablets with every meal, and have begun having wonderfully regular bowel movements without any of the pain, cramping, and other unpleasantness I had been experiencing.  If you want to try something over-the-counter, a product containing calcium polycarbophil might just work as well for you as it did for me, and at a considerable savings.

I had to research IBS on line after going to an Internal Med Doctor, Nephrologist, and then a Gastrologist to suggest IBS. (of course they all ruled out other possible problems). The depression caused by the pain in the gut, and the gas has stoped. It took about 3 days for the drug to do its job.

It seems to stop or at least reduce urinary pain and burning probably related to calcium oxalates or Interstitial Cysitis. I tracked this for several months and can definitely see the relationship. I wondered if anyone else experienced it.

I went to my family dr. the other day and was talking about my depression meds that I can't get myself stable. She told me that it's because of the Librax. It has valium in it which makes you tired and basically drowsy all the time. You can also get dependent on it. I forgot to take my Librax three days in a row and felt myself going through withdrawal symptoms, the shaking the nausea stomach pain. I am just in limbo for right now because the medication is working for my IBS but it is not working for my daily living. 
Irritable Colon	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		12/17/2010 8:24:05 AM	Before being prescribed this drug I was taking upwards of 20-30 tylnol#1 per day for pain.  I told my doctor he had 6 months to stop or  at least slow down the pain or I would end my life. He realized I was serious and said ok lets fix it.  I has taken the drug for only 2 days before my pain was almost gone for the first time in 5 years.  Its amazing, I forgot what living vs existing felt like.  For anyone who is suffering try this drug maybe it will work for you.  Ask your doctor and fight for your health. I have tried every IBS and almost every IBD drug on the market and none worked. If your existing not living try this please.

I'm going to try and week out one by one to determine if it's the Librax that is helping the most.

I suffer with nausea and anxiety on a daily basis. My doctor finally listened to me (I diagnosed myself) and prescribed generic for Librax and Promethazine. I usually need to take both to calm my stomach and anxiety, but it helps to take both. Only problem is they both cause drowsiness, so I have to be careful when driving. Good luck to those of you searching for answers!

I was in and out the hospital and test after test. I was put on Librax in the hospital and within 2 hours max I was telling the nurse whatever you gave me is a miracle pill. It has made my life start getting back to normal. I got really sick hoping the spasims would go away on its on and got even worse in health. My body was shutting down and nothing seemed to be working right. Its been almost a month now and there are bad days still I have had to spot eatting mexican and spicy stuff 100%. It makes me sick as a dog. But the side affect for me is im sleepy more. But im still recovering. Without this pill I was so sick dehydrated and malnurushed I couldn't even hardly walk without help. My husbands in  Iraq I have two kids under 7 I needed someone to help me and one doc did this pill means so much to me. Its helped me start getting my life back to normal again. I take it 4 times a day when Im late I start feeling bad. It sometimes does seem to work better then others on somedays. But atleast everyday is not a bad day anymore. To the ones that suffer with IBS I know what your going through and its horrable. I hope it works for you. keeps working for you. Or find something that does. Keep your head up. 
Other	Punkee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/3/2009 8:26:20 AM	I suffered for about 18 months with esophageal spasms, burping, and chest pain brought on by stress of my job. After several attempts at different medications, a combination of Nexium, Librax, and Benefiber have alleviated my symptoms. I started with two Librax a day and have decreased to one at night. I started using the benefiber because I read that it could help with high cholesterol...to my surprise, it really does help with the gastritis and other symptoms. I hope to stop taking any Librax. What is the best way to go off of it without side effects?

Stopping Librax can be very difficult.  I am experiencing shaking, crying spells and extreme lethargy after 5 days off Librax.  I went from four years at 2/day to three weeks at 1/day before stopping completely.  THIS WAS NOT SLOW ENOUGH!  Be careful.  This is horrible.  Ironically, I'm having no gastric symptoms.    
Irritable Colon	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/10/2009 11:28:14 AM	Librax has been a life saver for me. I started taking the drug about a year and a half ago and have seen a vast improvement. Than about 3 months ago I found out that the drug was only going to be made by 2 companies and the price was going to jump from 25 dollars to about 150 dollars. I was than put on Donnatal and after 2 months of taking that went back to my doctor to get put back on Librax. Was able to find it for half the price and can start enjoying life again. I would rather pay more for a med that will work than suffer!

I also live in Texas and it makes the excessive heat almost unbearable.  Every time I start feeling normal (not unbelievably fatigued) it is time for another dose. This, coupled with the Promethazine, and my hyperactive 4 year old nephew I have custody of, often make me feel like the walking dead. However, I do not know how I would survive without the relief from cramping and nausea.  Behold, it is the epitome of the &quot;catch 22&quot;.

For those who are 65+ and can not get the drug as Part D does not allow it, the generic which I take (chlorazipoxide-clinidium) can be purchased at a really good price from one of the chain retail stores with a pharmacy (not sure if I am allowed to mention the name).  Otherwise, the cost is way out of my league.  This drug is a life saver.

I use Librax to help ease the cramping that follows after having diarrhea caused by IBS until my system returns to normal again.  I strongly reccommend taking a strong probiotic to help you take back your life.  I started out using one that I got from a health food store that had 50 billion live cells in it.  That was a tremendous help to me, but was a bit pricey.  I tried Phillips Colon Health when it came out and found it to be almost as effective for a fraction of the price.  I still have an occassional flare up, which is why I need the Librax, but not nearly as many as I used to have.

Irritable Colon	ICUspecialist, 35-44 Female  (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/2/2008 7:37:50 AM	Just an FYI for those who suffer from one ot the 'adverse or side effect' of Librax.. Note this drug contains 5mg of Librium with each tablet.  Librium is an anti-anxiety med, similar to Valium, a benzodiazipine and is prescribed in 5-10mg doses to be taken 3-4x/day for mild to moderateanxiety (stress)Librium is also used to control the symptoms associated from alcohol withdrawl.Common side effects (not allergic reactions) are:-drowsiness, lethargy, confusion, dizziness-nausea, constipation-potential for abuseOne should be careful when first start taking this medication until one knows how the drug affects them and one shouldn't mix it with alcohol, as alcohol can increase the severity of any side effect.  (Again, side effects are not 'allergic reactions' (an allergic reaction has a systemic effect of one's body=rash, difficulty in breathing, et al)  If can't tolerate the side effects or they are bothersome, one should ask your doctor for a different medication to take, as there are other meds readily available, which will be as effective but without the side effect of drowsiness. (Bentyl and Levsin SL work well for abdominal cramping)Have a good day.Just a FYI as stated, for those wondering why the drug makes them feel: drowsy, tired, lagging, drugged, etc.

I would not recommend opening the pill, even though the pharmacist said it is o.k.

I also take probiotics &amp; slippery elm herbal pill which due to this it has turn my life around since I had suffer for years. I do admit that I still have the worriness because I feel that it can be true that I am no longer feeling as sick as I use to but that anxiety is wearing out slowly but surely.

Librax works well for the spastic colon, but not the other. I am still looking for something that will ease the terrible pain in my chest. Stress is one cause but it is not easily removed from my life. Has anyone else out there had esophageal spasms and found a medicine that will help with the pain?

Irritable Colon	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/24/2008 5:13:27 PM	This has been the most helpful medicine prescribed for my IBS. I take it as needed, up to 4 capsules per day, and have never had a problem with dependence or side effects, except for slight dry mouth and urinary retention (tolerable). Much more effective for me than Donnatal.

Irritable Colon	Vince, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	35-44	4/21/2008 10:13:50 PM	I went to my doctor in 2005 to complain of moderate pain in my upper right quadrant of my abdomen and moderate diarhea.  The ultrasound was negative, but the injection fraction test of my galbladder was somewhat positive.  I followed my GI specialists advice to have my galbladder removed.  Well, that seemed to worsten my symptoms.  He later diagnosed me with IBS and prescribed Clidinium with CDP.  I still suffer from frequent cramping, bloating, gas, and diarhea.

Irritable Colon	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	10/28/2007 8:10:28 PM	  This is the only medication I have found that actually eases my stomach cramping.  I have suffered from irritable bowel for 15 years and am very glad to have found this medicine.  The only downfall is drowsiness.
