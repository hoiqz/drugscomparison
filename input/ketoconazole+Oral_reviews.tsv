Chronic Fungal Infection of Skin	Polish Prince, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	3/29/2012 3:04:15 AM	I took this medication for a condition known as Tinea Versicolor. It causes splotches on the skin, caused by an abnormally high presence of yeast fungus. It's not contagious or bothersome, it just causes a splotchy/discored appearance.  It reoccurs every few years, most common among younger, active people. The best times to take it, I've discovered, are after a period of activity in which I've broken a sweat and have had something to eat. The discoloration after the medication is not from the medication, but from the abscence of the fungus in the treated area. These go away naturally in 4-6 weeks (or my first two weeks at the pool in which my tan begins to work). I've taken this medication along with a topical shampoo on three occasions and the Tinae Versicolor usually stays away for two years or so.  DO NOT DRINK ON THIS MEDICATION it can cause liver damage, try to at least have eaten or drink a full glass of milk with it.Hope this helps!
Chronic Fungal Infection of Skin	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	1/5/2012 3:22:19 PM	I had a funky looking fungal infection that covered most of my back. It had been spreading for months (I was waiting for insurance to come through b4 I could go to the doctor). Once I got to the doctor and took the ketoconazole it began to clear up within a couple of days and now, 2 weeks later, it seems to have disappeared completely. So I'd say it's pretty effective.Side Effects: The first two days I was seriously dizzy but that went away and I didn't notice any other side effects for the remainder of the 2 weeks. One note: my skin has been extra itchy in the last couple of weeks(especially my face) but I have ridiculously sensitive skin that is always itchy so I don't think it's related to the medication but it might be so I figured I should mention it.
Chronic Fungal Infection of Skin	gpn, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	35-44	11/2/2011 2:40:05 PM	My skin will break out once per year during the summer months.  The infection only appears on my upper body, chest and back. The spots are dark brown in color.  When I take the medication, I take it with food to avoid any stomach issues, no problem there.  The pills are small and easy to take.  I take it with right after eating breakfast in the morning.  Because I know for sure these pills wreaks havoc my the liver, I DRINK TONS OF water during the day. Next, and this one is tough, I DO NOT DRINK ANY ALCOHOL WHILE USING THIS DRUG FOR A MONTH, again to protect my liver as best I can.  Also, I don't sleep very well so normally I would take Tylenol PM, while using this drug, I DO NOT us T-PM.As far as side effects, I have two.  First, I get tired earlier now, like around 8 or 9 PM I'm ready for bed, rather than by 11 or Midnight. Second, I get really hot so I turn my AC down to about 75.
Chronic Fungal Infection of Skin	holl holl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	11/1/2011 5:49:20 PM	Have had undiagnosed infection for 15 years.  Finally, derm tells me it is fungal, gave me script for 2 pills.  Take once a week, 30 min after taking, cause body to sweat, and wash affected areas with anti-dandruff shampoo. Doc says may take 3-4 months to see results.  Will update after 3-4 month period with results

My Derm Doc wants me to take it another two weeks. It gave me a headache towards the end of treatment. I have been off for two weeks and i will start again. Im worried about staying on it too long. You have to have your liver monitored if on this too long. My tinea was misdiagnosed at first, so its going to be more stubborn to get rid of. im also using topical creams.

Candidiasis Yeast Infection that Spreads Throughout Body	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	5/3/2011 12:07:45 AM	I started this medication for a yeast infection. i was prescribed one a day for a week then two a day. Within 32 pills I broke out in a rash all over my body, itching horribly, fever, difficulty breathing.Stomach pains,and increased anxiety. Also trouble sleeping.Completly miserable. I stopped the medication. It took a week for the rash to be about 90% cleared up. My skin still feels very sensitive. I never will take this medication again. I would read the warnings, reactions, and precations. My doctor said to stop taking it for a few days then start again to see if i havesame results. I am not going to try this again and put my body into so much pain.

Yeast Infection of Vagina and Vulva	KC, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/25/2011 4:32:42 AM	I took 18 days of a 21-day course of ketoconazole.  It gave me severe liver damage (toxic hepatitis) followed by severe arthralgia in every joint in my body except spine/neck/head.If I'd taken it a few more days it probably would have killed me.  Instead, it just resulted in about 6 months of being bedridden, followed by 3 years of major debilitating pain.I was an otherwise healthy 37 year old woman taking no other meds, and I had no symptoms at all before beginning the hepatitis symptoms.I eventually (as I said, 3 plus years later) worked the stuff through my body, and I'm basically healthy now, 10 years later.  Although I cannot say for sure, I believe that the arthritis I now have in my hands is a secondary (and permanent) effect--livable, but much worse than it should be, and I'm the only one out of all my parents and grandparents who has it.Believe the big boxed warning.
Thrush	jumpy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	1/7/2011 9:56:19 AM	I have taken antibiotics and prednisone (oral and inhaled) for past year on a frequent basis.  I developed an awful taste in my mouth over the past few months.  After unsatisfying results with Nystatin and Diflucan, my dr gave me Nizoral.  It has not improved anything after 10-11 days of 200 mg bid.  I had noticed shortness of breath and heart racing in the am and pm.  I stopped the Nizoral and the symptoms stopped immediately.  It may be a good medicine but not for me.

I've been told it is tinea versicolor.  After years of different lotions and creams, this antifungal medicine does the trick!!!  I take 1x200mg dose for 5 days straight, and within 3-4 days my spots are gone.  The unfortunate thing is that it always comes back.

It seems as if this drug definitely affects your immune system.  I would recommend this drug  only if it is seriously helping your prostate cancer.

I felt the Doctor knew more than the insurance company and paid for it out of pocket. I am glad I did! They only cover diflucan at 1 pill every 2 weeks which was not working for me. This has and am I thankful. I had some tiredness and was a little queasy, but overall; I am doing better.

Thrush	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	25-34	6/16/2009 1:47:53 PM	Given a 5 day course to treat Thrush.  Having now taken all 5 doses, the thrush is considerably worse than when I started the treatment.  Little else to say, when I started treatment my tongue felt swollen and I had a burning sensation in the roof of my mouth.  Currently my mouth and tongue feel like they're covered in canker sores.  Speaking and eating are a real challenge.An oral pill is hard to take when your mouth is this sore so it only gets a 2 for ease of use.For what it's worth, my very experienced Doctor was surprised by this result, believing that this is a powerful and effective medicine.

Original episode about 6 years ago. Seeeminingly sucessfully treated then with Clotrimazole-Betamethasone &amp; Bactrim (Mupirocin)cream and oral Cephalexin. Drs since then (more than 8 seen including derm. &amp; aller.) kept saying it was Staph or Strep, but it would come back with vengence in a few weeks or month after treatment...especially if skin was broken (even through jeans). Got to a point I felt I might need a bubble :) . Have tried, at some point, Prednisone, Nystatin and Triamcin Acetonide, Altibax (retapamulin)ointment,Zeasorb AF (Miconazole Nitrate 2%),Amoxicillin and FLUCONAZOLE 1 tablet 150mg (WHICH ACTUALLY HELPED), and daily bating affected areas with Phisohex plus probably a few more that I don't recall or have current records on.

Also, fungal on toes.  This was caused from steriod injections for hip and back problems as well as oral steriods for bronchitis.  Steriods reduce your immune system making you suspetible to all kinds of fungal and airborne conditions.Have used this medication several times and have had excellent results.
