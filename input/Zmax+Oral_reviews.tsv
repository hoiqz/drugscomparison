That appears to be better.  But I have had diarrhea, vomitting, and mild dizziness.   I have lost my appetite.  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	2/12/2011 12:21:14 PM	I took the zmax one dose strawberry banana flavor. Taste was fine. About three hours later I experienced extreme nausia and diarrhea which lasted all through the night on and off. I also had a slight feverish headache which subsided. I am on day two now and most of these side effects are gone and my throat feels much better! This was at the cost of a miserable night but at least it seems to be working!

Acute Bacterial Infection of the Sinuses	SK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	1/6/2011 6:11:18 PM	Took the one day dose on a Monday and felt SEVERE abdominal pain for the first 3 - 4 hours with increased heart rate (At this point I vowed to never take this medication again), after this it was followed by watery stool. This was the end of any side-effects symptoms, they all ended after 5 hours. The following day (Tuesday) I felt MUCH better. Still a little groggy and tired as the medication is still in your system but my sinus pain decreased dramatically. The medication works VERY fast but was a miserable process for the first few hours. I have difficulty swallowing pills so this was the &quot;happy medium&quot; which was found.

About an hour later, I was experiencing loose stool.  I had that a couple of times at night. I did get mild stomach cramps, but nothing severe.  Had very dry mouth, but that could be due to not really being able to breathe in my nose.  Next day, still have loose stool, but no other symptons.
Pneumonia caused by Bacteria	dpp, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	35-44	12/1/2010 5:26:34 PM	I took the oral dose on an empty stomach as recommended. After 1 1/2 hrs I vomited voilently for more than an hour. I actually lost conciousness briefly during the vomiting. It has been 3 weeks now and although the pneumonia is much better I am having serious side effects from the medication. I have developed pesistant diarrea stomach bloating and cramping and blood in my stool. I would not recommend this med to anyone due to the harmful side effects!!

Acute Bacterial Infection of the Sinuses	bmarie828, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	7/27/2010 10:43:57 AM	I had a lot of stomach pain--especially within the first several hours along with diarrhea, nausea, and mild dizziness. It's been about 5 days and it has definitely helped my sinus infection, but has left my stomach upset. I have lost my appetite and having occasional stomach cramping. I read the pamphlet and it says it stays in your system for about 10 days, so I assume that's why my stomach still isn't feeling 100%. It's the first 3-4 hours after you take it that the side effects REALLY kick in. 
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	13-18	6/4/2010 6:54:04 PM	Only about five minutes after taking it, I experienced intense nauseous. It was so bad, I could hardly move. Now, only a few hours later, the nausea is gone, but my throat is even more sore. I hope this works soon.

Pneumonia caused by the Bacteria Chlamydia		4	4	4			11/5/2008 4:31:15 PM	Lots of stomach pain, it was very uncomfortable but it did subside. Having to take it only once was nice. Especially knowing that it was just as effective as the z-pack.
