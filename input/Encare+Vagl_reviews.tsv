Birth Control	BCuser, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/29/2012 1:42:52 PM	I have used Encare off and on for about 2 1/2 years.  I love it.  The only complaint is that is gets kinda messy but that's expected when it comes out.  Never had any burning feelings at all.  Has kept me from getting pregnant and that's the main purpose.  
Birth Control	Shaft on fire, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	7/13/2012 3:09:05 AM	My girl friend decided to use Encare to ought as our choice form of birth control. NOW MY #!&#165; IS ON FIRE!!!! There is no warning on the box stating that my penis would have the burning sensation like someone is pulling a fish hook and line out of it!!!! This is the worst product on the planet and I would not reccomend this to anyone. Actually I would have it all a part of a nazi book burning convention an erraticated from the face of this earth. This is not fair to any man for running such a horrible experiment. If you are a guy and you are reading this.... Please stay far ^#+]*! Away from this product. It will set your shaft on fire. I have read online that it can take from a few hours to a day for the burning to stop.... I wish I could sue those fuxers
Birth Control	the mrs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	6/17/2012 12:24:54 PM	So everything was fine until we got finished doing the do. My husband said his penis was burning on the inside and he was afraid to urinate or go for round two. I had no side effects other than the warm sensation and that was not that bad :) other than my husbands problems it was very easy to use and a little messy. We are now looking for something else as we are tired of using condoms and i do not want hormonal birth control
Birth Control	nobabyforme, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/6/2012 8:59:34 PM	Very easy to use, only have to wait ten minutes after insertion prior to intercourse. Can be a bit messy afterwards due to spermicide dissolving. Overall is a very good contraceptive method compared to condoms or the pill.

Birth Control	Joseph, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	4	4	Male	19-24	8/29/2011 8:50:23 PM	I have been using the encare inserts for a little over 3 years now with the same partner. I have noticed the urethral burning/itching on rare occasion, but its not frequent. Its actually just irritation from the N-9 in encare getting into the urethra. Personally I would recommend taking a break from using encare and any other product containing N-9 or other spermicides if you experience this, just till it goes away (couple days). Other than that, It's a wonderful product, and after 3 years its been 100% effective. Speaking for the woman of my life though, she agrees that after a while it gets a little leaky. Wouldn't reccomend using it if your planning on going out somewhere afterwards as you may have a wet seat issue.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	7/4/2011 1:15:15 AM	Tried this product for the first time tonight. sure it was easy enough to start using but, almost immediately upon intercourse it became very hot! After a brief interruption it it became extremely uncomfortable for both of us, so we stopped! Now there is extreme burning discomfort when using the bathroom(for us both)! surely that's not normal? 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	4	1	Female	35-44	3/27/2011 7:24:06 AM	I felt the burning sensation afterward as well. I used this product about 8 or 9 yrs ago, before having kids and do not recall having this problem. I also noticed the spotting, but I'm not sure if that is related to the product or not.
Birth Control	india82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/29/2010 11:47:36 PM	I decided to get off birth control pills for health reasons and I've explored many vaginal suppository options and have found Encare to be the easiest to use. I have noticed a warm sensation during sex that is pleasurable, so it adds to mine and my fiance's intimacy. I'm just not sure if it's safe to use around my time of ovulation and if it will really help prevent pregnany at that time. But overall, if used correctly, I believe this is a very effective product. The discharge a couple of days afterwards, someone else mentioned is the body's way of releasing that spermicide. I think the women who say they have gotten pregnant off this product did not use it correctly, as there are always failure rates to any type of contraceptive if not used correctly.
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4		19-24	3/16/2010 12:46:41 AM	I have been using this for about 7 months and so far so good. My partner has had no complaints. It's easy to use and you don't have to wait too long. Only complaint is after 30 mins or so it starts to get leaky and messy. It does tend to burn sometimes, but i think that it's from irritation during sex. I also noticed sometimes i'll have light unusual spotting a day or two after using. Don't know if it's from the foam or something else. But all in all, it's not a bad product

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/19/2008 10:32:54 AM	The Encare Vagl did what it's supposed to do and that's prevent pregnancy. I don't experience a burning sensation, however I do experience a very warm, pleasant feeling when using this product.
