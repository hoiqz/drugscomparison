Elevated Platelets with Rapid Growth of Bone Marrow	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	65-74	5/29/2012 11:11:04 PM	I took hydrea for about a year and a half and then put on anagrelide one a day and am now up to three in the morning and three at night.  in addition, I take hydrea twice a week.  my platelets stay high and now my dr awants me to have a bone marrow biopsy.  My kidney function keeps dropping down to 28 now and I know these drugs affect the kidneys.  I often think I would rather not take the hydrea or anagrelide and take my chances to save my kidney`s.  I know a lot about dyalisis and want to stay off of it at all costs.  
Elevated Platelets with Rapid Growth of Bone Marrow	Msterry6, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	10/10/2011 9:18:08 PM	I have ET and have been on .25 x6 per day along with 500 mg Hydroxyurea, and a baby aspirin. occasional headaches, heart palpitations and other annoying issues that are inconsistent. I have started to take ambien to get to sleep every once in a while so the heart pounding won't wake me up completely. I feel trapped taking this medicine, but feel it's the only option to keep my platelets down to 400,000.  Yuck!I also worry about what it's doing to our livers, and kidneys???

I had a successful pregnancy and a healthy baby girl while taking Anagrelide.  The biggest issue was the dosing.  My dosage was often adjusted to try and regulate my platelets.
Elevated Platelets with Rapid Growth of Bone Marrow	ronnie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	45-54	12/28/2009 11:17:05 AM	I am a 50 yr old female, and have been taking anagrelide 0.5mg X4 daily. I too,in the beginning,had severe heart beating; had to go visit a cardiologist,  my BP soared and having severe heart palpatations.Initially, also had vomiting, horrible headaches,diahrrea, and severe dizziness-- currently, I have  none of these symptom,  but now, my RBC is going way down, due to effects of this medication. My platelets are now within normal range--400,000. Now, I have severe joint pains,and feel very tired, and weak all the time. My oncologist says, that if I stop meds.-- my platelets will soar up to the millions again.  Also,that I must take it for my entire life-- it is hard-- which is the lesser of evils-- being on this med, or off it??? Both decisions have severe consequences.I am still trying to decide!!!:(

She now needs blood transfusions regularly to replace red blood cells that are being destroyed by the medication. She is highly allergic to Hydrea so we are running out of options.

Finally found one who took me off it and my hypertension quite rapidly ended.

I take 2mg/day and have been for the last 5 years. The only side effect I still have is rapid heart beat. My counts have remained at a controllable level. I still have monthly blood tests and see my Oncologist every three months but at this point in time I will remain on this drug.
Elevated Platelets with Rapid Growth of Bone Marrow	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	10/9/2008 9:18:20 AM	I have been on anagrelide for 3 years now.  When I first began this medicine I too had the racing heart and anxious feelings. In fact, with each added dose this would happen frequently.  I am now up to four doses per day and I still sometimes feel a racing heart beat but nothing like when I first began this medication.  I am happy with my results as my platelets seem to stay between 400,000 and 500,000. My platelets used to range from 900,000 to 1,000,000. So I am happy with my results and so is my doctor who I am very confident of. 
Other	Tina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	1/31/2008 2:34:07 PM	Started on this drug for high platelet count, 860.  Platelet count started dropping immediately, down to 560 in first week.  However started having heart palpatations and a rapid heart beat.  These became increaseingly worse, and lead to a severe anxiety attack which caused a seizure.  And on top of this my platelets began to climb again, back above 700, eventhough I was taking as perscribed.  Talked to my hemotologist and told him I refused to take it anymore after the siezure, so he perscribed something else and I threw this drug in the trash.  I am now seeing a cardioligist to deal with the problems caused by this medication.  Use with caution and make your doctor listen to you if you start to feel strange things happening with your heart!
Elevated Platelets with Rapid Growth of Bone Marrow	Patricia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	1	2	Female	55-64	12/28/2007 9:37:32 PM	I begin to have a bounding heartrate of 130-150's for 1-2 hours after taking the medication, anagrelide. This side effect is increasing in intensity and it has climaxed to the point that I am not taking the medication as of today.  I have consulted with my doctors to see if there is a medication that can be added to control this side effect and I have not, as yet, received an answer.  My platelets are controlled- under 300,000 with taking this medication three times a day(0.5mg tid).
