Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Kitnb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/9/2012 10:39:32 PM	I have been on Chloral Hydrate for the past 14? Years now. It has been THE only medication for my severe insomnia, that helps. I have a heart condition, so the older antidepressants that the doctor prescribe have been bad for me. I don't respond to you atypical sleepins meds. Have been to the sleep clinic twice. The doctor there refers back to my psychiatrist. My psychiatrist agrees that mine is NOT psychological, like the sleep doctor thinks. If you ever have a problem with a doctor, saying it is all mental, question him, or her! I did &amp; they don't like it, haha. I worked in the medical field for some time. Read up on the latest. Hope you all can find something &amp; have sweet dream, wakeing up well rested!

Both the parents and children are grately. The medications wen used appropriately is very safe.

When it first started to take effect we thought it was kinda funny.  She was loopy and a little drunk acting. We figured she would be that way for a few minutes then slip into a real sleepy state. WRONG!  Within probably 10 minutes, she went from silly, to so dizzy she couldn't walk, her head was practically spinning around uncontrollably, arms and legs flailing around.  She became very agitated, angry and combatative. This normally very loving child started screaming, crying and talking very mean and ugly to everyone. She told a nurse she was going to beat her up and tear her into little pieces. She bit me (her mother)numerous times, she pinched a nurse so hard it left a mark. Needless to say, this all scared me to death. They ended up giving her a big dose of benadryl to knock her out while the chloral hydrate wore off. She finally went completely out and they put us in a room in the ER so she could sleep it off. Then finally we were able to do the procedure, because she had to be awake enough to go pee pee.  That was terrible in itself because she was too awake and didnt have the right amount of sedation to make it comfortable for her.  Overall the experience was horrible and absolutely no one will be giving any of my children chloral hydrate ever again.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/4/2010 7:26:17 PM	I have chronic insomnia.  For 2 years, I never slept more than 2 hours a night, and my quality of life was awful.  I have been taking chloral hydrate now for nearly 2 years and it has been a godsend.  I can't take sleeping pills because they leave me too groggy.  CH is strong enough to put me to sleep and I can get a good 5-7 hours of sleep a night.  My life is so much better with this stuff and I anticipate taking it for the rest of my life and that's ok - I'm sleeping.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	aaron383, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	5	Male	25-34	11/17/2008 5:39:08 PM	Ive been taking chloral hydrate for about 2 years now in liquid form with about a cup of gingerale every evening before bed, having chronic insomnia the chloral alone gets me about 4-5 undisturbed hours of sleep, i am now on a combination of 30mg dalmane and 2 teaspoons of chloral a night and am sleeping a solid 6, dalmane alone doing very little, so overall i think its a very good drug for those with chronic insomnia, though measuring it can be a pain and the liquid form can cause quite a mess.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Katyinc, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	8/18/2008 3:13:43 PM	I took this med as directed, I slept for 15 minutes and was up all night again, it has not done a thing for me, I am at my wits end, nothing has helped me and I seem to have my days and nights mixed up. Ready to pull the old hair out, sick of this situation and the life I am in right now due to my sleeping habits. Any help would surely be appreciated. Have taken other sleeping meds, the newer ones, were useless. Oh well, just not good with meds....
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	45-54	7/25/2008 6:59:55 AM	This was my (former) doctor's last stab at a sleep aid for me (he seemed really dead set against benzodiazepines). It worked OK at first but stopped working very quickly. Also, I was not able to take it with a full glass of water as directed, because tat would waken me in the night, going to the bathroom. I can't remember now if it irritated my stomach or if my doctor just warned me that could happen. I would gladly give this medicine another try.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	up all nite, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/10/2008 6:00:17 PM	Chloral hydrate is a old timer drug that works with me since I dont want to take barbituates. I have Mania bi polar I,with anxiety. New meds like lumina and sonata dont work nor do benzodiazapines. If a sleeper doesnt work I recommend this to you.There is no physical withdrawl I have found,used it 4 years, went without it ,never had withdrawl of any kind.

She was playing and told us she felt funny, we made her sit and presto she was asleep. The only negative comment I have is that she was out cold. We could not get her to walk and she is 7 yrs. old and weighs about 65 lbs. I had a hard time carrying her, I recommend recruiting the help of a strong male to carry the child after the procedure.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	ammcbrien@gmail.com, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/14/2007 3:36:19 PM	I was put on this because I couldn't sleep due to remembering my past. I have PTSD. I am re-experiencing and remembering everything NOW w/ feeling all the abuse by two monstors. They were not parents. This drug has helped me sleep most of the time, unfortunately I also have to take it to calm down after a very hard setion w/ my therapist or reliving something in my own home. Anyone who has PTSD is in for a horrible rollercoaster ride and needs support. It is essential. Outside support by a compassionate,understanding and qualified/experienced therapist or psychologist is a MUST. Do not go it alone. Use great books, like Courage to Heal by Ellen Bass. Know others are out here and will hold your hand-I am.
