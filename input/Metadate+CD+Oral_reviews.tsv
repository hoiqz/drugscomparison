We are still experiencing days when she isn't able to sit still or stop talking (most of the time jumping from one subject to the next,without finishing). 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	9/5/2012 1:16:48 AM	I am taking Metadate CD 30mg 2 a day. I have found out that this dosage works for me. It helps me stay focused throughout the day. I have tried other meds before this one and they did not work for me. Metadate is the only one that I have used that works well. I   have no loss of appetite when I take it. I am more focused then ever!

I have read several reviews about the bad effects of Metadate.  The drug is only good for 10-11 hrs and then it loses its effectiveness (as with all drugs).  I know when Metadate is no longer working for the day and YES it is usually done with by the time my daughter gets home from school.  Jekyle and Hyde, but its doable.  Calming/breathing exercises.  Before Metadate my daughter was having severe problems in school. Aggression, emotional outburst, etc.  Since being on Metadate she is more focused, is excelling, there have been zero behavioral issues in school (aside from talking). I don't want my daughter to be on a drug for the rest of her life, but for right now...this works.  She sees a therapist, has a behavioral coach and has been given tools to assist her in making better choices so that she can get off the drug.

It helps me focus on what i need to do such as my school work. I have seen a difference in getting things I need to get done done. I only take one a day because I do not like the way two of them make me feel. I have lost a lot of weight because of this drug. I would say that is one of the biggest down falls about this drug. I have no appetite anymore and I have to make myself eat when I take it. I get dry mouth all the time as well. Over all this drug has helped me in school, work and daily things.

I know its otherwise known as ritalin, but metadate CD releases in the brain different then Ritalin without near as many side effects. I have been a very happy parent with this drug, it has gotton my son into the gifted program at school, to help him focus, and concentrate easier, he is very smart, and gets along with all different kinds of kids.

I am a senior in college now at a very highly ranked college and have found that even with an increased dose the metadate is not working. I do not know if it is my diet now or my lack of exercise because my sport season is over and it is finals but I am finding it very hard to focus on anything and I feel extremely slugish. I am going to stop taking my 40mg over break to try and see if that helps especially with foggy mind feeling I get
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	7-12 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	5	3	Male	7-12	11/21/2011 1:40:28 PM	My son just stared Metadate CD 10mg once a  day 3 days ago. Too soon to make any trueevaluation yet. However I have noticed the beginnings of mood swings, and the &quot;zombie&quot; stare. Not to thrilled. Was wondering if anyone had height growth rate problems with their child while on Metadate. When he was on Vyvanse one of the main reasons we took him off was beacuse he was 7 years old and people thought he was 4 years old. No growth in height and SEVERE weight loss. I know the height issue is a  minor concern compared to the other major side effects, but in a childs mind it is HUGE and contributes to the problem.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	13-18	11/15/2011 7:08:14 PM	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 12. I was very emotional, very troubled. I was abusive to my family and out of control. I was disorganized and manipulative when I wanted something. I was embarrassing and impulsive. When I was first put on this medication, it took a bit to get the dosage right. Over the last few years the doc has adjusted the dose a few times and I can tell you it was a miraculous improvement the first time the dosage was finally gotten right. It takes a while, but stay in there. Don't just stop taking it because you think its not working. Work with a doc to get the dosage right. This medicine saved me from sinking into a world of depression because my forgetfulness and disorganization had only led to failure. The failure made me feel inadequate to the point that I thought of taking my life. This medication helped me to learn how to be organized and to set goals for myself that I could for the first time ACTUALLY accomplish! I finished what I started, and that was something I had never done before. If I had not been put on the medication when I was, I think I would have taken a very different path. Sure it's not perfect, but it helps. I know how to accomplish goals now and control my emotions. Sometimes its still tough, but I hang in there.  It's done great things for me.

His grades have increased dramatically and he maintains e conduct. the problem is hes so quiet its almost scary even his teachers say you have to look up and see him to even know he's in the room. At home hes totally isolated and would prefer to stay in his room for hours at a time, i have to make him come out for family time. his appetite is slim to none and he constantly complains of a stomach ache. Now his dr. wants him on 40 mg and blue cross doesnt cover any adhd meds so its 187.00 a month. I think as with any medication it comes with good and bad sides.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Mom who cares, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Male	3-6	7/20/2010 9:48:26 AM	My 5 year old started taking it 3 months ago.  The drug was a God send at first, after his first drug caused him to act out violently.  We were up to 20 mg. I went to refill it and everything went to hell.  His first pill sent him on a violent tantrum at school.  Throwing chairs at his friends and teachers and physically going after them kicking and screaming. He has never missed a pill.  I even called the pharmacy to make sure the manufacturer was the same and nothing had changed.  To me it looked like there was a lot more medicine in the capsule then the pryor month.  I give him the capsule every morning in his applesauce.  I don't know what changed or why, but I finanlly had to stop the medicine this week.  He would cry and tell us he hated this world.  I feel like there is definately something wrong with this medicine and I don't know if the FDA can look into it. I don't think I am imagining more medicine in those pills then last time.  I just know, I want my happy child back.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	5	3	Male	3-6	3/18/2010 10:01:13 PM	My son was diagnosed with ADHD when he was five years old. We went through several medications before starting Metadate a few months ago. We started on 20 mgs and he has increased his ability to concentrate at school and his behavior has greatly improved. However, as soon as he gets home he is a different child. He is incredibly irritable and often displays signs of depression. He cries often and very easily, which is outside of his normal happy, playful, loving behavior. He complains of headaches almost everyday. I am very happy with his great improvements at school however I miss my son. He has not been himself sinse starting this medicine. He doesn't eat well or sleep much at night however he complains of being tired all of the time. I called the Dr. today and got his dose cut in half so we'll see what happens.

When I was nine, I couldn't concentrate, I was mouthy, I couldn't sit still if my life depended on it. Now I can concentrate, and my parents say I'm an angel. The main thing that I don't like about Metadate, is that I CAN'T sleep at night. I stay up for hours, reading and listening to music, and then when I have to get up at 4:30 every morning, and go to school, my mood isn't the best. Does anyone have any ideas for what I could do? It would make school sooooo much easier for me to stay awake and active during. I mean, I do get tired at night, but I just can't fall asleep. It's really a drag.

We put her on metadate cd about 1 1/2 years ago. It started out ok, but her attitude has gotten alot worse she is really mouthy and hateful she hardly ever says anything nice anymore, she has started cussing again and her talking has increased ten fold she is never quiet.  She is currently taking 30 mg. and she has built up a tolerence , it doesn't even slightly effect her now, she is also complaining of heartburn like pain the minute she eats or drinks anything and she has been having really bad headaches about every other day.She also does not sleep well at all she always has bad nightmares. I want to change her medication but there are really no other medications out there that i trust. Concerta made her lose so much weight you could see all her bones. She eats a little better on metadate but she is still almost 20 lbs underweight for her age group.

I have tried ritalin and Strattera and neither have worked as well as Metadate.  However, I find that i do have appetite loss and when I am coming down off of my medication, I  become irritable and extremely hungry because of the aforementioned appetite loss.  But overall, I have seen a dramatic difference in my ability to focus and all of it without the Zombie affect. I would recommend this drug to anyone who is ADHD.

His overall attitude has changed from being somewhat difficult to a desire to do well and to please.  There are some issues with decreased appetite during they day, but by 4pm he makes up for it with a vengeance.  His sleep time has been pushed back about an hour, but he has no problems getting up in the am.

She comes home from school with all of her lunch.  She just has nibbled on her sandwich and eaten nothing else!!  Is the Metadate causing this?  Has anyone else had this problem?  I have an 8 year old that is on this same medication and she eats just fine.  I just don't know what to do.  Could someone please give me some insight?

His doctor started him on 20 mg and we noticed a difference the first day. before he started on meds he couldnt write his name, count past 5, or say his abc's. within two days of meds he could write his full name, count to ten and could knew almost the whole alphabet. He has mood swings once in a while and bedtime is a mess but all in all this med. has done wonders, we didnt even have to go through any trial and error this medication has been really good for him. we have only had to up the dose once in the last 9 months and that was last month. Dealing with the rare mood swings and bedtime problems is a small price to pay for the happiness and well being of my child.

I do not like to take medicine at all unless I have to.  I recently went to the doctor about my ADD.  I have been taking Metadate for almost a week now and I cannot deside if I like it or not.  It makes me feel nervous (but awake).  It's kind of like drinking 5 cups of coffee in the morning.  But I can definately feel it wear off before I leave work.  Not sure if I should ask for a smaller evening dose because I do not want to be up all night.

He did eat applesauce, I took the caps. in half and put the inside of the pill in the applsauce.   He did not want it. So he did eat it for me,I feed  it to  him.He just started the medication, but I do nothow long. He walked around the house likehe was lost and he lived with us for a yearand a half.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	 Female  (Caregiver) 	2	5	2	Female		3/7/2009 1:59:24 PM	My son is 5 years old and has been taking this medication since November. He started off with 30mg and now it has been increased to 40mg. My son's behavior is still somewhat the same. He's still having angry outburst, aggressiveness, and impulsiveness in school, at home, and in public. He still cannot control his anger. The only positive is him being able to sit still to put a puzzle together.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/2/2009 4:33:30 PM	My 8 year old son has been taking this medication for over a year and we are very pleased with the results.  For the first couple months he would become very agitated/moody in the evenings, but we stuck with it (like the doctor told us to), and are very glad we did.  He no longer experiences these nightly mood swings and is doing excellent in school - one of the top students in his class.  My only complaint is that it seems to wear off by about 3:30 pm; however, it lasts through the school day, which is where he needs it the most.  The plus side, he usually eats a really good dinner.

I have been taking this drug for 3+ years now.  I find that I am able to think clearly, get organized and forcus.  Before this drug, I hadn't been able to pass a college exam.  I am glad to say that I have been able to excel in school with no problems! My boyfriend is also pleased with the change in our relationship since I started taking Metadate.  I take 40mg in the a.m. and a 10mg tablet at dinner time.

He started at 10mg and has now moved up to 30mg over the past year. He came to his father today and told him that he sees ghosts and has shadows follow him at school. He said that they talk to him. I will be taking him to the doctors first thing. He has also had upset stomach and at times becomes overly angry. It started out working great but he quickly developed a tolerance and I don't know what to do. I didn't even know what to say to him other than we will see the doctor in the morning.

I found that my son is getting bad stomach pains and he crashes really hard in the evenings, very irritable and agry, my doctor told me to stick it out for a couple weeks and the pain would subside, she was right, and he doesnt crash as hard in the evenings anymore, Im glad I gave it a try instead of getting freaked and stopping so shortly into it. At first my son starting saying he was a bad person and got more depressed, but the symptoms have eased and are almost not there anymore, he can focuse in school and no more referrals to the principle, and he has his friends back as well, I know that we will have to increase his meds over time and possibly add another med to the mix. For now he is doing really well minus the come downs and it has made a good difference for him and our family.

He is taking 30mg/2 times a day. We would love to bump it up as the teachers still say he blurts out in class but were told that 60mg daily was max for a 14 year old. Does anyone else have different dosing recommendations. Also as ADHD kids become teenagers; is there a test to determine effectiveness. I find that it is a lot harder when they are teenagers to determine adhd symptoms or is it age?

Suddenly couldn't think clearly enough to even make a list of what I needed to get done.  THIS DRUG IS A LIFESAVER -- been taking it for 1+ yr.  Had to adjust the dosage at first but it I can get though the whole day now.  It's great!!!

After that he started becoming very angry and thought that everyone believed him to be a liar.  He never exhibited this behavior befor this drug.  The final straw came with a call from his 1st grade teacher saying that he was so angry he banged his head on the concrete repeatedly.  Needless to say, he will no longer be taking Metadate!!!

Of the two, this one works best.  He has some irritability in the morning b4 it has time to start working and some in the evening when it is wearing off, but as long as he is functioning well at school with no problems, we can deal at home.  He is in kindergarten and his teacher says he functions like a child without ADHD. One thing we have noticed is that he has to eat regularly or he is more irritable.  Protein is a key player in his diet.

It doesn't seem to work after 2:00 pm.  Each time he builds up a tollerance for the medication his symptoms return and his dose has to be increased.  I am over all not satisfied with this medication.  My daughter has been on this medication for 3 months now with similar results.  I'm not sure why it's not working for them.

I took the drug with little positive results.  I would &quot;crash&quot; hard in the early evening with a total lack of energy and a bad temper.  The drug made me &quot;zombie like&quot; during the day and very irritable during the night.  We treat our son with the same drug, coupled with psychological treatment through counseling and have seen a tremendous positive change in his behavior both in the home and at school.  He does have to take a low dose anti-depressant which has helped with the nighttime &quot;crashes&quot;.  The medication has given us back our son after therapy alone proved useless.  We didn't tell his 1st grade teacher he was using it at first, just to make sure he really was getting a positive effect instead of a parents bias.  Our son doesn't seem to have the same &quot;zombie&quot; effect that I did.

Of course when I was a child I was just labled as never paying attention in class or low grades D/T not trying. On my own I found ways to compensate. But now since I started Metadate CD I actually feel like a new person! Life has opened up for me and I can accomplish so much more in one day than I ususlly would in a month! It is never to late. I take (2) 20mg in the morning.
