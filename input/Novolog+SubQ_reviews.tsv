I am on Social Security, and though I have insurance, the deductible is $135.00 every 28 days, and I cannot afford this medication.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	JoeSmith, 35-44 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/20/2012 6:52:35 PM	OK   I have been using this medication over 2 years It works perfectly!  Ya I have had a couple lows..  Thats my fault for over medicating myself!   People you need to learn  how much Novolog you need measured in Units!!!  I started with 2 units at meal times for type 2 diabetes.  Now I take up to 15 units at meal times.   Like for breakfast and dinner.   Im on the sliding scale which is something everyone should learn about!   If you use this medication correctly You wont have any problems with it.   Most people never learn how to use the medication correctly.   or they complain about weight gain... If you start gaining weight  GO EXERCISE!   I work out 3 to 4 times a week.  Even if you cant go to a gym  go for a walk  or something.   Look up Home Exercises on google if you have to.     People need to stop complaining about this medication  and saying it doesn't work.  Stop being lazy! 
Diabetes	Mickey, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	1/2/2012 10:15:56 PM	I have had diabetes for two years now, after spending a week in the ICU, $70,000 bill. Using this medication alone is not enough for me, blood sugar levels swing high to low. I was taking between 5-10 units 4-5 times a day when I took this medicine by its-self. Taken with long lasting Lantus, 40 units per night, I have been able to maintain my sugar levels very well, and while staying on a very strict diet, I have recently, on occasion, not needed to use the Aspart (Novolog)for a day or two. Which I enjoy not having to get poked with the needle so much.

It does take care of ur highs but only for a while as they state a quick insulin.  Overall it a constant checking of glucose throughout the day. The worst is the weight gain.
Diabetes	ByronR, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/31/2011 5:38:20 PM	I have been on Novo for almost three weeks now. I am getting very good results. I had an A1C of 12.0 last MD appt. but the therapy is working well for me. It should be noted that you have to balance diet and exercise with this medication in order to get the best benefit from it. No longer can I eat just ANYTHING I wanted to. I must adhere to a lifestyle change. We can feel better if we take care of ourselves.

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/5/2010 5:18:57 PM	Easy to use with a sliding scale.  Conveniant pen that I can keep in my shirt pocket and looks like an ordinary pen.  Loud clicking while setting the dose and injecting does make it difficult to be discreet though good for the visually impaired.

I do get the jitters and sometime a rush. Somewhat pleased with it.
