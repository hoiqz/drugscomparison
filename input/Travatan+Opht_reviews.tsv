Increased Pressure in the Eye	Cheryl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	9/25/2012 12:45:39 PM	Bad experience with Travatan Z. Although the drops didn't burn, my eye became fiery red and about 2 hours after instillation, I developed severe eye pain - a throbbing ache. The eye felt bruised, like I'd been punched in the eye.  Also had severe sensitivity to light. No visual problem. Happened each of the 4 days I used it, so it didn't get better with time. Now on a different med.

Increased Pressure in the Eye	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	55-64	9/13/2011 6:05:58 AM	Travatan has been effective for me for the last two years with the reduction in the pressure,but with side effects like itching and redness in the eye. However, recently my wife noticed hair growth under my eyes. I did not believe that Travatan did it until I read one of the reviewers had the same effects. Not sure what to do now until I see my doctor next month.
Increased Pressure in the Eye	Mark 1000000, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	45-54	3/10/2011 4:11:55 AM	Worked fine in lowering the pressure in my eyes (from late 20s/30) to 14/15 but I experienced growth of eye lashes (not that this can categorically be attributed to the taking of this drug) to the extent that they made my eyes sore and red (apart from looking very feminine!). For anybody else suffering similarly, try cutting eye lashes with nail scissors. Not easy but did the trick for me. Changed to another drug. A shame.  
Increased Pressure in the Eye	cactusflower,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		10/16/2010 8:07:14 PM	I have been using the drops for about two weeks.  I have had very bad reactions to the drug which ended up putting me in the hospital with severe chest pains.  Doctor has taken me off but my liver enzeymes are high and I have to have more testing.

Increased Pressure in the Eye	HelenElizabeth, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	5	3	Female	65-74	6/1/2010 11:01:00 PM	I have been on this drug for a week now.  The side effects that effected me were blurriness (hard to read road signs) and after I put it in, the drops seem to go into my throat and nose, then my nose starts running.  I have to go back to dr in two weeks, so I don't know if my pressure has been lowered, so its hard for me to rate it.

Increased Pressure in the Eye	Cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	4/3/2010 3:09:45 AM	This medication made my eyes very red, itchy and swelling around my eyes. I looked like I had &quot;Vampire&quot; eyes and it affected my breathing (SOB)as I have Asthma. Now using oral Glaucoma med that works great. Yes, longer lashes but at what cost to my health. This is same med advertized for longer lashes.

Increased Pressure in the Eye	Diane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	12/29/2009 10:02:56 AM	My eye pressure was up to 23 and the dr. put me on xalatan. Very bad side effects. Went with out meds and pressure went high. Dr. asked me to try travatan and I have been very pleased. No blood shot eyes,red eye lids or sensitivity to light. The only thing I have noticed is my eye lashes have gotten longer which for me is a good thing. I go back for my check up in 2 weeks and hope the pressure is down so I can stay on this med.

Terrible upset stomach, flatulence and diarrhea to the point where I'm afraid to leave the house.
Increased Pressure in the Eye	maggie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	65-74	9/27/2008 2:36:19 PM	It took me four weeks to figure out  my  uncomfortable side effects were from this drug, i.e.,upset stomach with  gastro intestinal issues; change of bowel color every two days,  chest pains (I thought it was heartburn), and I became very anxious.  I have not had my IOP checked yet to see if 5 wks of the med helped.  My doc is switching me to Timolol, a beta blocker.  We shall see.  I'm a little dubious, but I will try the new drug.

After using Travatan (1 drop each eye/night), my pressures were lowered to 14 and 16. Lazer surgery is one of my options, but I can handle one drop a day.
