Depression	Jaime, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	1/6/2011 7:02:33 PM	A couple years ago, I was given this as an addition to my zoloft.  I tried it for a couple weeks, but I couldn't stay on it.  I don't remember whether it helped my anxiety or depression, but I remember the side effects.My muscles felt like I had the flu.  They would get fatigued very quickly.  They other thing is that my memory was totally shot.  I couldn't recall simple words that I use all the time.  I know that happens to everyone once in a while, but this was extreme.  It would happen 5 times in the same conversation.  I'd have to stop in the middle of a sentence and try to explain the definition of the word to the person I was speaking to.May be a great for someone else, but it just didn't work for me.

Other	Sheba20, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	10/4/2009 4:08:46 PM	I fractured my spine in a car accident.  I have terrible chronic pain, and sometimes I get pretty depressed trying to cope with it every day.  Mr Dr prescribed this to help me sleep at night.  I feel like I have a bad hangover in the mornings, and feel very dingy.  I have to have a lot of focus at work and I can tell I probably will discuss not taking this drug with my doctor.

Other	Shanbanan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	3/12/2009 3:47:31 PM	I was given this drug in hopes of easing my Interstitial Cystitis symptoms. The worst side effect was panic attacks, and sweating. I had hot flashes, and was literally dripping sweat almost all day. It made school and work very diffucult, and embarassing. It did help my symptoms a bit, but I decided the side effects were not worth the small gain.

After about a week I had my first full day in 6 months without getting any headaches and/or migraines. I really helped me in a big way. Wish I knew more about how it works.... - Thanks, Brian
