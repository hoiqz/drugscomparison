Low HDL Cholesterol	Broken Heart, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	6/24/2012 7:40:17 PM	This is my second week taking this medication, I take one pill before bed and also an aspiring thirty minutes before simcor. I also take Omega3 pills three time per day. Today was the first day that I saw my face red, like sunburn red, butI was not in the sun at all,  it lasedt a couple of hours and then it was gone just like that, I also noticed a change a slight change on my bowel habits more often and lots of rumbling noise from my stomach. The only side effect that seems to be bothersome is the dry skin, I feel my skin unusually dry and I'm constantly applying body lotion, hand cream, even my lips seemed dry, which has prompt me to drink more water. I never liked just plain water now I crave water all the time which seems to be helping loose the weight that I must loose. only two weeks since I began taking this med, I sure hope that I do not get the flushing that seems to be common.

Have decreased dosage of aspirin to 81 mg over a period of time and found this amount works for me as well.
Low HDL Cholesterol	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	55-64	10/28/2011 4:03:56 PM	I was taking 1/2 pill per day without any side effects.  My doctor told me to increase to 1 whole pill per day.  After about a week, I woke up with my face feeling like it was on fire.  I tried getting to my feet but was very light headed and fell, hitting my head on the dresser.  I didn't know at the time that it was all associated with Simcor, and it scared the hell out of me.  I thought I was having the &quot;big one&quot;.  I'm going back to 1/2 pill and intend to take some aspirin with it.  I'm also going to take it at dinner time, because if I have intense flushing like that again, I'd rather have it when I'm awake than in the middle of the night.

I never had a problem with te &quot;flushing&quot; it kind of felt like a hot flash every once and a while. Thst is until I got a horrible migraine (nothing to do with this med) and I stopped taking all of my other medications because I was on some heavy pain meds.  When I got that situation cleared up I went directly back to taking 2 pills before bed.  the second night after taking 2 pills I was on FIRE! It was scarey I'll admit, but the Dr. did warn me about it.  I went back to 1 pill for 2 weeks then resumed with 2 pills.  I haven't had another problem since.

The first week was a living hell.I turned into one big red hot chili pepper.It made my skin tingle and burn like theres no tomorrow.I thought my ears were going to explode they were so hot.But after the first week my body got used to it and there was only minor flushing here and there.Simcor worked good for my cholestrol but its done nothing for my triglycerides. 
High Cholesterol	quinnmcb, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	4/27/2011 1:04:14 AM	Let me first say that everyone complaining of the ON fire feeling...that is really normal. It's the niacin not the simvistatin. Also take 325mg of asprin...not 81 baby asprins...I am 30 and my cholesterol isn't that high but the size is and my bp isn't good. I can see where it would scare people that haven't been explained the &quot;flushing&quot; feeling. Yes it feels like a sunburn. So here is my advice. Use soft sheets, wear hardly anything, take asprin, and do not take this medicine until you are sure that you will be sleeping. If you have problems sleeping on this ask your dr about sleeping meds. It isn't as bad as some say on here. Good luck on your journey. 
High Cholesterol	RBinCA, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	45-54	4/12/2011 4:35:55 PM	Last night was my first night on this medication.  As directed, I had a snack one hour before taking the pill.  I woke up at 2:00 in the morning with flushing so severe my scalp and torso felt on fire.  As the flushing steadily intensified I became extremely dizzy and fainted within seconds of standing up.  The hot flash eventually subsided in 30 minutes, but it was a looooong 30 minutes.  Today, I have a slight headache accompanied by some lightheadedness.   I am going to pass on this and all Niacin meds.  Im going back to my Welchol  and adding flaxseed oil to my daily regimen.
High Cholesterol	JJ, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Male	45-54	4/4/2011 3:18:50 PM	Have been on Simcor for about 5 months now for high cholesterol. It's very important you follow label (or your docs)instructions when taking this drug. I take mine with a low-fat snack and a coated aspirin 30 minutes before bedtime. Flushing seemed to be the only side effect I experienced, off and on for the first couple of weeks. Not going to lie, the first couple episodes of flushing were horrible, I felt like I was being burned alive from the inside out. Told my doc I wasn't going to take it anymore and he said I really needed it and to give it a few days. By body seemed to adjust pretty quickly and I rarely experience problems anymore. On the very rare occasion I do experience flushing now, it's so mild it really doesn't bother me.
High Cholesterol	daviddou, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	2	Male	35-44	3/15/2011 12:15:39 AM	After taken it for a few weeks, I was ok,  felt a lil flushing..was a bit uncomfortable but then it passed.  Then one night......I'm not sure, but I believe this is what HELL will be like. The burn starts in the brain,  it swells the head,  a fire w/in my arms erupted like a volcano, the tingling set in and introduced in concert the FIRE...ahhh the fire....I really felt like I was burning from the inside.. I jumped into a cold bath. i took aspirin, benedryl.. i felt dizzy..i thought i was going to die...yes its that bad.. I've since started to go to church - as I dont want to go to hell when I die. I am now very religous and attend bible study once a week.  As for Simcor - well its working, both physically and religiously as I've a new found appreciate to stay away from HELL!!!!   You too may go there one night at 2.30am ,  get ready to BURN!!!works great though...

My whole body turns a bright red, and an unpleasant &quot;prickly&quot; feeling.  Lasts at least an hour.

The flushing started immediately and woke me up all through the night so didn't get much sleep.  My doctor told me to stop taking it once both arms broke out in a rash and I was itching 24/7.  I took an aspirin an hour before and ate a little something when taking this medication but the side effects were too intense so I had to stop taking this medicine.

Niaspan gives me heart palpitations and my doc thought going to simcor would make it better. It, in fact, made it worse.  Very bad palpitations that landed me in the ER once.  irregular heartbeat.  was told to take full 325mg aspirin before so flushing at night wasn't a problem.  a few mild episodes of it but never woke me up out of sleep. my problem with the flushing is that it would happen in the middle of the day or whenever it really wanted to.  Referred to cardiologist because of palps. he took me off the simcor right away.  Hopefully the palps will go away now.  The drug did work.  Lowered my bad stuff and raised my good stuff.

Somedays I feel like I am on fire.  Others I barely notice it.    My doctor warned me about the flushing and told me to take an asprin but since I never had the flushing I got off of the asprin and I only at times had the side-effect of the burning and itching.

I did start exercising more and watch what my diet a little better (But this was over the hohidays and I was no saint!)however I still think that probably was not responsible for the drastic change alone.I did experience the &quot;flushing&quot; when i got stressed or angry.  Kind of felt like the HULK, but nothing that lasted for more than 5-10 minutes.I am very happy with results especially considering the short amount of time I was taking it.
High Cholesterol	Tony, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Male	45-54	1/15/2010 6:00:45 AM	after taking this medication for a few weeks the flushing started, waking me in the middle of the night. The flushing subsided but after months of taking this the joint pain got unbearable. I took my self off this medication. When I went back for my three month follow-up with the doctor, I told him about the pain and the discontinued use. He said to stay off it and the pain should go away. It has already been a month and no sign of the pain subsiding.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/28/2009 10:31:06 AM	My husband and I have both been taking Simcor for almost a year.  We take it in combination with 3 pills of Welchol each day, along with a pharmacy grade fish oil capsule (2 per day).  At first, the flushing with this drug (caused by the Niacin it contains) was annoying.  However, if you take an aspirin or benedryl with it for the first few weeks, you will begin to tolerate the flushing.  Occasionally I woke up covered with hives, but as long as I knew it was the Simcor, I was not alarmed.  They disappear within a short period of time (a few minutes or hour).  If your doctor has prescribed this specific statin, it is probably becauase you have cholesterol particles that require Niacin in order to be controlled.  As I understand it, this is extremely important.  So, hang in there and continue to take it unless you have side effects that are alarming in addition to the flushing.  You will get used to the drug.

So I stopped taking it. I know this pill caused it, because it was the only thing I was taking.It also made my hair oily.

I will not take this drug again and will resort to old fashion medication - eat right, exercise and first and formost GOD.  DO NOT TAKE THIS POISON.  Not worthe the pain.

If you can take aspirin, it really helps to take 125mg a few minutes before the SIMCOR to stop flushing. And I mean flusshing that makes your face feel like it's on fire!  Also taking the Simcor after a low fat food can help reduce flushing.  Do not eat fatty foods before or after taking - caused diarea for me.  As long as I follow these rules, it works.

I took 1 dose. Itching, especially on my scalp and body was awful. It felt like bugs crawling on me. Also headache, nausea, dizziness, aching all over and exhausted. I am now in the process of researching cholesterol lowering foods. I was told by the same doctor that it could also damage my liver and I would need retesting every 3 months. No thanks. I'll find a less dangerous (not to mention less miserable)way to lower my numbers.

When I first tried it itching started, scalp and then all over. so tired I felt like the life was taken right out of me flu like symptoms. Quick taking and then started back up again concerned with high cholesterol but no insurance. This time after 3 months of taking it I and the worst abdominal pain ever face burning up like it was sunburned almost felt blistering. Arms and face red as well.

Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	4/30/2009 6:04:12 PM	I have been taking this for a few weeks now and not had any side effects at all.  I take it about an hour before bed with a few crackers and drink about 16oz. of water.  I only gave it 3 stars for effectiveness because haven't had my blood tested just yet.
High Cholesterol	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	4/21/2009 11:57:00 PM	Have not seen my side effects on these reviews. Took it for 4 days and had HIVES AND ITCHING ON MOST OF MY BODY most of the days and nights. Was told by doctor that it is an allergy to an ingredient that helps assimilate Niacin. The itching is unbearable. Off Simcor. Will go on Zocor after the side effects go away (It is happening as I write this)

I only experienced the flushing for two days when I first started taking the medicine.  I take a baby aspirin 30 minutes before taking Simcor and no flushing has occured.  It is also important to know that when taking this medicine, do not drink anything hot, take a hot bath or shower, or eat anything spicy before taking it or you will experience severe flushing/itching.

Improved both HDL and LDL significantly. Doctors says drug most likely decreased plaque in Coradic Arteries (significantly!) Flushing is mild - take at bed time WITH a baby aspirin (if you can)! Had flushing maybe 3 times and then no more flushing - it does go away! Just need to expect it at first. So far Drug is great (6 months) blood work is &quot;outstanding&quot; as my Doctor says.

I get red on arms chest and legs too. Once I called the doc I was so alarmed and he said wait a few minutes, it will go away and it did. Not a pleasant experience. My doc says I need to keep taking it and try to manage the flushing. I stopped taking it for a while and my readings were high so I am back on it.

I knew the Niacin in this drug could do that but was suprised of the extent. I am not exaggerating when I say if the fires of hell are that hot, I am repenting now!! Only lasted 15 minutes but I was ready to swear the stuff off.  I read here that you have to take it with plenty of water, maybe thats where I went wrong. I am willing to try it again and see.

I stopped taking Simcor due to lower back muscle pain that was very bothersome, especially in the morning.  I noticed an immediate improvement within 48 hours of stopping the medication.  I was on the lowest dose one time a day.  Other mild side effect was flushing from the niaspan, three episodes over 8 weeks.
