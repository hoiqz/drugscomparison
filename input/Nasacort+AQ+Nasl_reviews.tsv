And after only two months of usage, and not even as much as the prescription called for, I have a hole in my septum. I am undergoing surgery to correct what has been a constant problem for me for two years. The surgery will be horrible. This medicine should have a HUGE warning on the box, advising users of the risk of a perforated septum.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	2/16/2011 2:20:13 PM	This is the only nasal spray that ever has worked for me to reduce the swelling inside my nostrils caused by allergies.  I have severe sleep apnea and this has helped by opening my nostrils so I can breathe again!  The problem is that my insurance does not cover this so the cost is $125.00. So I ordered it from a Canadian pharmacy and saved big.  The cost was only $41.oo including shipping to Arizona.

I have severe vaso-motor rhinitis and asthma.  Until I had to go on Medicare Rx program, I forgot that I actually have a medical problem. Humana and other prescription drug insurance providers refuse to cover this drug.  I have tried other things for 90 das at a time, but they don't work.  I'm desparate to find out how I can get this covered for my use again.  I wish I knew if there are any other plans that cover it.

The first couple of weeks I took this, it seemed to help. But lately I can't tell the difference from before I started using it.  It seems like it's not doing anything.  I take it in conjunction with Allegra and Singulair to control my severe allergies.  I've tried other corticosteroid nasal sprays and at least this one doesn't give me thrush like some of the others did.  I guess that's the best thing about this one.  I'm not saying it's terrible and I'm not saying it's great. I'd give it a &quot;meh.&quot;

I had chronic headaches while using this med. At first I had some light headed feeling so I reduced the dose to 1 spray in each nostril daily. The headaches started 3 months into using. The pain was all over my face, These were not like regular headaches, they were wierd pains in my head. It was so bad I was eating Advil like crazy.This went on for 3 months until I finally stopped using. It has been almost 2 weeks and the headaches are gone.I feel almost like normal before I started using this.I gave this a higher rating because of effectiveness, but at a terrible price, I was miserable! It seemed like I was in constant pain. I did some research and disovered that this is a common side effect of steroid nasal sprays. Steroids are nasty! be careful. If any doctor tells you it isn't absorbed ino the bloodstream, don't believe it!

I am getting a more restful sleep. I have been taking Nasacort AQ for only a short period of time but I have had no side effects. For many uears I have not been able to remember my dreams but after taking the mediatcation I can.  My doctor suggested that I am now getting more oxygen to the brain because the nasal inflamation is reduced which contributes to the fact that I am able to now remember my dreams.  So far this seems to be the relief that I have prayed for many years.  I have taken other medications which has not worked as effectively.

I suffer with chronic sinusitis and I am taking for sinus infection. The bad thing is the terrible splitting headache, just like a migrain. I am going to stop taking it, I can't sleep and my head throbs. Seems like 1 in every 5 people have this same problem, if you go by averages of people who have left comments for this drug.

I have had headaches, scratchy throat, fatigue, and my nasal symptoms worsened. I found out it can cause candida of the nose and throat,mouth. I am severely allergic to mold and fungus. Now I will not use this again. If it causes candida then it wouldn't do me any good and would make it worse. I don't understand why a doctor would have a person with severe mold and fungus allergies even use this stuff. I wing as also suffering from excessive bleeding and lots of fatigue. I didn't know the side affects and that is my fault. I will carefully review any meds I am given from now on!! Oh and I am feeling much better already after 24 hours of not using this medication. Make sure you read the side affects of anything you take.

He did give good instructions on how to use it (because it will irritate your throat, etc)1) Drink some water first (to help with throat irritation)2) Use a salt water over the counter spray in each nostril3) Blow your nose very hard4) 2 squirts of Nasacort AQ in each nostril5) Drink some water again.

I've had no problems with burning or bloody nose but you need to make sure you get it up into the sinuses or it can burn if sprayed too low in your nostrils.

In the spring, when pollen is in full swing, this nasal spray is crucial to my survival, as it isn't as harsh as some of the others on the market.

The only problem I have had with it is a nose bleed from time to time.  But it is worth it not having sinus infections all the time. 
Other	25-34 Female 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	2/8/2008 2:43:29 PM	I tend to suffer from sinus infections because something about the shape of my sinuses doesn't allow for proper drainage, thus the bacterial buildup &amp; resulting infection. This spray has gotten rid of an infection for me without the use of antibiotics! I don't use it daily, but when I feel like my allergies or sinuses are acting up I'll use it 2 or 3 times and usually it takes care of the problem. I know the literature says it doesn't work immediately, but I get quick results. Can't really talk about side effects because I don't use it daily. If you have allergies that cause sinus complications, give it a try!
