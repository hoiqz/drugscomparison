Pain	periwinkle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/26/2012 2:08:36 PM	The only issue I've ever had with Opana, is when they quit releasing it! My Dr., kept writing it, because his representative told him it was available! It took many  broken R.X.'s, return trip's to my Dr., &amp; ov erall, was a royal pain in my butt! Next time, the co., needs to do this, they need to make it clear to EVERYONE!!!

It IS like taking plastic. Thanks Junkies! It worked so much better before the change. Change it back please for the people who really NEED it!!!!!!

Pain	jjyeker, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	6/19/2012 8:51:14 PM	Since around the early 90's I have taken many pain meds and I suppose I have grown immune to most of the pain meds.  This seems to take more of my pain away and hopefully can have have a better life to share with my family.
Pain	Mangog, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	55-64	6/11/2012 1:18:30 PM	I have had and heard it all before so it was no surprise that the new Opana does not work well at all. Period. Way too slow to work and then by the end of the day with my last 30 mg. 3 x/day I am exhausted at work and feel like I have been given a strong sedative and I feel nauseated. My thought is that the pills are so damned slow release that the medicine builds up in my system and by the end of the day I am high but it is not a good high, I am ehausted, nauseated, and pissed off that this is what we patients have to suffer so all of t he doo-gooders in government and the medical industry can be assured that nobody is feeling good, high, euphoria, and we are all miserable and will consider living with the pain rather than the treatment. What a wonderful country America has become. I am now considering looking for another doctor to go back on Oxycodone or some other form of drug than Opana. I am also looking to purchase meds from other sources than the system of stupidity we have here in the USA. I hope all of the geniouses are happy now that the patients are sick and probably being poisoned from this new technology. I have never sued anyone in my life but if this one goes to a class action law suit, count me in.

My pharmacist told me they changed them so people can't crush them to snort or shoot up! I  wish they would go back to the old one's but I know they won't so now I have to wait almost a month without any pain medicine til I go back to the doctor (cause I have stopped taking them)to be put on something else because I can't stand being sick to my stomach &amp; throwing up. I hope they don't make all medicine's like opana er's or those of us that NEED pain medicine will be up a creek without a paddle!

Pain	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	5/12/2012 2:34:48 PM	I am a 45yo female who suffers from 8-10 pain disorders, I AM SO SICK OF EVERY DOCTOR I SEE, THINKING I WANT A QUICK FIX TO GET HIGH. That is not the case, I suffer from CHRONIC PAIN &amp; I HAVE BEEN A POSTER PERSON AT MY PHARMACY .Then I was referred to my pain management specialist.I love how he treats me(he don't want to adjust my meds) right now tho.I'm like most patients with CHRONIC PAIN, I have tried them all,&amp; I have received the best results from Opana er. it has brought some quality of life  back to me. I still feel like I need a med re-evaluation. I wish I could take the opanaIR for break through pain instead of percocet 10mg.I think that the different combinations is what causes the side effects.I am lucky I am on disability and have been for 17 years.So I have Medicare &amp;Medicaid,&amp; I only have a small co-payment for Medicare part D.(prescription coverage). FOR ANYONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE PRESCRIPTION COVERAGE THIS MIGHT HELP YOU GET YOUR MEDICATION. FIND OUT WHICH  COMPANY MAKES YOUR MEDICATION, CALL THEM AND ASK IF THEY HAVE AN INDIGENT CARE PROGRAM,That's a program for people that don't have any insurance or they have insurance but it doesn't cover YOUR medication. Or you can look it up on the internet, I just did a search for assistance for low-income families. That's where I found that information! Good Luck to you all,&amp; &quot;GOD BLESS&quot; may our lives be as pain free as possible, and our bodies strong enough to handle it,our minds able to process a pain free BODY,MIND,SOUL,SPIRIT &amp; LIFE STYLE CHANGE TO MANAGE &amp; COPE WITH OUR NEW FOUND FRIEND OPANA ER! HOWEVER I HATE THE NEW FORMULATION, I'M TAKING OPANA ER 30 mg. ER STANDS FOR EXTENDED RELEASE! WITH THE NEW FORMULATION IT'S LIKE DELAYED EXTENDED RELEASE. 
Pain	Girlsrule, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	4/27/2012 3:41:30 PM	I was given this med a cpl of days ago for chronic pain. In addition, I take 10mg/325 of Lortab. I took it twice and it didn't help at all either time. It made me nauseous..I felt horrible after the 2nd dose. I haven't taken it since. Have been on Lortab for years and just got the dose increased from 7.5mg..it works better than the Oprana, but i'm still in alot of pain that has kept me from enjoying life, and my brand new baby that is 3mos old now. I feel like i'm missing everything because I hurt all the time. I have a few more tests to go and pray that they find a treatment soon that will help.

Past six months OPANA ER was the most effective pain medication to date to help alleviate most of my chronic pain issues. However I just began taking the new crush resistent tabs 40m.g.x2per day for a week now. For whatever reason there has been almost no relief. terrible stomach aches. Im certain this new product has not dissovled in my stomach,noticed whole tab in my stool. I contacted manufacturer about. Did not recieve no good reason but was shocked when they told me this new product was not tested on humans. Im done with it . Shame on ENDO PHAM&gt;&gt;

Pain	Oldschool, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	3/16/2012 3:51:16 AM	I have been in chronic pain since 1990. Gone from vics to perks then doc moved me up in 2003 to oxycodone 30 mgs every 4 hrs w/ an 80 mg oxycontin in morning and one at night. Lost insurance so had to drop the 80's and am on morph sulf 100mgs now. My beef is that the gov has cracked downso hard its almost impossible to get my oxycodone filled each month without having to go to a hundred different stores to get them filled.Question is; is opana readily avaiable at most pharmacies and compared to the oxy 30,s is the 40 mg opana,s as strong? Another question is I pay about 65 cent per pill now. How much r the 40 mg opana oral? Lookin for some answers. One last thing to the women who,s husband is shooting his meds. If u love him tell him to stop.If he loves u ? He will. I hope he does!! Shout out to all my Homies and Hotties livin w/chronic pain. Dont give up cuz we,ll all be together after this game!

Before that I was on Hydrocodone 10/325, then Percocet 10/325.  I started going to a pain mngmt dr who switched me to the Opana.  I have been in so much pain since taking this medicine and going off the others.  There is absolutley no pain relief at all, I don't want to take this medication any longer as it doesn't make sense to take medicine that does not work.  I feel like I am just swallowing pills for no reason.  I am now seriously considering surgery at this point in time.  Opana is a horrible pain reliever, at least with my medical conditions.

When it was reformulated my doctor put me on Opana 20mg. I've had five back surgeries, two neck surgeries, and multiple other surgeries. I take six, five mg Percocets a day. The Opana 20 mg works to ease the pain, but it doesn't work as well as the Oxycontin did before they screwed with it. For the lady that claimed her husband is &quot;injecting&quot; it. People like him are the reason they change formulas and mess pain meds up for people that need them. He's abusing it. Call his doctor.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/25/2011 4:17:55 PM	I started taking Opana around July of 2010. In Feb. 2010 one day I had a cyatic nerve &amp; my body has gone down hill since then.  I have chronic daily pain in my right hip, pelvis &amp; greater trochanter (that's the side of the hip). They tried all of the &quot;easy&quot; pain meds from Feb - July (Oxycontin/Oxycodene - the same drug, different manufactures ; Vicoden ; etc.) they decided on the Opana, and it's been a Godsend.  I have a job where I sit down 8 -10 hours a day, so my pain has became worse, so my Dr. has added Opana ER &amp; I've been taking it at 6AM &amp; 6PM (Thanks to an alarm on my cell phone) &amp; it's been working well.  I would not be walking if it wasn't for Opana &amp; Opana ER.  I take these meds AS described. I live in chronic pain, I'm not looking for a &quot;high&quot; &amp; I don't take more than prescribed or any earlier than prescribed. And, yet the Opana ER IS daily, I (and you) must remember that the prescription for the Opana says &quot;AS NEEDED&quot;.  If you take it as it's prescribed, it will work wonders.

It interferes with different aspects of my life (not recreation, etc.), so I keep an alarm clock set to remind me, just in case I might forget. Other than that, it is easy to take w/water.

The part that is so ridiculous to the contract of pain management is you have to give a urine sample to show you are not selling are not taking it but ,what happens if the drug screws up your bladder so you can't always pee when they say to. so the doc  says pee are no pills. So then you have to go home get to go threw the wonderful thing called withdrawals. Thank you for letting talk. Any answers would be appreciated.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/17/2011 9:22:12 AM	I have had lower back pain for years, and it has steadily increased. Most doctors gave me tremadol, or other mild pain relievers, which did nothing. Now, I'm seeing a spine pain specialist who prescribed 10mg of Opana..I was amazed at how quickly it worked. I do feel a little loopy after taking it, but it that feeling does goes away after about an hour. The relief last almost all day. I am very pleased with this medicine and that such a low dosage works so well.

I also tried oxycodone for a few months which gave great pain relief, but had to discontinue that because of aggressive behavior (and because my wife said so).  Opana gives me almost as much relief as oxycodone without noticeable side-effects except for some drowsiness.

It does work very quickly - usually within 10 minutes but the one side effect made it utterly impossible to use.  It made me so constipated that I now have a case of hemorrhoids.  They are so bad that their pain rivals the original pain my back/belly.  I had to stop because life is now doubly unbearable.  I tried to work around the constipation with diet, water and stool softeners but it's not enough.  I just told my pain management doctor today that this cure is worse than the ill.

I am NEVER out of pain! Prior to this I took Roxicodone. Then I had microdiscectomy &amp; IDET done on L4/L5 &amp; L5/S1 &amp; ended up in severe/completely debilitating pain a week &amp; 1/2 later &amp; in the hospital for 2 wks. There, I was on Dilaudid IV and Fentanyl 100mg patch.  I was switched from the IV Dilaudid to Opana when I came home and kept the 100mg Fenanyl patch, still in a lot of pain.  A week &amp; 1/2 later the dr added Opana ER &amp; had me stop the patch due to no relief of pain. The side effects on Opana are HORRIBLE!!! Severe constipation, spontaneous sweating, groggy, insomnia, stomach bloated, 20lb weight gain, constant mild headache &amp; unable to focus.  Even if Opana worked for my pain, which it does NOT ~ the side effects are not worth it.  My pain is still at a 3 when laying down and it shoots to a 9 when I stand up from sitting, when I walk, etc.  I see a surgeon on 11/15/10 regarding disc bulge &amp; spinal stenosis at L1/L2.  In the meantime, I have a call into my pain management dr. I have decreased the use of Opana IR &amp; increased my Senekot and actually had a bm today!  I had to PUSH really hard, but at least I got something more than little marble sized pieces. I look forward to my dr's call &amp; stopping Opana completely!  I would not recommend this medication to anyone!  DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!

I was havingn to go to the ER twice a month or more for a 2mg shot of dilaudid to bring pain levels back down. My pain management doctor started me on 10mg Opana and it so far seems to do the trick for the breakthrough pain. I have Occipital Nueralgia and Severe Right Sciatic Nueropathy. I have had Many injections and ablations to prevent nerves from transmitting pain. That seemed to work on some nerves but not all of them. It costs 20,000 dollars per procedure and insurance doesn't like that to much. This medication seems to work much better then Vicodin and I don't have to go to the ER. I have been on all kinds of meds including Roxicodone, Percocet, Lorcet and so on...and have several allergies to NSAIDS and Demerol and even the new drug Nucynta. Opana hasn't given me any side effects at all so far. I like this medication much better than any other ones I have tried because it doesn't make me feel foggy or out of it. I can actually function on it and with children that range from 13 years old to 14 months functioning is extremely important! Good luck to all of you looking for something that works for you. Medications work differently for everyone so it is all trial and error to see what works best for you.

It controls my pain on a daily basis. The only time it doesn't work is when I have a flare up which happens about once every 3 months...during those times nothing works. I have chronic cyatica (too bad I can't spell it) on both sides. Pain from the back into the rear down the legs behind the knees all the way to my toes. On a day to day basis Opana ER &amp; IR works for me. Would like Opana IR in a 20 mg but I get by with 10. It doesn't increase my sleepiness as I also have narcolepsy...I sleep through like anyway. I am lucky to have excellent health &amp; prescription benefits, otherwise I would not be able to avoid this medication. Overall it works great and doesn't make me high.

Pain	stokem102, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	6/27/2010 10:35:50 PM	I have chronic pain in my lower back caused by a hirneated disk, pinched nerve and some other problems. I also suffer from pain in my left leg and foot due to a fracture that didn't heal right. I have had about 30 steroid shots so far in my lower back to relieve the pain and several in my left foot to ease the pain with no lasting pain relief. I have been on quite a few different pain medications, most with awful side effects. I am currently with the 5th pain doctor. I have been referred from 1 doctor to another when I wasn't getting any pain relief from what they were prescribing, pain meds, and different physical therapy. I am not looking for a high and I am not trying to get pain meds that have the &quot;high effect&quot;, I just want some relief from the pain. I was on opana 5 mg. 4x a day for a month with very little relief. This is my 2nd month on it but my doctor increased to 10 mg. 4x a day accompanied with 6 non-steroidal shots in the ligaments on both sides of my spine. The shot worked for 4 days and after taking opana 10 mg. I started having some of the side effects that others have experienced. I wasn't sure they were related to the opana until I read the reviews here on WebMd. I am sick to my stomach, jittery, loss of appetite (I have needed to lose weight but not this way), restless at night, sleepy during the day,funny taste of sodium all the time, and I am still in pain, but less severe. I'm not sure if the relief outweighs the side effects. I'm going to keep using it throughout the rest of the month and hope that the side effects ease up and the pain is brought down to a liveable level.

A total hip replacement would solve the problem but my age(30) disqualifies me as a candidate for the surgery.(So my local doctors tell me).  I was in a car crash about 8 years ago and had issues with my c-spine. The spine specialist gave me spinal injections of cortisone which contained steroids and those steroids caused my condition.  About 5 years ago I got my AVN diagnosis.  I am now seeing a very caring pain specialist who had the pain pump installed.  The meds in that are very strong but since my problem is in my hips and I can still walk I have lots of breakthrough pain.  This medication(Opana ER 10MG) is replacing my MS Contin 60MG.  It is working so far.  For those with severely debilitating pain I highly recommend the pain pump.  2 Biggest down sides to the pump are ER's are afraid to mess with you &amp; if MRI's are extremely necessary to your health then I don't recommend the pump.

However, I found that Opana 5Mg offer absolutely no pain relief to the main cause, lower back ( bulging disc, arthritis ,) nor for my knees ( tron cartilage, arthritis.) I actually felt like I was experiencing more pain..perhaps the idea of pain medicine was taken the wrong way, maybe this drug is intended to actually cause pain? :/I have an ample supply of Endocet, but, I feel that I need to take one and a half tablets in the evening to ease my pain.I only take the medicine once a day, but, I do not wish to start increasing the amount that I take. I prefer one tablet, with more effectiveness.

Both drugs should be reviewed seperate. As with any major change in pain I medications I did have some severe withdrawl issues. This drug is at 50% of oxy and to do it right you need to go in at even a lower dose them make 10mg adjustments. I went from 240 oxy a day to 80mg opana a day and had severe spasms in my intestines sick to my stomach and could not eat. After i got it built back up to 120 mg of opana( the equivalant) of oxy it all went away. So sometimes I think the reported side effects of this drug the first few weeks is more the side effects of cooming off the current medications and making the switch to Opana. I am not sure yet if it is better than oxy was for my pain control for full body rsd but I am going to give it 4 to 6 weeks of a constant dose before i decide.

It helps all of my pain I was taking 5 percocets a day before the Opana now I take 20 mg twice a day and percets for break thru. I have a lot of different pain but the worst is when I broke my heel at work a year ago.  I still have problems with it 2 screws have gone thru the bone and into the soft tissue.  I am walking on a bone spur and Opana.  Before I started taking the Opana I could not walk into store and buy milk without being almost in tears by the time I got out.  Now I can actually walk into a store and do all of my grocary shopping.  I still need the heel operated on again but the Opana has given me a summer and fall without being disabled to do anything.  I was in a cast for almost a year when I broke the heel.

Pain	lisakcoan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	8/15/2009 3:36:15 PM	I have RSD/CRPS and a slew of other medical problems and was taking 100mg of oxycontin 3x day and we decided to switch to Opana 30mg 2x day.  It has been doing fairly well controlling my pain though I have still been having to take my breakthrough medication fairly often.  I almost wish they would increase the dose on the Opana so that I wouldn't have to keep taking the breakthrough meds so often.  I think that this has been a good switch for me as the Oxycontin was not covering my pain as well as it should have.  I do have a staph infection and cellulitis right now so it may work even better when those are gone.  I do have additional pain from those infections right now and its not quite covering that added pain at this time.  But it is still better than the Oxycontin was doing!!  All in all I think a positive switch :)  Lisa

I am glad that I have read these all regarding this medicine so I know what I may expect but so far they are stopping the majority of my back and neck pain -- for now.

It seems I've become my own Dr. because I always do research on every drug ever prescribed to my family or friends and I'm right 9 out of 10 times about diagnosis before they are.   That's the truth I'm not bragging I'm scared because approximately 99% of Dr.s do not listen.  I mean who knows your body any better than you do, right?

At first it worked wonders, but then after the first year my tolerance grew very high, and I had to start taking more, and I have the hardest time waking up now. So, I'm trying to switch over to something more effective that will control the pain, but not make me a zombie.

Pain	stricklypresh, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/13/2009 4:32:50 AM	I have been using Opana 20mg twice a day and 10 mg 3-4 times a day as needed for break though pain.  I was placed on it last month after having been on fentanyl finally at end of 3 yrs on it with a 125 mcg patch chged every 48 hrs and 800 mcg lollipops used as needed for break through pain - I had an allergic reaction to it and had to be changed.  I went from that to 40mg oxycontin twice daily and 20 mcg oxycodone 3 times a day.  Worked well for 7 mos, then I had an allergic reaction to those and thus Opana.  Onl difficulties so far are some constipation and a lot of sleep, both I figure will pass with adjustment.  My pain is so severe from head to foot and so different for each area.  I neurothapy in both hands and feet.  They burn like as if I was in self combustion yet the surfaces are numb.  I've had carpal-tunnel surgery on both hands.  I have degenerative arthritis that has destroyed the facets in the small of my back leaving nerves exposed and severely damaged with damage continuing. I have 3 bulging discs in the cervical area with damaged facets also. T5 is damaged from the arthritis all of which cause great pain down my arms and across my shoulders and have absolutely throbbing shoulder blades. I fell in the shower in 2005 causing 2 compression fractures to L5 which have increased to 4 fractures due to arthritis plus 2 bulging discs at L4 and L3. S1-S3 have facet problems.  I also have fibromyalgia. I have had thermoplasty on L5. Radio Frequency  both left and right L5-S15 times just this last year and Epidurals - all to no avail.  Had RF 2 yrs ago that lasted 2.5 mos for which I still thank God for the relief.  No pain meds stop my pain and I cannot stand or walk without my walker with chair in it.  But I am so very thankful for all of the meds that have been available to help ease my pain.  I just pray I do not become allergic to Opana, also.  Pray for me/

Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	2/18/2009 9:32:24 PM	I had become dependent on a variety of different drugs including oxycodone and hydrocodone.  All I did was sleep too much, not want to go anywhere, and watch tv (especially when I had break through pain and sometimes took more for it).  I tried to stop taking pain medication but I was in so much pain that I could barely work.  I have been on Opana for about a week and a half now and feeling great.  The pain is liveable now, I am still active and able to complete my daily activities, and I don't find myself having as much breakthrough pain.  For me, this drug is working great and has saved my life!

Pain	Geocat-, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	1/6/2009 11:54:39 AM	I have DDD that has worsened over the last 4 years. I have tried multiple medications starting with lortab 10 then duragesic transdermal (50mcgs)(12 mcgs. I had good results with the duragesic but the efficacy eventually plateaued with minimal results. I eventually switched to Opana ER 40mgs and Opana 10 mgs IR(for breakthrough) and it has managed the pain very well. at first I was a little nauseated until I adjusted. It doesnt make me sleepy and I am able to function at work and as a mom. It has brought back the life of my former self before I started having problems. My problems started after I was slung around and landed in a bad position and soon after I had laproscopic surgery that was very close to my spine and I think nerves were damaged. MRI's show DDD as well as the discogram.

It has made me throw up,(which is horrible when you have a migraine), I have a bad taste in my mouth all the time since starting it, I have stomach pain, gas, diarrhea,and just an overall bad feeling. In short, Opana made my migraines worse. I would not recommend Opana for people who suffer from migraines!!

That's all long lasting. I used Opana rx for the last 4 months &amp; it helped the pain but the side effects made me too ill. Now I prefer the pain.  Read some of what happened to me in the last 2 months. Symps/moderate to severe: bowels, continuous urinary tract infections w/either no stoppage of emptying bladder or blockage, balance issues, nausea, panic attacks &amp; anxiety, breathing problems, high blood pessure, dry mouth, sweating, blurred vision, trouble sleeping &amp; loss of appetite. You ask why did I suffer so long? Well, becuz my current pain mgmt doctor refused to take me off. His answer to all this: (1) see a urologist (never been to one in my life) AND (2) I'm &quot;allergic to my husband&quot; &amp; &quot;he needs to be on antibiotics at the same time&quot; as I am. That was just two days ago. I called my pharmacist today and she told me to stop IMMEDIATELY &amp; I feel better already! If he sees me again it will be a picture. TAKE THIS MEDICINE IN THE CARE OF A DOCTOR THAT YOU TRUST WHO WILL MONITOR YOU CLOSELY. THE ONE I HAD CAME WITH GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM MY BACK SPECIALIST. HE WAS NOT COMPETENT &amp; I'M GOING TO REPORT HIM! THANK YOU WEBMD FOR YOUR INFO!

He had every side effect that was on Webmd.  He did not sleep at all, his mental status went haywire.  Where he felt like he just wanted to commit suicide.  The pain never want away.  He would get extremely moody, verbally violent, depression, blurred vision, decreased pupil size, blocked bowels,Hallucination,  Feeling Restless where he would just have to leave the house and drive then fall asleep on the side of the road with the car running and not remember how he got there,Loss of Appetite,  Abnormal Nervous System Function Affecting Mental Alertness, Confused, &amp; Slow Heartbeat.  I think that is too many for one medication.  This is the worse medication he has been on for the back pain that he is having.  I think a wheelchair is better than having you &amp; your family go through all of that.  DON'T TAKE THIS MEDICINE!!!

Opana to be superior to either IR.Opana has been around for 20 years as firstNumorphin or Oxymorphone. I just startedusing it, &amp; aside for minor side effectsit works when I am in Severe Pain. Peoplewho are in serious pain are not interestedin the High, but the Relief the drug gives.I agree, if its not working for you, your not taking enough. I Am a Therapist &amp; knowthere are no perfect drugs, but how we respond to them &amp; the effort we make tounderstand our Pain.

You are the first patient,other than myself, that found excellent pain control other than looking for a &quot;high!&quot; I only hope that others in our situation take heed and follow through with a positive attitude to control pain! CONGRATULATIONS! Sincerely, boss302kirk@yahoo.com.
Pain	jitterbug, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	2/5/2008 1:56:29 AM	I had trouble tolerating OpanaER and IR at first. After I had been on it about 2 weeks, the side effects went away. Then I realized how well it was managing my pain. The only thing I have had to work with is making sure I take it at specific times or I will start having withdraw symptoms. I can tell if I miss my scheduled dose by one to two hours. But, it works better than anything else I've taken (methadone, oxycontin, dilaudid and several others).I was in a car accident when I was 21yrs old. It ruptured a disc in my neck (between C5 and C6),so it had to be removed. It has been 23yrs ago and now I have two more discs that are bulging along with facet joint problems. This medicine has allowed me to do so much more with my family without being miserable. I HIGHLY recommend OpanaER and IR for breakthrough pain.

My input will not be well-liked by most patients. From what I've read with exception of the rare kidney disorder, these so-called patients are looking for a &quot;high&quot;. I have spent 35 years dealing with pancreatitis{chronic-relapsing} to be exact. Also known as &quot;auto-digestion&quot; for those of you not in the business of pain control. I'm 51 yrs. old and if, I say if, I get high on my meds...boy to have that old feeling back. But it's not going to happen. Pain control is all I have. My method of using opana works for me. People, I've tried thm all in my search for the pain-free day, and opana gives me a leg up on it. My response to the gentleman who likes 8mg dilaudid, he's looking for a quick high,being dilaudid is an immediate release drug. 10mg of IR opana would make 8mg of dilaudid seem just ok. I was on exactly that before opana. Opana wins,hands down in the pain control area. Try living in the pain control world, instead of the &quot;get high&quot; world. Your life would be better. I wish you all well and God Bless.

My pain doctor prescribed Opana 10mg for breakyhrough pain. Efficacy is poor with both short and long acting medications.
