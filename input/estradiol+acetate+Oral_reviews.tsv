Other	Happy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	8/30/2012 8:37:02 PM	I had taken another estrogen for several years and did not have a problem with it.  My doctor decided to take me off it and I began having hotflashes and sweats and problem sleeping.  She decided to put me on estradiol .5mg and I did stop with the sweats, etc., but do not feel nearly as good as I did when I was taking the other estrogin.

Severe vaginal irritation, abdominal pain and nausea.  Although costly, I am going back to Premarin.

I have both and am being treated for both with Meds. It Obviously is false information..

I had been sweating so much, that I had to carry a towel around with me, and was dehydrated no matter how much water I drank every day.  I was absoulutely miserable.  It took about a month of taking the Estradiol before I started feeling some relief.  It's now going on 3 months and I feel great.  The hotflashes are now mild and very few.  Before I was having hotflashes all day and all night.  I am only experiencing hotflashes at nighttime now.  The sweating is gone and I am sleeping better.  My life has improved greatly. I feel balanced and happy again.

So changed to Estradiol and although this stopped the hot flashes and bleeding it gave me really bad headache's. So now have just changed to Premphase - lets see it this works!!

So far so good ..although my blood sugar and blood pressure is rising.

I switched back to this just recently so we will see what happens I guess.

I've tried the Permarin/Prempro combo but had to deal with the return of periods/pain/spotting twice a month. Although some insomnia &amp; night sweats still occur, I'd rather say NO to the period/pain.

I am not awakened at night by hot flashes anymore.  I was wondering if my weight gain is due to this drug.
