Other	Lindsay, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/16/2012 8:07:12 PM	I recently had neck surgery and had an alergic reaction to Mastisol, used to secure steri-strips:  red, swollen incision site, weeping yellow liquid from blisters, intense itching.  I've had similar reactions when Benzoin was used as an adhesive under steri-strips so was advised not to come in contact with that after patch tests determined I was allergic to colophony and balsom of peru.  As it turns out, I can't come in contact with any adhesives.  I used Benedryl to help with the itching and warm wash cloths to aid the discomfort.  This problem cleared up after about a week; am hoping for no long-lasting scarring.
Other	mv2h, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	1/4/2012 8:55:41 PM	I had surgery because of appendicitis and after the doctors had closed my stitches they put Mastisol on the wound to glue the steri-stips. Everything seemed normal. I took a shower the next morning and that night I started noticing small red dots around my insition, but I attributed that to the surgery. The next morning, however, the few red dots on my stomach became dollar-sized-circles around my 3 insitions and they were swollen and EXTREMELY itchy. There were also blisters that where discharging a clear yellow liquid. I went to the ER and they told me that it was an allergic reaction to the Mastisol, and one of the head surgeons said that in his 40 years of practice, he had never seen such a extreme allergic reaction to Mastisol. They had to scrub the glue off my skin which felt like they where burning my skin. If you have sensitive skin or get a rash from bandaids easily, I would ask the doctors to NOT use Mastisol if at all possible. 
Other	rtphoumy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/26/2011 7:08:02 PM	I recently had bunion surgery-Lapidus Bunionectomy on my right foot in July of 2011. Upon removing my cast which I wore for 6 weeks, my Podiatrist noticed a small area of my incision was not completely healed so he put Mastisol to adhere with the Steri-Strips which two days later caused a bad allergic reaction to my foot. It was blistery, swollen, dark and with a lot of yellowish puss.  The itch, pain and burning sensation was unbearable! I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product!  I tried alcohol rub, Neosporin, Bactine spray, Cortisone cream, and Cortisone ointment which did not work for me.  My Primary Doctor prescribed Prednisone pills which cured my bad reaction in three days! STAY AWAY FROM MASTISOL!!!
Other	lam, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/25/2011 4:31:52 PM	I had a horrible reaction to this glue. It was used around my face, then my doctor tested to see if I was alergic by putting a little bit on my abdomen.  I had to use steroid drops, then oral steroids, then steroid cream to get rid of the large, bright red, raised, inflamed, bumpy, horribly painful and itchy rash.  I am not usually allergic to anything. This really complicated my surgery and caused me much discomfort and a much longer recovery. Someone should report this to the FDA.  I still have the rash on my abdomen. From one small swab of masticol I got a palm sized rash that is resistant to going away. It actually hurts when my shower water touches it.
Other	Amanda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/26/2011 10:20:01 PM	I had surgery on my wrist recently.  I was told to leave the bandage on for 16 days, which I did even though it was driving me nuts itching and burning.  Upon removal, my wrist had a large rectangle shaped red-blistered patch.  My Dr said, &quot;I've never seen anything like that.&quot;  He said, &quot;that is the shape of exactly where we would put the mastisol.  I was sent home and told to come back in a week if it wasn't better.  I bought topical benedryl and I'm hoping that will help.  Now I'm wondering if the fact that I had the mastisol stuck to my skin for so many days will cause any permanent issues.
Other	dlumpy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/19/2010 3:22:51 AM	I recently had my gallbladder removed and they used steri-strips and Mastisol to close the incisions.  Three days after the surgery I began to break out in a horrible contact dermatitis rash.  The doctor said it was probably from the Mastisol since steri-strips had never bothered me before.  Up until now I have never had any allergies to adhesives.  It was just like really bad posion oak/ivy reaction.  I had to get a steriod shot and take a steriod dose pack for a week to clear it up.
Other	Delma, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	6/9/2010 7:36:10 PM	Mastisol caused horrible blistering on my back after a back surgery, then after a back fusion.  The pain was unbearable.  It took several weeks to recover from the blistering.
Other	Dorothy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/14/2010 5:57:45 PM	I had a severe skin reaction with horrible itching, weeping &amp; blistering of my skin after back surgery &amp; again after a c-section. They didn't know what caused it but said something they used in surgery. Then I had my gallbladder out &amp; it happened again. It was fine when the staples were in but once they applied the mastisol &amp; steristrips, the contact dermatitis started again. I had to go on prednisone because it was so bad &amp; my stomach area looked almost like a burn. The itching &amp; crawling feeling &amp; stinging &amp; burning made me almost crazy! It lasted for a few weeks &amp; Dr told me to never let them use mastisol again.   
Other	SObrien, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	2/1/2010 10:16:45 AM	Two different surguries the doctors office used this Mastisol.  I had severe long lasting internal and external reaction to this glue.  The doctors etc. didn't seem to think it could be the Mastisol until the second time it happened.  I suffered a great deal and was only offered a topical (Topicort) medication to ease the pain.  It felt like Acid was being poured on my skin for a week.  I had a tight throat, itching in ears, scalp, hands, feet and of course the wound site not to mention 4 inches around the site.  Blisters were oozing. NP took pictures of the reaction.  They kept saying it was only a &quot;reaction&quot; to the glue. I have trouble with bandaids as well.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/3/2009 2:27:58 PM	I had hernia surgery and the doctor used Mastisol to adhere the steri-strips to close the incision.  By day three I had developed a severe reaction to the Mastisol.  The area where it had been applied to my skin had developed huge blisters, itched and was extremely painful.    It should be noted to other patients that experience this type of reaction, the adhesive does not come off with plain soap and water.  It must be removed with a solvent.   If not removed, the adhesive will continue to burn the skin and produce blisters
Other	virg, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/8/2009 4:10:49 PM	I had bunion surgery. My doctor used Mastisol to secure the steri strips. After less than 3 days after the surgery I had a major allergic reaction to it. I developed huge blisters the entire length of the incision and the surrounding skin where the Mastisol was applied. I have never had a reaction to any adhesives before.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	8/24/2009 10:42:16 AM	My husband has Sesary Syndrome. No bandages,or bandaides etc would stick to his skin. This is the only product that works for him. He has not experienced any side effects, although that could be because of the oddness of his skin due to the condition he has.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/4/2008 1:20:03 PM	My husband has steri strips secured with Mastisol after 2 different back surgeries.  On both occassions, 2 days after the surgery he had a major allergic reaction to it.  He developed blisters the entire length of his incision.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	10/15/2008 2:52:01 PM	Mastisol glue was used to secure steri strips following hernia surgery.  I developed a severe case of contact dermatitis on the 8th day.  I developed severe itching, rash, and blisters.  I was treated with a synthetic corticosteriod to ease the reaction.
