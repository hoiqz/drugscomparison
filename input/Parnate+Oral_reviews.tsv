Parnate was administered s mono-therpy and was titrated to 60 mg daily in three divided dose. Although compliant with the MAOi restricted diet, spontanous and transient episodes of hypertension presented within about an hour of drug administration and patient would return to normotensive within two to three hours. Although none of the spontaneous episdoes fit the criteria for it havig been classificed as a hypertensive crisis, the patient nevertheless experienced uncomfortable somatic symptoms such as sweating, feeling fluah, heart palpations, nausea, nervousness, and anxiety. Although these symptoms were disturbing, there did not seem to be any long-term consequences in these limited episodes.
Major Depressive Disorder	Batchain2001, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	4/12/2012 1:28:29 PM	Long history with psychiatric medication, most backfired and achieved the opposite of the effect they were intended for. Finally, in 1980, with immense fear I swallowed one tab of Nardil (Phenelzine Sulfate), waited for all hell to break loose, it didn't and very subtly I lost my chronic anxiety and, once I was up to 6 15 mg. tabs I was experiencing no anxiety or &quot;panic&quot; at all. Apart from the food/OTC med. restrictions I detested the weight gain and had *heard* that Parnate (Tranylcypromine Sulfate) had much less of a weight-gaining affect. Despite my PDoc's reluctance to &quot;temporarily destabilize you&quot; I argued him into switching me to Parnate. It was no smooth transition and he was very conservative about changing meds so I began the Parnate a week before he advised because I was really on the skids with a major depressive episode. Luckily, Parnate has a fast onset of action (unfortunately for some there's a 24 to 48 hour rise in anxiety, sometimes requiring a brief co-administration of a benzodiazepine) and I was back to where I was on the Nardil. It is a high dose I take -- 7 10 mg. tabs daily -- but all such drugs have to be &quot;fine-tuned&quot; to the individual so that it's neither too much nor too little because it does vary, sometimes widely, and it's sad to see a PDoc prescribe by a generality when even an added tablet split in half can mean the difference between efficacy and inefficacy.Not incidentally, my hoped-for weight loss was only 5 lbs, far from what I'd wished for -- unlike that of a woman I'd met who'd lost over 50 lbs making the same MAOI switchover(My guess is that she was somehow atypical). But at least I can live in my own body.
Depression	westiemom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	3/16/2012 10:24:49 AM	I have taken Parnate for 27 years. I went off it 20 years ago because I had a severe hypertensive crisis that nearly killed me. I tried 15 other medications but nothing worked for more than a few months to relieve my symptoms of chronic depression. I have had 3 interactions with food all from eating in restaurants. The latest was this week. I ordered a ham &amp; onion omelette with toast. I assumed it was a safe choice but they must have had parmesan cheese or something on the same chopping block as the onion because I've never had problems with ham. I can eat cream cheese or non-aged cheddar cheese but that's it. the symptoms started right after eating. I was sweating and my vision started ti blur. I had to get outside for air. My neck started throbbing &amp; I had to pull my car over. The back of my head was throbbing &amp; I had to cover my eyes from the light. My friend called her husband but by the time he got there I was screaming in agony (we should have called an ambulance). I lost the feeling in my hands &amp; feet &amp; by the time I got to the ER I felt like the back of my head had been shot off. They didn't do anything except monitor my blood pressure which was very high. I guess there wasn't too much tyramine in the meal because my b.p. started to fall after a couple of hours. They gave me a sedative &amp; sent me home. Two days later I've still got a massive headache &amp; am nauseous. I know it's scary but I rarely eat i restaurants and the potentially fatal reaction is not enough to not use Parnate. Without it I lie in bed &amp; cannot work or even look after myself. i guess it will be a while before I eat in a restaurant again.

The 2 times before (using Parnate) I felt a big change by the 4th or 5th days.  Just want to know if I'm the only one who felt a much better after a few days using Parnate ?  Now tomorrow is my 5th days on Parnate and I really hope that I will feel a little something better because it is really hard for me now.

No other med has been this effective for this long. The diet is a challenge, but doable. I have not had mania, but it is a side effect in person's with bipolar. Nardil (another MAOI) was more effective, but it's effectiveness didn't last. For me this is a last resort and am grateful something works. Many drug interactions makes treatment for other concerns a challenge but there are ways.

Major Depressive Disorder	eullipious, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	1/22/2011 4:53:26 AM	My depressive illness began when I was a child and can be traced from both inherited factors and early learning experience. At the time of major depressive episodes psychiatrists and doctors prescribed Trycyclic and, later SSRI antidepressants with little success. It was only in my mid thirties that Parnate was prescribed as an alternative to ECT while I was being treated in hospital for major depressive disorder. Apart from a headache that lasted for about 6 hours together with a slight rise in blood pressure on the first day [I was being monitored in case of hypertensive crisis] I had no ill effects. Day two the headaches had gone and day four I felt elated, a little hyper. Not an unpleasant feeling after years of depression and fatig. By day five all my depressive symptoms had gone and from staying in bed all day I became able to travel from the south coast to London feeling excited to be back on old home ground. Parnate really pulled me out of despair. I have not been affected by the dietary restrictions which do not affect all people but are listed for safety's sake to cover every eventuality. Over a period of twenty years I have found that I can eat more or less normally or that I naturally don't eat certain foodstuffs nor drink alcohol.After a period of remission I ceased Parnate for about three years but then suffered a massive depressive collapse. My GP, new to my case as I had moved would not prescribe Parnate as he 'had never prescribed it before and was afraid of prescribing a drug 'I have no experience with'. SSRIs made me paranoid and suicidal. I complained to my PCT stating that my notes showed I had safely taken the drug before and that my GP was causing suffering withholding it. He then had a partner in the practice prescribe it and I was soon recovered but I had experienced the prejudice against this 'old' drug. Apart from some short term memory loss [which may be due to benzodiazepines] I have had only had good effects from Parnate.
Major Depressive Disorder	missbike, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/16/2010 4:21:18 PM	  There is a ridiculous amount of untrue information propagated about this drug: even on WebMD there is old disproven speculation published. Parnate, and its cousin Nardil are the only drugs that will bring about true remission from intractable depression. The voodoo diet mythe have been scientificly researched in the last fiftenn years and found to mostly be single incident reports of dubious origin. The MAOI Diet is very simple now; I've taken these drugs for years and eat all the chocolate and caffeine I want. Very stinky aged cheeses are still off bounds along with certain types of beer and one or two other things but I'll give up blue cheese to be well any time!  These drugs are absolute miracles to us who need them; Parnate is the superior in that Nardil turns every thing you eat into sugar in the liver's metabolic pathways- weight gain-a-rama! Nardil is also a soft edged rosy ride that's easier to take coming out of the Black Pit so it's tossed about with out much thought. But morbid obesity is a worse effect than giving up blue cheese...  Parnate is the real wonder drug! US doctors are drilled in the 1960's nonsense about it but I've been off and on it for years- doctors will force me off it, ruined my newly built career in the process. But get the new information and it's not the evil drug you hear about.  Starting it is rough; it rewires your brain to a healthier matrix in eight weeks, during which you will not want caffeine and it can be tough. Well, or close to well is a strange place after years of illness! I use 60 mg of nortriptyline with it to soften sharp edged reality. A brain illness needs some coddling still. But this drug has me living my life instead of warehoused on inappropriate anti psychotics. It also vamoosed my social phobia/ agoraphobia issues and I've ditched the weight from Bad Drugs that didn't work but warp ones metabolism.  I highly recommend this drug. I'm actually happy, like other people are!

It is the only medication that has helped me. Some would work for awhile then stop. I'm on 40mg. a day, I take it all in the A.M. and I do have to have Parnate as the generic did not work for me.Also, I eat almost anything I want and have never had a problem.  I read that the food restrictions have been relaxed a it. I even drink pasteurized beer once in a while. My PSY. Doc. said that was the only kind I could drink, no Micro-Brewery beer. Now I'm not recommending other people should do this, I just know what goes on within my own body. I am also on 600mg. of Lithium which I will be weaned off from after the holidays are over. Too many side effects.

Depression	Adam, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	11/12/2010 3:40:06 PM	This drug usually does not work except for only on very small subset of patients with atypical depression. it has very poor action, many difficult side effects and does not have a consistent daily action. it is one of the most unpredictable drugs and you will never know what will happen tomorrow effect wise. There are no recent studies because it does not worth it. it just like very dirty drug that might work by randomly activating different areas in the brain. I would give it 0 out of 10 in general. the newer agents in my experience are at least has some evidence. I understand some one may scarify his life style and food for some help but this is not the case with this drug, you have to scarify both. it was a big lie I wish I have not wasted my time on it. please note that the onset of action is very slow usually &gt;3-5 weeks.

I had to beg a psychiatrist to try and MAOI because the tricyclics and other things were miserable partial solutions at best. Nardil was very good and my opportunity to experience life virtually symptom from much of the time. The formulation was changed and it no longer worked. I changed to Parnate. I loved Parnate -- total relief, but it took 120mg/day to kick in. Got a zippy little euphoric boost for about 2 hours after each dose and the darned stuff seemed to make me smarter over over the - no kidding.I'm I scientist and for some reason chronic use of this stuff seems to be enhancing my recall and work quality. Love it and take with 1200 mg Li as a stabilizer. Seems to compliment. Keep trying with and without. Works better with. Virtually symptom free. Hypertensive sensitive real bummer with high dose Parnate. I have electric PB cuff in Manbag, one on sailing yacht, 2 at home, 1 in car, all with Nifedipine in kid. One MUST be ready at all times 7x24. If on high dose Parnate, sometime one eats at restaurant and just BANG, not aware what went into the fish pie. But I can detect start of reaction long before any serious increase and get first. So even out far offshore sailing, or anywhere, I can manage it, but it take some extra care. For total symptom free life where you can't even remember what symptoms are like, it is a small price to pay. Based on more reasons than I have time to write about, I'm guessing most people who fail response simply take to little. On standard doses, Parnate does NOTHING for me. Once I got over about 110mg/day, some sun came came in, and then another 120mg and light came shining down. Then I gained some weight and found I needed up and restored it. It was very body weight sensitive, so it needs to be adjusted to a mg/kg ratio. This should not be a surprise to anyone with a technical background.

My psychiatrist then put me on Parnate taking 4 10mgs a day.  Yes, there are some reactions and yes, the food laws are complicated and sometimes difficult.  But the drug has been a miracle drug.  It has helped me immensely.  For me, it is an &quot;end of the road&quot;drug.It is the only one that has worked.  A major side effect that I have recently learned of is my inability to take general anesthesia.  This has created a major problem for me, but I will not give up the drug.  The food restrictions cause you to look at the right foods more creatively and good weight loss will occur.I see my doctor once a week and my depression,while it hasn't gone away, is now under control.Rather, the drug enables me to have better control.  It has been a miracle drug.
Depression	N J, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	65-74	7/26/2010 3:40:51 PM	Parnate is for my Bi-polar condition.My Psychiatrist tried 12 other antidepressants which, not only did not helpthe side effects were traumatic! Parnate worked for me within days. I have been taking Parnate {10 milligrams 2 daily) I am 69yrs old &amp; have been taking this drug for app. 17yrs. My Bi-polar symptoms started when I was having menopause symptoms. The few time that I discontinued Parnate, I would have extreme highs &amp; lows for months at a time!Parnate is a challenge to take because it has major food problems. There are many foods that restrictions; some include certain meats, all cheese products,some fruits &amp; vegies (ones which contain tourmaline. I am a vegetarian, which does help. However favorite foods like cheese,avocados,anything pickled, very limited amounts of caffeine products. cheese is hard to not eat! love pizza,cheese sandwiches,eating out is complicated. Most salads include cheese &amp;/or cheese dressings, yogurt can be touchyas is dark green vegies. Eating any of these can cause a stroke or death. You have to be VERY CAREFUL! you CAN'T CHEAT! A food or medication that does not interact totally shuts your body down(at least mine) I feel completely disorientate &amp; just have to take a sleeping pill &amp; hope that I'm not having a stroke! Now I am very, very careful. Even Doctors prescribe meds for some other problem, sometimes even after I remind them. Luckily most pharmacy's will catch it. I would not recommend this, unless you have tried at 6-8 other medications.You will probably have to make dosage adjustments, &amp; severe health or personal problems can make it ineffective!

This is just like speed but you have to be on this ridiculous diet that made it almost impossible to eat out. My mind was racing; I was talking rapidly, my body felt weird, no coordination, dizzy, hard time walking, passed out if I stood up too quick, high blood pressure when lying down and more. I feel like I have never recovered from this drug after being off it for ahwile. This was a horrible experience.
Depression	JohnMly, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	35-44	2/9/2010 8:53:58 AM	I've had moderate to severe depression since my early 20's. The SSRI's were not very effective - lots of side effects that made life unenjoyable- though I know they are very effective for others. This turned out to be a &quot;miracle&quot; drug. I took it at the height of one of my depressions and one or two days later felt significantly better. At small dosages I did not feel any side effects. At my current large dosage (60 mg)I've felt several. I have insomnia and (perhaps) have bouts of high blood pressure when drinking lots of coffee - I can't tell. Eating foods that aren't fresh causes high blood pressure and a throbbing headache.  I can't tell how frequently the high blood pressure occurs on a general basis. I also don't know if my memory problems are due to it or benzodiazipines that I recently quit after long-term use- I strongly suspect the latter.  I obviously suggest staying at a small dose.

I tried to quit it and get on Paxil but, the side effects of paxil on me was just too much to take and I did a slow taper off of parnate too. It does'nt work too good on me, but it still does help some.

After trying many different (types of) drugs over the years, I was put onto parnate. I really expected it to work, as it was the last-resort. I have had ECT and even that didn't work. I didn't mind the diet etc, even though I did have to go to ER once with one of those famous parnate headaches. However, I have just come off parnate as it is just not working for me. While it may be a great drug for others, it has not been for me. I keep wondering, &quot;now what?&quot;.Anyone else have this experience? How are you doing now/

Does seem to affect memory and the &quot;foods to avoid&quot; list is pretty long and makes food choices difficult when eating out.  As long as it keeps the depression away, I can live with the side effects and no pizza!!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	3/21/2009 1:08:42 PM	I was on Parnate several years ago and it worked wonders on my depression but the side effects were too intense.  This time around, I didn't have the side effects, but I haven't had the relief from my depression either.
Depression	forgot, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	45-54	2/13/2009 11:53:02 PM	Similar as the previous posts, Parnate is the only anti-depressant that has worked.  I've had a few hyper-tensive crises, mostly from food that is past its edible date rather than because it was on the list, with the most severe from a 'new' package of spoiling ham.However, my concern is that after taking it for around 20 years, I am experiencing short-term memory loss and difficulty concentrating.Has anyone else experienced this after long-term use?Thanks.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	1/20/2009 6:21:05 PM	i have been depressed since age 16-am now 49. since the 1980s started talk therapy, while completing college and working as a cardiac nurse-i was active and useful despite my moods, but by 1996, in my late 30s, i began to be hopitalized in psych units and hospitals-lost count, can you believe, but it was at least ten times, each worse than the last. my depression has always had a strong anxiety component which became more and more distressing as i got older. i was placed on a long list of antidepressants, none of which worked-benzodiazepines for anxiety, also many kinds-didn't help-was briefly treated for bipolar and those meds did nothing except make me fat. meanwhile, i continued talk therapy, went to 12 steps, church, outpatient programs, groups-nothing worked. by 2001 the anxiety had become crippling, with panic attacks-i went from nursing to less challenging jobs but could barely do even those-was in fear, racing thoughts, obssessive thoughts-one doc tried an ocd med with no effect. in 2001 a psychiatreist tried parnate-i started it on a friday, by monday all of my depressive, anxious symptoms were gone and as of jan. 2009 have not come back-no kidding, it was a breathtaking miracle. i've been through many life experiences on parnate, even had a hypertensive crisis once caused by carelessness, which i treated at home with no ill effects. i just have to avoid aged cheeses, take it easy with soy sauce, and be careful with other meds-small price to pay. i don't drink so no worries there. no side effects except maybe a slight decrease in appetite-nice since most other meds made me fat. on 50 mg/day. can't say enough good about this med-i am now a normal person mentally. very nice to have a 3-day onset, as opposed to five weeks for ssris.

Depression	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	10/8/2008 7:30:47 PM	My dr. started me at 30mgs and I was really dizzy and slept a lot.  We backed the dose off to 10mg a day and slowly built up and now I am up to 50mg with virtually no side effects.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	6/9/2008 1:33:45 PM	Started on 10mg for 3 day then increased to 20mg per doctor. On the 6th day I experienced severe dizziness to the point of passing out every time I tried to sit up or get up with severe head/neck pain. My chest hurt, shortness of breath and heart beating hard. Scared me to death, stopped it immediately but took me 3 days to be able to get out of the bed. Worst experience I've had on any antidepressant.
Depression	rose5, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/23/2008 11:42:04 PM	Several therapies were tried to alleviate my major depressive disorder.  Some worked for a short time then I would crash again.  My pdoc was very patient and continued to try to find the right combo that would allow me to rejoin the land of the living.  Finally he asked if I had heard of MAOIs.  Of course I had and I knew there were foods I couldn't eat while taking it.  &quot;And...?&quot; was his response.  Got the point.  Said sign me up.  And for the first time in years I feel like &quot;me&quot; again.  It's not perfect.  It's not a cure.  But at least I can finally enjoy life!  
Depression	C.W., 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	5/17/2008 10:20:56 PM	I was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe depression with anxiety disorder since 1991, yet I know I had the depression a lot earlier than that.  I have been to 2 previous psychiatrists who prescribed Prozac, Paxil, Pamelor,Trazedone, Wellbutrin, Effexor, Seroquel, Xanax, Lamictal,Anafranil, and Lithium.  All these prescribed over a 15 year period. Nothing was helpful for me.  In fact, I developed more complications.  I changed psychiatrist and he put me on Parnate.  I have been on it since January 2006.  It has been a miracle medicine for me.  I am now able to be around people more easily, work and function, and be more spontaneous in enjoying life.  I am so thankful for this older medicine, since the &quot;tried and true&quot; things still work very well.  Once you learn the food and medicine precautions with Parnate, taking Parnate daily just becomes part of who and what you do every day.  I am thankful for this MAOI, which is still working at the same dosage level I found effective for me since 2006!  It is not perfect, but it is better than the so-called modern antidepressants, afterall I had tried most of the &quot;newer&quot; medicines.
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Male	25-34	4/30/2008 6:30:18 PM	Had major side effects.  Started on the largest dose, but quickly had to be moved to the smallest dose.  The side effects including complete lack of sleep, trouble urinating, and loss of the control of the eyes (blurred vision).Was pulled off of the medication immediately and switched to the patch with no side effects.
Depression	RAByrd, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Male	45-54	3/17/2008 2:17:37 PM	I had tried numerous other drugs for depression and had too many anxiety side effects.  Finally, something that would help me and let me function.  I know that this is an old drug, but it worked for me.  I also know that the new drugs are the ones that doctors use and say not to use the MAOI;s but that's the only thing that has helped me and saved my life.  I was so deep in depression and anxiety.  No other Dr. or drugs could help me.
Depression	55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	1/18/2008 9:08:58 PM	new generic has caused severe reactions. Feel sick, light headed, waves of strange feeling through body. Depression returned. Switchint to a different MAOI due to this. Generic parnate is dangerous
Depression	Whiskerscat, 45-54 Female 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/17/2008 12:02:01 AM	Being on Parnate since 1989 I don't have any problem with watching the foods I eat.  Since it is the only medication that will work for me, I will continue to take it.  It's just a shame that more medical professionals aren't up to date on MAOI's.  Not even the most current meds of the 2000's have worked in my case.
Other	olivia grace, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/17/2007 4:46:48 PM	Although the food restrictions are a little aggravating; the results I receive from Parnate are well worth the aggravation.  I have bi-polar and my doctor and I have had a difficult time with medications that is effective without the effectiveness wearing off within a matter of 1-6 months.  I have been been taking Parnate over 5 months with no evidence that is beginng not to work.  This is a miracle.  I was diagnosed with bi-polar 12 years ago with many hospitalizations and frequent doctor visits.  I haven't been to the hospital since I began Parnate and my doctor visits have been radically reduced.  My doctor told me that I am better than he has ever seen me.  Praise the Lord that I have a doctor that has stuck with me and is not afraid to try medications that are not typically for bi-polar.
