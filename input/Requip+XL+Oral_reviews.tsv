I couldn't sleep, I had 10 projects going on at the same time, not finishing any. I was compulsive about everything, well except sex, I think that's just wishful thinking on a man's part. It took my doc over a year to figure out what was wrong. I would NOT recommend this drug to anyone!!! Danger Will Robinson!!

Parkinson's Disease	xrmygal, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		5/25/2012 3:26:04 PM	I take this drug 2 times daily with great benefit. I caution users to not accept Ropinirole as a replacement, generic, drug. My pharmacy did change on the direction of my Rx Plan and all benefits slowly seeped away and I experienced side effects serious enough to require hospitalization. The neurologist is adamant that Requip XL has no generic replacement; it is a slow releasing action drug so symptoms are kept at a somewhat normal level. Ropinirole is a 1 time release giving the body the full dose at once, like a jolt, and if conditions are in place, the side effects are intolerable is some patients

I would caution everyone to try this medication only as last resort.  The severe side effects after second pill made me hurt so bad that I considered suicide to relieve my misery.  I met a woman who was hospitalized with symptoms after 1dose.  BAD drug!
Parkinson's Disease		5	5	5			1/21/2012 7:46:38 AM	I struggled with nausea for years using requip.  My doctor tried the XL time release and suddenly I got my life back.  I had no nausea.  My balance and tremor improved.  I was able to knit again.  I can not say enough how this time released medicine has improved my life.
Parkinson's Disease	Sara, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	1/14/2012 12:18:22 PM	I am taking 12mg of Requip XL daily. During the day I seem to function well, but this drug's effectiveness seems to fizzle by early evening. I do experience the feeling of being car sick most of the day. By 6:00 pm my RLS is very painful. The only relief I get is getting in the hot tub.

My dosage is 36mg/day which is necessary to continue my daily 18 holes of golf here in Florida.  Side effects have been minimal, although would like to increase my dosage even higher..highly recommend RequipXL. tc
Other	flavio, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	10/11/2011 12:55:02 PM	I used requip for RLS increasing my doasages over about 6 years. I went to Mirapex ER when I started getting it in my upper body/torso/arms. I had poor experiance/side effects so after 6 months I went to Requip XL. 3 days later I was doing well, I have been on it for 4 months. I double up on days when I can feel it comming on. I do drink with it because among other things it does let me sleep through the night. No drinking and I am awake every rem cycle for at least 30 minutes. Just being honest I am sure others are out there and would not post it here. It's what works for me.

It has stopped the agonizing 'electrical shocks' that would go through my legs before I started taking it.  It is very pricey, but my physician wrote a letter to the drug company so I get it with my copay.  I have difficulty remembering to take it at bedtime.  When I forget, I can immediately tell the next day as the dull ache (deep bone pain, I like to call it) returns immediately.  Usually, If I forget to take it, I start feeling slight electrical discomfort which is a great reminder.  It has been important to me that I take it at the same time every evening at bedtime.  It has made such a change in my life.  I was taking Requip several times a day prior to Requip XL and still had horrible leg pain most of the time.

Parkinson's Disease	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	4/7/2011 5:50:22 PM	I have been taking Requip XL since 12/2008.  I tolerate it very well, but my dose keeps increasing.I'm now taking 12mg per day, but I still move very slowly and am stiff in my neck on the right side and in my right arm and hand.  I found out accidentally that Cipro interacts in a positive way for me with Requip XL.  When I took both drugs, I wasn't slow or stiff. Seems they could take the part of Cipro that caused this effect and improve Requip XL.
Parkinson's Disease	wrfig, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	3/13/2011 5:03:16 PM	I have been taking this for 6 wks. &amp; my tremor is greatly improved, but the insomnia is worse. I'm not sure if it is worth the added expense, but will give it more time. Also, I am noticing difficulty focusing my vision--possibly due to sleep deprivation. 
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/17/2011 8:15:49 PM	I have been on Requip for Restless Leg Syndrome for over 12 years, and on the Extended Release formula (4 mg in the morning) for about 2 years. It has been a lifesaver, as my RLS is very severe, and has been getting worse and worse over time. I have very few side effects from it, but if I forget to take it, my whole body reminds me. RLS is not just limited to your legs - the whole body can be involved.

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/25/2011 10:07:37 AM	I have severe restless leg syndrome.  Actually during breast surgery, a nurse had to physically lay across my legs to control them until surgery could be completed.  My surgeon said I was the talk of OR that day.  I was on Requip 1MG for about 5 years and took a total of 6 pills before I could comfortably lay down to go to sleep. It was like planning your evening around taking your Requip.  My family used to get very concerned about me because I would pound on my legs to try and stop the &quot;feeling&quot; you get from restless leg.  I made an appointment with a neurologist because I had read that they had been studying restless leg syndrome for years and he put me on Requip  XL 8mg.  I take it once a day and for the past four months has only had 3 episodes where my legs began to jump at bed time.  I am very very pleased with Requip XL. If you have Restless Leg, Requip XL is your best friend.
Parkinson's Disease	mr p, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	9/9/2010 4:32:27 PM	dr introduced me to this drug with sammple packs.  I had been taking cabidopa levola dopa and was getting along.  I was havng trouble with fitful sleep.  drug was easier to take and doc lead me to believe it might help with chronic pain.  well drug did help but I came to find out that my insurance medicare did not covet it  and it was 400 per month for my dosage.  quite a shock since I am disabled with parkinsons and not flush with money.  still in shock since getting used to requip xl called for a period of adjustment. Now I am back on requip that is similar to carbidopa levoladopa.  Be careful drug is not covered and samples run out quickly.

I know it has not been long enough to truly state side effects; however, the tremors stopped within hours of taking the first dose and now I am even walking a little better. I am very satisfied and hope for continued success.

I recently tried the Xl version and found myself unable to sleep, obsessed with fixing a new computer. I got almost no sleep for a week. My back is still hurting from sitting in an awkward position etc....I believe that for me the obsessive - compulsive behavior it has created far outweighs any symptomatic relief it has given me. It is a dopamine agonist and has all the benefits of such drugs. It also carries the same risk factors and was very expensive, even with health insurance,

I tried the generic and it defeated the whole purpose as I would lay there almost all night long, wide awake.  I cut the 1 mg pill in half and take with my supper before it gets ahead of me, and then take the other half about 2 hrs later.  If by chance I am on an airplane and have to set to long, I will take an extra half earlier.  I have been taking this medication about 4 years and it is the first medication that has helped me.
