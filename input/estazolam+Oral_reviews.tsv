I would have vivid dreams and wake up having panic attacks. I would fall back asleep &amp; wake up having panic attacks again. I did not sleep well &amp; wake tired every day.

It might take a week or two.  I have a condition that causes me to naturally fall asleep later and sleep later each day.  If left untreated, I eventually cycle through 24hrs, but I can work a normal job with this condition.  I think ambien is the best but eventually develop a resistance to it and need to switch.  Estazolam works well except it gives me bad dreams.  When I start to fall asleep I think someone is in my house or standing over me.  I'm conscious enough to know that it's not real but it's still scary.  It's not my favorite sleeping pill but it works well.

My doctor tried many medications but estazolam was the only medication that worked without all the scarey side effects of the more trendy sleep medications.  To my knowledge I've never done anything to embarrass myself in my sleep or expereienced disabling memory loss.  I found out quickly, however, that I only needed half a pill and that's all I've taken from time to time since 1999.  There was a point when I felt I was becoming addicted but I went cold turkey for a month then got myself back on a more healthy usage.  It was hell without it for that month but it is more effective if not used every night.  It is hard to come by but, so far, CVS has always had it available in my area.

The street I live on is fairly busing, so I take this only on nights I have to and work 3rd. shift. I does exactly what it is supposed to keep you asleep so you can get good sleep. Would recommend it anyone.

The generic that they still make, and put me on was Estazolam.  Last month, Sam's Pharmacy said the maker of the generic was having trouble getting the necessary 'ingredients'.  This month there didn't seem to be a problem.  Maybe you could try CVS again or go to Sam's...

I have been taking it for over 8 years now, and suddenly my CVS Pharmacy is unable to get it. Has anyone else had this problem? I am frantic trying to find it.
