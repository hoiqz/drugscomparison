I was told the medication was painful to use and was also given a prescription for percocet which I actually had to use as the pain was so great.
Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	RhondaVI, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	3/4/2012 9:18:35 PM	After using this medication for pink eye for the last 24 hours, I have not seen any improvement. If anything my eyes feel more irritated than they did before I started the treatment. I had pink eye once before and was prescribed Bleph which worked really well. 
Bacterial Infection of the Eyelid	Fran,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female		7/29/2010 4:44:45 PM	Entire face swollen after using this product prescribed by Dr. who did eyelid rejuvenation.  Allergic reaction.  I'm also allergic to neosporin.  Do these two have a similar ingredient that I should be aware of?

I've got a chalazion and with this, the other medicine and warm compress they've gone away in about a week. I had just been washing my eye carefully and had the bump for several months. I also had to have one lanced which is why I'm on the oral medication as well.  I'm satisfied with the Doctor's prescription.
Pink Eye from Bacterial Infection	0-2 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	1	3	Male	0-2	12/2/2008 1:50:37 PM	This was perscribed to us for our 2 year old's case of pink-eye she caught at daycare.  It was extremely effective at curing her infection, however application of a thick gel to a toddler's eyeball is, at times, darn near impossible.  We struggled through it, and as I stated it cleared the infection up in less than a week.
