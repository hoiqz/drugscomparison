I have been losing my hair ever since I got out of the hospital and Im unsure if it has anything to do with the meds.I would love to know if its a side effect.I was on the most they can give a person of my weight.

In each instance I experienced a permanent memory loss from mile to sever. After my endoscopy I lost eighteen hours of memory. After my gall bladder surgery I had a short memory lost, but approximately one month later I became severely depressed and have experienced a psychologically painful regression to a period thirty years ago. This regression has continued ten months later.I would not accept this drug again under any cercomstance.

General Anesthesia	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Male	55-64	2/12/2011 10:40:18 AM	This was given to me for a colonoscopy. Very effective at putting me out instantly.Unlike most others reviewing this drug, I was able to wake up instantly (suprising even the nurse), however I was tired and &quot;foggy&quot; the rest of the day. I slept from midday to morning the first day, but had a pretty bad headache for the next 2 days. An unusual side effect I had was &quot;drooling&quot;, right from the moment I left the Outpatient Center. I could not get any satisfactory answers from anybody on whether or not this was a normal side effect. I was just trying to find out if I am somehow allergic to this drug. Obviously everyone can experience different reactions to any drug, so just take note of your side effects (if any) as it's really just a judgement call on your part to use the drug in the future.
General Anesthesia	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/24/2011 9:12:00 AM	I had this with a colonoscopy and endoscopy.  Very fast acting, i had no side effects other than being very groggy when i woke up for about 20 minutes.  Its almost a feeling of being intoxicated, very lucid.  Once they injected it you will feel a burning feeling, and it was maybe 5-7 seconds after they injected it i was out. I think i told them &quot; it is burn-.....&quot; and thats all i got out.  I did not feel a thing during the procedures
General Anesthesia	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/3/2010 12:31:55 AM	I am glad I didn't read these reviews before my colonoscopy. I would have freaked out and refused this drug having read some of those negative comments here. Instead, it has worked wonders for me. One second I was talking to the nurse, next I was out, no weird sensation of any kind. I was told it took the nurse quite a while to wake me up. But once I was awake, I felt totally alert. Of course I didn't remember anything during the procedure. But I don't have other memory lapses like some reviewers claimed. The greatest thing is: it didn't give me nausea, which I had big time when given other anesthesia drugs. Thank God there is finally an anesthetic that works so well for me.
General Anesthesia	booboobear, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/27/2010 7:44:17 PM	administered for colonoscopy. When drug was going in I had chest pain like I was being stabbed with a knife, I felt like I was drowning and could not yell for help. The following was told to be by the nurse. I do not remember any of this. I woke up screaming in pain, pulled out the IV sending blood all over the bed and walls. Pulled off the heart monitor and pressure cuff. Punched the nurse in the face and screamed in pain if anyone touched me. I cried for almost an hour before I went back to sleep. When I awoke about 2 hours I had a massive migraine and uncontrollable vomiting. I had my colonoscopy on Wed and did not get out of my bed until Sun. I WILL NEVER ALLOW THIS DRUG TO BE USED ON ME AGAIN OR ON ANYONE IN MY FAMILY.     
General Anesthesia	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	45-54	9/18/2010 11:55:36 PM	Used for a colonoscopy. Was explained that I might feel discomfort at the start. Which I did, but was soon out. I woke up to vomiting, that's how i woke up. I vomited 3 vomit bags full. I was froze, had at one time 4 warms blankets on me. I also had a slight headache, but by the end of the day it had gotten worse. All I could do was sleep. The next day I was still tired, when I walked i felt like I was walking on air. Also, my vision has become blurry. Didn't like this at all! The last time I had a colonoscopy was 3 years ago and I don't know what they gave me then, but it worked a lot better for me. I just slept it off. No sickness or other side effects.

The med goin into my IV site was a bit painful but I only felt the pain for about 10 seconds and I was out.  I woke up in recovery with no memory of the procedure.  I was very confused and disoriented as I woke up but that is normal.  
General Anesthesia	ronthomas, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	6/11/2010 6:22:03 AM	Several times propofol IV was administered to me by a licenced anesthesiologist. Each time was a &quot;pleasant&quot; going to sleep, and pleasant waking as if no time had passed. I've never had any so-called &quot;drug hang-over,&quot; and awake refreshed and in a good disposition. As of this date, many people associate it with the drug taken by Michael Jackson. All I can &quot;guess&quot; is:  it was not administered properly, whether in amount or amount of administration. It is a wonderful drug for out-patient surgery, because the patient may come in, go to sleep, have the procedure done, then awake, and pursue the rest of his day whether working or relaxing.  I've never had to &quot;relax.&quot;  All my mental and physical strengths returned to normal upon awakening. I was not aware of anything going on during my colonoscopy, and it was a pleasant experience.

Itwas very quick acting and I experienced no prpblems afterwards.  I have allergies to a large number of drugs. It is nice to know there is a drug I can take and not be aware of the surgery or procedure being done. This unfornately has happened in the past.
General Anesthesia	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/27/2010 12:25:59 AM	Used for colonoscopy. I was talking to the dr. one second and waking up in recovery the next.  Slightly dizzy but passed quickly.  No headache, however, the next day I could recall only a few details of the day before and don't recall too much of the following day.  Still, to have the procedure done in such a pain free way was worth the memory lapses.
General Anesthesia	Moto689, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	2/6/2010 3:22:08 PM	This drug was given to me as part of my general anesthesia prior to having back surgery.  I've never had a problem with sedation or anesthesia before, and I thought if you do well once, you're in the clear, but I was wrong!  I don't remember that day, or the next.  What I do remember came to me in waves.  I had a terrible headache for 2 days.  I later learned that this was one of the drugs that Michael Jackson had in his system at the time of his death.  I will NEVER EVER use this drug again, no way!

I am hypersensitive to fentanyl &amp; all opiods. Gastro/doc still was insisting to use fentanyl this time or intubated General Anethesia.  I insisted on Propofol and now know there are options.  Don't let doctors bully you!
Inducing of a Relaxed Easy State	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/10/2009 5:23:38 PM	This drug was used during my colonoscopy last week.  It worked VERY well.  I don't remember a thing that took place during the procedure.  When the drug wore off, I did vomit for a short time but not like I have in the past.  15 yrs ago my first colonoscopy was horrible because I was awake and the pain came right through the valium/versed seditive.  I will ask for this Propofol in the future!

I had one 2 years ago with a different anesthesia.... what a difference! I woke up easily, not groggy at all, back to normal within an hour. Big plus... I didn't scare my kids this time. Last time I did because I was incoherant when I got home.
Other	Just Jo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/21/2008 11:34:57 AM	11/7/08 Versed and propofol IV used for triple surgical breast biopsy - no ill effects at all.   Intent was to use versed and fentanyl - I had a bad experience with fentanyl used for a colonoscopy and am scheduled for next colonoscopy 12/5/08. Gastro doc intends to use fentanyl and versed.  I will suggest/insist on propofol to avoid the vomiting and severe anxiety from fentanyl. I am hypersensitive to all pain medications like fentanyl.  Having propofol IV was a life saver!

Recovery time was very quick.  I was up and walking out of the hospital within an hour or so.  Very unlike other procedures I have had.  No side effects at all.  I was very happy with the drug.
General Anesthesia	beachbirdie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/18/2008 12:08:55 PM	Administered for colonoscopy.  Vrey fast acting, was out almost instantly.  Began to wake before procedure was done, was dreaming procedure and had a little pain while it was completed.It was a very good experience.  Awoke without that &quot;drugged&quot; feeling, no nausea or headache.  Was able to leave the facility very quickly and return to most normal daily activities.  Was just a little bit tired, and not quite up to normal attentiveness but that is why patients are instructed to avoid operating machinery, driving, making decisions.For the headache sufferers, perhaps it was dehydration and not the drug.  I told the nurse at prep time that I was very thirsty and dehydrated, she started my IV right away and got fluids going into me.  My thirst abated about 40 minutes later so I went into the procedure well hydrated.Overall, a very good experience with this drug.
General Anesthesia	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	6/26/2008 10:38:46 AM	Received this drug via IV prior to getting an epidural injection in my lower back.

I awoke from a dream just a few minutes after the procedure feeling very alert, not groggy like the last colonoscopy five years ago. They removed the IV, gave me my clothes and I was gone. Maybe a coincidence, but I had a headache for five hours after...small price to pay for a better experience.

Also i had it as part of my general with my open heart surgery. Other then my fear of needles- which impacts any iv solution for me- it was the most effective anisthesia i had ever had with all of my different surgeries. plus they gave a lower dose to me in icu and i do not recall being extubated- which for me was a true blessing.
