Other	Silver, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	12/3/2011 11:43:14 AM	I have been suffering from a myriad of symptoms over the years that included but not limited to, slurred speech, migraine headaches, fatigue, pain in the joints, fibromialgia, back pain and panic attacks. I used to chew mint flavored gum at least three times a day and a friend of mine had listened to the troubles I was having back in 2001. She asked to look at the package and informed me about the risks associated with aspartame. I decided to talk to my doctor about the issues I was having and he suggested that I refrain from taking the product. Under his advice, I did so and I felt an improvement within a day with the migraines gone in about a week. Ever since I had avoided taking the product, I am no longer in need of my panic attack medication and I no longer need a sleep aid. After about a year of not using the product and I had confirmed for myself that aspartame is not recommended, I noticed that a friend who was drinking diet sodas often was suffering from the same issues. I asked her to refrain from using it for a week and see if her symptoms improved. She confirmed this as well and therefore I am willing to place money that aspartame is linked to neurological deficiencies that could result in further complications later in life with prolonged use. The same goes with monosodium glutamate which is still being used in restaurants. The FDA should be regulated to keep chemicals marked as flavor enhancers out of the consumer's reach. Out of personal experience, I do not recommend this product. Period.

I was having problems getting dizzy and passing out. After many tests including a 72 hour fast in the hospital where nothing was found because I was not using aspartame. My local doctor found I was having a reaction to the aspartame. It was causing my pancreas to pump out to much insulin. I was going into hypoglycemia.

Other	Marla, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	4	3	1	Female	45-54	8/11/2010 10:13:33 AM	I started using aspartame to lose some weight 5 yrs ago. I drink about 2 gallons of sweetened w/ aspartane tea per day. Use aspartame to sweet tart fruit, coffee and any other cold items. In the last 3 yrs have had health lots of new health issues that are getting worse. Heard about a lawsuit against aspartame &amp; looked it up.  All the health issues are listed as symptoms of aspartame poisioning. I have stopped using it. It has been 2 days without so I don't know the full extent of the chemical detox. I have a 13 yr old who has been using the aspartame and his ADHD became so bad 2.5 yrs ago that he had to begin taking medication to control it.  We will see how much changes without the use of aspartame.  I am really amazed that the US FDA approves chemicals like this for consumption by humans.  How much are the aspartame distributors &amp; makers contributing to the FDA?  I am planning on adding my son &amp; myself to the class action lawsuit. I have spent thousands of $$ to find out what is wrong with me and am told they can't find anything.  I am lucky I saw the add on TV concerning Aspartame as one of the side effects is Death. Symptoms I have are but not limited to the following: depression, irritation, same as musclar sclerosis, fibromialgia, lupus, extreme sleepiness, fatigue, migraine headaches, weight gain, stomach pain, loss of balance, focus &amp; memeory loss. Please do not use this chemical.

During the winter I consumed large amounts of aspartame in hot decaf coffee to keep my body warm. I suffer from Reynaud's syndrome and will lose circulation in my hands at cool temperatures (50F and below).  I began to experience extreme fatigue and inability to sleep well. I had heard that aspartame might be the culprit but did not believe that. Finally after 3 months of heavy daily consumption of this I was almost too tired to work. I could barely complete my jobs. I read a book by Shane Ellison called Over the Counter Natural Cures and decided to abstain from aspartame. I immediately felt some better but by the next week I was able to complete my work without the extreme fatigue. I believe I am still suffering ill effects and would not recommend the consumption of this product to anyone.

I wonder what the FDA is really doing when they review products and their contents befor giving them the ok for public consumption. Capitalism at its best. Notice this site wont give any hard information.

I started having lots of headaches and joint/muscle aches and couldn't find a reason until I read about Betty Martini and her fight against Aspartame use. Now I know my one year of drinking Coke Zero has caused all my problems. After learning the true I am back to drinking water and NO ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS!
