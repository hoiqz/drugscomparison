Cough	jimster22, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	13-18	9/10/2012 7:37:57 PM	My 13 year old son was prescribed Bromfed DM for cough and cold symptoms.  Not only was it awful tasting, it did not work well.  My son was acting weird so I looked it up and Bromfed DM has a very very high alcohol percentage of .95% per teaspoon.  This is a 4 hour product and if you take it 6 times in 24 hours, that is equivalent to my 13 year old son drinking nearly 3 Miller Lites in 24 hours.  I would never give this product to any kid under 21.

They suffer with outdoor allergies and asthma.  This medicine is a Godsend for them.  Their asthma causes them to snore at night.  While on the medicine the snoring stops.  When I take then off of it for a break the snoring comes back.  The take 1/2 teaspon 2x daily.  I thank their Allergist for it.

The pediarician gave me a prescription for Bromfed and I followed the dosage of half a teaspoon 3 times daily for a week.Well, on the 7th day the last dosis was at 7 pm. At 2:30am my son woke up crying and screaming and he was shivering. I took him to the emergency room, I was told that Bromfed is more harmful than beneficial and to stop giving it to him.

She started getting very clumsy, irritable and talking out of her mind.  Though the medicine worked as it said it would, we made the decision take her off the meds due to the side effects.

So far, I have had mixed results. Mostly, it has really worked well. There has only been one instance when it didn't work as effectively. But, overall, it is a pretty good med for colds.

Cough	Crystle627, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/21/2009 3:14:21 PM	My 5 year old daughter suffers when the seasons change. She has coughing fits and Bromfed DM syrup silenced her cough within 5 minutes. Dosage is 1/2 teaspoon 3 times a day as needed. I, her mother, ended up with a cold as well and asked the doctor if she would prescribe the same for me since it had worked for her. I had excellent results. It completely took away the constant tickle. My dosage(adult dose) 2 teaspoons every 4 hours as needed. 
Cold Symptoms	CONCERNED PARENT,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male		10/11/2009 3:44:00 PM	DO NOT GIVE THIS MEDICATION TO A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 6YRS OLD AND WATCH CLOSELY FOR SIDE EFFECTS... MY 3 1/2YR OLD TOOK SEVERAL DOSES AND BY THE 3RD DAY EXPERIENCING HALLUCINATIONS FOR APPROX. 4 HOURS.  MIND YOU I ONLY GAVE HIM A TEASPOON AND RECOMMENDED DOSAGE BY HIS PEDIATRICIAN WAS A TEASPOON AND A HALF.
