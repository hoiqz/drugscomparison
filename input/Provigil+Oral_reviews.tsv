Have been taking for several years and although it has helped some I still find I am fighting sleep attacks several times a day.  Driving is my biggest concern.  I've increased my dose way beyond recommended doses and still have EDS.  I have no idea what the next step is but I hate living this way.

Sleep medications didn't help the nightmares, just made me groggy the next day.  My doctor prescribed Provigil because I was having trouble staying focused during the day.  Not only did Provigil help me focus during the day, I was able to fall asleep and stay asleep longer at night.  I am having trouble with my insurance covering the medication now and have been without for 2 months and have to go through a series of trials with other medications before they will authorize the Provigil again.  It is very frustrating to say the least!!!!

The drug really helped.  I did have constant dry mouth and noticed I got aggitated more quickly.  I wanted to know if anyone had withdrawal systems?  I lost my insurance and I could not afford $1,000 for a month's supply.  I've been off for about four days and am crying at the drop of a hat.  Dr. said I should not have any withdrawal systems.  There is a generic form now but it is $700!!!  The same company who had the patent is producing the generic.  There is something wrong with that. If they lost the patent why isn't another company producing the drug at a true generic price.

I have Tourette's and either sleep delay disorder, or shift work sleep disorder. I cannot tell you how tired I was during the day. I'm a teacher, and would actually nap in my car during recess and lunch. Not anymore! Provigil lets me get through my day like a normal person. I have not seen any side effects. My life would be miserable without it. I now tak the generic Modifil (sp?) and it works great. The price should be dropping soon....

Before, I would sleep 8 or more hours, be up for maybe 4 hours at the most,and need to go back to sleep for another 6 or more hours.  Now, I take 100 mg. in the morning and sometimes another in the afternoon, and I'm able to stay awake all day, up to 16 hours.  Before Provigil I was sleeping my life away.  I haven't noticed any side-effects either, which is very nice.  My only complaint, is that my insurance, Medicaid and Medicare, often give me trouble about refills and there is no way I could ever afford it on my own.  It is $1,600 for a 30 day supply! (60 tablets)

At first the dosage that I was given was working great, however half-way through the month it seems as though my body has gotten use to it and it is not working as it did in the beginning. My doctor stated that this is typical and after 30 days the dosage is increased. I wanted to let anyone having issues with insurance companies covering this medication that if your doctor calls your insurance company and states that this is the only medication that will work for your condition; the insurance company will cover their cost of the medication. I have United HealthCare and this is what needed to be done in my case. There are also other organizations out there, if you do not have insurance, to cover the cost of specific prescriptions like Provigil.

One very large additional benefit to me is that this medicine alleviates the pains and aches of fribromyalgia. (I space out my 2 x 200 mg dosage throughout the day by breaking the pills in half and taking them 3-4 hours apart.  When I get behind in my dosage schedule, the aches and pains in my joints start to return.)In summary, I function again close to the way I used to operate a decade or two ago.

Able now to go do many more outside home activities, brain fog has lifted and can think without the 'short circuit'.  Thank you to the makers of Provigil for helping me to have  relief, at least from this part of  the MS...  It is not on the TriCare formulary, but it took only a phone call to get an exception made, so thank you also to TriCare

I am disabled from working and have lost pretty much my life and friends etc.  Feb. 2011 I was given Provigil at my request.  And it was wonderful.  I could not believe how the &quot;brain fog&quot; simply disappeared.  Now I asked for a refill in May, 2011 and was told my Insurance Co. won't cover cost.  Are you kidding me?  Finally, we find something to give my life back to me and the insurance company basically says no, we want you to continue to suffer!!!!!!!!!  Tramadol was given prior to Provigil and it works great too!  However, it seems to become less effective much faster and you need more and more.  I don't like that part!  I do not want to become addicted.  How can we avoid it when we need something to treat a &quot;chronic&quot; condition?  It is sad that the health care system is more concerned about how much it costs to care for us than helping us live full, satisfying lives.  Where do I go from here?  The hopelessness returns.  Thanks for nothing Health Net!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I never noticed anything until menopause set in.  Now, I am on 150 mg 3 x a day plus 10 mg. ritilan 2 x a day.  I usually have to take 2 of the provigil and 2 of the ritilan in the morning just to get moving.  I don't take ritilan in the afternoon, but do take the other provigil.  On it's own these two drugs BARELY helped.  I started HRC medical for hormone replacement (natural) and that was the oomph I needed.  When this year is over, I won't be doing the HRC replacement do to cost, so I'm not sure how well I'll do then.  Work is difficult sometimes.  I need to nap during my lunch times so I would say whil the Provigil helps it's not a cure all for me. I come home at night, my husband fixes dinner and on the weekends if my house gets cleaned it's a miracle.

The first 3 years taking this medication was positive with little or unnoticeable side-effects. While taking the medication  I experienced positive and negative reactions. Some of the good effects of the medication was a very keen sense through out the day, a stable sense of energy, and a sense of normal-see. Unfortunately the last year of taking Provigil I have experienced extreme mood swings, excessive urination,and a heavy dependency for the prescription. I have chosen to stop taking this product for my own personal reasons and felt the prescription was helpful ,for a time, but overall Provigil is not a prescription I will be taking on a regular basis for the future. I would recommend this medication for others but like any medication take this medication with an open mind and remember to keep asking yourself,&quot;do I really need this&quot;?

Without the Provigil, I would not be living the productive life I do today. A miracle drug...no doubt. The only complaint I have with the drug is the process of 'absorbtion' after taking. Can be jittery at times, but with proper diet, controlled. No rough trips down with the drug. Jim

My co payments were high, but we managed.  However, due to my husbands job lay off, and forced to take early retirement, I now at 62 have no health insurance and won't until I reach 65.  I have used up my savings trying to pay for the $550.00 a month cost for a 30 day supply.  I am being forced to stop it for I simply cannot afford it. It is such a shame there is nothing that is &quot;cost effective&quot; or something else that can be used.

First it was OSAHS (Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnia Syndrome). Then, after a couple months of using the CPAP machine, I was still tired all day.  My next sleep study showed the CPAP actually wasn't helping much and I was still nodding off at work in front of my computer. Narcolepsy was added to my diagnosis and then it all made sense!  My doc prescribed Provigil and I hesitated for about a month because I didn't want to have to take something like that.  One day, I took my morning coffee before leaving for work.  On my way, I picked up a triple latte.  Drank 3 diet cokes with caffeine before lunch and still needed to go to my car to take a nap during lunch hour. I then drank 3 mountain dews (gross!!) which meant I was desperate! Then, another cup of coffee before end of workday.  THIS is when I decided to fill my prescription! First day, I was completely amazed I wasn't tired.  Four months later, I am happy to say I feel close to normal again and have now enough energy to get back into the gym to work off the pounds my OSAHS brought me. (about 50 in 5 years!!!)I hate having to take meds but this so far gave me my life back.  My kids no longer see their mom napping on weekends or after work. Learned caffeine is no longer my friend. It induces anxiety and the gitters. (which I never had with all that caffeine, oddly) I've been prone to anxiety but adding a soda or strong coffee is asking for a panic attack.I've only had about 4 episodes where I felt tired during the day with this. Perhaps, not enough sleep the night before... Not sure

Several months ago, United Health Care took this off their formulary and out of pocket I was told it would cost over $1,200.  I was given a script for Nuvigil which they would pay for.  This made me nauseated and so dizzy I couldn't even walk.  I am now in the process of trying to get my docs to fight to try and have them make an exception for me.

Provigil(200mg) not only keeps me awake but also helps me focus during the show. I still need to take a one hour nap in the afternoon. Because I own a DJ service as well, I take care of all my call backs in the evening. I take another 200mg tablet around 6pm which keeps me bright, alert, and focused with my customers. I usually go to bed around 10pm and don't have a problem falling asleep.This has been the perfect compliment for my work situation. Even though I don't have ADD, I do have an issue with focus and concentration and the Provigil addresses both of those concerns. Be careful though because my wife tried this drug, and it didn't accomplish the same things for her as it did for me, plus she was not able to fall asleep. I highly recommend Provigil, but unless you have insurance, it may be unaffordable.

It was the week &quot;Neurology&quot; published a paper endorsing Provigil for MS fatigue. I took the drug and it gave me back my life. Co-pays were tough but worth it. Now my PPO (the only plan I can get as Medicare handicapped under-65) suddenly dropped it from their formulary because generic amphetimines are &quot;equivalent and cost-effective.&quot; Do insurance companies tell diabetics to eat a cookie instead of take insulin? And why is the company's prescription aid cut-off $43,700 for a 2- person household regardless of adjusted income? A daily dose of Provigil retails for $6570.00/yr!!! That one Rx would account for over 16% of our current adjusted income. We simply can't afford out of pocket. And I don't want to live life the way I used to feel before Provigil &quot;normalized&quot; me. It's no placebo. I felt so good a couple of years ago I quit taking it. I suffered debilitating fatigue within 2 weeks. I don't know what to do. There seems to be nothing but dead ends ahead.
Other	Dee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/7/2011 7:44:19 AM	I have MS, (since 2000) , with that the Fibromyalgia , Restless Leg Syndrome, Chronic Daily Headaches, Irritable Bowel Syndrome. The Provigil I had to keep asking and getting denied for as Medicare/ State Insurance doesnt feel the need to pay I guess.  For all of you out there with children...as I have 2 (11, 13) they do understand, they know Mom has to lie down, or Mom has to nap, take a break etc. My kids have told me numerous times when they were very little it was hard, but they knew Mom had to rest to (example) get to their christmas concert, or school play. They were great then and now they are like mother hens....They knew how to dial 911 at age 1 1/2 because of all the falls related to MS. They have been my little guardian angels for years. It is hard when you first sit down and tell your child/children you have uncureable diseases but they still love you unconditionally.  Thats what is most important, always remember do WHAT you can and dont over extend yourself or you will miss the christmas concert or play etc. And when they get older that relief comes off your shoulders when they say Mom you might be a little different from the other Moms but youll always be the best!!!!

At the advice of friends, I took only 1/3 of a 200 mg. tablet and was able to have normal energy.  However friends told me that while on it, I became &quot;short&quot;, less tolerant.  So I take it only when I am required to be &quot;on&quot; for long periods of time, such as long, inter-state drives or days when I have many appointments.

Have since been diagnosed with Sleep Apnea also. Dr. recommended a switch to Provigil Because there are fewer side effects than the Dexedrine. After a very difficult weaning off the Dexedrine and switch to Provigil, after two years, all I can say is, for me, this stuff sucks. It doesn't work very well and is 8-10 times the price of what I was taking before. I have no energy, backaches and nausea constantly, and generally have no zest for life anymore. I want my life back. I've given this more than a fair trial. I'm headed to my Dr. this week to request a switch back to the Dexedrine.

So I began to take it, but it never helped.  Infact, it did quite the opposite.  Instead of helping my tiredness, it put me to sleep and it was nearly impossible for me to wake up to anything.  It also made me very forgetful.  It got so bad that I couldn't remember anything that had happened 5 minutes prior.  I took myself off the medication and decided that I would just try all of the non-drug forms of dealing with narcolepsy.  I would never recommend Provigil to anyone.

I've known all my life there was something wrong with how much sleep I required to function for a few simple hours/day. I got diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia with long sleep cycles. For those that get the jitters or can't sleep on this medication, you shouldn't be taking it. This is for people that have trouble staying awake during normal wake hours (daytime). Also, if you're on this medication, you should do your research. Your body CAN and will get used to Provigil and require the need for more mgs throughout the day. If you want to make your dose continue to work for you, try taking breaks from it once a week (usually days you know you can get away with napping). I don't take it on the weekends and 100mg twice a day has worked for almost 2yrs now.

Over the years it just kept getting worse. I became terrified to drive. My Dr. sent me for a sleep study and found that I had Obstructive Sleep Apnea. I went on CPAP and it helped alot with my general fatigue during the day but I still had the problems driving. I would like go into a trance and could not keep my eyes open. I heard about Provigil and I asked my Dr. about it. He prescribed it for me and It is a MIRACLE DRUG. I have my life back! The only side affect is dry mouth. It's truly a God send!

Fatigue &amp; sleepiness continued to get worse.  Tested for Narcolepsy....not all the symptoms but Dr. said I didn't have it but was as bad if not worse.....can't explain that one.  This drug helped 100% when I first started taking it.  Like within 15 minutes I was a new person.  I've been taking it for about 3 years now.  Went from one pill to two pills.  They help me get through the day but still really struggle with fatigue &amp; sleepiness.  Life gets quite hard and discouraging.  My eyes droop from the fatigue.  I have a bit of neuropathy in my foot, which I understand is a side effect.  At present my hands and knuckles are getting quite stiff with some pain off and on.  don't know if this could be a side effect or not.  Xrays show nothing.  It is VERY expensive even with my insurance.  But it's a matter of at least a few better hours in the day.  Every day is different.  Some days the misery seems to be unbearable.  So, I have to say the effect of  this drug seems to have worn off.....or I'm just getting worse.  Overall I would recommend it.

My sleep has not been affected but my apathy has, for the most part, subsided and is more managable than ever.  However, if I do not take the drug, it comes back so am, so to speak, 'dependent' on it.

Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/11/2010 1:43:10 PM	I was diagnosed with narcolepsy a few years ago, and was only able to be on Provigil for a few months before I lost my insurance. The few months that I was on it saw a huge difference. I was teaching at the time and was falling asleep, having to schedule naps, and then just being really moody because I was so tired all the time. The first day I took it, one of my 2nd graders commented on how I was in such a good mood that day. Big difference!I finally got insurance again recently, and got a new Rx for Provigil, and while I've only been on it a week, I can see a huge difference. I feel like there are more hours in the day!The only side effect I've had either times taking this medication is that it kills my appetite. Sad because I like food, but good because of the weight loss, which is a welcome side effect.As other people have stated, this is an expensive drug. My pharmacy label said the cash price of my 100 mg 30 day supply is $455. Even with the insurance, the copay is $60, because it's considered a formulary drug. Would be nice if they developed a generic, but from what I read, that won't be possible for quite a few years to come.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/4/2010 10:45:36 AM	I have fought with staying awake my whole life. Last year, at the age of 29, I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy w/o cataplexy, and started provigal. The side effects I have had are: huge increase in sweating to the point of having to have extra clothes to change into. I can sweat doing nothing.  Not so accepted or attractive being female.  My toes and feet sometimes turn blue/black, poor cirulation?  Will go away if I rub them or get moving. An increase in brusing. I suffered from a upset stomach for the first 2-3 months. On the upside, I did have some weight loss to start due to the nausea. Lastly, and not so bad, &quot;word vomit&quot;, i cant stop talking and all the time. With all that said, I have never been more happy in life then I was after I started this medication.  I can only imagin how well i could have done in school if i started this 20 years ago. Having narcolepsy and not knowing any different, I never knew how much time was in a day!  I have spent most of my life trying to fit in naps and not waking up till 2 in the afternoon.  Working two jobs, sleeping in, and taking naps whenever i could, i missed out on a big part of my life.  Provigal has given me my life back.  Sadly this is a extremely expensive drug. And is getting to expensive for me to afford, even with insurance. On the days I do forget to take my medication, they tend to be very hard on me.  Im not really sure how I got through life before Provigal.  My friends, family, and co-workers all noticed a huge difference the day I started takning the drug.  I do hope the price comes down.

When I changed to  Provigil(100 mg.)3 1/2 years ago, it was an improvement, but I've had to increase the dosage up to 400 mg./day. I still feel like I'm on the verge of falling asleep and get sudden bouts of yawning, sometimes falling asleep during the day. I've tried taking varying amounts at different times during the day, but it doesn't seem to help. However, without Provigil I would SLEEP most of the day, so I can't give it up.In 2007 Provigil cost $596/100 (100 mg.) and presently costs $1473/100(200 mg.)tabs. Insurance covers only a 3 month supply before reaching the &quot;do-nut hole&quot;. The company has blocked efforts to develop a generic.  There's something wrong with this picture!

It has been my wonder drug. I previously have taken Adderall, Ritalin, Dexedrine, Wellbutrin. However, it is very very expensive, but far above anything I have ever tried for ADULT ADHD.

I switched insurance companies and it took 6 weeks to get it approved. those were not a good 6 weeks (I could not afford to spend $800 out of pocket). Dr gave me a coupon for a free 30 day supply of Nuvigil which worked but gave bad headaches. Provigil works great!

I've heard of other people that where given an Rx but didn't realize that this drug was used over the years for people that have MS associated with sleeping.  I have taken Provigil with Rital because of Attention problems and the effectivness of Provigil and Ritalin work well together.  My attention and focus is 100% throughout the day and still sleep well!  Since my doctor has taken me off Provigil I am not the same and told both my Neurologist and Family docotr the same.  My Family doctor has just resently put me back on Proviligal and I feel better.

Up until 2 weeks ago,it just seemed like all I could do was sleep. I would get up at 7:30, get a cup of coffee, sit down to watch the news and before I knew it it  was 11:00. I HATED it! I just felt like I was sleeping my life away, with very little hope  of any of it changeing.  Finally a new doctor I saw mentioned provigil and it has been SO AMAZING!  I haven't slept for 1 minute during the day since I started and I and am sleeping better at night.  I cannot believe it.  I just went to visit my son and he even said to me &quot;Do you realize you haven't taken one nap or fallen asleep during one movie since you've been here&quot; That was enough for me!  I am just amazed. There's a time and place for everyting and I guess this is my time and I coudn't be happier.  I get to have a life again.

The amount of pain I live with on a daily basis, keeps me from sleeping and moving. I started taking Provigil and immediately I could start moving around a little more than I had in 6 years. Then my sleep started improving and from that my mood swings lessened. Even though I am still in the same amount of pain I am able to live with it better. I fine now that I sleep better, I have more energy to at least try to get up. Now Nuvigil has given me the extra stregenth to try to be a little more mobile each day. The lack of sleep and pain diminishes my life to a invalid in bed. Provigil and now Nuvagil have given me the ability to get out of bed for an hour or two each day. I feel like there's hope for me now to maybe get better. The better quality sleep I get the better quality of life I have.

The CPAP helped 60% of issue, and the Provigil made up the 40% to help me feel normal, alert, less fatigued, even less pain.  With economic conditions hitting us hard this year, I tried to space out doses, taking every other day or two.  When the prescription was out I didn't renew (about 5-6 months ago) &amp; I noticed a huge diffence--major regression!  Then my doctor recommended adderall since it's less expensive. It works ok, but not as good as Pvgl does.  I often have to supplement with awake pills which I think now I'll have to increase quantities:(   I've never experienced gitters, panic-attacks or anything w/this medcn--IF someone has it's likely they were probably started on too high dose.  The only thing I've noticed is daily, severe headaches including 1-2 migranes each week.  Whether this is actually attributed to being off the Provigil, I don't know for sure.  However, they have been very noticeable and consistent since not being on it.I'm so lethargic,fatigued and lazy  without my Pvgl and miss it greatly!!!  I can hardly wait until the generic comes out and it's less costly--I truly benefit from having this medication!!
Other	worn out, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	12/3/2009 1:12:18 PM	I began taking provigil almost 3 years ago. I took 400 mg because of my profound depression.  For which I was also taking Effexor + Wellbutrin + trazadone (for sleep).  9 months ago, after extensive testing, I was diagnosed with the inattention form of ADD, and was put on Adderall.  All was well, except the Adderall was too uneven.  So we switched to Vyvanse, which is terrific for the ADD, but...I became so exhausted I could barely function.  I came down with a virus around the same time, which was a long siege (still have some symptoms), but we experimented with removing the provigil--and my energy levels soared.  So it was a great drug for a while, but in concert with Vyvanse and the viral issues, it was horrible.  And, I'll add, I've been off the provigil for two and a half weeks and have been so depressed I am on the verge of crying almost all of the time.  (If I'm not actually crying outright.)  So, a few more weeks to see if I'm suffering a rebound effect and will level out as my brain adapts to life without provigil.
Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/3/2009 12:03:26 PM	I have always slept alot during the night and took several hour naps during the day.  I became concerned when I had to travel and started to fall asleep while driving and my evening after work consisited of sleep.  I contacted my dr and was diagnosed with hypersomnia or excessive sleepiness. I have been taking this medication for almost 5 months at 100mgs daily. I could immediately tell a difference.  I had minor side effects in the beginning such as head ache, back pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.  After my body adjusted, the side effects discontinued. It does, however, act as an appitite suppressant.My dr said that I could take this med just on weekdays for work if I choose and skip the weekends. I did not take the medication for a week when I was on vacation, which was a mistake, b/c my body had to adjust to it all over again.  I did not have any trouble with my ins paying. I pay $10 a month as my copay, which from what I understand is very good.I have noticed a decrease in the affect of the medication and plan to discuss an increase in the dose with my dr at my next follow up appt.  At my last follow up I asked my dr about increasing it and it was changed to 100mg in the am and 50mg in the early afternoon, but i didnt feel like the afternoon dose helped. Overall, this medication has changed my sleeping habits and my daily routine.  I had hoped to have an abundance of energy from it, but thats not the case. I do, however, require less sleep at night and function during the day without naps.  I'm not constantly yawning and tired.  I feel awake.  I am able to schedule my sleep around my life now and not vise versa. I am truly blessed to be able to take this medication and benefit from its effects.

For over half my life I struggled to stay awake during the day, finally culminating in episodes of falling asleep while driving and not remembering how I got places. I sought out the advice of a sleep specialist in my area, and I thank God every night I found him. After a couple of sleep tests, I was finally diagnosed with narcolepsy and mild sleep apnea. I learned I had had symptoms of cataplexy dating back 20 years, and restless legs almost my entire life. Under his treatment, I am on Provigil and Klonopin, and am happily awake during the daytime and falling asleep with ease at night. I feel like a new person, and all my friends and family notice a difference in my attitude and productivity. Without Provigil, I feel as though I am only part of a person, unable to conduct my life on anything but the most basic level. My only complaint is the cost. The price of this drug at a US pharmacy is OUTRAGEOUS, and has not come down due to unethical practices by the manufacturer to prevent generics from being released on the market.

I found I cannot have any alcohal which is fine by me but I do miss my margaritas.I get drunk fast.

For the past seven years I have been fighting to find out what is wrong with me.  All I wanted to do was sleep, I felt awful. The first doctor called it depression and I tried three different SRIs before taking prozac for 4 years.  About 1-1/2 years ago I decided to wean off the prozac.  I felt I was missing my life.  I wasn't the me I missed.  I found another doctor, and because I am also always in a lot pain - I was living on excedrine -(made up of tylenol &amp; asprin for the pain, and caffine to keep me moving), we did alot tests.  She said due to high virus markers I had chronic fatigue. I also believe it's fibromalagia but we haven't discussed it yet). I almost cried telling her I felt like I'd missed the last 5-7 years of my children's lives because I was always so tired and in pain.  She asked if I wanted to try provigil.  I would have tried anything.  I HAVE MY LIFE BACK!  I've been taking it for about 6 months now and I feel like ME again.  I don't just want to lay down and sleep after lunch at work and I don't come home and fall asleep on the couch like before.  I get things done. I ENJOY doing all kinds of things with my kids and I don't feel like I'm paying for it physically when I do. This medicine seems to help with the pain and maybe the migraines too. I am amazed at how I can think now - no fog. I JUST FEEL SO MUCH BETTER! (I do still ached somewhat but not like before!)  I went to this site to see what others felt about it becasue I didn't know it was going to help with the pain and was wondering just what this miracle drug was. Thanks for your reviews - it inspired me to share.  I take 100mg a day at 6am and by 9-10pm I'm ready for sleep.  IT HAS TRULY CHANGED MY LIFE!!  I HAVE a life again!
Sleepiness Due To Obstructive Sleep Apnea	MJ, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/18/2009 4:36:11 AM	I began taking it for exhaustion due to narcolepsy, sleep apnea, circadian rythm disorder and also idiopathic hypersomnia. By the second day I was very angry at everything and everyone including myself. I learned what it was like to have turrets, I mumbled all kinds of things all day while working in the yard. I had no control over it, I just couldn't stop. I have had mild reaction to a couple of other medicaitons but nothing like this.  On the third day I was a threat to anyone around me and definately a threat to myself. I called my neurologist and he suggested cutting the dose in half. (via his nurse). My reaction was so frightening I refused to take it at any dose. My doctor saw me the next day, asked for details. When he heard for himself how bad the reaction was he said &quot;never, never, take it again.
Other	CarolA, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	9/17/2009 5:38:52 PM	I was given the medication by my neurologist because because I have MS and sleep apnea and get so fatigued that she thought it may help.  She checked my allergies(which are extensive)and did not think it would be a problem.  But I have a lot of other medical problems(eg)heart problems, high blood pressure, asthma, etc).  She did start it at a high dose (200 mg) daily, but after 3 days I didn't feel better and was told that it would probably take 2-4 weeks, so I continued taking, but after another 5 days, I am having a really having a hard time catching my breath and have a low grade fever for about 5 days.  At first I thought it might be the flu, but the temperature has not gotten high and the weakness and shortness of breath have gotten worse. Since I was unable to get a hold of any of my doctors, I finally called my pharmacist because I use only one pharmacy for all of my medications he was able to go over my history both of illnesses but he has a history of all of my medications.  He told me that I should have called first and that I should not have been taking it.  Normally I do call and speak directly to the pharmacist before I start anything new, but didn't this time and now I am having a problem.  I know that the doctor should know about various medications, but they can't know the entire chemistry where a pharmacist can.  I am not saying that this drug is any good, I just checked a little late.  Now I just want to stay out of the hospital.

Sleepiness Due To Obstructive Sleep Apnea	LeeBolin, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	9/11/2009 6:41:17 PM	Despite the cost, Provigil has worked fine for me. My dosage was two 200mgs in the AM. But now all of a sudden, the Veterans administration has gotten cheap on me. There have been times when I had to go without the drug for a month, due to their inability to dispense the drug. I even had one primary care doctor refuse to give me the drug, as he insisted that it was a psych. drug, and made me see a psychiatrist, who would not do anything about it. The pulmonary doctor at the VA hospital bases is reduction to only one 200 mg. pill per day, because of my liver function panel. Yes I do have hepatitis-C, due to the Navy being unable to be sanitary, and I had several shots using the same syringe and needle. Back then they figured putting it in an incubator will kill the virus, but heat has no effect on hepatitis-C. My private pulmonary doctor knows how expensive the drug is, and my co-payment is $50.00. SO when the VA will not give me Provigil, he then gives me Dexedrine. My last visit to my private pulmonary doctor told me I should ask the VA about the new pill that is made that is twice as powerful, only need to take one, and cost the same, yet the VA will not listen to a word I say. My Hepatitis-C had now progressed into cirrhosis of my liver. My hepatologist (sp?), Dr. Bruce Bacon, who is ranked 3rd in the US for treatment of hepatitis, told me that Provigil will not affect my liver. How can I convince them of this? In addition, shame on those doctors that say I am grossly obese, as I am only fat in the stomach. Now I learn that it is not fat, but fluid built up in my stomach. How rude can a doctor be saying this about me? Thank you.Lee Bolin

I like the way it works better and it COSTS ABOUT HALF THE PRICE OF Provigil.  I have started rotating the drugs because they seem to work better that way.

I can function greatly from 6am to 11pm at night. I no longer take trazadone at night for I am completely tired out and don't suffer from insomnia as much as I used to do it.

Sometimes it works fantastically, I'm in a great mood, I'm awake, etc. Other times it doesn't seem to work at all. In fact, I often have no trouble sleeping after taking it. Drove from VA to VT 2 weeks ago, took my provigil before we left, drove for 4 hours, then felt so sleepy I had my wife take over. I slept the next few hours. It's so expensive that I keep saying I'm not refilling the script, but at times (esp. midweek, when I'm trying to adjust to 2 or 3 overnights and then trying to live like a daytime person for 2 or 3 days) it's really been a lifesaver. So I don't quite know what to make of Provigil. It would be really nice if it was affordable, so I wouldn't have to be so careful about when I take it.

Before provigil, I stayed so fatigued that I stayed in bed the majority of every day. It has helped to save my marriage and my life!  The only notable side effect for me is sometimes it causes my mouth to get blisters and some sore throat;however, other meds I take may play a part in causing these small sores inside my mouth and on my tongue.

Provigil was prescribed and the Lexipro dose I take was lowered by half.  The result was nothing short of a miracle for me.  I would even go on to say that it cured my depression completely.  Now, all of my hopes and dreams in life are possible.  Where as before, I had almost given up due to my chronic depression and countless attempts to keep my focus and mood up due to my depression.  I am 44 now and feel like I just started to really live 3 years ago.  I have a great psychiatrist, therapist, family, friends and God to thank for getting me to that day 3 years ago.  I could never have dreamed that I would be doing the things I do today in a happy and consistent way.

I called the manufacturer who tells me they haven't changed ANYTHING, but my use and effects tells me otherwise, wondering if anyone can say they have experienced changes in the last few months.

I normally have no motivation to get things done,  even enjoyable activities. But, when I take Provigil,  I have motivation to do anything I want to... from work to fun things.  I no longer have to fight with myself to keep from wanting to sleep all day.  I take this medication for depression. But since it is not FDA approved for depression, I have to pay out of pocket,  and have to order it out of the country because in the USA it is only approved for ADD, sleep apnea, shift work, and narcalepsy.  Never the less, I am so grateful to have it. I no longer dread each day, and it has had nothing but good effects on my life.

Not habit forming and it wears off for me after 8 - 9 hours, so it does not interfere with a normal nights rest.  Love it!!!

Yes it works. Prior to starting my cpap usage I had a hard time doing a four hour drive. The sleep study showed that the apnea woke me up 120 times an hour. It would have helped me prior to the cpap machine. A cpap takes about 3 months before you stop hating it, but it works. Sleep apnea does more than put stress on you due to lack of sleep. It is a outright health hazard in its own right. Deal with it right.So, why do I take this drug from time to time? Frankly its a &quot;go&quot; drug and used for that purpose by the military. Right now, I am in a personal situation that will require that I be awake and functional for about 48 hours straight. The Provigil will do that for me. I do not recommend that you go over the 48 hour limit much. At 72 hours a lot of people start to hallucinate. Your brain does need sleep sooner or later. It evolved like that and its not nice to trick mother nature too much. But for emergency shift work, time zone hopping, and all the rest of those sort of short term usages off label from narcoleptic things, this is an amazingly effective drug. Your mileage may vary a bit. The effectiveness of Provigil is somewhat dependent on your own brain chemistry. Be careful with the usage. You can fall into the pill to wake up and then the pill to go to sleep habit. That is not anything smart to do.

I haved suffered from major chronic depression since my teens that caused me to lose years of productivity as my doctors struggled to find the right anti-depressants, mood-stablilizers, anti-psychotics, etc... There is hardly any on this entire list I haven't been on. After 10 years of intensive in-patient and out patient drug and psychotherapy I finally became stable enough to go back to work. BUT, the drugs made me too sleepy to work and my doctor wasn't about to put me on the true &quot;speedy&quot; meds after all my bouts with overdoses. I started Provigil 6 months before I returned to work and I am back leading a full life again. I have been back at my original career (teaching) for 6 years. The first 2 years my doctor provided me with all the free samples expecting the FDA approval we were bitterly dissappointed when that didn't happen. My insurance started giving us all kinds of trouble after it wasn't approved for other problems. Like most people i cannot afford $750+ for one medicine. What you can do is have your doctor order a sleep study and then when he/she shows proof that you have had a sleep study done the insurances usually relent. I don't know what I would do without this drug. I would still be sitting at home watching the world go by. I hope that one day the FDA would listen to those of us this drug has helped and have used it responibly to improve our quality of life and in very good cases, like mine, even go back to work and feel like the professional i was trained to be.

Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day	Omkastoe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/9/2009 2:43:14 PM	  This drug has been a miracle to me.  I have narcolepsy and was constantly falling and getting injured due to attacks of micro sleep while I was walking.  I no longer have this problem or as much day time sleepiness even though I have CFS and amazingly, I did not know that Provigil was also used for fibro myalgia and depression, both conditions that I suffer from.  The lift of my depression and the pain control of my FM is amazing  wasn't aware of these supplemental uses until I changed doctor's and he automatically assumed I was  receiving Provigil for depression.  I am 59 YO with  DID Major Depression PTSD and panic attacks and phobias, and of all the mecdicines my physicians have prescribed throughout my entire life this one is the most universally effective with out any noticeable side effects.  I wish that the price could be lowered so that others could benefit from this wonderful medicine.

After 7-10 years, I received a secondary diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  I was prescribed Amantadine.  This was very unsuccessful.  I continued to excercise and get plenty of rest.  Finally my Dr. prescribed Provigil.  I was reluctant at first because I have Mitro Valve Prolapse (rapid heart beat / Heart mumur).  My fatigue began to intensify and now I take the drug as needed.  Started with 100mg and now that I have a two year old &amp; fulltime job, I am taking 200mg.  This drug works wonders.  I reduced my caffeine intake, take prenatal multivitamins, biotin, Caltrate (MS patients need Vitamin D), &amp; improve my eating habits.  This drug helps with Chronic Fatigue but I believe patients can also help themselves by improving their overall health.
Other	vervette, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/3/2009 2:25:14 PM	I have secondary progessive MS and at my yearly Neuro appt to have my FMLA paperwork completed mentioned the reason for my FMLA usage was primarily fatigue and was given a sample of Provigil. I looked at the cost and thought, no way I was going to pay for that!  I had the samples anyway. I broke them in half, and found that this medication for at least 12 hours a day, reminded me what my life was like prior to MS. Well worth the obscene price. My insurace will not pay for this off label, except for depression. I didn't know this until I got the denial. I had been treated for depression previously, and after the provigil went back on medication again, and will file another request
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	6/3/2009 12:29:21 AM	I am taking Provigil because of a mild traumatic brain injury which has caused a worsening of previous depression,fatigue,sleep problems, lack of ability to concentrate,anxiety. Provigil was like a miracle for about the first three days but then started  having a paradoxical effect of making me MORE sleepy. I stopped it because of that and other side effects like dizziness and not sure whether I felt better or worse. I went without for about 3 weeks and noticed that some of my activities(weaving) and organization and concentration had been better on the med. I restarted and have made it through the first week. Concentration is distinctly improved but have still had some odd side effects.Getting tired again in the pm. One night I had one cocktail and could NOT speak. Like I was having a stroke. Words would not come out or organize in my BRAIN. I felt OK-not intoxicated- but like my whole brain had slowed WAY dowm. Couldn't drive home or talk for   awhile. VERY SCARY. OK the next day. No more alcohol. Still feel caught between good side effects or bad. Can't decide if I should keep trying.Waiting for a neurologist appt.for more direction. I feel quite drugged sometimes.100 mg 1/day

I was just diagnoised with Fibromyliga &amp; been on Provigil for only 2 days now but can see a huge difference. My doctor gave me 200 mg pills &amp; wanted me to cut them in fourths due to the effect on my liver but the 1st day I felt really nothing but today I took 100mg &amp; I feel awake. I have a high tolerance to meds &amp; I am on pain meds as well. My insurance hasn't approved yet &amp; by reading all these blogs looks doubtful, I paid $340 for 30 200mg pills with my AAA discount, I used a credit card &amp; if this wonder drug will help me I will give up something else. When your kids say they are sick of you being sick it hits home &amp; HARD. I am only 56 &amp; feel 75 some days, I miss family functions etc due to being so tired all the time &amp; when you live alone you need meds that work. I live in a state that will fine you if you don't have insurance so these drug companies need to get of their butts &amp; make a generic or lower the prices or approve us.

I can go till about noon or so now, which is great for me. I have been taking it for about 8 years and so far no side effects. It hasn't lost its effectiveness yet, either. I take 200mg a day. My insurance balked too but my doc was persistant. You have to get your physician to keep at it to get it paid for. Bug them and they will bug the insurance company!

I am supposed to ween myself off of the Provigil gradually to see if I can function without it, but I haven't started yet - I like not being sleepy!  My worry is that if I do indeed have narcolepsy, he said Provigil is the only treatment.  Thank God my insurance covers it!

I try not to take it every day for two reasons: 1) I'm afraid it will lose its effectiveness and 2) For me, it gives a wonderful sense of well-being and an almost euphoric mood.  I'm afraid I might like THAT too much.  I do get the occasional nausea, which only lasts for maybe an hour, and sometimes a headache which is usually well taken care of by either tylenol or motrin.  On the days I take it, I don't take it past ten a.m. if I want to be in bed by ten p.m.

I was diagnosed with MS and was almost immediately given it after my diagnosis.  I have had no significant side effects and I can tell the difference the few times I have forgotten to take it.  My only negative comment is that my HMO does not cover this med because it is too &quot;expensive&quot; because it is prescribed off label.  I am forced to take a sleep study to find out if I qualify for under that diagnosis.  It is a pity that this great med is not covered with the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

Came to the point I would fall asleep during the day or could not read a book or long article without constant yawning.  Provigil works pretty well for me but two cautions:  (1) The drug is most effective if you skip at least one day per week.  Apparently it can lose some effect if taken each day.  I've found this to be true.  (2) Don't take it too late. It will keep you awake for 10-12 hours even though they say it will not interfere with normal sleep.  Overall satisfied, but thought these two things would possibly help someone else.

I was diag. w/ MS 3 yrs. ago. Two of my kids are not school age. I was having extreme difficulty waking in the am &amp; would fall alseep in the middle of the day. I was ALWAYS tired no matter how much sleep I got (MS related fatigue)! I was started on the 1st drug to battle the sleepiness. I tried it for 1 mo. It didn't work for me beyond week 2. I was, then, precribed Provigil. After a couple of days, my urine began to have a nasty odor. I was told to stop taking it for a couple of days (to see if the drug was the culprit). I found out that the odor can be normal while on this drug. I also began to have a lot of problems w/insomnia, until my body was used to the med. After, about 1 1/2 wks. I began to be able to sleep @ night. When I was still tired during the day, my dose was upped to 2pills/morning. After another bout of &quot;getting used to the dose/insomnia @ night&quot;... I am now sleeping very well @ night &amp; able to be awake during the day (w/energy that I hadn't had in a long time.) I am able to enjoy my kids more &amp; be less crabby from tiredness!

First off let me say, you should be gradually introduced to the pill. 1/2 a pill for 3 days then 1 pill for 3 days (depending on mg) to avoid the headaches and nausea on first weeks of taking. ~ As for someone who claimed Provigil is not FDA approved, stop being ignorant and read the material. As for the stroke-like symptoms...it was a stroke, find new doctors. The only problem I have had is the easy developement of resistance. I try not to take it on the weekends...but it seems within 2 months I needed to stop taking it for a few days (I'm on 400mg a day). You might need to ask your doctor to fill a week supply of Ritalin or Adderol to keep you going during the off time. But be careful how you ask...you don't want to seem like a drug-seeker.

I went from 100mg to 200mg because the 100mg worked for about an hour and then left me even more tired and sleepy than before I took it. In the past few weeks, I have needed to take 400 mg/day just to function. And I am exhausted all of the time. I have experienced headaches, dizziness, and spaciness in varying degrees of intensity while on this drug. Currently, I am experiencing numbness and droopiness on the left side of my face, which is quite alarming. After reading other revues of this medication, I suspect that it may be the cause, as numerous tests, MRIs of the brain, etc, have revealed nothing. This is a powerful, addictive drug and should not be used haphazardly. I am currently weaning myself off of it, and will discontinue its use as soon as possible.

Recently I learned that I had narcolepsy.  My doctor prescribed me with this. I am currently up to 400mgs. daily and I have yet to find relief from my tiredness.  The medication kills my appetite.  I am constanly feeling in a hazy.  Always sleepy during the day. Troubles sleeping at night. It is almost as if the medication made my symptoms worse. Anyone else have this experience?
Sleepiness Due To Shift Work Sleep Disorder	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	2/24/2009 10:57:07 PM	My husband took this medication due to not sleeping at night(very little). He took 1 pill first thing in the morning to hopefully, wake him up for the day. He took 1/2 pill around noon/1 pm, then after the 1/2 pill would almost instantly want to nap. After 2 solid weeks, he started developing 'feebleness, stumbling, memory problems, not able to focus(avid reader). Needed help with medications, remembering what to take, when. Has been off this medication for 8 days, still having some of the same problems, not as severe. His sleeping problems are related to shift work for 15 years, and also has sleep apnea. This medicine was not for him.

Along with my other meds, i just can't afford it.  I already have to choose which medications I fill, and which ones I don't.  Is there a generic for Provigil?  Is there something similar?

I was taking klonopin for a sleep disorder and it was working.  I had worked a 12 hr night shift for 4 yrs and never had a problem staying awake at night and sleeping in the day...didn't even need caffeine.  A year after retirement I couldn't last in the day without needing a nap or two.  I have had the sleepiness plus fatigue return recently and have been diagnosed with lupus.  I will discuss this with my neurologist on my next visit.  Fortunately all my doctors are in one place.

Every night I would experience devastating dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, sometimes lasting up to four hours a night. I also had severe weight gain of 44 pounds, even though I was vomiting constantly! At first the doctor believed it was withdrawal from the previous medicine I had been taking- Dexedrine. However, after six months it was apparent it was this medication that was making me ill and the doctor put me back on the Dexedrine. (I eventually had to switch to phentermine after I built up a tolerance to Dexedrine after nine years of taking it) Please be especially wary of Provigil's side effects, since I still have problems from taking it over eight years ago.

I have a strange reaction to this drug for about the first two weeks of taking it. It is like having a constant buzz. I have to work my way up to the full dosage of 400mg a day. When it finally levels out this drug is amazing. I used to sleep off and on most of the day. I would not drive further than 10 min away for fear of falling asleep. I couldn't stay up past 9:30pm. Now I watch the 11:00pm news every night and maybe take a short nap in the afternoon. I still dont drive very far alone. The only downside I realy have found is my sensitivity to the sun. Overall provigil has realy worked for me.

I had very few side effects, I felt like I slept better at night, and I no longer wanted to sleep all the time.  I've been taking half a pill because taking a whole pill causes me to not sleep at all for 24-36 hours.  Unfortunately, I've now built up somewhat of a tolerance so half a pill seems to make very little difference now and a whole pill is still too much.  I've only been on Provigil for 3 months now but I no longer take it every day because it doesn't seem to make much of a difference now that I've gotten used to it.  If my doctor can't figure out a better dosage for me, I may stop taking it altogether since it no longer seems to do much good most of the time, which is a shame because it worked very well when I first started.

I was so tired and nobody would listen. It kept getting worse and I starting falling asleep during the day and while driving. I recently crashed my car because I just went out, no warning, just ou tand when I opened my eyes I am spinning across 2 lanes of traffic and smash my car into the guard rail. I was banged up but ok overall, went on web, found provigil. If your insurance co. won't pay, try Canada, they have a generic and it is $117 for 60 200mg pills. Also there will be a US generic soon and a new med called NUVIGIL that lasts longer than provigil and even clears up cognitive effects. There is so much more to let people know but it won't fit here. Again, try Canada, if you have a valid RX, they will fill it since they have a generic, no joke. This may have saved my life and maybe other's as well because my accidents were getting worse until I smashed my car and who knows what would happen after that.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	12/5/2008 3:42:04 AM	My doctor gave me a sample of Provigil for general fatigue. I found it very effective, although I noticed a few side effects. I experience fequent and vivid dreams on this medication which is unusual for me. The worst thing is the severe headaches when drinking alcohol, also not normal.

I am a teacher and mother of 4 so my life is very full and busy.  Before Provigil I could barely drag myself through the day.  Now I can think clearer, am more organized, have more energy to spend evenings with my kids, and am able to stay up past 8:00 in the evening!  It is truely a miracle drug.

This pill is a miracle for me. I now have the energy I used to have when I was younger. I am a school teacher and this pill has increased my concentration level as well as my memory. I am a better teacher because of it! The only drawback is the cost ($55 co-pay) but I am better off than those who have NO insurance.

First 200mg, that did nothing, then we went up to 400mg in the morning, and that has worked fine. The only side effects I suffer from occasionly are headaches. This medicine has made a world of difference for me, no more nodding off during conversations, driving, and office work. The only draw backs for me are that there isn't a generic or another substance to treat narcolepsy (more affordable.)

It is a wonderful product and has given me my life back, without the side effects.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Bruce Alan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	45-54	11/30/2008 7:25:41 AM	PROVIGIL KILLS. Read this again: PROVIGIL KILLS. Are you aware that the FDA has already SPECIFICALLY DECLINED TO APPROVE the use of Provigil for the treatment of ADHD. This happened just 2 years ago, but you will not read about it because Provigil was tested under a FAKE name: Sparlon. Look it up on FDA.org. For over a decade, Provigil's manufacturer, Cephalon, has been promoting this drug as a safer alternative to Dexedrine or Adderall for ADHD. One of their sales reps talked my doctor into switching me from Dexedrine to Provigil because it was safer. At the time (2 years ago) I had taken Dexedrine for 12 years with no side effects. Within a week after I reached the 'target' dosage I went into psychotic delusions, my blood pressure went down to 75/40, I went into cardiogenic shock, acute kidney failure, acute heart failure and suffered significant brain damage. I spent 20 days in the ICU and my doctors estimated that, simply for not dying within 24 hours, I had overcome odds of 200 to 1. In part because of my case the FDA ordered that Provigil labels include warnings about hypersensitivity to Provigil that people have been dying from without notice since Provigil was released 10 years ago because the physicians who performed autopsies either never learned that their 'patient' had recently started taking Provigil or if they knew they did not suspect Provigil as the cause of death. If you have been taking Provigil for at least 6 months already you are probably safe -- the hypersensitivity tends to occur, when it does, within the first 2-4 months it is taking. My advise? Take Dexedrine if you are diagnosed with narcolepsy or shift sleep disorder. The amphetamines in pill form are FAR less likely to cause side effects and infinitely less likely to kill you.  Believe me -- I know; I am now permanently disabled because of Provigil. brucealan at gmail.com.

My Dr. Gave me an rx for provagil. I take it when I first get up, no matter what time of the day or nite. It has saved my life, career, and probable someone elses life.

If anything it causes headaches, and confusion.  I tend to find myself extremely alert but unable to prioritize throughout the day.  Peronsally it sends my mind racing, unable to focus on a specific task.  Many doctors will simply tell you to take stronger dosages if you are not satisfied with the initial effects.  This will lead to dependence in order to stay awake, and will make functioning extremely difficult when you stop taking the medicine.  I personally took 600 mg a day (Perscribed by doctor) and when I stopped taking it I had tremendous trouble staying awake.  *If you stop using this, you will be left off worse then when you started.*

I've been through the Ritalin, then Dexadrine Spansules etc. but naturally after all this time, they don't do anything anymore.  They took Biphetamine off the market.  It worked. This worked for my Narcolepsy but I had severe side effects. Flu symptoms, bones ached, skin hurt, lower back hurt, teeth hurt. My doc gave me 7 to try. I stopped taking them when I realized it was the med that was making me sick. However, I have to say that until the side effects side lined me, it did wonders.  Nearly zero sleep episodes while active, could stay awake and alert even sitting in a meeting, yet not a wired feeling.  Great!  Except for the side effects. My doctor said the insurance company doesn't like to buy these because the cost is prohibitive. So if you don't get the side effects, for me at least, it was a drug made in heaven.  I'm still going to investigate further. Maybe it just caught me at a low immune system point. 
Other	maybaby, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	11/10/2008 5:42:20 PM	I also have MS and have been taking Provigil for 5 years for the severe fatigue. I also have other health issues and find now that the effectiveness is wearing off and being replaced with more side effects such as severe H/A ( migraine with aura)  anxiety,ringing in the ears, increase in depression and sound sensitivity. If I increase the dose I experience chest pains...oh well...guess I go back to sleeping again. No drug is without side effects of some sort but I wish it didn't lose it's effectiveness and I wish I wasn't a pharmaceutical junky. The doctors mean well but after long term use it could kill you. Messing around with brain chemistry is risky. It's down right depressing! Good luck to you all for good health and/or answers

I was having blackouts while driving during the day, and lucky I never killed anyone. I used to believe I wasn't getting enough sleep, but as I got older, the occurences became more frequent. I have chronic sleep apnea, which I treat with a bi-pap (10/5) and quit breathing 255 times for up tyo 1 minute during a 5.5 hour sleep study. I would not fall asleep during the day...I would black-out. My latency test showed I was hitting the first stage of REM in under 1 minute. A rather large arachnoid cyst was also discovered on the back of my right cerbellum, which may or may not be the problem. I have ADHD, and have had TIA strokes. I am also being treated for anxiety and depression with Lexapro.  I have been taking 200 mg Provigil (2x) daily and I am happy to report that everyone can feel safer on the road. I have not had one driving blackout in the 3 years I have been taking the medication.  My neuropathy and these conditions werre enough to disable me. However, taking my regular naps, getting recuperative regular sleep, proper diet and excersize all help this mdication work to its fullest. I lost 90lbs in 18 months, through portion control and excersize, and was able to reduce the bi-pap to the current 10/5 from the original 17/11.

The fatigue associated was extremely debilitating. About a month after my neurologist prescribed it there was a write up in MS Outlook about the use of Provigil for MS fatigue.

At first the Dr. started me on 200mg a day. It did nothing. In desperation I increased the dosage a pill at a time to 600mg a day and it worked great. So far it works every day with no change. About three weeks ago I seemed like 3 pills were too much. Jaw clenching, nervesness, etc. So I cut back to 2 pills a day and so far so good. I hope this means my body is fixing whatever went wrong with my sleep controls. Without insurence I could not afford this medicine.

After starting this medication, my whole life changed.  i can do what needs to be done and more.  I have never felt this good in my entire life.  No more standing at the bottom of the stairs crying because it took too much effort to bring the laundry up.  I wish my parents had this drug for me when I was younger.  I haven't had any side effects other than a mild headache for the first couple of days.  I don't have any problems sleeping at night.  This was a miricle for me.  I wish it was less expensive however, my husband and I have to decided we will do whatever it takes to buy this for me.  A friend who is a phamacist told me it would be a generic in 4 years.

Sleepiness Due To Obstructive Sleep Apnea	wandachicky21, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/27/2008 1:45:13 AM	2 years ago, I fell asleep while driving, crushing my car but thankfully no one else but me and I was lucky and healed. I have complained to every Dr. I ever had that I couldn't sleep. I was always tired. I was always tossing and turning throughout the night. I also started &quot;twitching&quot;, especially when overtired, which was often. My body twitched for hours, making it  impossible to fall asleep. I have tried EVERYTHING you can possibly imagine for sleep. I have a &quot;high tolerance&quot; with medications so even things like Ambien at the highest dose would do nothing for me. And I know it was ME because my sister tried taking a HALF of one and it knocked her out for HOURS (I know- I hate her, too - just kidding) I found a therapist about three years ago and she immediately out me on anxiety meds because I was a 30 year old woman, full of pressure, and about to explode with all the stress in my life (divorce, kids, 2 jobs, etc.) but though it helped with stress, I still stayed sleepless. I finally had a sleep study done and surprise! - I had moderate to severe sleep apnea.  I did a 2nd sleep study with a CPAP machine. It was WORSE than sleeping without it. I was up all night, barely getting to the 2nd stage of sleep for very short periods of time. My &quot;sleep&quot; doctor said I'd get used to it, that he'd NEVER had someone who didn't LOVE it; no one could live WITHOUT it. Was I crazy? My therapist said half of her patients on CPAP's hated them and no, I wasn't crazy. I work in a hospital and was written up due to excessive drowsiness. I love my job and I couldn't argue their justification of writing me up; I had patients and co-workers that counted on me to be at my best. One night I saw a commercial for Provigil. My therapist was willing to prescribe it. I have been on it for 2 weeks and I'm a different person. Yes, I still have sleep issues but I am able to be the person I need to be during the day. I've had no side affects and I'm GRATEFUL for this med. For now, things are good!

AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS THE EFFECTS SEEM TO DIMINISH AND THE SLEEPINESS RETURNS.  IF I STOP FOR A WEEK OR TWO, I GET SICK BUT IMMEDIATLY GET THE DESIRED RESULTS ONCE I START BACK.. IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE EVEN WITH THE INSURANCE, SO STOPPING BECOMES SOMETIMES NECESSARY.

Sleepiness Due To Shift Work Sleep Disorder	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	9/10/2008 3:44:22 AM	I have suffered from insonmia for years but within the past two years I have had a career change that requires me to be up, alert and functional during normal sleeping times. This medication has helped me stay awake, relatively alert and for the most part functional. I work eight days, off six and my shifts are 4,8,10.5,11 to 12 hours long. If it weren't for this medication there would be no way that I could keep this schedule. I have noticed some side effects within the past three months of the year that I have been taking this drug that aren't listed. I do have the mood changes and stress level coping skills becoming more apparent and harder to maintain along with several other side effects. But the most recent side effects are bloating not as in gas but just bloating and water retention. My ankles look like tree trunks, my feet like 2 by 4's...and they're already huge size 14, and my belly gets so bloated that the only relief I feel is when I can remove my clothes and extend my belly to its fullest and then I look 5-6 months preganet, and I'm male. The swelling of my feet get so bad that it makes walking difficult and painful and even worse after lying down or sleeping. It takes about 2 days for me to remove all of the excess water from my system and then I can walk without pain and my pants fit once again. I'm not sure if it's this medication or not but my sleeping patterns during work have come to absolute horror. I consider myself lucky if I can get 2-4 hours per afternoon. The sleep deprivation is making my life terrible! My time off is spent sleeping a great deal 12-15 hours the first few days off and then 9-7 there after. It's a necessary evil at this point but God, I wish I could get better sleep during my work week!

I felt like I had to take more to get the same effect as the first 6 months but then the more I took the more it made me a little sick so I had to stop taking it.  Too bad because it really pumped up my energy levels.  Now Im back to wanting to sleep all the time.  And I can, two, three days straight!

Provigil brought my life back to me. I have not experienced any side effects and the one factor I really like is, even though Provigil allows me to function as I used to during the day, if I want to lay down and just relax or take a &quot;power nap&quot; I am still able to do that. The one drawback would be the expense. I do not know how people manage to take Provigil unless they have insurance ---- even then it is still expensive, but I am more than willing to forgo whatever necesssary in order to take Provigil. By the way, I take one 200 mg tablet at 8 a.m. and one 200 mg table at noon. Again, I have MS and I'm so grateful for Provigil.

Not as sleepy during day. Dream at night now. No side effects. Has lifted mood, clarity and motivation. No super stimulating effects. Do not take after 12 noon. Hope it works for the long term. But you need to do other things as well. Exercise and staying busy are very important. Eat the right foods.

I awoke my son and told him he needed to get dressed so we could both join the militia. I continued to hallucinate for several hours longer, but when I returned from my garage and could not explain to my wife why there was blood streaming from my scalp, she drove me to the ER.  There, I was found to be in a state of cardiogenic shock, acute kidney failure and other organ difficulties amounting to multiorgan failure. I developed a rash, but my treating physicians did not note its significance as an indicator of Stevens Johnson Syndrome. I managed to survive this experience, if only barely. No amount of awakeness is worth dying for. Despite unpopular associations with the illegal drug culture, Dexedrine is a far safer drug than Provigil and I predict it will assume the place of Provigil once Provigil has been withdrawn from the market, as Vioxx was a few years ago.

Provigil worked in the beginning. I started at 100mg for a couple of months and increased to 200mg. It was great - I had fewer sleep attacks and was able to stay alert throughout the day. A few months ago, I found myself more and more sleepy, and my dosage increased to 400mg. Now I'm still tired. Not as tired as I would be if I wasn't on it...but still tired. I'm still having sleep attacks. I may be increasing to 600mg/day soon, but I'm not hopeful.

I slept about 16-20 hours a day on and off for the first couple years, until I was prescribed Provigil. I'm currently taking 300mg, and was at 400mg last month, but added Focalin XR and was able to decrease the Provigil. I probably take more than the average person on Provigil takes, but it works really great. The only thing I have found dissatisfing is some headaches that I get when I take extra medicine. I still have the headaches to some extent even at 300mg, as opposed to 400mg or 500mg. It does it's job.

It gives me energy that I otherwise would not have because I have a great deal of inflammation in my body.  Some days (rarely) it does not help, but if I did not take it I would be sleeping all the time.Thank you.

Provigil makes it possible to get through the day without falling asleep in my chair after work. SO far no side effects. I am also worried as the other post I saw about the person having fibromyalgia and taking other medications. My Doc knows of all my medications and mentionned no problems with any of them.

I am only 28 so we did blood work to make sure it wasn't anything like thyroid or anemia. It was great the 1st week no bad side effects but after the 1st week it not effective. The cost for me here in Texas (I'm not insured) $287.00 for 30 pills. I can't afford to pay that anyway but it would have been nice to have something that would work!

Sleepiness Due To Obstructive Sleep Apnea	pwhite97624, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/9/2008 3:20:19 AM	I have been unemployed for well over two years (lived off of savings). I put on at least 100 to 120 pounds during this period, and thus the Sleep Apnea began. I'm now 48 years old, very low-income, and without health insurance here in Southern Oregon. I can't afford insurance - PERIOD! Oregon has the &quot;Oregon Health Plan&quot;, but the funds are so dry that only women and children qualify. Anyway, this drug does work for me (I got an allotment from the manufacturer). I started a new job this week, work from 6 a.m. til 2 p.m., and I started up again with Provigil. I YAWNED AND YAWNED ALL WEEK LONG, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ? I was still &quot;alert&quot; and could listen to the girl training me. I will say that as the week wore on, I also drank a LOT OF COFFEE, but I was able to not feel &quot;sluggish&quot; and that &quot;awful sinking feeling&quot;. In the past I've nearly crashed my car twice (nearly). But with PROVIGIL I don't have to worry about this......sometimes I take two (one later in the day), and I can get my work (sitting in front of a computer all day) done. I like this drug, and recommend it. I don't have the CPAP (can't afford it), this generous donation from the manufacturer has saved my life and my job. Only warning is that over time, as my Doctor told me, your body will build a tolerance and more and more dosages will be required for the same effect. Solution ? Lose that weight, says my Doctor. He's also my age and a bit &quot;chunky&quot;. Being middle-aged really sucks sometimes...you can't use food as a &quot;refuge&quot; or &quot;consolation&quot; for life's cruelty or cruel people. The term &quot;comfort food&quot; has a lot of meaning for many of us.......and too much &quot;comfort food&quot; makes one fat-fat-fat ! Anyway, I wish everyone good luck with this sleep apnea problem -- it can be deadly in the long run, and I'm not ready to go just yet !

I have no apnea and can easily sleep 10 hours a night. A one or two hour nap is always welcome as well. Some people would kid me that I was lazy and that sleep is my favorite past time. Well, it is my favorite past time but I'm not lazy. I have 3 kids, two part-time jobs, a beautiful bayfront house and I go to the gym 5 days a week. I am at a healthy weight. What people don't understand is how hard it is to go through the day feeling like you're walking through mud. Yawning-sluggish-just wanting to..that's right-go to bed! Provigil has at least helped me stay awake during the day. I can still sleep 10 hours a night but at least I can skip the daytime naps. I have been prescribed 200 mg. a day but am taking 300-I will call my dr. next week and let him know I have uped the dosage. I have seen no funky side-effects. I would definatly recommend this especially to women who have to run a household, have small kids, ect. It's at least worth a try. Life is no fun when all you want to do is sleep.  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/29/2008 12:28:20 AM	I was prescribed provigil for chronic fatigue and difficulty concentrating. I was always really tired during the day, did not have sleep apnea or any other health problems and was sleeping for at least 9 hours plus at least 2- 3 hrs of napping. I have taken dexadrine and adderall, both of which had annoying side effects: increased urgency to urinate, sweating (bad!), dry and peeling (yuck) mouth, stomach pain, etc. Provigil has been great because I only experience slightly more urgency to urinate but not much else. I feel more awake and alert with Provigil. The drawback is it is very expensive and it doesn't help with concentration like adderall does. Provigil is amazing for those that need help with wakefulness. It may arguably be worth every penny.

I would like more energy, need a higher dose but it's so expensive (even in Canada) that I have to take a lower dose. When I could afford the higher dose things were better. This has to get generic soon, I hope. Meanwhile, I do what I can with it.

So far it has done it's job for me however I only take it when I feel it is absolutely necessary. My daughter has taken this medication for ADHD, prescribed by her psychiatrist...( that is how I learned of it. On my daughter, it made her terribly cranky, but it did keep her up during the day and focused. It just made her personality change to the point where she stopped taking it and he prescribed something else for her.

All I knew was that I was fighting hard to keep up my successful career, and it seemed to be getting harder all the time.According to my dr, Excessive Daytime Sleepiness Disorder runs in families, and I can see it in certain of my family members.I just did not have the energy or brainpower to keep up with work and home, and no amount of sleep seemed to help me shake it.  I knew something was really wrong because when I traveled, and upon boarding a plane, I would put my carry-ons up, sit down, and the next thing I knew, we were in the air.Provigil gave me my life back. I've been taking it for over 2 years now.  As far as I can tell, I've suffered no adverse reactions.  If I forget to take my next dose, my brain lets me know when it has run out of steam. But as long as I take my doses as prescribed, I am fully functioning all day long.  Power of concentration is back, grogginess is gone, and I have energy to do more than just veg out.This is a miracle drug for me!

I take 200mg tablet once a day early enough that it won't keep me awake at night. Super results without narcotic type euphoria.  Been taking for six years.  Because of the cost $10/pill) and insurance refusal to recognize effectiveness and refusal to pay for drug, I only take provigil once every 4 or 5 days.  Strange reactions from doctor regarding drug. Some think it's effective; another might think it's narcotic-like and addictive.  No addiction here.

I take 400 mg a day, I should say I was taking because I stopped taking it a week or so ago. And I should mention that I feel no different since I stopped taking it.

Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/24/2007 1:58:51 PM	I began taking this medication because like many of you I am on a lot of pain meds from a previous car accident and I also have Lupus SLE. I was sleeping whenever I could. I was missing my 1 1/2 year old and 5 1/2 year old. I wasn't able to give them their baths or rock the baby to sleep. I was in bed before them. Now I am able to play with them, take my daughter to school and pick her up, give them baths and rock the baby to sleep. Provigil gave me my life back. I just have one question for everyone taking it... Does anyone else notice a difference in the smell of their urine?

The first day I took this pill I was ecstatic at how good it made me feel. I was able to focus, I had enough energy to clean my house and most important of all just being able to get out of bed.I recommend this to people if your doc finds it appropiriate.My hardest time was when I had to come off of it due to pregnancy and then nursing my baby. I am happy that I am able to take it again. My neurologist who has MS himself takes it as well.I hope anyone who takes it has the same experience.

I've been suffering with  chronic pain for many many years, so I'm on pain medications for many years also. Which lead to constant sleepiness &amp; sometime I can't even tell what day it is, cause I've been sleeping for days. Only reason I'm waking is can't bear the pain even I'm sleeping &amp; because pain is so bad I can't reach pain pills. Finally I've spoke to my doctor about sleeping problem, because I've felt it's not worth living, when all I'm doing is nothing but sleeping &amp; taking pain pills. My doctor gave me PROVIGIL to try out &amp; next morning I've felted like a new person. I was up about 10hrs &amp; my mine was so clear, I could take care of my check book. Hallelujah!!!!Since then I've been doing very well. Except, my biggest problem is wonderful &quot; INSURANCE Co.s&quot;. Because I don't have &quot;Narcolepsy&quot; they denied every time. So, now I'm paying it out of my little Disability check I'm receiving &amp; it's very expensive, but lease I can leave like almost normal person, instead sleep my life away. Thank God for Provigil, even though I have less money.

It lasts about a year before I have to start again with one of the other ones. They all last about 1 year before I become immune or they are not as effective as they started out. It has been a godsend for me. It helps me focus and stay alert.  I like what it does for me, so does my husband, not so tired all the time.

Other	CFSprovigil, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	10/28/2007 6:08:40 PM	I'm taking Provigil for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which is an immune disorder. I've noticed I develop a low grade fever within an hour of taking Provigil. If I take it more than 2 days in a row, I become aware of succumbing to a general feeling of infection, so I make it a point to only take it for important events, at the most once a week. It DOES make it easier to get through a day, but I do have to pay for it in terms of rest for a couple of days after. I've also noticed I develop a headache around my eyes due to hyper-focusing my eyes, not my brain. To summarize, Provigil not only keeps my candle burning, it allows me to burn it at both ends.

However, I was one of the rare cases with the severe side effects.  I was completely unaware of the change in my mental/emotional state; I thought my feelings, moods, and thoughts were normal and justified.  My depression, irratiblity and abnormal thoughts almost caused me to get a divorce.  Luckily I stopped the medication and got a clearer mind.  Be very open to the observations of the people close to you.  They can notices changes that you don't see.

I can make it though most of the day before I fill like I will drop from exhaustion. I did have to &quot;Play&quot; with the time of day I take this so that it doesn't prevent me from sleeping at night.  If I take it around 11AM it seems to work best.

Provigil absolutely saved me from being a couch potato.  Before, I was spent after work and could do little besides go to bed after work - sometimes  not even strong enough to eat.  I still have intense fatigue daily, but taking more Provigil makes me too jittery and no sleep at night.

I have been alert, able to complete tasks and even got out in my garden. Although I overdid it, I felt great getting outside. I have learned to take it very early in A.M. as the later I take it the longer I am up at night. 8am should be the latest time to take the med. I will make sure I monitor myself with smart breaks, but overall I feel mentally and physically better. This is amazing.
