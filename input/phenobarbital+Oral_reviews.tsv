Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	Lstrm, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	8/3/2012 10:39:04 AM	I have taken Phenobarbital for 28 years for tonic clonic seizures.  Next week, I will be off of it after spending 3 years s-l-o-w-l-y reducing my dose with my neuro.  It has a lot of positives.  It works, is cheap, and is easy. The negatives are staggering, however.  Phenobarbital is a major depressive.  If you are on much of a dose at all, plan on also taking an antidepressant.  It changes your brain chemistry. Forever.  Studies were finally done in the early 2000s on its impact on the unborn.  It decreases our babies in utero.  Their cognition is decreased.  Forever.  The list goes on, but those are the &quot;biggies&quot; to me.  Thankfully, Topamax works for me too.

Other	zerostate, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	25-34	6/16/2012 10:10:47 AM	Lately I have been taking this for clonic movements originated by stress at work.  I had tried up to 4-5 different BZPs and they always stop working after a few monthsI don't want to up the dose anymore than I already have fpr valium, xanax, ativan, klonopin, et al; in case I get &quot;out of it&quot; and inadvertently damage something/hurt someone from inattentiveness. 100-300mg of this, taken every 2-4 days, helps to relax me and most importantly stops my stress-related spasms temporarily.  I know there are alot of contraindications, and I use almost all of them, particularly alcohol (no more than 2 drinks day, usually drink six days of the week).  I worried about contraindications including alcohol as well as other CNS depressants (e.g. BZDs, antihistamines, opioids(.  Thanks!

The combination is an old &quot;cocktail&quot; but was basically the only thins avialable when I was DX w/ Grnd Mal Epilepsy (now Tonic/Clonic)  Seizure free for the past 10 + yrs... more side effects from the Dilantin, but, to be able to drive and work, I am willing to deal with the side effects.  Works for me!  Won't change a thing!

It is about the anti-convulsant that I have not had an allergic reaction to.  I have to take a fairly large dose, but I have adjusted well.  Been using for over 20 years.  And you cannot beat the price.

Dr. wants me to eliminate klonopin from my system w/in 14 days--each day, lessening the typical 6 mgs of klonopin and coupling the lowering of klonopin mgs. via using phenobarbital.  ???  I just began said schedule and feel extremely unsure of this expedient &quot;weaning&quot; schedule AND the intake of phenobarbital for 28 days (approx.).  THEN, I am to be &quot;free&quot; of klonopin for good.  Thoughts?  Related experiences?

The doctors put him on this medication. He experienced loss of appetite. Was always sleeping. The doctors blamed a neurological disorder and increased the dosage. As they increased the dosage he would eat less and would not gain weight. A side effect of this medication. Eventually they were overdosing him on this medicine. He is 18 months old. Has only had the one seizure and has needed a feeding tube since 3mo. Needless to say I am extremely dissatisfied with this medication. Oh, and parents. Withdraws from this medication are potentially fatal in infants and small children.
Repeated Seizures with Unconsciousness Between Episodes	Black Diamonds, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/7/2011 12:35:56 AM	One of the most effective drug unfortunately the HMO Insurance Neurologist who had placed me on this (plus other drugs) destroyed it (yes, your body can develop tolerance and/or resistance). It was a shame in what that Doctor did, but in turn the good news is; everyone is safe because that Doctor's license is revoked forever! Due to this Doctor, he had me on beyond toxicity levels where not only I had side effects but other medical issues as well (alongside with the other &quot;anti-convulsant&quot; medications {old terminology} was just too much for me), had to be hospitalized to be titrated off of all these drugs and back to square one and with another Neurologist.Sadly, this was the first drug on the allergy list that I can never go back to again - not even it's related drug, Mysoline, for that is also &quot;discontinued&quot; because it &quot;makes&quot; Pheno.

That doesn't mean that I have been &quot;satisfied&quot; with the experience...to be on any drug is to forfeit control of your life.

Can cause severe depression, rapid tooth decay and osteoporosis.

Rotted my teeth out . I finally just stopped taking it and food tastes much better and the anger is gone. been off it for 10 yrs and you could never pay me enough  money to take it again.Phenobarbital is a evil drug and the doctors will never tell you about known side effects, that it destroys your body over time or that it may make you very aggressive / violent .by the way I took it for seizures that started after a car accident when I was 4 due to a head trauma that the doctor said caused me to have seizures. I still remember the principal in my school saying to my parents that I was retarded and should go to a special school.I wish he could have been put on 300mg a day to see him try and do his job. I run my own business , build homes and resteraunts.find a better medication for your children for their sake please.

Seizures	 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5			11/16/2007 10:20:35 AM	i have been on phenobarbital since 1985, when i had my first seizure, and through a combination of that drug and dilantin, i have not had a seisure. though i wonder why it is that 64.8mg of phenobarbital is considered the same dosage amount as 60mg. just looking at the numbers, it seems to me that 64.8mg is a higher dose that 60mg. i only mention this because i seem to get more drossy the day i began taking the tablets with the medicine bottle labeled 64.8mg.

Simple Partial Seizures	Marcia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	55-64	10/8/2007 9:03:07 AM	I was put on this medication in 1991 after having partial and then a grand mal seizure. At first it worked pretty good but then the seizures returned.I was put on 3 different other drugs(tergtol,topramx &amp; Limictal ?sp. but they only made seizures worse. Am back on Pheno and usually have seizures every 1-2 wks.They generally are for one day only.
