Cough		2	3	1			3/6/2012 6:43:09 AM	I gave this medicine to two of my children, both teenagers. I had phone calls from both of their school nurses telling me that they were jittery, light headed, and overall not feeling well. They are still not 100% a day after taking the medicine!! We will NEVER use delsym again!!

Cough	Cole, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/19/2011 7:18:01 PM	I didn't get quite 12 hours out of it like the box said. I got about 6 hours of relief from the cough and the side effects stayed for about 8. I know many reviews complain of the &quot;drunk&quot; feeling as a side effect and I do not disagree, however, it's not that bad compared to other liquids that knock me out cold. I would rather concentrate harder than lose my job for falling asleep. I had some problems with enunciating my words and some tingling in my face and arms but nothing severe. I spoke with my pharmacist and he said I was OK and it is a normal cough medicine side effect. I have always been hyper-sensitive to side effects on OTC and RX meds so I wasn't all that surprised.

Cough	radishes, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	13-18	2/16/2011 10:25:13 PM	(i am a 16 year old female with some kind of chest cold....) i personally took this and it completely knocked me out at first, i found it affective for my chest mucus but i didnt hve any nasal mucus so i dont know how it does with that. i took the maximum amaount, went to sleep and did some strange things. i woke up at approx. 10:45 after just falling asleep fast at 9:20... i usually wake up at 5:30 and even though now i am aware that the clock said 10:45 i thought i had woken late... like 6:45... freaking out i woke up my brothers while texting my boyfriend... the memories foggy, but i texted him asking him odd questions and spelling atrocialy. i felt almost high all day and while taking other drugs with it, would feel tingly. now i look back on my day and it feels like a dream. an odd medication but i worked ok. i still lost my voice now and then but the cough was to a minimum.
Cough	ofnac, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/9/2011 7:26:56 PM	This is a great cough syrup to take for that annoying dry cough that kicks into high gear when you lay down at night. One teaspoon helps me get a full night sleep. Doesn't really work if you have a mucus driven cough, you just need to get that stuff out the hard way. I was concerned about the price when I first tried it, but the portion is small, so in the long run it's cheaper than other medications, as well as more effective. 
Cough	Dana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/22/2010 10:20:22 AM	I tried this on my son (almost 4 yr.). I gave him the recommended 1/2 tsp. before bed. He slept with me that night &amp; still coughed ALL night. When I woke him up the next morning at 7am, he was VERY wide eyed and happy (he is usually completely grumpy). His pupils were dialated &amp; he seriously looked high. It creeped me out so much that I didn't want to look at him. I remember now that I've tried it on my daughter (now 8 yr.) and had similar results. I will not give them this medicine again. It doesn't do a bit of good. 
Cough	delsymdrunk, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/30/2010 11:21:20 AM	It has mostly stopped the coughing, but I feel dizzy and lightheaded, almost like being drunk.  I don't know that I could function at work like this, but if you're on a &quot;sick day&quot; at home and sleeping, it will help you get some rest. 
Cough	280retreads, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	65-74	2/26/2010 1:02:07 PM	I was hacking away and I took the prescribed dose every 12 hours.  It didn't work at first but after one day it has stopped my cough.  I am slightly dizzy and euphoric, but I can still function and I definitely am coughing much less.  
Cough	almollings, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/14/2010 8:04:18 PM	Have used this drug while taking mucinex (guafinesin) to help resolve respitory infection. Also have asthma. Mucinex helps to loosen mucas great, but i have noticed over a few days of use  it caused excessive non productive (dry) coughing. So my Dr, a pulmonologist, suggested Delsym. He also said the the recommended dosage on the box is too low. Suggested 2 table spoons not 2 teaspoons. Anyway, worked great, stopped coughing, while mucas continued to loosen. Also used a netty pot, to keep sinuses moists.

Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	1/27/2010 5:48:36 AM	My 7 year old daughter has had a cough, fever, and headache going on three days. Took her to the doctor yesterday evening and there's no flu, strept, or other infections. I've been giving her tylenol for fever/headache &amp; mucinex (powder packets) for coughs. Don't seem to be working so I asked the nurse what I can give her. She said Delsym. I gave my daughter her one and only dose at 7:45pm right before bedtitme. She's been up twice during the night with severe nose bloods. Now granted maybe the dryness of this bitter cold Chicago night might be something to consider but I have never seen this much blood come out of a child's nose. I started researching this drug and it doesn't attack the cough. It's suppresses the part of the brain that makes you want to cough. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. I will stick to elderbury, honey, and cinnamon tea to hopefully get my daughter back to heath.
Cough	LISA, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	12/8/2009 6:19:41 PM	This product did not work for me whatsoever. If anything I think it made me cough more... 
Cough	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	11/20/2009 12:09:35 PM	I've taken this twice now, both times right before bed and both times I've woken up feeling drunk. My vision is weird, all movement feels weird, and I can't get rid of the hic ups to save my life! Got rid of the cough tho..
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	11/18/2009 9:04:00 AM	My son is 4 yrs old and has not had a full night sleep or a nap in 2 days. He is irritable and not himself at all. My son is usually a very laid back 4 yr old who sleeps through the night and takes a nap daily until we started using delsym. We will not be using this medication again.  
Other	nicole, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	9/19/2009 7:16:50 PM	I took this at half the dose for my cough and nothing. My roomie took a little more than a single dose and he became so wild and crazy that he pulled a gun out on me. This drug causes hallucinations. It should be taken of the market immediatly! He has never done anything to harm me in the years I've known him! I DO blame this product!
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	9/10/2009 2:27:02 PM	I feel like I have had a bottle of wine.  I can't take this again if I need to function at the same time.  I am also a health care provider and will not recommend this to my patients/family/friends again!

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/14/2009 12:46:08 AM	I had addiction to Delsym, taking around 800mg per day. I know I have been near death several times. I suffered all of the common side effects as well as seritonin syndrome. I have kidney damage as well. If you are abusing this med or know someone who is please get help. I thougt that a product that was safe for children would not be as harmful as other abuseable drugs. I know this sounds silly but when you are trying to get high who wants to read the warnings. This product also contains EDTA as inactive ingredient which can be very harmful (edetate disodium). PLEASE CONTACT POISON CONTROL, AND SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION, BE SURE TO BRING THE PACKAGE SO THAT DR. CAN EVALUATE ALL INGREDIENTS AND THEIR ADVERSE REACTIONS.

Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	4/23/2009 1:54:08 AM	I took my son to urgent care where they suggested that I give him Delsym, prior to that I had never heard of it! He's 2.5 and the doctor didn't recommend a doseage. I had no idea what it could do! My son has been in a hazy eyed, drunken state for the past three days, I didn't realize that Desylm was the culprit until I took him to the doctor to figure out what was going on?! Running into walls, tripping over his own feet, jumping off of everything, hiding under beds, intentionally wetting his pants... these are just a few of the symptoms. I'm just praying that it works it's way out of his system and I get my son back!! DO NOT ADMINISTER THIS DRUG TO YOUR CHILDREN!!!
Cough	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	35-44	4/2/2009 12:44:56 PM	I have been taking this medication for the last 4 days for a cough associated with my allergies. I had no side affects in the beginning, but during the last 2 days my head has been spinning and feeling very lightheaded. Being this disoriented just will not work for me. I am looking for other options. 
Cough	ladybuilder, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	3/25/2009 2:19:41 PM	I have only taken two doses and withing two hours I have gotten diarrhea.  It slows my cough, but i guess it is forcing the phlegm out of one end instead of the other....
Cough	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	3/10/2009 12:15:32 PM	This medicine does not work.  It should be taken off the market for the side effects alone.  Kids are abusing it and getting high with it.For a cough, a spoonful of honey works better!

Other	6 Bluiz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	3/3/2009 11:33:37 PM	My 6 year old was on 1 dose of Deslym and had a severe reaction.  She began to hallucinate, blood shot eyes, and seemed as if in a drunk state of mind and shallow breathing.  She was confused and saw things that weren't in the room.  My daughter became dizzy and out of it.  I will never let my child take this drug again.  I only gave her 1/2 tsp as recommend by her pediatrian.
Cough	Read the warnings, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	1/13/2009 3:40:55 AM	I had a very bad cold and decided to try Delsym, I should have read the warnings and will in the future.  After being on the cough med for 4 days I started feeling very weird, voices in my head and feeling very disoriented. After the ER couldn't diagnose me and released me unable to drive attentively I did make it home and continued to feel very unusal, including tingling skin (arms) and continuing to hear voices,  I went to my family practice doctor the next day barely able to think or function, I was sent to the hospital where it was discovered that I had had a reaction of my medecine and the Deslym that had effected the oxygen getting from my lungs to my brain.  The warning is on the lable, DO NOT TAKE IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE 80% OF AMERICANS THAT MAY BE ON A ANIT-ANXIETY OR ANTI-DEPRESSION MEDICATION!
Cough	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	19-24	12/8/2008 5:08:20 PM	Same situation as the person with the &quot;out of body experience.&quot; Definitely not a drug you want to take before going to work for the day. Very effective against the cough but was dazed and spinning the full 12 hours. Had to go home early because of this side effect.
Cough	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	11/12/2008 2:58:17 PM	My son started choking his friends after 2 doses.

Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/10/2008 9:17:46 PM	I don't know if the Delsym company has done research on the  side effects of this drug on kids 4years old. I have been giving my son this medicine 1x in the morning and 1x night a small dose (less than a teaspoon each time) for the last couple of days for a cough. My son's behavior has done a 380. He is super hyper, super active and non-compliant with my and his teachers directives. He is a complete person on this medicine. I cannot specifically say that this medicine is at fault but I am definitely not going to be giving him this medicine anymore. I rather hear him cough. 
Cough	AnnaM, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	6/7/2008 11:51:23 PM	This medicine knocked out my cough within an hour of taking it, but the side effects were not worth it to me. I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience with dizziness and nausea on top of that for the full 12 hours. If I need to take it again, I might take less than the recommended dosage so I don't have such terrible side effects.
Cough	coughfy-coughfy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/4/2008 8:08:56 AM	It helped me during winter season and it is easy to remember the time you have to take it (only BID). It is really cost-effective. I like the flavor too.
Cough		5	5	5			12/19/2007 8:20:26 PM	This medication stopped my son from coughing and allowed both of us to get a good night's slee.
Cough	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	12/17/2007 11:52:56 AM	I have had a severe cough for about 4 days now, and this medication really didn't even touch it. But then again, nothing I have tried has ever worked, so maybe it's just me.
