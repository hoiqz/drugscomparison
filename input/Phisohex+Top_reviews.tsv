My acne outbreaks are reduced. Only a few samll outbreaks every so often. The scarring is still noticeable but breakouts have reduced significantly.

I never had any side effect from it.I also used it occasionally at home for my face if I had a cold and I never had herpes problem.I suspect that this product was too good and often misused, so the patronizing FDA forbade it. On the other hand, it now approves many drugs who make people sicker or even kill them, but that is OK. Big drug companies make a bundle out of it and FDA gets its share no doubt.As another person said, get it with a prescription or go online to a Canadian pharmacy.I am sorry to say that the FDA is another government agency tuned dysfunctional. I was so proud of it once upon a time.

Boils recur on scalp, need more pHisoHex to control it. Nothing else helps at all.    HELP !!!   --js

It is still on the market, but it is ONLY BY PRESCRIPTION NOW. They keep it behind the counter in the pharmacy. A lot of pharmacies don't keep it in stock anymore, so call your dr first to have them call you in some, just in case

It does not seem to work for me. Lately my acne just seems to have gotten worse. I would not rule out trying it though as it as worked wonders for many people. 
Other	Czech Chick, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/20/2011 4:12:28 PM	For years (starting in my teens now 51)Phisohex helped some of my skin irritations from acne, boils and psoriasis. I only used when I had flare ups.  Over the last 3 year I have not been able to get it.  I referenced it to my doctor - never heard of it Hmmm. I must admit I called it prescription Phisoderm.Just yesterday, I was informed by pharmacist at the local CVS - that he recalled the product, not much call for it and if I had a script he could try to special order it - but doubted it was still produced.I will be more specific when I see my physician next and see what happens, but like many of the other reviews, I wonder is it still even manufactured and can you get it in the U.S. via prescription?
Other	ftrrd, 25-34 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/7/2011 4:06:42 PM	For everyone writing about pHisoHex:This product was in fact used regularly by many in the 1950's and 60's and it was used to bathe newborns in. However, the reason you do not find it anymore in drug stores is because it was found that the chemical causes neurological damage with prolonged use. You should not try and order this product from out of the country and use it for this reason among many others associated with buying meds from another country!
Other	 (Patient) 	4	4	4			4/30/2011 10:02:42 PM	Phisohex was prescribed to me because I had 5 episodes of MRSA skin infections and I have been told to use it for 2 weeks daily all over my body. I will be done in 2 days and am praying I have no more MRSA. It was prescribed by my MD and I had no issues getting it from CVS.

I have never actually used phisohex, but am considering giving it a try on my acne. Never had acne until I turned 26 and it keeps getting worse I am 28 now. Wondering for the ones that have used it on acne, how did they do it. Once a week, everyday, and how bad does it dry you out?
Other	dznuts, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/7/2010 3:59:00 PM	about 12 years ago my bf's parents brought me this product from canafda. I have such bad acne around my mouth and between my eyebrows. THis is the only product that ever worked. It cleared it up with one wash right in front of my eyes. I could never find it again. Years later I asked a dermatologist and he said he thinks its not sold int he states cause it causes tumors in monkeys.  Well I don't know the truth but i want it. I am breaking out like i am 17 again and nothing is working. all the products i use make it worse. the only place i can find Phisohex is on ebay from Australia. for like $35.00 for a small bottle.

They no longer carry it across the counter.  Some pharmacy's tell you that you have to have a perscription and when you do they tell you you can buy it over the counter but have to order it.To my surprise the 5oz bottle was $27.00 and the l6 oz bottle was $57. Why such a increase over the years? We all used this for years for acme.  
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/10/2010 11:46:43 PM	As a kid growing up from 1961 on, Phisohex was a mainstay in our OTC products. Used for uncomfortable skin rashes of all sorts, a cleanser, a antiseptic scrub etc. It always healed the effected area in short order. Often it was used in a warm bath for soaking groin/sweat rash after days of football practice. My mom was a RN and it was a standard item in the dr's office and hospital...now can't find it anywhere and no one including the local doctors or nurses seem to be able to indicate why? I had a recent skin rash which was treated with a week of Prednisone, Bactrum, and a ointment for two weeks and it still hasn't gone away...I am willing to bet one soak or two in a hot tub with my good ol friend Phiso and I would not still be in pain but completely rash free! PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET

My doctor had recommended it to me and at that time it could be purchased over the counter. It worked wonders! I wish it was available now for my teenage daughter's acne.  Is it available by prescription?

Nothing I tried seemed to help, until I got pHisoHex. It cleared the cradle cap up in one treatment &amp; it never came back.  The exzema took a bit longer, but no ill effects were noted, either.  She is now in her 50's &amp; going strong.  I thought this had been taken off the market. My Dachshund has a skin condition &amp; I thought he could benefit from pHisoHex, too. I hope I can find it somewhere.

Other	samk44, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/30/2010 9:52:48 AM	I have been using this product for several years. Our family was hit by MRSA infections and our Dr. had us use bactroban and this soap after we showered. We left it on for about a minute or two, then rinsed off. It was the only thing that controlled the outbreak in our family and prevented it from returning. We only use it occasionally now. I am about to run out of what I had left and I can't find it anywhere. I am really in a panic. I don't know what our family will do without it. MRSA is a very serious thing and very contageous. Why would they take this off the market when it's the only thing that helps with this infection? It makes no sense at all, unless they want people to suffer. Why can't they just keep it away from use on babies and small children if it harms them and give them something milder to use. We need this. It also keeps my Lupus rash in control. Please bring this back. Our whole family will be miserable without it.

She used it when they washed and in their laundry.  After months of being reinfected with MRSA it was finally gone...I think this is a great product!
Other	toosy68@hotmail.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/18/2009 12:27:48 PM	I have used this treatment (Phisohex) for ten years and have found no problems with it.  I used it as a face wash and have received many compliments on how well my face looked.  A doctor recommended it after I was getting boils/acne on my face.  Since I started it, I have never had any more boils/acne (whatever you want to call it) on my face.  The only reason I am not using it now is because I cannot get it.  I have been out of it since December of 2008 and my Pharmacy keeps telling me it's on back order, but today (11/18/09) when I called them again, I was told it was stopped.  I would like to know why?  Does anyone out there know?  And is there a substitute for it?  I decided to google it to see if I can get any information, and a link directed me to WebMD to share my information.  I wanted people to know that it was a good product for me, and I truly miss using it.

I have been using phisohex for 15 years, and have cut the amount of boils I get to 3 a year from 3 a month. I am now told that the makers of phisohex will no longer sell this product. Does anyone know of a substitute for phisohex. I am very troubled with the thoughts of going back to that constant pain.The boils I used to get on my upper thighs, my butt, and under my breast, were so painful, that I sometimes could not walk, sit, or wear cloths. There must be more people out there that have been so greatly helped with phisohex, please let me know if you have had any help from other products.

A short while later she began having seizures...I believe it was caused by this product.  When medical professionals know the potential damage this product can cause if not used properly, and they continue to use it, someone else suffers.  I think this should be banned.
