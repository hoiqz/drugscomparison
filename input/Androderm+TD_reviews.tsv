My insurance company is giving me a hard time but you can't put a price on the quality of life improvement. I would make other sacrifices to pay for this myself if the coverage is dropped.

I also gained some strength. After two months, I looked as if I had been hitting the gym.  My wife was impressed. But the patches left itchy, red sores on my body that took several days to disappear. I switched to the GEL. The gel is not as convenient to use.  But, it does not give me those large, red welts. Ask your doctor for AndroGEL which is the gel form of Androderm. For the first several months, my insurance company helped with the cost. Then suddenly they decided that they would not cover testosterone therapy. I stopped using because of the cost.

After the first 2 weeks I felt I was gaining more energy, but  now it seems to no longer to be working. Plus, I am experiencing deep burning pain in my arms &amp; shoulders. Hydrocondone doesn't help much. Has anyone else had this side effect?

Has anyone had this experience?? He has a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma so he's seen his oncologist &amp; has a biopsy scheduled. I'd rather this be some sort of rare reaction to the patches verses a Hodgkin's relapse.

For an unknown reason my pituitary gland is not making LH.  The patch does not stick well and I have painful bright red raised rashes where the patch was applied.  I am young and like to take off my shirt so I am having a hard time finding places to put it.  Quality and frequency of erections is much improved.  My mood and memory are much better.  My condition is not just age related androgen deficiency so I have other things going on but the patch is much better and more consistent than Depo-T injections.

After two weeks I started to feel great with less back pain, more energy  and back to taking care of business. After 23 days I woke up one morning and was shocked to see 6 bright red rashes where patches were placed. They itched like crazy and took weeks for the strawberry raised rash to go away. Stopped using them and hope there is something else in the marketplace that will work

My testosterone level was extremely low. I started the Androderm patch about 15 months ago. I feel much better physically and mentally. I have more energy than before. The side effects has been an increase in allergic reaction to the site. Red patches, itchy and slightly burning are becoming more and more frequent. This didn't happen much for the first year, but increased a lot in the past three months. I would definitely recommend it as a help to those men with low T levels.

Haven't had desire to make love. Wasn't able to stay hard, very tiered all the time and no matter what I did couldn't loose weight. Just started one day woke up this morning with a erection. I was going to open a bottle of champain, haven't happened since I was a teen ! Leading up to this all,I didn't even know about low Testosterone and the afects it has on men until I saw a comercial and heard the Guy talking about his symptoms and decided to tell my doctor what I was feeling, so I was tested and the results shock me my level was 130 ! At my age it should be in the 500 ! So here I am. To get the Patch to stick I use medical tape and it stays on. If you are like me and are feeling the way I did don't waste time and tell your doctor to check your Test, because you will be happy you did ! Good Luck &amp; God Bless

It also boosted my mood and decreased anxiety levels. On the downside, the side effect is irritably and unattractive. I experienced very noticeable red rashes where the patches were placed. These rashes have been extremely itchy and takes 2 to 4 weeks to clear up!

Unfortunately, it tries to push too much into too small an area and can leave itchy burn marks that take weeks to heal. Better to go to a local pharmacist and have blended a custom-mix topical gel prepared without this side effect and at a greatly reduced cost.

Although the patches don't stick as well as I'd like, this could be the result of my overly oily skin and persperation; however, with the addition of a little good quality tape, I've overcome this problem. I have seen an increase in energy, muscle mass, body hair, sexual desire and sexual ability(quality of erections). I've also seen a decrease in body fat, mood swings or depression and (being diabetic) blood sugar levels. My overall physical and mental health have improved and my sexual partners are also happy. Most excellent.

My wife and I have sex about every 6 months or so.  My doc said that my T is low and prescribed Androderm.  I have been on it for about 2 months now.  It sticks just fine and doesn't come off till I want it to.  I haven't showered with it on yet.  My sex drive had not improved.  I still have no energy.  I have seen a little more body hair than before, but that's about it.  I'll try it for a few more months.  If nothing changes, why use it?

I use a medical tape from drug store called paper tape. no problems.  Deficiency in Testosterone made me apathetic towards work, overwhelmed by life, generally tired, and a lack or sexual desire.  All of those conditions have been greatly helped and my wife and I am very pleased.  It does not fix all problems, just replaces testosterone so you want to fix your own problems

The exercise I was doing was not producing results afte age 50 and this medication has worked wonders at reducing the aging effect of life and maintains a healthier muscle mass. The secondary benefit is the symtoms of slight Anxiety were removed. Sexual benefits is hard to gage but there seems to be an increae desire effect upon some who use this medication.

I do notice a bigger sexual appetite then I had but that was never a concern of mine before taking this.  Patches are easy to use but do not stick as good as they should and tend to come off or move during excercise and subsequent shower.
