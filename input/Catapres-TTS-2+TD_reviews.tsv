Catapres-TTS-2 caused severe depression, where I experienced hatred and temper which I have never had in my life.

Dropped BP an additional 20-30 points!Switched to generic Clonidine patch which never stayed on even with overlay.  Would recommend sticking with Catapres TTS unless you are sedintary and don't sweat or move much. I also take Minoxidil (10mg) x2, Metoprolol Succ ER (100mg), Ramipril (10mg), Hydrochlorothiazide (25mg), Potassium CL ER (20MEQ) x2, Nexium (40mg) and have no obvious side effects from anything other than lower blood pressure, from 220/110 to 130/80.

Had to replace after 1 day and then the next one still did not stick.  Stick with name brand-no generic.
High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	65-74	8/2/2009 10:54:10 PM	If I put the patch on and take my oral meds. at the same time, I get a very severe case of orthostatic hypotension.  Then the last 2 days of the patch my BP  begins to rise to higher levels than the first few days of the use of the patch.

Can't you guys find a glue that doesn't itch so bad and causes me scars from scratching. The only reason I tolerate this side effect is because it also helps with my smoking cessation and HOT FLASHES. As you can see I am taking it a for all three of the main reasons stated in the condition drop down menu.

High Blood Pressure	judy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	5/7/2008 3:12:11 PM	This worked great, and I had been on many meds before that did nothing. The only thing is that I have so many allergies that after 4 weeks I had blisters under the patch and had to switch to Clonidine which is the same thing, only pill form and I have to take it more times a day. I would definetly still be on the patch if I could.
