Vitamin D Deficiency	Nick45, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	4/10/2012 5:33:26 PM	My initial doses were to take the Rx daily.  Oh my goodness.  I've been experiencing spasms on the inside of my rib cage. The ribs actually prevented me from rubbing/soothing the spasm.  Now, I'm only taking Rx  once a month but still experience spasms within my ribs for the following seven to ten days.

Vitamin D Deficiency	Deceived, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	65-74	12/17/2010 9:31:26 PM	The doctor assured me that Drisdol Maximum D3 is vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol. IT IS NOT!!!IT IS VITAMIN D2, OR ERGOCALCIFEROL!!! It is made by irradiating mushrooms. Dr. R Vieth, a prominent researcher, has concluded that vitamin D2 should not be regarded as a nutrient suitable for supplementation! I discovered it was D2 when my blood test showed both vitamin D2 and D3. The first person I talked to at the pharmacy where I got the drug told me it was vitamin D3, but I later talked to a pharmacist who agreed it is D2. She said my doctor had prescribed D3 but in doses that was only available as D2, so they called my doctor who said to give me the D2. The pharmacist said it happens frequently that doctors prescribe vitamin D3 in doses only available as D2, and no wonder since the drug company has deceptively named their vitamin D2 &quot;Maximum D3&quot;!!  My side effects included abdominal pain and bad anxiety.I am surprised that the FDA would allow such deceptive practice!!

Three days later, I am broken out in whelts, they are painful and itch. Worse ones on my chin and around my eye. Dozens on both arms and legs and all in between. My head is full and I want to use a Brillo pad on them.  My Vitamin D level was 8.6 and I had surgery in the same week of diagonis. I am also experiencing extreme joint pain in entire body. Moving my arms and neck is horrible.Has anyone else experienced this type of reaction? I couldn't reach my DR but spoke with my pharmacist and he said it could be any one of three things I am current taking - Vitamin D, Hydrocodone and Cipro  (the last two pertain to my surgery)

Had all sorts of symptoms associated with low vitamin D levels.  It took doctors 5 years to discover it.  I am now a new person.  Lots of energy.  Pain level drastically lowered. Vitamin D now in normal range. Take it every other week, along with 2000 units daily.  I'm a new person.
Vitamin D Deficiency	Jim, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	3	Male	45-54	12/16/2008 11:12:42 PM	50000 IU capsules on a weekly basis seems to be nothing but a ploy to charge heavy for the prescription drug.  The oral drops of Calcidol and Dridol are 8000 iu/ml.  If one takes 1 ml per day for 7 days, it will be ~56000 iu(8000x7).  In my opinion, the use of Vitamin D on a daily basis is more effective than weekly tablet which just offers only convinience.  In addition drops are more conviniet (mix with food or liquid) than taking a capsule.  I continue to take 2000 iu of Calcidol drops on a regular basis and have well maintained my levels. 
Vitamin D Deficiency	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	9/6/2008 5:07:09 AM	I have been on a 3-month therapy treatment for Vitamin D deficiency (level of 11). Following treatment my level has only increased by approximately 3 points to a level of 14; this is with taking 50000 I.U. per week.
