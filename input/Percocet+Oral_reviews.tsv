I have tried several other pain medications such as hydrocodone and tramadol. I have also taken muscle relaxers, and Lyrica. If your pain is severe and you also have nerve pain as I do, I recommend asking your doctor about this medication.

I got sick on the patches, oxycotinv All the spinal injections gave me next to no relief. Seen many professionals and can't have surgery. This drug at least gets me out of the bed and able to have some kind of a life. I can control the usage but it does take discipline. I can see where some people would abuse it .  A+ rating

Had cervical laminectomy in 2004. Can't use Oxycontin, due to severe itching, vicodin is okay but doesn't help the pain much and percocets make me sweat like I'm in the 7th circle of hell, even though they help with pain taken in conjunction with 600 mg ibuprofen.  20 mg liquid morphene is perfect for high pain days..no side effects, no tiredness, just no pain, but lots of luck getting it..my pain doc that I went to gave me 20 mg morphene pills sustained release and they ARE NOT the same..gave me stomach cramps, destroyed my appetite and didn't do crap for pain. I have had no trouble over 8 years with getting addicted to any pain meds.  If you are careful and do not take more than what you need and even take less on days you can get by with less, you will have no problem.  If you are popping them just because you have them whether you need them or not..you will develop a tolerance faster and also will become addicted. I need to go back to my doctor and find something for bad pain days that works without making me sweat to death...if it weren't for the sweating, these would be fine.  For those of you with fibromyalgia and other inflammatory issues...TART Cherry juice..in the refrigerator section at your grocery store.  About 17 dollars for a bottle, but it works and lasts for quite a while..also pineapple contains anti-inflammatory qualities...taking the Tart Cherry Juice got me off of the anti-depressant med for fibro pain~I got relief within several days of taking it. The less meds you can get by with..the better for you and your health!

I can not take more than very small quantities of this drug without these spasms and cramping in my hands. I also notice severe joint pain if I take more than 1/2 tablet per day. The cramping and pain fades when I cut back on the dosage.

Pain	Spartan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/11/2012 2:18:42 AM	I am an acute migraine sufferer for more than 20 years, ever since a combat related injury occured. Orginally I used the Percocet as a break through drug for migraines lasting more than 2 days and  when max doses of other drugs are not working. This drug has helped very well. But now,instead of taking this when the pain meds I have do not help, I take Percocet in the morning with Tylenol 3 and once in the evening with Tylenol 3. Doing this allows me to be pain free and be proactive and stave off the pain ahead of time. Because of this, I went from having to go to the emergency room 1 to 3 times per month when the regular meds did not work so they can give me a shot of Dilaudid, to having to get a shot of Dilaudid only 2 times this whole year. It works and my quality of life has improved 75% or more. I also use p/t, chiropractic care and accupunture as well as exercise to deal with muscle aches and stiffness. Migraines are only a part of the issue, I also suffer acute spinal pain from combat injuries and nerve damage to right side. So, this drug has helped 100 fold for me.

Unclear as to whether it was helpful with pain or not. Couldn't sleep after my last dosage in that I would wake up after 10-30 seconds with severe, choking-type apnea. Have had untreated sleep apnea that is fine when I sleep on my side in the past. Believe that the drug aggravates soft palate conditions.

Other	Alan, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	3	Male	55-64	10/12/2011 2:51:32 PM	Percocet 10 is prescribed for me for relief of pain in the hip, wrist, back and shin. I have to say, it has no effect on my pain whatsoever. I don't ken the pain relief aspect of this medication.It does provide a mild plesant sensation or &quot;euphoria&quot; when it first takes effect and so I continue to use it, though &quot;euphoria&quot; grossly overstates the effect. The effect then wears off in short order, perhaps two hours. It is very like a shot of whisky in that way, though I never drink alcohol. I have no sensation of addiction, beyond the addiction that would accompany any other plesant habit. Certainly, nothing like alcohol or tobbacco. When it is available, I take recourse in it. When it isn't, I don't. It is generally too difficult to obtain and inures too easily for it to ever be a problem at the level of alcohol.

After three months of pain, my orthopedic specialist finally prescribed Percocet for me.  (I was born with one kidney, so I'm limited to acetaminophen-based medications.) I only take a half of a pill each time because it's really strong.  As far as side effects go, I've only noticed a bit of itching in my face (which I've had with any narcotic I've taken) and I feel a bit warm and loopy.  It's manageable with just half a dose, but I don't drive when I take it, just in case.

I take this with 90 mg Morphine a day and the only difference I feel is when I run out my pain definitely increases,so at least it takes the edge off.I don't know if increasing the dosage will help,but I take 3pills every 4 hours now.Any more has to be bad for me. If you have only a quick onset of pain,this would be effective.However;I don't think it is the answer for my chronic pain.

As i am. I want alternatives other than perks. These are no diff. than herion people it may take the pain away but eventually your doc is gonna stop you. think about it.... talk to your doc. about the withdrawls please for your saftey... I have a doc who thinks arthritis is a joke and theres no pain with it and now im fighting every month to get my script so I can work. I do landscaping and i dont know anything else.

Pain	bogey5, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4		45-54	8/2/2011 5:41:59 PM	Just a little background. I suffered a severe neck injury( 3 surgeries) that rendered me completely disabled way before my time.  I had to resign my job and give up golf and other activities that I loved due to constant pain. I tried morphine, fentanyl and others but I could barely get out of bed. My Dr. then put me on percocet 10/325  four times daily and it  has been very effective in taking the edge off of my pain.  I have proof every morning as my first hour of the day is still brutal until the percocet takes hold. I can now do many things that I couldn't before. I am opiate tolerant so this drug does not make me high or anything of the like. It just takes the edge off of my permanent pain. I could not ask for more

My issue with it is nobody, not even the prescribing doctor, informed me of withdrawal symptoms. After using percoset for just over 3 months I read that prolonged use can cause DEATH. A few weeks later I decided to stop using it. I had severe weakness and muscle aches for 3 days right after I discontinued use.

Vioxx did work pretty well, but developed a skin rash with long time use.  Vicodin works about 1/2 as well, and celebrex, Naprosin, Tramadol don't help.  I have used the &quot;Tens&quot;, PT, massage, Chiropractor,etc., but for siatica and RA percocet seems to work.  One must also lose Wt, excersise and follow Doctor's advise.  Shots worked for a while, only temporary.  Living with pain is a bummer, but beats the alternative.

I had C4-5 fused in 1998, but degeneration continued, causing shoulder and arm pain.  I also have 2 torn rotator cuffs(since 2007), which is much more severe as the pain goes.  I am inoperable, due to a series of strokes(coumadin, plavix), and my MD would rather prescribe vicodin and soma(both generic) than risk hemhorrage.  I take 4-7.5/d of each, and often fewer, depending on pain level.  If I miss a dosage, I do go into pre-withdrawal, sweats, irritability, etc.  However, I have found this drug to be effective in pain mgmt.  I NEVER experience a &quot;high&quot;, just relief.  Constipation is cured with a bowl of Grape Nuts and a fiber diet.

However, morphine drug tests are less sensitive to oxycodone. They will only pick up high doses. There is a specific urine test for oxycodone, hydrocodone which usually is not included on a basic 7panel drug test. It is usually included on a 15 panel or healthcare prof drug panel. But regardless, 72 hours is the most.

Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	7/3/2011 4:17:38 PM	I agree that this drug is given a bad rap but self-serving politicians and law enforcement.  I have never had to take this kind of medication until I shattered my foot in four places,after surgery I would not even be able to get off the couch, let alone consider working again with out this medication.  I finally understand what many in chronic pain must deal with the stigma of being prescribed this medication.  I have some of the best health insurance money can buy, and my own doctors and his assistant stigmatize the use of this drug as they are almost deftly afraid to prescribe this medication out of fear of retribution by the dea,law enforcement and the politicians it seems.  For shame on those groups.  I only hope that you may have a severe break some day and no what it is like to go thru the treatment of a second class citizen due to the fear you guys serve up.....
Pain	YorkieMum, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/25/2011 5:16:52 AM	I've had Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction for almost thirty years. I was one of the first patients diagnosed at Cedar Sinai.  I underwent a sphincterplasty, but the common duct continued to spasm.  Other than Demerol and Phenergan IM in a hospital, Percocet is the only drug that can relieve the incredible pain that comes with these episodes.  Don't take more than you absolutely need just because you have it on hand. Make sure that you get the brand name and not a generic.  They are by no means the same.  I split the tablets and take 1/4 every half hour until I have a reasonable reduction in pain.  I have been successful in avoiding addiction for thirty years and still been able to managethe high level of pain that comes with these episodes.

He has had 2 back surgeries and is now on SSD.   The doctor prescribes 150/5mg pills every 20 days.  It is INSANE.  This drug is so addictive.  He turns into a severe moody, mean, insensitive man when on this drug.  He has even told me that it doesn't work that well anymore.  But he still continues to take it.  It gives him a high that he used to get from other drugs for which he went to a rehab to get off of.  It appears that he takes more of the meds when he ISN'T in pain becuase he likes the affects!!!  To clarify things, my &quot;boyfriend&quot;  used to be my &quot;fiance&quot; pre-Percocet.  STAY AWAY!!!!!
Pain	RN1993, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/15/2011 2:38:08 AM	I have been taking Percocet for breakthrough pain in conjunction with Duragesic 100mcg/hr for more than 5yrs. These medications have made it possible for me to continue working as an RN in a long term care facility where I physically interact with my patients.  I have degenerative disc disease, fibromyalgia &amp; 3 herniated disks. I need to take care of my disabled parents when I am not at work, so I have not been able to take time off for surgery &amp; recovery. I say hooray for medications like this! As long as they are taken responsibly, as prescribed, the risk of addiction is minimal. People need to communicate with their physicians when their current pain medication is no longer effective so they can explore other pain control options before their pain gets out of control.  It is much easier to keep the pain under control than it is to let it run wild &amp; then try to get it back under control. Your pysician will appreciate you taking a proactive roll in your own care.  If you are new to pain medications, you may want to try doing a &quot;pain diary&quot;.  Keep track of what you're doing when your pain starts or increases, what makes it better (medication, rest, hot bath, heating pad, ice pack, etc) &amp; what makes it worse (stress, too much activity, bending, lifting, cold weather, etc). Bring this diary with you to your doctor's appointment for your physician to review with you. You may also want to make out a list of things you want to talk to your doctor about before you go to your appointment so you don't forget what you want to speak to him/her about. Also bring a current list of your medications to every appointment. They appreciate this info as well.

But than I am used to meds like morphine, and oxicotin. I'm sure for some people it may just put their lights out! It depends on the person and their tolerance.

Each time it was to &quot;make her comfortable&quot; while transporting her from acute care post surgical to rehab. The drug reaction was so severe each time it took three days to detox. A perfectly coherant adult was reduced to restraints until it cleared her system. We have marked it as  NEVER on her med history from now on.

It works well for about three to four hrs. This time i am taking it it does not work as well. when i am in moderate pain it is fine. But when it's severe it might take the edge off the pain. Be very careful about how often you take it your body can become dependent upon it with out you realizing.

My doctor knows my situation ( ruptured discs from an on the job injury and surgery on my neck where I have titanium plates and screws ), however, I still have to go in to the office once a month in order to get my prescription.  One of my monthly problems is that I am unable to take the generic Percocet because it does not work.  The generic drug can be called into the pharmacy, but the monthly trip is because the doctor has to write the Percocet and says control substance rules say he cannot call it in.  Does anybody else have any suggestions or can share experiences or knowledge that maybe I can get my medicine without a monthly visit??

I suppose because it is a narcotic it can be addictive for most users. For me it gave me aweful mood swings and just made me unbearable to be around, I didnt care about my personal relationships anymore, my finances, my girlfriend, or anything else for that matter!!!

Pain	blondephoenix, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	9/5/2010 9:02:19 PM	This pill does little to reduce the actual sensations of pain; instead, it makes me think less about the pain.  It gives me a buzz and makes me itchy, so I would rather not take it.  My feelings about all the opiates are pretty much the same... does little to reduce the pain, just makes me care less that I hurt, and they all give me a buzz of varying degrees of dizziness and nausea; some make me itch.  Just. Say. No.
Pain	bootsie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/4/2010 12:41:01 AM	Ihave been taking Percocet 7.5/325 for almost a year now. I find that if I take 1/2 tablet then the other half about 30 minutes to an hour later and have eaten something it doesn't make me nauseated or groggy at all and I can take them at work and still function normally. I can repeat this dose every couple hours if needed. This works very well for me. I just don't take them right before going to bed because they make me relaxed but not sleepy. I only take them when the pain is really bad so I have absolutely no concerns about becoming addicted. I am fortunate to have a wonderful pain management doctor who knows  that I don't abuse any medications, and I also receive trigger point injections regularly.I have had chronic back and neck pain, headaches and sciatica for about 8 years. I am pleased with this drug.

As soon as she took her first dose, she got so sick. She was nauseous, almost to the point of fainting. She was vomiting all day &amp; night. Her body had a tingling feeling all over. She never felt so sick in her life. But, it did ease the mouth pain a bit.

I had a severe injury to my shoulder and took this for 1 1/2 years while I went through cort. shots and pt. When I quit taking the drug I had pretty significant withdrawal symptoms and serious depression. This takes 3 - 5 days to get out of your system. The other issue is the stereotype that you are a worthless junkie. You won't believe how many people will judge you for taking this, even if you are taking as directed. I would try something less addictive like Tylenol with Codeine. It is not nearly as addictive and I could have saved a lot of pain and misery.
Pain	nambi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	7/6/2010 6:12:55 PM	My daughter was suffering with a lot of pain due to a staph infection. Not wanting to miss the last few days of work because she had taken a new job, she used percocet to relieve the pain.  My daughter passed away ten days after beginning the percocet.  It was a mistaken overdose with deadly results.  Do not take this drug!! It is dangerous and very addictive. My daughter would be alive today if a doctor had not prescribed this medicine. The average person thinks any drug a doctor prescribes is safe to take. Nothing could be further from the truth, one small mistake can take your life!

Percocet has been a life saver as it is not as addictive as some may think.  Pure Oxycotin is a much more purely addictive medication.  Oxicotin is mixed with aspirin.

It relieves your pain but the drowsy effect sneaks up on &amp; you find yourself asleep. So please NEVER take while driving even if you think you can handle it or even if you've taking other meds b4 &amp; handled it ok. DON'T chance it. Rest &amp; eat b4 taking. It's not sensitive 2my stomach but I eat becos if I don't i'll fall asleep b4 fininshing the meal. Good luck with your health!

Used it after a very rough wisdom tooth surgery for a short time, and then was given a single pill during a colposcopy.  Having the single dose during the colposcopy made it much more bearable, and if anyone has to have a colposcopy, I would reccomend it for that.  No side effects.

I have tried everything out there for migraines and none of it has worked. I even have a barbituate pain reliever for my migraines and that, too, doesn't work. Percocet is unfortunatly the only med i've tried that works. It's unfortunate because it really relieves this incredible pain but it has this very bad rap. Im on 5/325 and I usually have to take one and a half to relieve the migraine..then 5 hours later i take one and it's gone. Although sometimes I have to go to the E.R. and not even DILAUDID the most powerful pain killer, wont relieve it. But percocet works most the time for me..the down side? I get horrible constipation =/

It finally started causing me problems 5 years ago. Started with demorol but it didn't even touch the pain. I have had every treatment but none worked. Have been on 10/325 percocet for 3 years now. It is not as effective as it was in the beginning and am finding I have to take them more often. It was recommended a few years ago to havae surgery but I refused. I have never talked to anyone who said it helped. I had a plate and bone graft in my neck to help with the headaches and neck pain. It did just the opposite. My  neck hurts worse than before. I would like to have just one night of sleeping all the night.

I also take a muscle relaxer with them.Reason is I have 3 herniated disk in my back that are pressing on my nerves causing pain down the leg and in the back.DJD and scoliosis, arthritis too.I'm finding that these meds are NOT taking the pain away.All they do is relax you.

Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	3/30/2010 1:52:45 PM	I took this medication for 2 years along with having epidural and facet joint injections due to pain caused by herniated disc at L5-S1. After 2 years I finally had a discetomy to hopefully help the pain subside. Shortly after the surgery I felt better but progressively the pain started to return. So I had to start taking percocet again. I have been taking 2 10-325 tabs a day and it unfortunately does not help enough with my pain. My Doctor said the next step will be trying me on oxycontin which I am nervous about but I need more pain relief. I have a team of 3 great Doctors and I take their advice so at my next visit I will discuss starting to take the oxycontin. Overall the percocet has been a good medication with little side effects (constipation being the foremost) and easy use, but just does not alleviate enough of my pain. I hope this helps!!

Pain	Carrie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	65-74	3/24/2010 6:23:12 PM	I have considerable [if temporary] pain associated with facial plastic surgery. I can tolerate discomfort during the day, but by using Percocet at night, I had hoped for better sleep. Unfortunately, I have developed respiratory problems [2nd night onward] that supresses natural breathing to the point that I have had to sleep in a sitting position, supported by pillows. I have found that when I attempt to lie prone, I must make my thorax inflate deliberately. I do not know whether apnea syndrome would eventually cause spontaneous intake of air, or whether I might suffocate; I have been too concerned to relax my system in anticipation of survival. In any case, I am not much pleased by the apnea alternative, even though it would be transitory during the limited time use of Percocet.I mentioned my concern with my surgeon and he was perfectly relaxed about my continued use - no skin off his nose, I guess! I'd be better off with a glass of wine instead. 
Pain	dede2fun, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/24/2010 1:26:55 AM	I recently broke 2 ribs, went to the hospital, took a couple of x-rays and told that nothing was wrong.  A couple of days went past and the pain on my side got worst nandn worst.  Now I went to my private MD, he then took his own x-rays, found out that I have 2 broken ribs, and it hurt like Hell.  My doctor gave me Percocet 10/325 and it worked like a charm, I felt no pain at all,  The only side effect I had was some itching of the skin, but I could take the itching to get out of pain.  I give them drug a #10!

Pain	jayjenx, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	3/15/2010 1:19:11 PM	I've always had trouble controlling pain, whether from serious injuries or minor cramping. Percocet is one of the three medications given to me that have actually worked to control my pain. The others were some muscle relaxant I was prescribed after an injury to a tendon and whatever was given to me in the ER when I was suffering from what I assume was gallbladder pain (the walls were melting around me... and then I became nauseous). I was given morphine after my c-section - useless. Anyhow, I was given Percocet when I had a dry-socket form after wisdom tooth extraction. My only complaint is that I did become very light-headed and blacked out once. It was a terrifying experience, but the only negative side-effect I noticed.

Now I'm addicted..I take 4 a day and if I don't I will start to feel ill. I'm a young looking 46 year old woman and hate being addicted. If I don't take it I also feel awfully depressed. It elevates my mood. Tried to go back to the darvocet but now that doesn't even do a thing..and I still feel sick without the percocet.

Severe sciatic pain has hospitalized me twice in 6 yrs.  I have been on a consistent regime of 5mg percocet for the first 2-3 yrs taking 10-15mg per dose.  In the last few years, I have had to increase to 20-30mg per dose to achieve the same pain relief.  The most taken was 40mg at one time, however, not again that day.  I routinely get a new 100ct prescription at the 1st of the month and try to make it last the entire month, but some months are better than others. I am now on the 10mg tablets and make it pretty easy every month.  I wish there was a percocet prescription without the acetamenophen.   The only side affect that I have with the medication is that I will occasionally start sweating in my head and neck area.  It subsides in about 10-15 minutes, but is embarrasing if I am out on a job somewhere...it can get quite profuse.  Other than that, good to go.  It takes care of the pain and allows me to function at about 95% which is doable rather than at 0-30% with the pain.

Pain	Arthur, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/1/2010 11:33:25 PM	I comefrom a family with back problems.  In my 40s things were really getting bad.  Had 5 MRIs and results were 2 herniated disks, cervical(neck) and 2 in the lumbar region (lower back)  also a benign tumor the size of a dime at the base of my spine.  Vicodin did not provide needed relief for me.  It worked quickly but also only provided relief for a short time.  Percocet takes about 30 min to work,I take the 10/325 dosage.  It provides 4 to 5 hours of pain relief.  Many say this is addictive.  And now kids in H.S. are getting high off narcotic pain relievers. Terrible thing.  But for those of us who really need something for effective pain management, this is a very good drug.  Take as directed.  My Doctor gives me 90 pills every 3 months.  You cannot become addicted by taking 1 a day.  Some days I do not need to take it at all.  But some mornings I can't even get out of bed to go to work.  So I thek one, have a cup of coffee and I am good to go.  Again, if you use this medication RESPONSIBLY, it is a very effective pain medication       
Pain	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	19-24	3/1/2010 2:55:25 PM	I was prescribed this medication, along with skelaxin, for lower back pain relief sustained from a snowboarding injury and it seems to relieve the throbbing pain for about 1-2 hours. I've noticed when I'm not taking it that I seem to twitch due to muscle spasms. Be careful while taking this medication as I'm told it is habit forming.

After taking it for 10 months I am trying for the third time to wean myself off it and the withdrawal is a horror show. The muscle twitching and the indescribable feeling that comes with it keeps me up at night and miserable during the day. I'm determined to get off of it after reading the reviews of people who said it becomes ineffective after a while and have to increase the dose. I don't want to have to go throught this again.

Pain	mimi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/18/2010 11:52:55 AM	I was prescribed this drug after surgery. I took 2 tablets and waited for relief, which did not come. Next day I was still in excruciating pain. I discovered that I had vomited the two tablets. No one told me that they contain acetaminophen. I found that out when I read the label. Some one elso had given me the tablets and did not warn me. I did not take any more of the stuff because they obviously did not agree with me and did nothing for my pain and suffering. I had warned the so-called professionals at the hospital that acetaminophen does not agree with me and takes forever to work, if I can keep it down.

Percocet and/or Oxycontin should be the LAST DRUG you are given!I have sever rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis &amp; ANV. I have been on a combo of Percocet &amp; Oxycontin for about 5 years now for chronic pain. I have been on pain meds for about 15 years, and just like you, I was started on anti-inflammatories (non-opiates) first. As my arthritis got worse (over years), I was slowly given stronger and stronger pain meds, but wasn't given Percocet &amp; Oxycontin until I was in so much pain I was (still am) using a walker and wheelchair. Your dr is correct by starting you with non-opiates. You are way too young and opiates are highly addictive. Also, keep in mind, the longer you take this type of drug, the less effective they become and the more you will need to ease your pain. If the anti-inflammatory doesn't work, your dr can try another one or combine it with a another non-opiate drug. You may also want to talk to your dr about a nerve block, which I hear works wonders for back pain.Let me tell you about this drug and other opiate based drugs. For short-term use, they are fine, but for long-time use at your age, they are not, especially Percocet and/or Oxycontin. The side-effects are horrible if you ever go through withdraw. I have gone through it, as I am sure other people writing a review have, and it isn't pleasant. I ran out of them before my dr &amp; pharmacy would re-fill them and the I started to go through withdraw. I felt like I was having a heart-attack, sweating, twiching/jerking of my muscles, you can't sleep, can't eat, the list goes on and on.You are way too young for this drug or any opiate. What do you think they will be able to give you when you get older, if they give you on one of the strongest opiates first?

It only worked if I took ibuprofen with it.  I didn't relate what was happening to me at the time to the meds, but I've just learned that the anxiety, palpitations, and tachycardia I've been experiencing are from the Percocet!

My doctor prescribed percocet and in the beginning it was not a big deal to me, it helped me with my pain and made it more tolerable to work and stand on my feet all day. At first I was prescribed 2per day as needed for pain, then it increased to 4 per day as needed, then up to 5 and now i am on 2 pills three times a day for my pain. i take 168 pills each month. i have tried to lower my dose and when i do i find that my entire body hurts and i begin to feel sick. in my opinion, nobody should be on this drug for an extended period of time, because now it has been approx 2 years for me and i cannot go a whole day without it. i rated it 5 stars in effectiveness because it still takes away my pain, 5 stars because it is VERY easy to use, and only 1 in satisfaction because i feel like i will never be able to get off of it. i don't want to go back to the worse pain that i had in the beginning, and i don't want to go thru the body aches and pains when i do not take it.

At first, it killed the pain entirely,left me with a pleasant feeling (not really high). Lately, the side effects are horrendous. Feel nauseated, spaced out mentally, paranoid, dizzy, and a weird depression--as if I'd just lost a loved one. I did not connect the meds with my mood---I could not even leave the house---just stared mindlessly at the t.v.  Few days ago, I thought about the meds---am tapering off-was on 3 a day; going to try just one. Also experienced violent, vivid nightmares. Hopefully, it is the Percocet. I'll wait and see.
Pain	SuperShmoo, 13-18 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	2/3/2010 8:23:53 AM	I am 18 years old and I have 2 bulging disks in my lumbar spine. I have tried every medication on the shelf trying to manage my pain, but nothing works. I was wondering if this medication might work for me. Do you think if I asked my doctor about it she might prescribe me something? I asked her about it before and she gave me an anti inflammatory, but that did absolutely nothing. 
Pain	flady, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	2/3/2010 6:06:48 AM	I suffer from denegerate bone, joint,disc disease &amp; Sickle Cell. The pain management team was called to work on my case due to post surgerical procedure the doctors could not manage the pain. My pain was unbearable I was given Morphine, then Dilaudid was tryed, but I was hysterical due to the pain. Once the Pain Management Team arrived my mother remembered that at age 12 I had a tonsilectomy &amp; almost died from an overdose.The meds I was given were having no effect on me. It was discovered I was born with an extremely high tolerance to opium. It is very difficult to manage my pain, so I left pain management and chose a great primary care physician that changed my medication from the large amount of Percocet to Dilaudid 4 mg 3 times a day &amp; I would love to say I am pain free, but I beleive he is on the right track. I was always concern the amount of Percocet I had to take just to get out of bed would eventually kill my kidneys or severly damage my liver. Hopefully, working with my Doctor given him feedback I write in my journal will assist him to get the correctt combination of meds &amp; I can get my life back. My body is rapidly declining, but with God, Dr., PT and other life style changes I can return to work, utilize my degrees to regain a good quality of life. I would advise anyone that suffers from chronic severe pain to do research,so you can be an educated patient. In the long run you will feel alot better partcipating in your therapy and keep a journal of your activities and what triggers your pain &amp; what gives you relief. A rule of thrumb honestly inform your physician everything interferring with your daily activities and things that help.

Recently, tho, I have TERRIBLE ITCHING, hives, SCRATCHING my arms, hands, feet, legs really bad. The itching keeps me up all night. I've scratched my arm so badly that I have broken blood corpuscles!   Previously, I had been taking Vicodin 10/325 for several years for advanced arthritis and bone&amp;joint degeneration, back surgery, Fibromyalgia, chronic pain syndrome(and other conditions), and that made me itch too (not as badly as Percocet!) but benedryl used to help with Vicodin.    I'm at the end of my rope. Over the past 8 years, I think I've tried every pain med on the market. Nothing takes the pain away. I'm seeing my Primary Dr again tomorrow AGAIN.  I understand all of you suffering from chronic pain. In the past 10 years, I've gone from a happy, active, working, social person to someone who lies down almost all day because of the terrible, chronic pain :(

Pain	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	1/25/2010 4:31:04 AM	I have a chronically pinched nerve from   broken ribs for over a year now. I cannot stress enough how debilitating the pain has become. I couldn't sit upright or even go to a resataurant or grocery store with out hollerin' before I started using this med.I can't sleep without itI'd be yelling in pain for hours.The weght of a bedsheet can set it off. Sometimes I can't even wear a shirt because the weight of the fabric can set it off. I couldn't be anywhere in public because of the involuntary pain induced vocalizations! (I scream when it give me a shot of hot knife in the chest)! I don't like taking it but have no choise and with out taking 3-4 5mg/day I have no life at all. I have had 4 apin blocks of diferent kinds...RF...Cryio...none of with helped for more than a few days.One precaution. Do NOT try to quit it cold turkey. I was having precipitous drops in blood pressure nearly passing out and found I had to taper down....2/day for a few days then 1/day for a week then 1/2 /day for a week then 1/4/day then 1/4 every other day for a week. Trouble is each time I waened myself off the pain block would fail and I had to get right back on.Do NOT exceed the prescribed dose as many have gotten adicted by doing so. I am mildly adicted so I need to taper down as above. I know a person that got really hooked and had to start buying them on the street and it nearly ruined the lives of both her and her family. She is a smart sweet girl, best friend w/my daughter (they are both serious athletes) who is against taking asprin and it ruined their friendship for a while until her 3rd detox. It can help you if used only as prescribed and ruin your life and those around you but if you are going for the buzz good luck you could get to the 50-75/day like my daughters friend. Just the tylenol alone will kill you by way of a rotted liver at those dosages.Use it if needed and be aware of what happens when you exceed prescribed. I hope this helps you.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/23/2010 10:53:53 AM	I woke one morning and could BARLEY move my arms with pain in my lower body as well.  After MANY MANY test the doctors found a non cancerous tumor on my spine that was squeezing my spinal cord.  This tumor has apparently been there since birth, growing.  The doctors told me that it would continue to grow until it pinched my spinal cord off and I could no longer move.  In the ER they gave me Percocet for the pain.  I am a very heavy girl and was diagnosed at 15 years old with a bone disease that would in the end cripple me.  I also for as long as I can remember have had 15 to 20 migraines a month, at least.  So I am no stranger to pain.  There is NEVER A SECOND of my life that I am not hurting somewhere.  So when I had to go to the ER and they gave me Percocet my pain level went from a 9.8 on a scale of 10 to a 4!!!  Anybody who deals with pain knows thats HEAVEN!!  They only gave me the one bottle of 150 pills so I would only take the pills when I couldnt stand the pain any longer.  My doctor refuses to give me more.  I took my very last pill today.  :-( But for the next 4 hours I will move without so many tears.

It worked great on the pain as it is very strong. However, it also causes severe constipation and nausia. I take it only when I absolutely must because of these issues and also the fact that it is a habit forming medication. Please use caution and be responsible when you have to use this medication.

Pain	Kristy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/12/2010 1:40:32 AM	I have been on Percocet for over a year now, Due to a major back surgery... L4 and L5 S1 fusions.  I had my back surgery on Sept. 18th, 2009.  I tried everything before the surgery, and nothing worked.  The last thing I wanted to do was have a back surgery, considering all the risks.  I have been taking percocet for a while now, and have built up a tolerance to it.  I am now taking Opana 10 mg.  As of today.  So far, it has not helped me near as much as the percocet 10/325.  My doctor has prescribed me up to 4 percocet a day for my break through pain.  But I am definitely not as comfortable with opana as I was with Percocet.  I have been told by my doctor to try the 10 mg. for a week, of the opana, and if it was not strong enough, to call him for a larger dose.  So far, it doesn't come close! I am worried about my job, and worried that I will not be able to work through the day without enough pain relief!  I am definitely worried about the withdrawals of this pain reliever.  It is NOT good, and I know that it will be rough, I am hoping the opana will help.
Pain	bigkev, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		35-44	1/10/2010 7:53:31 PM	I have a bulging disc between L-3 and L-4 due to degenerative condition in my lower back. I have alot of arthritis there too. MY days begin with alot of stiffness and very limited flexibility in my lower back, making it difficult to put shoes on and getting in and out of the car. I have used tramadol with ok results, but once my doctor prescribed oxycodone my life changed for the better. I now have more pleasant mood due to reduction of pain. I have less misery in my life due to it. I do not abuse them and only take the dose my doctor prescribed, but i can see why people abuse them because they do produce a sense of euphoria.

Pain	Katrina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/4/2010 8:30:50 PM	In 1997, I was a pedestrian struck by a motor vehicle traveling 55 mph. Amazingly, I suvived after coming out of a 3 week coma. Initially, I was given a Morphine button, injecting 4 mg every 8 minutes. I was also on Percocet every 4 hrs, 2 of the 5 mg tabs. After lots of physical therapy and rehabilitation, I learned to walk again and eventually went back home. I was given a prescription of Percocet 5/325. It worked ok for a while, but I was still in a lot of pain. Now,my doctor has me taking 10 mg every 4-6 hrs as needed. I get some relief from it, but I have found that there isn't any medication that TOTALLY relieves the pain. It is now 2010, and I still have to have total knee replacement sometime in the very near future. I also have a metal plate holding my pelvic bone together, and 2 metal plates in my left arm. Some days are better than others, I guess, it sort of depends on the situation and the weather. Lots of luck and prayers to everyone living with chronic pain.

Have recently been diagnosed with fibromialgia and the Percocet helps, it does not relieve all the pain brings it to a somewhat acceptable level. I can not return to my skilled trade because the narcotics affect my concentration, I am a MEAT CUTTER working with sharp knives, a band saw, a meat grinder, deli slicers, etc. These require my full attention or I could cut off a finger, cut myself severly enough for stitches or other serious injuries. The side effects of the medication slow my reflexes and can affect my memories and concentrationqjukee
Pain	bulldog lover, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	2	2	Female	35-44	12/30/2009 9:09:38 PM	To the person who used it for MRSA on 12/13 at 5pm--be careful.  My mom died of MRSA and one of the reasons they did not act fast enough is that the Motrin and the acetomeniphine in the Percocet she was taking masked her fever and they did not realize how bad the MRSA was until she was nearly dead.  By then it was too late.  I am sure you are aware of your condition and are already on the lookout, but to anyone who has an infection and is using it for pain, remember that a fever is the single biggest sign you have an infection or it is getting worse and percocet has other drugs in them that will reduce fevers.  Sounds pretty basic, but my mother's doctor did not seem to know this.

Of course depending on your situation! I have found it works better then morphine pills. The only down side is that it does not last any longer then 4 to 6 hours. And will need to be adjusted after long term use. Don't be afraid to talk to your Dr. about it. Also if you run out the with draws are unreal. PLEASE use as directed by your doctor.

Recently I was also prescribed Suboxone along with it and it makes the pain manageable and it also keeps you from needing to take higher doses. My pain management specialist in Carmel, IN is from a different country and has by far the best pain management facility in the state as far as I am concerned. When I first went to him I was on Fentynal patches, percocet, muscle relaxers and the list continued. He was able to change all of my medications around and add the suboxone and the combination of suboxone and percocet are all I need now and feel much better now than I had for the previous 8-10 yrs. I also prefer the Percocet because you don't get high off of them or make your sick or any side effect in my case and I can actually drive myself places and carry on a conversation instead of being all fuzzy and messed up on the patch and other shall we say coctail that I was on previously. It is a miracle drug in my opinion and now they are talking about taking all narcotics off of the market and have no idea what may happen then but foresee it being a huge problem for the entire country unless they are able to invent something suitable that can manage pain as well as this medication has been able to for many patients with chronic pain. Mine is chronic back pain and when a person is in a great deal of pain it also adds to a lot of depression and other mental and mood disorders. For anyone who does not have this type of condition they can't understand it but it's a miracle drug. Last of all I would like to state that I wish that Mr. President would keep his nose out of the health care business and stick to all of the other promises he made and not kept. We are to care for our elders, not take food out of their mouth, nor money out of their pockets to give to the poor. They are our responsibility! All of us and not the government! Leave our medications and health care alone!!!!!

Pain	L, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/11/2009 2:00:27 PM	I was taking morphine sulfate for over 5 yrs. those are 12 hour pills.Then I would take 5 or 7.5/325 percocets for &quot;breakthru pain&quot;. They come on in about 30 minutes and last just 2-3 hours for dealing with my chronic pain. Now that I'm off the morphine, I need 4-5 Percocets daily. Many people eat these just to get high. They will probably get more difficult to obtain even for those who need pain relief. I think they remind people of 714's. But being an opiate, it's easier to get addicted to the Perks. If you suffer from chronic pain for the rest of your life, being addicted to a pain reliever is no big deal.

If taken correctly it can be very helpful. However, the medicine has an opposite effect on me. It gives me energy instead of making me sleepy. It just sucks to have energy when you're not feeling good enough to do anything with it. :/

As for the 10/325, it works GREAT for fast pain relief. Especially when I can be off my feet.(which is very seldom running a restaurant) But is SHORT in duration. Also on Zonegran 100 mg 3x day and Neurontin 300 mg 3x day to help with the nerve pain associated with a venous stasis ulcer on my lower left leg. The nerve meds are relatively new and not up to full dose yet, thus I am praying they will help relieve the constant severe pain this ulcer causes! The goal is to spend less time bearing weight over the wound and keep it elevated as much as possible. (anyone work for food so I can do this)? Ha ha life goes on!!!

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/27/2009 12:17:52 AM	I recently started taking the generic form of medication for pain im experiencing of disk degeneration. It was prescribed to take at night before bed being tha the pain is soooo terrible that i toss and turn at night. I was prescribed 5/325mg but i have to take 2 so it can work well and by early morning i am already in pain again so like many other other reviews i saw, i agree, medication does not last long but i do agree that it helps with everyday living even though i have to tolerate the pain the rest of the time untill further tests are done so doctors can find out the severity of my disease. Overall, good for pain management as i also used name brand when i had c-section, but not as great for long lasting effect.

It has helped me soo much.  Doctors who are afraid to prescribe it are either ignorant or evil.  It has allowed me to get out of bed and go to work and spend time with my children, and gradually evolved into exercising regularly.  It is simply a &quot;Quality of Life&quot; issue.  Either deal with the pain and not be able to enjoy time with my family or be able to work and provide for my family OR take the medication as needed and enjoy time with my kids &amp; wife and provide for them by enabling me to work with minimal pain.

It had not effect on my pain, just made me sleep for 2 hours. I know several people who have been prescribed this drug and have the same comments.  When I called my doctor's office after no relief from the pain, the nurse stated the drug was only meant to 'sedate' me not to relieve the pain.  I remember the post-op nurse saying the same thing. This can be a highly addictive opoid, it should be taken off the market since it's not very effective at relieving pain.

After surgery, I was prescribed Percocet 10/325 mg 1 4x daily as needed. I was previously on Vicodan 10/325 mg and the switch to this was alot better. It was easier on my stomach .vs. vicodan and the major difference was that it's effectiveness was in my opinion longer lasting in duration for pain control.

Pain	backpain, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	8/14/2009 1:04:11 AM	I have had severe back pain after failed back surgery for two years now.  I was on percocet 7.5/325 four times per day for about a year and a half before my pain management doctor changed me to time release morphine with percocet for breakthrough pain.  I don't know how I would get out of bed if it weren't for the percocet.  The FDA needs to really think it through before banning this drug.  There are some that abuse it, but the good that this drug does, far outweighs the bad.  Please FDA, use common sense and actually talk to patients who rely on this drug to function and have at least some quality of life.

I could still feel the pain.I used it for back pain but it was given for kidney stones. I can't imagine it working for that extreme kind of pain. I have not had to use it yet for that, Praise God! I realy don't like it and I hope that I never have to use it.

Pain	db616, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	8/7/2009 7:05:41 PM	I have 2 herniated discs and spinal cord trauma due to build up of scar in my thoracic region. My injury happened 4 yrs ago but I didn't get an MRI until 1 yr ago because my family Dr. thought I was drug seeking. I was prescribed Lortab 10 1 yr ago and din't have to change my dose until 2 wks ago. I sked my Dr. to alternate Bi Monthly between Hydrocodone and OxyCodone without changing the dose. (I afraid of increasing my tolerance at a young age). She said Percoset was soooo much stronger that she would cut my dose in half and it would give me more relief than the 1 Lortab 10. IT DIDN'T!!!! I'm not looking to be pain free, I just want the edge off so I can function on a daily basis. I have a desk job that I work at 10-12 hours a day. That hurts more than lifting. When I told my Dr. that I had to take 1 1/2 of the 5 mg Percoset's she took me off them all together because she said &quot;that was the strongest thing out there and if it didn't help nothing would&quot;. She prescribed Zanaflex at night and said it would last 24 hours. I'm going into that with an open mind. Hopefully it works and gets me off narcotics. I just want to play ball with my 6 yr old boy, and go for a bike ride with my family, I'm not trying to enter the Olympics. Any advice will help

A negative, however, is that the relief does not last long enough.  Another downside now is that percocet is not as effective as it used to be.  I guess this is because I have been taking since Spring 2001.

I've been taking prednisone since I was 11 yrs old and my bone and transplant doctor said that contributed to my bones deteriorating.  I have OSTEONECROSIS.  I take Percocet 7.5/500 mg.  I hate taking it because it makes me sleep.  It helps me and i'm happy to have it.  The problem with it is that it makes me sleep. The doctors scold me because I don' take it then when I take it, it don't really work or it take a longer time to work.  The problem is taht i'm afraid of getting addicted as I see a patient every month at the transplant ctr asking the doctor for a prescription of the med and they refuse to give it to her because they say she should have.  With my rass is different because they ask my rass if mih rass need more.  I'm glad it is available.

Last 2 years have had severe lower back pain and sharp pains in right leg. Nerve tests and MRIs reveal a pinched nerve in L4-L5. Am being referred to spine specialist in Minneapolis, MN. Have been on generic Percocet for 10 months. Takes care of most of the pain. Does not make me hallucinate as other pain meds. Am well aware of addictive nature. But have safeguards in place: Rx must be renewed monthly by doctor. Living in small town pharmacist knows me personally, so I can not &quot;pull anything.&quot; Also, having a caring RN as a wife is an automatic safeguard. Plus, personally, it's often a &quot;balancing act&quot; between, &quot;How much pain can I tolerate&quot; vs &quot;How concerned am I about becoming addicted?&quot; Pain management is a &quot;package deal&quot; of medication, injections, surgery, physical therapy, lifestyle changes, etc., as shown in so many articles on this WebMD chronic pain  newsletter, for which I am grateful. You do what you have to do to enjoy at least some quality of life.

I was involved in a car accident that gave me nerve damage and pain in my neck and shoulders. Sometimes while I am working the pain got so bad and my armand finger would go numb. This med helped alot in conjuction with physical therapy. I do feel a dependence to it, I wont lie. And I do worry about what is going to happen when it is time for me to go off of it. IT gives me a euphoric feeling along with taking away the pain. Another downside is that I cannot take this med before I go to bed. I find myself &quot;wired&quot; and unable to relax and go to sleep. But during the day, I am productive and fully functioning. I have not experienced the drowsy feeling that most people seem to get with it.

We tinker with it when it's not working as well, and we switch it out for something else when I don't have as much pain.I have interstitial cystitis, reccuring ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and IBS. I live in constant abdominal/pelvic pain. When a cyst ruptures I have lower back pain as well. If a cyst is sitting on the nerve that pain will shoot down my leg. I take 10/325 percocet and 60 mg of morphine ER.

Pain	Thankful Patient, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	7/21/2009 12:21:53 AM	Percocet is a miracle. I am fairly heavy, and most medications I have taken either have a reduced effect, or no effect on me at all. This does not hold true for Percocet. I've been given percocet in the past and know the dangers of using it, and have found that this knowledge makes it easier to USE and not ABUSE. As good as it is, this drug is very dangerous and can easily kill an abusive pill popper. So, with that aside, I would like to spread the good word about percocet and give thanks to the creators of this wonderful modern miracle.I have severe lower back pain, it's something my doctors haven't been able to find an etiology for, and had become a problem for me concerning sleep. I would go approximately a week without sleeping before it became too much and I would shut down. My Doctor found this highly worrisome and decided I should be given Percocet after having tried many other drugs with little to no effect. Percocet did the trick, and the best part was I only had to take it for one month before I decided I could move onto a lighter and less dangerous medication. It took away all pain I was experiencing, and it left me able to resume work.Secondly, and most recently, I've had a corrective surgery completed on my right foot. A double tendon transfer and a calcaneal osteotomy. The doctors warned me that the pain would be nearly unbearable and that I would not be able to work for at least two weeks. This wasn't true due to Percocet being available. I was prescribed a stronger dose than before, 10/325, and found myself able to continue with work less than two days after the surgery. Granted I do feel a bit light-headed, and occasionally I feel nauseated, but thanks to Percocet, I can continue living my life the way I want to.

I started out taking Percocets as my Dentist prescribed for an abcessed tooth. I worked in a medical setting. I ended up becoming severely addicted and taking 30 perks a day. I had to take 2 and wait in bed for the withdrawal to ease, to even get out of bed. These pills made me very active with insomnia, very outgoing and friendly. However, I had access to prescriptions so there was no &quot;doctor shopping&quot; I just wrote my own using DEA numbers of various Drs. I ended up in a rehab with a horrible withdrawal and then had a 1-2 year jail term. Be careful! One pill may be too many, a million never enough.

I was given percocet for migraines/headaches. What a mistake! After about a month (maybe 6 weeks) of taking percocet I began to experience something called &quot;rebound headaches&quot;. For all you migraine sufferer's out there, heed this advice! The rebound headaches are 10 times worse than the original headache (if you can imagine that!) I NEVER took percocet for migraines or headaches again!     I have taken it for other types of pain in the past. I had my rotator cuff (shoulder) operated on and percocet worked wonders for that kind of pain.

For longer term relief, it has diminishing effects as do all short acting meds. If using for long term care, I suggest trying to switch to a time released med like MS Contin.

I've been on it for almost a year and a half, my tolerence to it has gotten stronger. I meet with my DR 2morrow, hopefully I can show her I need a stronger dose. My ONLY complaint is it makes me constipated so I have to sometimes take a laxative. But I guess, alls fair in love and pain?LOL I have MS, so the pain I have is often different from day to day.The only MS Rx that does anything for me is Tysabri. So with my Tysabri and my perks I can luive my life. Thanks for the oppertunity to tell others.

Pain	mom of three girls, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/10/2009 8:03:00 PM	I had lumbar surgery and with the percocet medicine, i am able to take care of my young children without complications of pain.I been taking it for 1 and 1/2 years. I noticed how well it helped when my surgeon just completely cut me off it.  When that happened i was in chronic pain once again. I couldn't bend,walk,reach,or interact with my kids activities without being in pain. I've tried vicodin and it does not take the pain away, i missed out on social events at my kids school because the pain that returned was too much for me to bear.  Physical therapy only helped for the ten minutes while hooked to the electric shockers. Once i walked out my pain returned within 15 to 20 minutes. I wish that some of these doctors could get the same surgery to understand how important a pain killer works for an indivisual. They may be smart but unless one goes through surgery then one does not know the importance of what works for a patient. Now i go to a pain clinic and they give me an injection, but that also only relives the pain for a few hours. I hope that anyone who gets surgery can find the help with what works for them. I pray everyday that no one has to endure back pain or any pain that is chronic,constant, and severe.  I will not be able to give my children 100% physical support to teach them sports dance or any phsyical activity.

This worked much better than the Darvocet (proproxyphene) that I had previously been given (which only made me feel loopy). Percocet makes me feel floaty, sometimes constipated, but I hardly noticed the pain and/or weakness in my back and knee.

My blood pressure hasn't been staying elevated from the pain and I am a little more physically active which helps, both , my back and my fibromyalgia too. I is a pain medication I recommend for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain and as I tell my friend who has it also, you have to deal with some pain, you're not going to be pain free and if you take the pain medicine as prescribed it will help.

Pain	Rblue, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/3/2009 8:19:22 AM	I have been taking percocet 10/325 for about a year. I'm 61 and have hypothyroid disease too that is being treated with synthroid.  My dosage of percocet is three times daily.  Occasionally I have to go for a fourth pill because of my severe neuopathic pain.  Until I started the percocet I didn't have a life.  I know I probably need to stop because of all the medical community's hate for the drug but it has allowed me to do the things I want to do without pain.  I have problems with anxiety so psychaitrists won't prescribe anything to help me there because I'm using percocet.  It's like I'm unclean or something.  I am in a CBT group that's helping, I think, my anxiety.  I know there are concerns with percocet because it is a narcotic but used with discretion it can actually give a decent life back to a person.  I don't understand why drs are so reluctant to help with anything else once they learn you are taking percocet.  It's very sad.

I have had three back surgeries and am always in constant pain. I have degenerative disc disease and herniated discs and I always will.This is the ONLY medication that has helped me live a normal life. (as normal as it can be)with that being said.... I am VERY &quot;dependent&quot; on this medication. I am taking it as prescribed and only when I really need it, however that didnt prevent me from building a tollerance either. You need more and more. I would stick to OTC medications if you can survive. If not then I would suggest taking the lowest dose and cutting it off after two or three days. Please learn from my mistake! My tollerence has gotten so badthat it effects other medications as well. for example... morphine doesnt work for me anymore. anyways... just a word to the wise! use strong discression and dont let teenagers take it.

My docotor raised them to 7.5/325 and thay work much better. And I don't have to take as many for the pain to die down. You build a tolarance after so long of being on the same medication. And some times even a little adjustment makes a big differance.

The effectiveness starts with you. start with small amounts every 4 hours don't go over this. If you wake up with pain eat then take 2 tylenol wait 4 hours take as little as possible, tell your doctor your fear of addiction. The whole idea is to get rid of the pain before you forget how it feels to be pain free. Don't be afraid you can beat anything unnatural, you are stroger than you think. the whole idea is to have the pain killer when you need it without the doctors treating you like a out of control person when your not. Don't beat yourself up try to get well and don't feel guilty because the medicine makes you feel good and remember that you can feel good without it.

The medication worked wonderfully in taking away the pain and discomfort and especially helped me get a good nights sleep. I dont understand why after a second knee scope that hasnt helped why the doctor will not put me back on percocet. I understand that the medication has a bad rep but when used properly the medication is a miracle pill.

I have been on this med for 3yrs for back surgery that resulted in me living with chronic pain for the rest of my life. Yes, this med will give you pain all over when you stop it after being on it for such a long time. It can cause you to have severe stomach cramps, diarrhea, sweats, and make your pain that you are being treated for even worse if the medication is suddenly stopped. This does not mean that you were addicted, it simply means that you were depended on the drug to relieve your pain. It's either take the medication or suffer. I'm taking the meds. Most people don't like being depended on the med, but it's better than being miserable and bed ridden. One important thing to remember is to never allow yourself to run out of the medicine. It's when you run out, that you have these awful withdrawal effects. Also, if you plan on stopping this med, make sure you tell your Doctor so they can give you something to curb these withdrawal effects, or you can simply taper down on your own. By that I mean, instead of taking 5 a day, go to 4, then the next week try 3, then try breaking them in half until your body is comfortable enough without the medication. I hope this helps.

I also have stenosis of my lower spine.  I find that  oxycodone works best when before the pain is at its worst. The biggest problem is the long acting oxy is no longer available in a generic form, and medicare insurance has a &quot;donut hole&quot; price limit once met will not pay for any medication. I'm not quite sure what to do when my limit is up soon.

I was prescribed Percocet/Oxycodone for pain following gallbladder surgery.  I found, however, that not only did it relieve the pain from surgery, if I took a dose immediately at the onset of an attack of Irritable Bowel Syndrome I could avoid it all together.  One dose or even at times only half a dose and I would avoid pain, bloating and severe diarrhea.  If you suffer from moderate to severe IBS as I do, discuss it with your doctor, see if perhaps it can work for you.  The only side effect I noticed was feeling a bit warm.  I am hot natured and noticed it but someone else may not have the same experience.

It took the edge off, then knowcked me out all day so I just slept through it. I took it for about a week and had to convert to ibuprofen because I started to depend on it. It is very ggod for the short term (especially when you don't have to go to work or school), but it does get you &quot;high&quot; so I wouldn't suggest taking it for too long. But, with any medication, it will have different effects on different people.

People who whine about withdrawal symptoms try prednisone and see how much WORSE those side effects are. I was taken off percocet, because they seem to think the withdrawals are terrible. Granted maybe over time withdrawals are bad, but they have a great drug to curb withdrawals called SUBOXONE. This drug makes me feel amazing it helps with my anxiety, depression, and my pain! It helps me focus and keeps me driven to succeed! I work harder, I smile more, more talkative and friendlier, and I feel like I can handle anything thrown my way. I TAKE IT AS PRESCRIBED that is the most important part. Misuse causes serious problems don't be a dumbass and take more then prescribed simple solution. MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE, but sadly you are in the minority, because this truly is a miracle drug for chronic pain. I am on constant pain level of 8 and it relieves to about a 2 sometimes it disappears all together. Doctors are evil they would rather see you suffer then to help you, just to PROTECT THEIR OWN BUTT! As the mercenary in FIREFLY states &quot;Every Doctor should be shot in the leg to see how it feels&quot; It would make them a ton more understanding of pain and how much it ruins your life.

Oh yes, more so than any other med I have taken for my severe back pain except tramadol,  I took that several yrs ago worked well but I can no longer take because of interactions with other meds.I read one review from a woman saying it made her wired.  Well me to, it actually made me feel on top of the world, like I could accomplish anything.  I have been taking 10/325 plus a 5/325 3 to 4 x's a day, but that is not how I started out, believe me I could take more but I want off these things.  If I dont take it before it wheres off I feel horrible, I know iam addicted and I swore i would never do that. I have a question if someone could answer, after taking this med for several mths, now my body hurts everywhere,  I was told by an emergency physcian that I have fibromyalgia due to the percocets.I just feel muscle pain all over, like I exercised for hrs after not exercising for yrs, that type of soor.  I just want to know if other chronic users  feel that to?

I just found out my husband has been addicted to percocet for over the past 2 years. He lived a double life to protect his addiction, and lied about everything to make sure his pills were a secret. He was to the point where he was taking 20- 25 pills a day. Some may say I should have known, but honestly had no clue. This medication has destroyed my life! Please use as directed, it is extremely dangerous!!!

I have worked up by multiple docs over 5 years and done it all i.e. PT, magnets etc.  Ever thing on the internet I have tried.  I live at 6-8 pain levels and have recently moved up to 8-9 levels of pain.  This drug worked for years to keep me down to below 6 levels but seems to have lost its effect over time. I am looking at meth treatments as a next step.
Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/23/2009 2:57:07 AM	I had always had chronic back pain. I have carried nine babies full term all large-for-date, after all the kids came i was a mess, at this time I was put on diazepam, &quot;mommas helper&quot; what my dr called it, and 10 years later I broke my tibia and fibula and was prescribed percocet and ibruprofenand never been the same since. At first it took the pain away now  I have to take more and more to get the same pain free life. I do therapy and pilates, but as the years go by I am starting to feel pain in the injured ankle. It is due to the fact that when your nervous system blocks out these pail sensory it makes it a little harder for the body to sense that it is NOT is pain It has been three years on percocet and when I run out I withdrawal with stomach cramps, major bowel movements and severe mood swings. So please be careful.

As long as you don't abuse the meds I think they're great!  I'd say, IMHO, that people are responsible for their addictions - unless you have a mental disorder you KNOW when you're taking more than the prescribed meds - and if you need them just to function (i.e. not for pain) you have a problem!  Sure, I'd like to just be able to get by with Tylenol but I need a bit more than that and am allergic to codeine.  Percocet works for me!

Pain	Shawnee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	2/12/2009 12:41:25 AM	I was started on percocet while in the hospital for 3 days (just tyhis past weekend) recovering from an abdominal hysterectomy. The 1st day all I did was vomit every couple hours (this may have also been from the anesthesia-not really sure) The 2nd and 3rd day I couldn't stay awake. (again, this may have been due to the toll the surgery took on my body-or it could have been the medicine, I wish I knew which one it was) when I went home on the 4th day, I didn't have my script filled yet so didn't have any that day. On the 5th and 6th day after getting my script filled, It had the totally opposite effects on me - I have been wide awake and very wired and not able to sleep at all. Today is the 7th day, I did not take any at all today, it is a little after midnight, my body feels weary and tired - yet my mind is still totally awake and I cannot seem to fall asleep. Even after only about 6 hours of total sleep over the past three days. Percocet and ibuprofin are the only meds I am taking for my post-surgery pain so I don't know what else could be causing all of this. It does help to releive some of pain when I take it and it did make my mood pretty upbeat - but, if not being able to get any proper rest is a regular side effect, I don't know if its worth it. So far, after reading about 15 reviews, I have only read one other review where someone else also reported that it made them wired.

Pain	Rebecca, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	2/8/2009 5:06:54 PM	I was given this medication after a spinal tap to help relieve the headache I had from it.  Though it relieved the pain, it made me vomit about an hour after taking it.  Normal pain killers were much more effective because they stayed in my system!  I know this drug helps a lot of people, but if you're sensitive to pain killers, this could make you sick as well.  It works better if I take half a dose, but it still makes me worried I'm going to vomit, so I avoid it all together.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/4/2009 2:07:24 AM	I have a blood clot and am taking percocet to treat the pain.  What I discovered was it helped with my bi-polar.  I know that they say that percocet is addictive but I look at it as a cure.  It is the only drug that ever made me feel normal.  It also kept me out of the hospital when I was on the verge of a nervous break down.  With my bipolar I had extreme stress pain in my head along with suicide thoughts.  Percocet stopped the pain in my head and left me feeling highly energentic.  Unfortunately, doctors cannot perscribe this medication because of the government and it has not been approved for bipolar.  I do not know who can help me to get approval for this medication to be used as treatment for bipolar.  Cancer patients are allowed to use marijauna for their pain and I need to use percocet for my pain in my head.

I was on 10mg Hydrocodone, but that was not strong enough so the doctor tried prescribing Percocet 10mg.  I had crazy hallucinations on this medicine, and was very eager to stop it.  I tried taking half the dosage but still had very weird, vivid dreams and hallucination.  Just made me feel &quot;yucky&quot;.  Was just too strong for me.  Went back to the Hydrocodone and that was a much better fit for me.

I was also on Pharmacy made Vicodin with strength in the 40mg where Vicodin ES is only 7.5.  I have also had the shots from my pain management doctor but right now the combination of 4 Vicodin ES and 4 Percocets has been working for sometime now.  I can feel though that I might have to step up yp something just a little stronger but this has worked for over 5 years so i can not complain.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	2/2/2009 9:16:13 AM	when I first started using percocet, it took the pain away and I was able to live everyday capable of doing the normal activities that I always do.  Ive found that over time, It has become a mental thing of taking it and not really doing the job of relieving me of the pain that I am in.

Takes away about 80% of the pain for me. Pain relief starts after about 30 minutes and it makes me sleepy about 45-60 minutes after taking a pill. Overall seems to be working well. What I don't like is the itching. I itch like crazy about 30 minutes after each dose and it lasts for about an hour. I also find these pills hard to swallow. They stick in my throat and make me gag. Wish they came in a capsule.

One evening I stood up and my jaw was shaking. Then my entire body began to shake. I became nauseated and my husband freaked out. The doctor said it was the Percocet and that we should dispose of it at once. How can anyone function on that crap? I work in the healthcare industry and have several patients that take up to 6 Percocet a day. Oh by the way, they drive a car while on it as well. I would say the most humiliating part for me was when I was collapsed on the front lawn dry heaving. No thank you!

The testosterone will also regain your energy levels which also naturally helps my depression.  Anyone with a back injury knows how much the depression can make your life hell as also the back injury does.  I think that all doctors should test all patients blood levels for testosterone levels after being on an opiad for any extended period of time.  And all the info is already out there on the benefits of testosterone when taking other drugs that bring natural levels down.

I have resisted for 3 months but decided I had to do something.  I started taking Percocet 4 days ago and can not believe how it really manages my current pain.  I haven't walked free of pain in 2 years and now it feels so strange but good.  The only negative is once it's been 4 hours since my last dose I feel my pain immediately.

I find Percocet helpful pain radiating around to my belly, but not nearly as much for the low back pain I get if I doze off in my wheelchair. It loses effectiveness if I take more than one a day, though my prescription says 1 q 6 hours.

I have had 3 different back surgeries and was addicted to percocet every time when my surgeon would prescribe it freely.  I does help with pain, but is more addictive than anything else that I've taken, even moreso than methadone.
Pain	mommyof3girls, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/7/2009 1:02:14 PM	I take this medication for chronic back pain and it does wonders for me! Without this medication my quality of life would be horrible! I have been very lucky to have doctors that understand the difference between pain and addiction and will treat you accordingly!  I had lumbar surgery in 06 for 2 herniated discs, was find until a year later when I gave birth to my child.  Since I had the epidural I have been in constant pain.  This medication has allowed me to interact with my children and be the mom they need!To all the drug seekers out there...You are the reason a lot of people in my situation have to live in agony, drs are afraid to help today and its just not fair.  I dont think YOUR &quot;high&quot; should punish the people that really need medication!

I have muscular dystrophy, scoliosis, a spinal fusion, and chronic pain. Percocet worked at night being that I only took it at bedtime but I began taking it during the day just to get a high. I would use it with caution.
Pain	Lexi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/3/2009 7:38:31 PM	I have had lower back pain since a car accident 5/06; I was rear-ended by a man who claimed to be going 55 mph (I was sitting still to make a left turn - waiting on traffic).  I recently had surgery for a L4-L5 fusion w/trinity allograft and am still in a lot of pain.  I have been on Oramorph 15mg 3/xs a day and Percocet 10/325mg for breakthrough pain and it has recently stopped being effective.  My doctor has decided to put me on Oxycontin 2x/day with Percocet 10/325mg 4x/day when it is time for a refill on my meds which is within the next few days.  I have read the reviews on Oxycontin and I am scared too death to start taking it but I have GOT to have some relief!  The morphine + percocet combo is not working any longer.  I can sympathize and empathize with any and all people who suffer from chronic pain.  It affects every aspect of your life.  I hope that I do not have any adverse effects from Oxycontin + Percocet when I start it this month ... God bless you all!

In any case when it comes to moderate to semi-severe pain meds Percoset seem to work the best for me, with vicodin as an acceptable second choice.
Pain	memeyg500, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/30/2008 11:27:47 PM	I had a total knee replacement two weeks ago today. I did have a morphine drip that I could control a bit for me. Wonderful....a &quot;life saver&quot; it seemed. After 3 days, the Dr. put me on Percocet tablets. This worked well then and still does. It helps me be able to do my physical therapy and to sleep at ease most nights. I have never had surgery of any sort before, so I have been impressed with pain medication that actually does work and help me. I am thankful for this.

I am addicted to percocet soI could not and would not see what it was doing to me.  All I wanted to do was takepercocet and sleep.  Years ago it was darvocet and darvon.  I had bleeding ulcerswhich resulted in one half of my stomach removed and part of my intestines.  After that I looked like a cancer patient.  I then changed my medication to percocet.  Icouldn't function with it or without it.  MY wife noticed how uptight I was most of the time.  Again, all I wanted to do was take percocet and sleep.  When I wasn't sleeping, I was irrational, depressed, bored, and irritable.  For a short time Imoved on to vicodin, then the doctor tookthat away and put me back on percocet whichwas fine with me.  Ten years passed and nowI started to develop high blood pressure and all ailments that are associated with that.  Coradid artery surgery and Bypass.During my recovery, I was told I then hadcancer of the esophogus in the ulcers in the esophogus.  When I had ulcer surgeryback in the 80s, I couldn't keep my food down and was vomiting for about 3 years before the surgery.  I knew I had ulcers in my esophogus from this.  For a while I was on suboxone but because of the surgery I hadto stop taking that.  I had a problem withmy breathing and couldn't swallow.  Now because of cancer, I take percocet again for the pain and I now have miserable restless leg syndrome and a sleep disorder.It has gotten so bad that I can't sit or lay down without my legs not being able to relax.  My wife noticed, when I'm sleepingmy legs are shaking.  Now I'm trying liquidmorphine to relax.  I stopped the percocetLet's see if this helps.

As for it taking the pain away, yes it did the job. The side effects are brutal. Being high for an hour or two is great in the beginning but can lead to easy abuse of this drug. The side effects after taking it for a long period of time even a week, aren't worth it. Ex)not being able to sleep, irregular sleeping patterns, stomach/intestinal pain. Just not a good idea. Take when instructed.

Recently my husband was given this for pain for the very first time in his life after major back surgery. Within an hour of taking it he got delusions, confusion. After only two doses it was discontinued but it took 5 days to get it out of his system and him to be back to normal.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/6/2008 10:50:42 PM	I was prescribed this for RA. Took 1st dose, and felt good. I took the 2nd dose before bed, and even though I was &quot;sleeping&quot; I felt like I was awake. I woke up early and took my next dose, and went back to &quot;sleep&quot; for an hour or 2, and when I woke up, I was dizzy, nauseated and in a cold sweat. A few hours later I was vomiting profusely. When that subsided, I slept for 18 hours straight. I've taken this before and had no problems. Don't know why this time was different. Maybe there is something else that does not cause vomiting and nausea.

You then need to increase the dosage.  Do not stop the med. without a doctors help as your body becomes addicted to the drug, and can cause major withdrawls.

I feel that without injections and surgery meds are keepin me goin but it is chronic and its not healthy to take these meds for long periods of time.  Getting fixed is number one but if i cant get the help i need its disturbig to resort to pain meds for a long period of time but for now that is my only option until i can get insurance.  Overall they work better than other pain meds but there are risks especially if you have chronic pain and need to be on them for months and months.

The itching was bad enough that I wasn't able to sleep.  The same thing happened when I took Demerol.  Does that necessarily indicate an allergy and if not could I take Benadryl along with the pain meds to control the itching?

I noticed I had to take more than what was recommended to get the relief I needed but if taken at the same time it does the trick. It really helped me cope with the pain from my surgery on my foot and I was able to function better. One very odd but annoying and dehabilitatign side affect I expeirence was blurred vision. I could not read or watch TV because it was so blurry. It gave me a real scare. The vision change subsided when I went off the medicine. 
Pain	2catsonemerald,  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5			10/19/2008 7:12:32 PM	My husband was always prescribed Percocet for the pain when he has a kidney stone attack.  The Percocet took away the pain and  made him fall asleep so he slept through it and when he woke up, he felt much better.  Now, our presciption company is substituting Oxycodone for the Percocet and my husband says the Oxycodone takes away some of the pain, but doesn't knock him out so he can sleep away the pain, which he wants to do rather than be awake and have to deal with the pain.  If they are the same drug, I don't understand why it does this.  But Percocet is better than Oxycodone for kidney stone pain.    
Pain	Pandora, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/19/2008 6:33:42 PM	This is the only medication that relieves my migraines. The only side effect I have is slight drowsiness, which just feels more like relaxation because I am so tense. I'm able to function perfectly on it. The only problem is that doctors only prescribe it when I end up in the ER so I very rarely get the pain relief I need.
Pain	 (Caregiver) 	3	5	2			10/18/2008 11:57:05 AM	My father is 82 years old, and he is recovering from his second replacement knee surgery.  For his pain, the doctor has prescribed Percocet.  My father is not experiencing any pain while on this medication, but he has become confused, disoriented, dry mouth, not sleeping, and constipated while on this drug.  These side effects concerns us, especially the confusion, and disorientation, because of his age.  The doctor said it is common for patients to experience side effects while on Percocet, and that each patient could experience different types.  The doctor also said the confusion and disorientation  my father is having is a common experiencing a patient may have from this medication. My father is not experiencing any pain from the knee surgery while on this medication, but because of his age, I am fearing that there may be other complications the side effects from Percocet could triger.  My father made a decision to have replacement knee surgery on his left knee, because the knee was giving him problems.  He prepared himself for the surgery and rehabilitation process that was to be expected.  He had his right knee replace about a year ago, and the total experience was a good one; from the surgery to the rehabilitation.  He did not experience the side effects from the pain medication after his first knee replacement surgery as he is experiencing this second time around.  The pain medication prescribe for him, back then, work well with very little side effects.  At this time, I do not know what type of pain medication he was on when he had his first knee replacement sergury, but I am going to find out.  I am wondering, could the confusion, and the disorientation from Percocet cause other complications for my father, who again is 82 years old?

It worked great, but I noticed I would have headaches when I would take it. Be careful, abusing narcotics will make you be someone you don't want to be.I have seen too many patients do that.

Pain	ZNickey, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	10/16/2008 4:18:25 AM	I use Oxycodone/APAP for 2 different chronic conditions and have had excellent luck with it for treating moderate-severe pain.  I do not use it on a daily basis but only when one of the conditions flare which has resulted in me using 3-10 pills a week and I have had no problem with addiction nor have I had to increase the dosage.  I personally have not had this issue, but a major problem encountered by many people initially taking Percocet is nausea; you can take this medication in combination with Benadryl and it will decrease the upset stomach and increase the medication's effectiveness in pain relief as you are combining a opioid with an antihistamine.  It will also increase drowsiness but people taking this medication on a short term basis should not be driving anyway.  With all of that said, no 2 people are alike as you can see how these reviews differ so my best advice is try it and if the medication is not for you, contact your doctor as there are TONS of options out their for pain relief.

Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	35-44	9/25/2008 5:22:44 PM	I've been taking percocet 5-325 for 10 days now. Dosage was for 1 pill every 4 hrs. I was up to 2 tablets every 3 hrs when I called Dr to let her know it was cutting the pain. She told me to take 2 tablets and added gabapentin 300 mg 3 times a day.  I've taken about 110 percocet pills in 10 days now without any major effects. Cuts the pain from ruptured disc ok although I know the pain is still there. I'm not noticing any major effects except slight light headedness if I turn my head too quick. I don't want to be on the pills too long but they are cutting the pain somewhat. Like others have mentioned, don't let the pain get to be too great. I try to cut back to 1 tablet during the day when I'm feeling better in an attempt to not take too much.  Vicodin did not work at all in cutting the pain though.  In addition, I have had alcohol for two events during treatment and I haven't noticed any issues with increased effects with alcohol.  If anything, I've noticed that the alchol wasn't affecting me the way I expected it would.

It works really well, especially if you maintain a constant dose in your body.  (take it before you start hurting).  Makes you a tad constipated, which is expected.  Overall, Percocet is wonderful.  Eased all of my pain, and was not habit-forming. (at least for me)

When I first started taking it, it was terrific. It seemed to be the only thing that alleviated the pain I was in and allowed me to go about my life normally. Unfortunately, it doesn't take very long to build up a tolerance for it, and now it isn't anywhere near as effective as it used to be.

I was given it for tooth pain. Taking it with food didn't help any, and most times I didnt want to eat because I felt too sick. The only thing that I found that helped with my side effects was laying still and not moving much for the time I was taking it. It helped to relive the pain, but I had a hard time dealing with the side affects. 
Pain	2young4RA, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/17/2008 11:56:54 AM	I am taking Percocet 10/325 for RA and Lupus.  I experience quite a bit of dizziness from it and was wondering if this is common.  My disease condition is severe and progressive and I wound up with this diagnosis after a bad reaction to a flu vaccine last November.  My rheumatologist first had me on Norco and it was just not effective at all as my pain was too severe.  She switched me to Percocet 10/325 about 2 months ago and it does make more of a difference in the level of pain I feel and makes the pain more tolerable.  I'm just very concerned about the side-effects of this drug and how long they should last.  Also, has anyone ever had nosebleeds while on this drug?  I haven't had a nosebleed since I was about 10 and have had 3 bad ones in the past week.  I am on a plethora of other drugs, including methotrexate, leflunomide, voltaren, folic acid, xanax, and Effexor XR.

I used to take Lortab for endometriosis and that was good also

Pain	bigboypete, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	8/19/2008 11:27:35 PM	Took after breaking my big toe at the joint.  It works well but I think alot of its effectiveness has to do with its ability to take your mind off the pain.  In other words, it makes you feel good in an intoxicated kind of way.  I can see how people could get addicted to this and that is real bad news.  It seems to firstly improve my mental state which in turn makes physical pain less obtrusive.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/19/2008 12:22:56 PM	Herniated disc L5-S1 Most pills work for my back. But I also have chronic pelvic pain and pressure and these are the only pills that have worked so far. I suffered excruciating pain and it took me 3 yrs to find these pills and I had to put my life on hold. It's hard to walk without the proper medication. I can now go about my day a lot easier. Even though these pills work great for me, Drs. don't want me to be on these pills because they say they are addictive and they want me to use other less effective drugs which means that I won't be able to walk or go about my day. It doesn't make any sense. When there is a drug like this available, it should be given to those who really need it and have tried most pills instead of having patients suffer. Just because there are people who abuse this drug, it doesn't mean that I will. It means that because of this drug I can now have my life back like a 28 year old girl should.
Pain	Paula, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/17/2008 10:32:29 AM	I have suffered from severe headaches and migraines for years and finally was prescribed Percocet and Soma.  I can't tell you how much a difference this has made on my life! I actaully have my life back! I was taking Lorcet for years and vicodin before that..I still had break through pain.  With the perocet I havent experienced any of the pain I had like before.  At the onsst of my headache I take a percocet...15 min later my headache is GONE!!! I know that all opiods are addictive, but so are cigarettes &amp; sex! Hope this helps anyone out there who suffers from headaches/migraines! It really helped me!

Was told to take the percocet and lorcet together, I think that is a bit to much.

Using many pain meds and muscle relaxants, I've now been prescribed Percocet 7.25/325 along with Soma.  Took that many years to find a combination that works for chronic back and neck pain.  No side effects, and I've been able to adjust my dosage accordingly.

Pain	Jlesp, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/30/2008 8:36:00 PM	I have had exceptional pain relief with this drug. However, it seems to me that most doctors do not want to perscribe it because of the risk of addiction and/or abuse. I have fibromyalgia and I feel that I know how to keep my pain under control with this medication but my doctor is so busy trying to get me off it he is interfering with the therapy. Treatment and/or therapy is great (Dr. has no clue what pain really is...). He percribed me Cymbalta a while back, it really helped me for awhile (5 months to be exact) then a trauma occurred in my life and I had to go on steroids. When I came off the steroids, the pain of the fibro came back. Well, I'm back on percocet, trying to control my pain with my Dr. fighting me about it. Finally, I heard about Lyrica from the television and started taking it 4 days ago. I hope it works for me so i can get on with my life.PS: Maybe my Dr. can get over the fact that I'm not an addict now.
Pain	staceylaurencesmith, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/30/2008 7:44:55 PM	I was a very healthy and athletic young woman. i now have a g-tube for stomach decopression as well as a j-tube for feeding due to the sudden onset of gastroparesis 2 1/2 years ago.  Along with that severe pain and twiching began along my right side.  Before using percocet sleeping was impossible. Pain consumed my day. with my other issues i could still have a somewhat normal life, be a mother and a wife.  Pain takes away from all of that.  while we are finding out that this is all caused by damage to the vages nerve the amount of percocet i am getting from a doctor allows me on 2 tablets a day.  4 to 5 tablets a day would be ideal and that is why i am here on this web site finding out what my options are. 
Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	45-54	7/27/2008 3:27:38 PM	Used to treat pain for displaced collarbone and cracked ribs due to fall. Will have to have surgery on collarbone. I also use Fentanyl patch for chronic back pain from 3 back surgeries. Percocet made me scared to go to sleep, iritable, and had bad hallucinations. Could not sleep on this medicine.
Pain	Headband, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	13-18	7/27/2008 2:29:14 AM	Took this for pain after oral surgery. The first day, it made me sick to my stomach--I couldn't swallow much, so I basically had to take it without food--as well as dizzy, and didn't totally relieve all of the pain. It put me to sleep for half an hour after I took it.The second day--today--it was more effective (because I had less pain and ate first), but had one bad side effect: I became dizzy and lightheaded. I was unsteady and couldn't walk without leaning on something. The most recent dose made me slightly loopy, so I'm opting for a half-dose next time.My sister, who had the same oral surgery but more extensively half an hour before I did, has had similar dizziness and unsteadiness as well as remaining pain after taking dosage, but without the loopiness.

Started with the 5mg for a week or two, then the 7.5, and now I'm taking 4 to 5 of the 10mg each day and I'm still miserable.

I was at the point I was wondering if i may have been over taking the over the counter meds. But my headaches just were not going anywhere. I was able to take the medication and in about 15-20 minutes I finally felt a relief. I can only hope for a full night of sleep now without waking up from a headache leaving me exhsusted the next day.
Other		4	4	1			7/9/2008 12:34:34 AM	This drug is a great thing for pain! However it comes with serious side effects. You will become very dependent on it. The mood swings, fogged thinking, messed up sleep routines are not worth it. Not to mention it has a weird effect on the pain tollerance. This pill is very bad news for long term use!

I have a very high threshold for pain, so I don't usually take pain meds even when they are prescribed to me.  But the nature of the injury I was in severe pain. I only take half my prescribed dosage just to get some relief.  The med made me zonk out for about 30mins, then I'd sleep for 2-3 hours and repeat the cycle.  It made me constipated, so take some fiber and drink alot of water.  I felt very dehydrated also.  I never got total pain relief, even when taking a full dosage, just got sleepy.  Hope this helps someone, I'm now switching to Vicoprofen which is helping more due to the type of injury I have.

I have been taking this drug on and off for a year. I notice that it is the only pain reliever that does not cause me to feel drowsy or tired. In fact, it makes me more energetic. However, in the mornings I feel very tired and achy all over.

The reason for the switch is longterm use of the higher dose percs made me unpredictably nausous.        I would vomit with no warning and it was quite embarassing.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	5/8/2008 10:38:55 AM	I was prescribed Percocet for post-op pain following each one of my cesarean sections.  It was easy to use, very effective in pain reduction, and had few side effects for me.  I am sensitive to codeine (it makes me vomit), but had no nausea with Percocet. I am currently on a five-day prescription of Lortab for pain following oral surgery, and the Lortab is giving me severe nausea, although these two drugs are quite similar. I was groggy at the prescribed dosage of Percocet but cut th dose in half after the first day post-op and had very good results.  I stopped using it as soon as I could manage it, because I understand that this drug can become addictive.  It was just right for my situation.

Pain	razr90, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/7/2008 12:00:07 PM	I have had moderate to severe lower back and leg pain from herniated disks and degenerate disks since 2006.  I have tried Darvocet, vicodin, injections, steriods, chiropractor, surgery to remove part of a disk for the leg pain, anti-inflamitory medications, etc.  The single most effective medicine that gives reliable consistant relief is Percocet.  It has truely raised my quality of life.  Without it I would be in too much pain to do daily activites and hobbies.  For example, without it I cant even sit by a computer for more  than a minute because of the increased leg pain from sitting.I am having spinal fusion surgery in a week so maybe that will solve the promblem.  Until that happens I'll take the  percocet.  It is good medicine.

Pain		5	5	5			4/20/2008 1:39:47 PM	I broke my foot and had to have surgery. The doctor gave me Vicodon. Then I rebroke the foot and had to have surgery again. This time he gave me Percocet. I found it works much better. I have not had to take it as often as I did Vicodon. It seems I can tolerate the pain better with Percocet. The only side effect I have had is consipation. However, I had that with the Vicodon as well.

Pain	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	4/17/2008 6:27:08 AM	I have been taking Percocet on-and-off for nearly a year due to a DVT, neuropathy, post-surgery, and for pain due to prolonged swelling in my thigh and knee. I take it as opposed to Vicodin because I noticed a tendency to build up fluids with that drug, even when taken for short periods (with existing problems with swelling, this is obviously not helpful). Also as opposed to high-dose Ibuprophen due to stomach issues and ineffctiveness to my pain. Percocet has been extremely effective with all of my pain and I have noticed no side effects at all, including no withdrawal if I miss even several doses (my current dosage is 5-10mg every 4 hours or as needed, largely based on my level of activity and subsequent swelling). I even stopped usage for a period of about a week because the swelling and pain subsided, with no adverse effects. However, I am aware that this is a rare circumstance and should not be expected. This drug is extremely effective and that in itself makes it habit forming, as I noticed that even though it was not needed for pain, I fought the urge to take it. This being the case with many such drugs, I highly recommend Percocet because of its effectiveness.
Pain	kim3884, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/14/2008 9:58:33 PM	I have been taking Percocet for about 5 years now for sever Rhuematiod Arthritis. The drug works wonders! However, in reading comments from others, I will agree that your dose needs to be adjusted because your body becomes use to it. However, I've been given Oxycodone to take along with it and I haven't had to have an adjustment to my pain medications in over 1 1/2 years now. And yes, I've been given other pain meds in the past (even stronger drugs like morphine), but this drug has worked the best for me. Without this drug I would not have any quality of life and would probably be bed ridden and on disability. Because of this drug, I am able to work, although I do have a desk job.   I can also enjoy other activities that others take for granite.  I can go to out to lunch or dinner, or go to the grocery store or the mall for short periods of time (not more than 45 minutes to an hour because of the pain), so it's improved my quality of life.I do realize that this drug is very additive and is abused, but for patients who really do need this drug it is a life-saver. The only bad thing I can say about this drug is the withdraw from it. I had forgotten to take it with me once when I went out of town for a weekend and will never do that again. I had to go to an emergency room to get a an RX to tide me over until I got home.

Pain		5	5	5			4/11/2008 9:52:36 AM	I took percs for a broken foot from a car wreck I was in. They work great. my nose was very itchy, but other than that, they were great. One thing people need to be aware of is that this drug, when taken for an extended amount of time, inhibits the brains ability to fight pain. In other words, the more you take this medicine, the more you need it. Since percocet is an opioid (i.e. it is in the same class as herioine) after long periods of use your brain stops producing dopamine because you are supplying it through the percs and it is &quot;tricked&quot; into thinking you don't need it anymore. confusing? I know! bottom line: only take percs for a short period of time. I don't suggest it for chronic pain. I am sympathetic for those living with chronic pain. keep being strong!!

I have to quit working bc of my pain,cut back in all activities of my life.Have noticed a tolerance building as I have upped my dosage from 5 mg,then 7mg,then 10mg,but it still does help. As my pain is chronic,though I fear that it will begin to NOT be as effective,and am seeking different pain-control methods such as hypnosis,etc in conjunction w/my pain med.Pain management is difficult for neuropathy or for any long term pain, I recommend counseling and often,antidepressants are warranted. I am unable to take antidepressants due to adverse effects so have that additional challenge.I recommend Mayo Clinic's Chronic Pain book,has been a lifesaver for me.

My doctor Prescribes me 240 a month. By the end on the month Im very short,because of having to take them every 4 hours.so I have to take them far and inbetween. I suffer big time. I dont want to tell my doctor,because Im afraid she might think im drug seeking , or abusing the medication. I ve been on them for over 5 years.with no millagram change.

Pain	justme, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	3/26/2008 11:06:18 PM	After taking 5mg Percocet for over a year, my doc changed me over to 10/325mg Percocet. I find it to be very effective as far as pain relief in my back, but have noticed a rather bad headache when it starts to wear off. Use this medication with caution, as the longer you take it, the more tolerant you become, and the more you must take. Take it no longer than you must, and wean yourself off of it as the withdrawals can be rather unpleasant if you suddenly stop taking it, and may include nausea, vomiting, headache, insomnia, and a few other things as well. Hope this helps.

Percocet works wonders on basic day to day life activities. People who do not have chronic pain do not know what it's like thankfully i have a boss who also suffers from chronic pain (2 back surgeries). The only complaint about the percocet is the itches... what the hell is up with that? But for as good as it makes me feel I'll deal with the itches, it's just puzzling and frustrating especially while trying to sleep.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/12/2008 2:34:43 AM	I have been taking Percocet 5/325 mg. twice daily for almost 6 months due to a severe fall that completely shattered my tailbone. Although very effective for the first 3 or 4 months I now find that the pain relief is short lived. I have spoken to my doctor about this and it is very common for the medication to have a decreased pain relieving effect after months of use. The next option is to switch the 5 mg. to 10 mg. My concern is this: when the 10 mg. starts to decrease in effect, what is next? I have resigned myself to the fact that I will need to take some sort of prescribed pain reliever for an indefinite amount of time although surgery is an option, there are no guarantees and I have been told I could end up worse off than I am now and that worries me GREATLY. It is unimaginable to me what I would be like without this medication, I still have a very difficult time with everyday activities, but the medication does help (even though it is a limited amount of help). People that do not live with pain on a daily basis cannot understand how it affects EVERYTHING you do, it is consuming. You have to make so many concessions due to your pain. It takes on a life of it's own while complicating yours. I just remind myself that I am doing all that I can to keep it under control and not letting it take control of me, which is a very difficult thing to do. Do your best to take care of yourself, take it easy and realize you now have limitations, but DO NOT let the pain take over your life--easier said than done, but not an impossibility. As corny as it may sound, positive thoughts really do help to make a difference!!!

Definitely helped with the pain, but in the beginning, the pain was so severe that it didn't take it away completely.  Over the last year, I have taken it on an as-needed basis when my neck gets real stiff, along with migrane type headaches. Again, it helps greatly but does not alleviate the headache 100%. But, helps much more than advil does in those situations.  I can see how it can become addictive with the euphoric feeling it produces.  After I've taken it, I feel very mellow and &quot;at peace&quot; with life in general. You do have to be careful not to abuse this drug. Overall, it has helped me alot with my neck pain and severe headaches.

Pain	suzy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/25/2008 6:36:12 PM	I have been expericing back pain for about 6 years. My doctor had me on percocet and then decided I could do without it.  Since then I have had steriod injections in my spine, which has helped some, but I have aklso gained  about 30 pounds due to the steriod use.  This in turn puts additional pressure on my  low back.  I work as  a nurse aide and the lifting on patients is a great factor of my pain.  I can work with the pain medication and have a lot less pain.  Now when I get home form work I can't even get to my normal housekeeping duties because of pain in my lower back.

I have been on Percocet for 2weeks now and for the first time in years I have been able to really play with my children!!! GO for a long drive.DANCE! I have actually been able to be intimate with my husband and not feel like I am going to pass out from pain.It's sad that so many people who truly need this med can't get it because of all the people who abuse prescribed meds.This med works so well for me.Instructed to take it every 4 hours but take it every 6-8hrs.I am so very thankful to have some quality of life again! I have had this God for saken condition since I was 19 and I will be 28 this year. Good fortune to you all suffering with this life altering disease and God bless you.

I have been on this medication for four years and have not abused my dosage. I take it for pain and pain only.  With my level of pain, I can't imagine normal physcial life without it, so I am careful in taking my prescribed amount. I can see how some can become addicted because of the euphoria that it delivers in addition to the ease of pain.

Pain	feelinggood, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/30/2008 7:55:06 PM	I was prescribed Percocet for pain management after I had surgery in Dec 2005.  It worked very well.  I had surgery last September and was once again given Percocet to control pain.  It definitely gives you a good feeling, similar to having a couple of drinks and gives you a &quot;don't care&quot; attitude.  Very addictive.  As with most narcotics, this drug can cause constipation if you take continuously, so drink plenty of water.  Also, can upset your stomach.  I found this drug useful in recovering from surgery.  Not sure how effective it is long-term though.
Pain	TeryB, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/30/2008 3:32:20 PM	I have been taking this medication for  3 yrs now after my spinal fusion, and I also have Fibromyalgia since I was 18 yrs old, and I  am now 38 going on 39.For me,there's days it works and there's days it doesn't due that I have chronic pain, and my body is immune to pain meds.I honestly, have no problems with it. My new primary Dr. increased my dosage to 10/325 since I was taking 5/325 and I have more pain due to other illnesses now.Yes, this is a habit forming drug, but not all patients have the same effect to the medication. Just make sure you and your physician communicate well regarding pain meds.

My doctor back home in MN prescribed 7.5/500 mg which is a moderate dose and I never had a problem with it. When you have this condition, it's all you can do to get thru the day and try to live a normal (as possible) life. Once I moved to KS, my doctor followed my previous doctors treatment plan for a short time and then decided I was taking too much and reduced my dose by 50%. Needless to say, there are days that I can't get out of bed and yes, there has been times when I've taken more than prescribed and followed the old dosage to get by. I might have to go on complete disability because it's very hard for me to work anymore. I've tried the &quot;fm&quot; med Lyrica and it's done nothing for me. I wish doctors would not automatically assume you're addicted if you take narcotics longer than a month. Unfortunetly, sometimes they are physically needed.

Pain	John, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	1/19/2008 7:34:44 AM	Use for chronic soft tissue (muscle) pain in back.  Works very well; but becomes less effective over time.  Use in combination with fentanyl patch for break-through pain.  Did start to notice it was giving me a lift (mood) in mornings with first dose.  Very hard to keep on hand since doctors in Canada do not like to perscribe large amounts or repeats.

It is very addictive. I was on it for about 3 years on and off for kidney surgeries and female surgeries (yes, several surgeries in a very short time period)... I did not want to stop taking it. I knew I needed help getting off and talked to my doctor who helped me with antidepressants and sleeping pills. When I was on percocet, I felt high and I loved it, but it is not a way to live. Please find something else to use if you have pain for more than a month. I used so much that I built up a huge tolerance, meaning I had to take more and more the next dose to get the same relief. I was 130 pounds and was taking 30 to 40 mg at a time. Please be careful.

So far, I feel like it has just been a &quot;bandaid&quot;.  I don't believe my doctor is using it properly with regard to the disease.  I know that I have to live with a certain amount of pain regardless, but is it normal to have so much residual pain after taking the prescribed dosage and how do I talk with my doctor?

I only quit taking it so i could continue flying (privately), and the three to five days after I quit taking it were days i would like to forget forever.  Be careful, this drug is physically and mentally addictive.

Have tried various pain meds and found Oxycodone to have worked the best. Presently taking 2 7.5/320 every 4 to 6 hrs. I only have one complaint about the itching that is associated with taking this med. I probably would be better suited for 1 10/320 dosage.I do not take med every 4 hours, only as required when pain is unbearable. No problems with constipation or sleeplessness. I am a very large individual and I believe body weight effects dosage requirements. I am Afib so my medication choices are limited due to counter effects with coumadin.

It seems that I can miss a dose if I am not hurting and  not become sick.  It is hard to get prescribed because they only wwant to give you Hydrocodone.  And that does absolutely nothin.  I have a ruptured,disk, a herniated disc and nerve damage in my back from a car wreck.  They prescribed me Morphine, Methadone, Hydrocodone, Duragesic patch, and the onky relief has been the Percocet.  So please don;t be afraid to try it.  It may be the only thing that helps you to

I have chronic back pain due to three herneated discs and degenerative disc disease.  I could not work or even take care of myself without this medication.  However, it bothers me that some people abuse the drug because it makes doctors skeptical and makes it difficult for me to get.  Doctors should not assume that everyone who asks for this medication is a drug abuser.  Some of us really do need the medication for legitimate medical reasons.

You do not want to be moving around and doing things when under the influence of this drug. It made me extremely loopy.

Multiple, 1970 &amp; 1972, Surgeries (lumbar laminectomy) for Ruptured Discs. Time marches on (seemingly, right across your back) resulting in extreme lower back pain with Sciatic Nerve pain radiating (shooting) into buttocks and down either/or both legs. Fibromyalgia. Confirmed in every possible, painful, diagnostic point. Surgery to remove Gastric Ulcer caused by taking Naproxen for many years. Asthma -NEVER SMOKED-(need Advair Disc 500 mg and Xopenex 1.25 Nebulizer 3x daily). I also use other prescription medications to help with coping and sleeping.

Kwitko, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/5/2007 1:04:46 PM	I have been taking percocet 10/325 since 7/06 to present, but since 8/07 I have been taking as needed, I take percocet only if my pain gets too strong. I had lumber spinal fusion on 11/06 on L5-S1 due to a crushed disc, which broke and a peace of disc material was lodged into my spinal cord, which cause great pain from the back to my foot on the left side, taking Percocet on an empty stomach work very well, but with side effects, ie:dizziness,drowsiness,lightheadedness, it's like being drunk. but I can walk and work at my job without pain, so for me it works well, if you take it with food the results are poor and the pain doesn't go away, and there is no side effects. I also take Lyrica 75mg for nerve damage in my spinal cord.

Yes it took a bit more than prescribed but what doesn't.  Including Tylenlol, Excedrin etc.  For Pain with minimal side effects... Give Me Percocet every time (degenerative discs 2, 3 &amp; 4 w/pinched nerve down arm and back into hip)  Maybe it the type of pain that it helps most.  Wish I had insurance so I could get some relief!  For those who do &amp; it helps, think of the working poor w/out relief!  Bless you all! (sorry corrected a typo!)

A little higher dosage of 15/325 would probably work much better and a quick release tablet if they have those. Every morning is terrible until the medicine kicks in.  I have no side effects from this medication at all.

I start to fell awful if I miss a dose.
Pain		3	5	3			11/6/2007 10:29:36 AM	HiI have been taking this medication for 3 years for pain. I need back surgery and I have no insurance so I am stuck on percocet.I think the wrost side effect is the itching. You itch from head to toe.The constipation stops after you have been on it a while. You get diareahea if you don't take it. You must also remember to take it exactly on time or you will have break through pain that won't be controlled.

I have had 3 knee surgeries and being in the military this is about the best thing you can get. Taking one every four to six hours definately does not work. I wasn't to satisfied with the pain reliever and wish i could get something stronger. Also need to take a laxative while using these.

Works great as long as I don't get behind on dosing.  It did make me feel whoosy in the hour or so after taking it.  Overall though it did not make me nauseus, an was effective.

Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	45-54	11/4/2007 2:29:26 AM	I was taking this after oral (dental) surgery.  Twenty times 325mg every three hours over three days.  One of the less serious side effects is supposed to be constipation.  It caused constipation alright - totally shut down my elimination system.  I was drinking plenty of liquids, nevertheless my waste turned into brick.  I was only able to eliminate two days after I stopped taking the medicine.  I'm fifty years old and have never been constipated like this, ever.  The feeling is horrible, incredibly painful to boot. Something to keep in mind when taking this stuff.  Personally, I'll never take Percocet again. As far as percocet's pain relieving properties go, my dosage was only effective at relieving pain, from ca 70 minutes into taking the drug, for a one hour of the three hour period it was supposed to be for.  Nevertheless it helped somewhat.  Sometimes it made me woozy, at other times I could barely tell I had taken anything at all.  Of course, that may all be dosage related. 
Pain	Speakuppeople, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/3/2007 5:44:16 PM	PERCOCET has been given a bad &quot;rap&quot; because of people abusing drugs. People can abuse anything. This is the ONE MEDICATION that works for my pain and with NO SIDE EFFECTS!  ARE YOU LISTENING, DOCTORS/Prescribers? The Department if Justice regulates Percocet, Vicodin, Lorecet and all the other narcotics and scheduling.  PEOPLE, we need to write them! Doctors are afraid to prescribe the medications that work fear of law suits, so they are all trying to prescribe the latest antidepressants out there, like CYBALTA, EFFEXOR, LRICA, etc. I am sure that these may work for some and great for depression and in some cases pain, BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE ADDICTING!  I am happy for those of you who can take them. I cannot. I have a friend who cannot get off of PAXIL! We have to speak, people and watch out for ourselves. The FDA has not done too well lately,and we have to watch out for ourselves and communicate with our doctors. There are laws for us, also and if we have a disease and are in pain, we have to be taken care of and not allowed to suffer as human beings.  So many of the antidepressants, not only have severe side effects (like nausea, dizzyness, headache, chest pains)etc., but damage to the liver and kidneys. Percocet does have acetaminopen in it, but if you do not take over 4,000 mg a day, then you should be okay.  The stigma placed on narcotics should not be there, especially when a physician prescibes this for their patient who is in PAIN! I would not be able to WALK or function without Percocet. I am not addicted, but IF I ever was addicted to anything, I would rather it be to this and able to lead a normal life, than an antidepressant or something else extremely detrimental to the essential organs in my body and may not live as long. Most of the medications just cover up the symptoms anyway unless it is an anti-iflammatory; those you have to be careful with, also. Good luck to us all in this horrible realm of pain.  God Bless. Try and have a positive attitude!

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/23/2007 8:11:19 PM	It works alot better than Vicodin or any other pain relievers I have used in the past.  (I have had 2 major surgeries).  Since I have been using it nightly to relieve pain, the effectiveness has gone down.
Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/23/2007 12:33:16 AM	I have had to use this medication for several different problems (kidney stones, endometriosis, and lower back pain). This has been one of the only pain medications that has helped me through all my medical problems. I agree that there is a stigma with it and I can't stand that! It is so restricted to the people who actually need it because of the drug abusers out there and that is absoultely terrible. I am having back surgery soon and I would be in bed everyday if I didn't have this medication. Hopefully soon I will be able to live without it, but it has definitely helped me and I would recommend it to others in pain.

Other	MARY, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/21/2007 2:58:30 PM	I HAVE SEVERE CHRONIC PAIN AND COULD NOT FUNCTION WITHOUT PERCOCET. I WOULD ONLY BE SURVIVING AND NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A LIFE. THANK YOU, PERCOCET. I HAVE &quot;FIBROMYALGIA,&quot; A STRANGE SYNDROME; BUT THE EXTREME ALL OVER BODY PAIN IS HARD TO DESCRIBE. YOUR MUSCLES, TENDONS, NERVES, BONES AND YOUR ENTIRE BODY DOES NOT FUNCTION AND SOME DAYS YOU CANNOT GET OUT OF BED. FIBROMYALGIA IS DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE AND THERE IS A LOT OF ANXIETY THAT COMES ALONG WITH THAT.  ONCE IT IS DIAGNOSED, DOCTORS SEEM TO WANT TO USE YOU AS A GUINEA PIG AND TRY ALL THE NEW DRUGS, EVEN THOUGH WITH FIBROMYALGIA, COMES A HIGH SENSITIVITY TO MOST MEDICATIONS!  ALSO, WITH FIBROMYALGIA, PATIENTS HAVE A LOWER TOLERANCE FOR PAIN. NOTHING MUCH HELPS.  THE ONLY THING THAT HAS HELPED ME WITHOUT ANY SIDE EFFECTS IS PERCOCET. I DO NOT FIND IT ANYMORE &quot;ADDICTING&quot; THAN ANY OF THE OTHER MEDICATIONS.  IF YOU HAVE PAIN, YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING. EVEN NSAIDS ARE ADDICTING IF YOU TAKE THEM EVERY DAY FOR PAIN AND SO IS ALCOHOL IF YOU DRINK IT DAILY TO CALM YOURSELF OR WHATEVER. HOW MANY DOCTORS DRINK ALCOHOL?  HOW MANY DOCTORS HAVE REALLY EXPERIENCED SEVERE CHRONIC PAIN?  I BET YOU THAT THEY WOULD TAKE THE PERCOCET! I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ALL DOCTORS AND DO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE SCARED TO PRESCRIBE PERCOCET BECAUSE OF THE SCRUTINY PLACED ON THEM, BUT LEGITIMATE PATIENTS IN PAIN AND IN ORDER TO LEAD A SOMEWHAT NORMAL LIFE, NEED THIS DRUG.IT MAY NOT HELP SOME PEOPLE BUT IT HAS HELPED ME FOR THREE YEARS. I WOULD BE IN A WHEEL CHAIR WITHOUT IT. I AM DISABLED WITHOUT IT AND THE PAIN IS SO EXCRUCIATING, THAT IF IT WAS TAKEN AWAY, I DO NOT THINK I COULD LIVE. MORE PEOPLE NEED TO WRITE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO HAVE PERCOCET AS A SCHEDULE III DRUG SO DOCTORS ARE NOT AFRAID TO PRESCRIBE IT.  IT IS NOW LISTED ON THE WEB SITE AS SCHEDULE II AND I DISAGREE WITH IT. ALSO, IT IS SO HUMILIATING IF SOMEONE KNOWS YOU ARE ON PERCOCET BECAUSE OF THE BOGUS STIGMA PLACED ON IT. THIS NEEDS TO GO AWAY. WE ARE NOT DRUGGIES!
Pain	Ann, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/21/2007 2:04:00 PM	Percocet goes straight to my pain and I have sever chronic pain! It does not make me dizzy or nauseated. I HAVE NO side effects and do not feel I need to take more than needed. One would know if you take too much because you would get dizzy or euphoric.  Any pain medication that you feel any euphoria, in my opinion, has addictive properties.  When Percocet 5/325 or a 10/325 cut in half, relieves my pain, I am not dizzy OR SLEEPY and can drive the car and do any activity. I am not tired like some medications make you. I am not depressed like some other meds make you. I do not know what I would do without this medication because I have a high sensitivity to most medications of any kind, especially NSAIDS and anti-depressants, which doctors sometimes use for pain.  It is ashame that Percocet has been abused by many, therefore making it a SCHEDULE II drug.  Doctors seem to have a fear of prescribing it and this is a drug which works for me.  Doctors should not be afraid to prescribe this medication, especially to an older person and the doctor knows they are in pain.  There has to be TRUST going in all directions.  Patients need to stop being law suit happy and realize that doctors would help more if their hands were not tied because of the fear of being sued by prescribing SCHEDULE II drugs.  EVERYTHING can be potentially addictive! I cannot take AMBIEN that is a schedule V, nor ROZAREM (compare to melatonin in the body). Talk about being addictive and take AMBIEN! I also had chest pains and other side effects from it. Stay away from AMBIEN; you can't get off of it! Alcohol is addicting, chocolate is addicting, too much eating is addicting, soda is addicting.  We need to write the Department of Justice under DEA and have Percocet lowered to a Schedule III drug, such as Vicodin, Lortab and Lorcet.  I cannot take those meds!  I have many side effects from them, but not one from Percocet. Percocet is a good med and should not be kept from those of us who need it to live!
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	10/21/2007 11:34:38 AM	this drug was very strong, and caused a lot of anxiety for me.  I was dizzy, lightheaded, and very drowsy, but couldn't seem to sleep....it helped the pain for about an hr, but then I began to vomit repeatedly.  It's not for everyone.

Pain	Mrose, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/19/2007 10:30:04 AM	I was taken off of this and put on tramadol. That drug did not work and caused severe nausea and vomiting every time I tried to take it. Percocet worked for my severe pain with very few side affects. If you only take it when the pain is severe I found it had less of a &quot;buzzy&quot; type effect which I'd rather avoid. Yes, you do have to be careful as I noticed needing to increase the dosage faster than I would have liked but, honestly if you really only take it when you absolutely have to then you can avoid most of that. My second time on it, I followed that criteria and never had to increase the dose once.I wish doctors would learn more about pain management. Most Gp's will put you on ANYTHING BUT a narcotic when some types of pain will NOT respond to other drugs well. Meanwhile those of us with severe pain have no life at all till we can get on something that actually works!I have to think if it was the doctor in that kind of pain he'd not hesitate to take what works and would get it a lot sooner than most of us do.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/11/2007 3:05:09 PM	Percosets are great for my four herniated discs that are pressing on nerves in my neck and back. My pain extends from neck to arms, from lower back down right leg. Not only do percosets deaden my pain, they also give extra boost of energy (whereas, other pain relievers causes severe drowsiness and depression). I caution you and from experience, Percosets are extremely addictive and you have the tendency to take more pills than prescribed.  I further caution you ... Do not run out of your percosets before your next refill. Severe side effects will occur.

Pain	navysea7, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/8/2007 7:56:39 PM	My only concern with this combination pain medication goes along with many other combination pain medications which have added high doses of either aspirin or acetemetophine to their primary pain reliever such as oxycodone in the percocet.  I just don't thing that physicians think sometimes before they write a prescription for chronic pain that for the most part patients don't need or want all that extra aspirin or acetemetophine; especially, for someone like myself who has been taking Percocet for pain for the past twenty years for Bi lateral avascular neucrosis.  However, I have been able to get this point across to my new physician and he just writes for 5mg of oxycodone w/o the added APAP.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/5/2007 1:59:44 PM	eI suffer with fibromyalgia. This medication allowed me to move without feeling like the bones in my legs are breaking. But with all the horror stories about addiction and over dosing it's almost impossible for people living with chronic pain to receive this medication. My Dr. won't even prescribe it anymore unless you've had surgery.

Pain	elaine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/25/2007 2:00:59 PM	I have been suffering from headaches that are a combination of a tension headache, a migraine and a sinus headache - all at the same time. Percoset is the only drug that has given me relief. I do worry about becoming dependent and I don't like the negative connations that come with taking it. Recently a doctor refused treating me for taking Percoset regularly.  I felt that was unfair as it truly is a great pain reliever. Perhaps she was someone that doesn't experience pain - but it was bothersome to hear that.

I have a problem with my throat constricting and these pills have gotten stuck in my throat.  They don't taste very good at all!  But they help with my chronic back pain ( I have 4 collapsed discs in my lumbar spine).
