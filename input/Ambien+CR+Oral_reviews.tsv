I wanted to be knocked out since I have a fear of flying.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	ritam2ben, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/30/2012 10:16:55 PM	I had very bad insomnia and ambien has helped me sleep through the night. I am very happy taking this drug.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Sundance, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	5/7/2012 11:32:09 PM	I have taken Ambien CR (Zolpidem)12.5 mg for about two years now.  I can't go to sleep or stay asleep very long, so when I found this it was a blessing, it is so wonderful to get an unerupted nights sleep, usually 6 to 8 hours.  The bonus is no side effects.  Other sleep enhancers would leave me feeling horrible the next morning, with Ambien, I can wake and feel good.  My only worry was long time use, my doctor doesn't seem concerned as long as it's working for me, which it is.  It was good to read that others have used it long term as well.  Here's to a good nights sleep~

The very next night i woke up 2 hours later having the strangest dream ever.  The next night the same thing happened.  I was unable to go back to sleep after both times. Has this happened to anyone else?
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/26/2011 8:20:45 PM	I've been taking the 12.5 Ambien CR for 3 years &amp; the Zolpidem (generic) for 1 year.  No dreams at all with Ambien, but dreams every night with Zolpidem. Also, Ambien gave me 6 hours of sleep &amp; Zolpidem is only 4. After waking up in the middle of the night, I can still fall back to sleep with either one. This drug has been a lifesaver for me.  NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL.    
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	patco, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	65-74	11/16/2011 5:54:22 PM	I don't have a problem going to sleep, it is staying asliip.  Ambien CR seems to make me sleep longer, although I rarely sleep longer than 6 hours.  Six hours is good for me.  Regular ambien does not do this, I keep waking up every 1-2 hours with regular Ambien. I don't take Ambien CR every night, just when I haven't had any good sleep for a few days.  So I probably take it about3 or 4 days a week.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	10/26/2011 8:48:03 PM	A short time ago I was percribed Ambien CR for sleep. I am still and was at the time dealing with PTSD, Bipolar depression, ADHD and severe social anxiety. After the first time taking it I thought &quot;wow this works awesome&quot; and I fell right asleep. All was great time I woke up the next morning feeling disoriented, confused, angry, deeply depressed, violent, and suicidal. All day long I was pacing my home growling and nearly barking at anyone that came near me. I latel found out from a doctor that my behavior was due to a bad reaction to the Ambien I took.  I have since then found out that I can not take sleeping aids. I have simular reaction to most of them. I am now on Seroquel and it seems to help with sleep and my mental status. Take caution and please READ lables and information sheets that come with your medications.

In the beginning I was told of conversations that I had, and things that I did that I didn't remember.  But it worked so well that I made sure that I went directly to bed after I took it (I would give this 5 stars).  But I guess since I've been taking it for so long, it started to lose its effectiveness and now my insurance won't cover it.  My MD switched me to Sonata but I this doesn't seem to work and it makes my heart race. I've also tried Lunesta that has a HORRIBLE taste.  I refuse to go through that.  I'm hoping that somehow I can get something that worked like Ambien CR.  I would gladly go back to taking Ambien even though it doesn't work as fast as it use to because I've been taking it for years.

I took the 12.5 mg does a couple of times and then threw the rest of the pills away because the side effects were so bad for me.  It did make me sleep soundly for about 6 hours, but I woke up feeling incredibly hungover and this lasted all day the next day.  I felt like I had wet sand in my head and that I might throw up.  The day after taking it, I also was incredibly emotional, crying on and off all day, and having panic attacks for no real reason.  I felt weak and uncoordinated until almost 24 hours later.  It's scary that I drove the next day given how I felt.  I will NEVER take this medication again.

I take it on an empty stomach, as recommended, and go to bed immediately after taking it.  Within 15-20 minutes I am asleep.  If I watch TV in bed, I fall asleep with it on, so I shut TV off before 15 min.  On a few occasions, I have discovered the next morning that I have eaten something and not remembered it, so I determine before I get into bed that I will NOT eat anything.  It works.  Trust me.  If you follow directions, you will NOT run into problems.  Never deviate from the instructions.  The problems you may hear about are usually when instructions are not followed exactly.  Occasionally, I take the smaller-dose tablet (6.25 mg.), which seems to alleviate any amnesia, but doesn't work quite as well as the 12.5 mg. tablet.

I have to stop taking this and suffer through a few nights of not sleeping in order to find something else.  I cannot carry on this way.  My husband says I'm a completely different person since starting this 3 weeks ago.  It works great in putting me asleep and allowing me to sleep all night, but be VERY CAREFUL this stuff is habit forming AND changes who you are as a person!

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Scott, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	55-64	1/7/2011 11:40:38 AM	Okay folks. This needs further investigation. I took Ambien for 10 years. I experienced all of the known side effects like cooking, even driving to get food, truth telling to my partner, but the reason I am writing is that at about year 9 I began to feel particularly weak around 5:00 each day. This got progressively worse until I needed to take myself to the emergency room one evening thinking I may pass out or be having a heart attach. Nothing abnormal was found. They said I was exhausted but I knew I was getting 8 hours each night with Ambien. I weaned myself off it, began having dreams again and the daily weakness has disappeared. Could Ambien have been the culprit? It appears so. Could ten years without REM stage sleep be to blame? (a side-effect I read about) I loved Ambien but I think more research addressing this question is needed.

If it works for you, I wish I could agree - I watched someone sleepwalk, fall out of bed and crack open their head open, black their eye and split it open, they were vulgar, hateful, violent, and addicted to it. The worst part is they did not remember a single thing except the pain the next day after it wore off. I had to babysit an adult night after night and it almost caused a divorce. Call it whatever you want, but my best friend had same issues with their loved one and several others I know very well. Just please, use extreme caution - it is not good for those who cannot sleep... thank you

My doctors are not worried about the possibility of me getting addicted; they say it's much more important that I get my sleep!  I think it works great and I never feel hung over in the morning.  I do sometimes get up in the night to snack and then don't remember it the next day.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Natalie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/28/2010 11:34:52 AM	Really scary!  Slept-walked and slept-cooked and took several showers during the night.  I did not know any of this until my husband informed me of this. I had gained a few pounds and now I think it's because I was &quot;sleep-eating&quot; because I would find bagels and chips and lunch meat out in the mornings.  Anyway, He stayed by me the whole night and protected me.  Apparently I was wielding a knife and cutting up salads, etc.  He said I was like a zombie or one of the out-of-it people you see on that show, &quot;Intervention&quot;.  He said he was so scared for me... and I will never take it again.  Beware and please be careful.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	jrb1950, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	6/22/2010 2:47:45 PM	I have had chronic sleep issues for years and was put on Ambien way back; didn't stay asleep.  Then was give 12.5 mg Ambien CR; most people say to take it right before going to sleep and not to read, watch TV, etc.  I have been on it so long that I now have to take it 1 hour before I go to bed before I even feel sleepy.  Then because I go to bed early, 9 p.m., I am awake anywhere between 2:30 and 4:30 a.m. and usually can't get back to sleep.  Sometimes I will be able to go back into a light sleep, like catnaps, and I finally give up and get out of bed at 6:30 because I hurt too much to stay in bed.  I have next day drowsiness, headache, joint pain and muscle pain; but suppose it could be related to other issues besides the Ambien CR.  I am now thinking of asking my doctor if she thinks Lunesta would be better as I have read it's supposed to be better for long term use over Ambien CR.  I just know I'm afraid to stop taking anything as I will go back to insomnia and that's not good for your mental or physical health.  Sorry this is so long, but just wanted to talk and let everyone know what I've been going through in case anyone else has had the same issues.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	sasha88, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	35-44	5/23/2010 2:53:19 PM	Two years ago I took ambien CR as a sleep aid for jet lag when traveling overseas.  Kept me asleep (when you normally wake up at 2a.m. ready to go!) 'til normal wake-up time.  Worked like a charm.  Regular Ambien couldn't keep me to sleep the entire night.  Only CR would do that.  Soon after all the traveling I had back surgery and used it during that time also.  Then I stopped using it.  Now its over two years later since I stopped it and I am using it again for overseas travel (severe jet lag) and some stress/difficulty sleeping.  These pill just aren't working.  I took one last night and nothing.  I took a second one, managed to sleep a couple hours, then woke up again.  I always fell asleep the 1st time round (few years ago) with CR - the experience was, I would say, very consistent.  Never built up a tolerance to speak of.  Now its been a over two years since I took it last so I figure it should work as it always did.  Well it doesn't.  Almost not at all.  So, either my body chemistry has changed, I have received pills from a poorly made batch, it was stored too long before it was sold to me, or worse.  I will complain to the FDA and the manufacturer on this one.  Has anyone else noticed this lately?  FYI I live in the Houston Heights - but won't state where I received it.

Have been taking Ambien CR for 11 years after trying everything else. it works for me. I take it about 1:30 am after my sinuses have dried out and I can no longer sleep. The only problem with it is I can no longer afford it, no insurance!!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	ncrangerwilly, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	35-44	5/1/2010 3:58:56 AM	first night i slept like a baby, i awoke feeling absolutely great after 8 hours of blissful sleep. next night not as great but was still pretty good... after taking it about a week i started sleepwalking, to the point of going to my neighbors house and rearranging their patio furniture and plants. luckily they knew me well, and that something was wrong and i wasnt dangerous, so thankfully no law got involved and they even allowed me to stay at their house so i wouldnt accidentally hurt myself or others.   another time i got up one night to use the bathroom and as i was washing my hands i insantly fell a sleep standing up and fell busted a huge hole in the wall and bruised my head arm and ego. these are only two of the 5 or 6 unpleasant experiences i had... so if you decide to take this drug you might want someone to watch over you till you see how it affects you, which could change from dose to dose and night to night. so be very careful. i dont have these problems with the regular ambien. thought i will wake a few times during the night, im very grateful im still in own my bed.! good luck all
Other	lawyer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	4/24/2010 6:21:06 PM	I started taking ambien CR 10mg because I could not sleep at night due to the fact I have acid reflux and its gets worse when I lay down.  The first 5 months I took ambien I slept great.  I could not feel the acid reflux and thus would could all night and wake up in the morning feeling great.  After 5 months, I decide to stop taking it because I was concerned I'd get addicted.  Of course, I could not sleep because of the acid reflux, some anxiety for 4 days and to add to it I started getting ringing in my ears when the my room was silent.  The ringing sounds like its inside my head.  I do have high blood pressure and take medication for it, but I don't think this has anything to do with the  ear ringing because I've been on blood pressure pills for over 3 years.  Anyways, I am going to talk to my doctors.  But ever since I stopped taking the ambien, my ears ring constantly.  Every now and then, I will take one and the next day if I don't take the ambien, I cannot sleep well.  It takes about 2 days to get back to the sleep I usually get.  It's not a bad pill, but it's a little scary to take all the time because of the chance of addiction.  If you decide to take it stop every 3 months for at lease 3 weeks and then if you really need it take one here and there, but not every night.

I wake up with major muscle and joint pain.I feel as though my hands are swollen.Last night I had pain in my hands , back and ankles.I have fibromyalgia too, but this muscle and joint pain is different from the fibro. I feel like I have a virus all the time since I have started taking ambien cr. Guess I need to get off of it to really see if it is causing this pain.I neeed my sleep as I am a care taker for my husband. Has anyone else had unexplained muscle and joint pain since going on ambien cr?

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Happy 2 b alive, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/9/2010 3:35:19 AM	This medication is scary. I have taken it for several years and was fine. In the last year I was texting, making phone calls and my kids would wait till I got to that weird zone and talk to me. I hated that it is very violating. The symptoms got worse. Until one night I had a minor minor fight with my boyfriend. Went upstairs to go to sleep. Took my 1, 12.5. From that point on I am stilunaware of  what nightmare I was about to go through. Apparently he came up to talk to me. Intold him I think I took 3 or 4 more. He went to call my GP. In the time he went down to call her and come back up apparently I had taken 10 more. He said i was rumaging though the drawer for more. I dont know why I didnt just find the bottle. What ever. He paniced they call 911. I guess they came talked to me, stuck me with needles, something that I have a terrible fear of, apparently not that night.  They took me to the hospital gave me the charcoal treatment. That of which I am glad I do not remember. They did many other things. I woke up in the ICU many hours later. I was in tears could not understand what was going on.The last humiliation at that moment, was I was uncontrolaby pooping a black substance. My last word were OH God. I fell asleep again. My poor boyfriend endured the clean up. I work in the medical field so I know the routine.  The next time I woke up they were telling me all kinds of stories, taking some pills, lots of pills. What? Is all I could say. I cried and called my parents. I am 52, mother of 5. Working through lots of stuff. Nothing that would ever ever has caused me to try to kill myslef. I spent the next 2 days unable to sleep because they would not give me anything. I was distraught, I was horrified as the events of that night dribbled in. I had to try to convice numerous people.To Shrinks, Social workers, nurses and my parents that I did not try to do what it looked like I tried to do. Don't take it please. There are thousands of stories out there. Some worse!!!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	45-54	3/2/2010 10:29:17 AM	This is a very dangerous drug. I have had 2 instances of sleep walking, the latest resulting in me driving my car and getting into a serious accident. I have no recolection of the events of this night. This is a common side effect which is not widely publicized. Upon stopping the use, I have not slept for nearly a week. do your research and think twice about using this drug.

I never took it again and am still trying to find a solution to my insomnia + anxiety.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	georgiamamacat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/31/2010 8:12:09 AM	I took this drug for the first time last night at approximately midnight and woke up 3-4 times during the night. It is now 730am and I am wide awake.  I will try it again tonight and if it does not help any better, I will discontinue use.  So far, not worth the money it cost.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Sleep tight, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	1/15/2010 11:14:09 AM	Last night was the 2nd night I took this Ambien CR 12.5 mg for sleep.  This is the secong day I woke up with a mild headache and stuffy nose.  I'm not sure the stuffy nose is from this but feel it could be. It kept me asleep all night, which was from 10pm until 6:30am.  I feel very well rested.  If it wasn't for the headaches I'd say this medication is a God send.  I take some Advil and the headache goes away.  Anyone else having headache and or stuffy nose with this medication?  I have no insurance and paid $175.00 of this medication at Sam's Club Pharmacy, which is cheaper on their meds. than Walgreens, CVS even Walmart who they are affiliated with.  The maker needs to make the 12.5 mg Ambien CR in a generic form.  I hope this review helps anyone who takes time to read it. MM

This is a HORRIBLE drug and should be removed from the market.  MY wife is a recovering alcoholic and also bipolar started using this drug about 9 months ago. Her memory is totally gone, she talks nonsensically, she doesn't even know what day it is.  She has been suicidal, verbally abusive and just recently shown very agressive and violent behavior.  This drug may work for a few people but for some it is a NIGHTMARE. I'm sure as long as people continue to buy it and the drug company makes a profit it will remain on the market.

If anyone has a solution please let me know as I want to get off of the three  that I take, namely, ambian cr, zoloft, and klonopin. The last I have tried myself and I get the shakes when I do not take it. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Jus1ano, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/6/2009 8:23:30 PM	I've been taking Ambien for about 4 years off and on due to insomnia. I take it when I am working steady and then wean myself off prior to or during long vacation breaks for a couple of months. For the past year I have been taking the  12.5 mg Ambien CR which works better and I get an additional 2 hours sleep all spread out through the night, about 7-8 hours. I feel rested and can get through the work day.  The non generic brand or the regular 10 mgs don't last as long and I wake every couple of hours. In les then 20 minutes I'm sleep. I use these to wean myself off by cutting it in half, and the a quarter over a 3 night period before coming all the way off. This cuts the side affects which include waking up w/ high adreneline and anxiety, hot flash and shortness of breath. Also feelings of irritability and aggitation with lots of tossing and turning. Memory loss is an issue. Recall is poor and I'm not as quick to remember things from the past. Overall, my experience with Ambien CR has been a blessing. I have been taking it for the past 3-4 months and the memory loss is the most obvious side affect yet. No sleep driving or sleep walking incidents.

No more walking around during the day in a daze from lack of sleep. I didn't have a problem with side effects, overall I feel this medication can help allot of people who suffered many years with insomnia. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	private, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	45-54	11/10/2009 12:58:02 AM	I have been falling asleep at all hours of the day. I do things and go places I do not remember anything about. I am irritable with everyone. I am also on narcotics and muscle relaxers and have many health problems contraindicated for.  But my Dr. did not ask about these problems that were preexisting. So I am questioning my Drs. sense in giving me this medicine, not downgrading the ambien cr per se. My Dr. should have read the interactions with other drugs and health problems.  I have thought I was losing my mind, but I have found explanations for all my problems right here and just wish I had thought to look here sooner.  I mean I REALLY thought I was completely going crazy and becoming paranoid and it's just side effects when mixed with other meds I am on.  Thank God for this sight!

This is usually just 2-3 times per month.  I have only had trouble one time and it was my fault.  I took the medication before I put whitening strips on my teeth and then tried to stay awake for 30 minutes.  I woke up the next morning in the hallway, with the strips still in my mouth.  If you take this medication, do as it says.  Take it and go straight to bed.  I have taken 27 pills over the last 8 months and have never had any other problem.

However, I tried it again and I do get 8 hrs. of sleep.  I feel better when I take it since I do get sleep but I definetly am hooked.  I can tell when I am unable to take it because I don't have 8 hours to sleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	kim, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/16/2009 12:31:02 AM	It worked very well the first couple of months-I'd take it at 9:00pm and be asleep by 10:00pm.  Then I noticed it started taking longer for me to feel sleepy and to finally fall asleep. So if i took it at my usual time (9:00), I'd find I wouldn't fall asleep until between 11:00pm and midnight.Also, I do have periods of amnesia if I make the mistake of taking the Ambien and then not going immediately to bed. I'll stay up and check email, put in a load of laundry, take meat out to thaw overnight etc..., but the next morning I have to recollection of doing those things. This has happened several times, where I THINK I'm totally aware of what I'm doing, but the next day have no memory of it. This is very unnerving. So I definitely recommend taking the Ambien CR and going immediatley to bed. As long as I take it early enough in the evening, I don't feel &quot;hungover&quot; in the morning. But on the few occassions I did take one late (like atfer 11pm) I slept a long time the next morning (til 10am) and it was very hard to get out of bed. So try and take it early in the evening and at the same time every night. I do still dream since I've been on Ambien, but I often have trouble recalling them the next morning.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	GiGi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	10/3/2009 6:27:17 PM	I began taking AmbianCR approx. 3 yrs. ago. I took this med. as needed usually 1-2x a week.I also take Effexor XR &amp; Xanax for severe deppression &amp; anxiety. The AmbianCR worked well for the first 2yrs.For the past 6 months, I've gradually began to experience short-term memory loss as well as total memory loss of 1-2 days in a row. I could'nt imagine what was happening to me. My family would mention certain events to me &amp; I had no idea what they were talking about. I know the side effects of Ambian CR and decided this medication was the problem. I immediately discontinued the Ambian CR &amp; within one week the memory loss &amp; &quot;black outs&quot; of certain events subsided. I'm sure Ambian CR is safe for some people with short-term use, but never for long-term use {2yrs.&amp; longer}. By the way, my physciatrist prescribed these medications for me and stated I should not be having episodes of memory loss with the Ambian CR.WRONG!! Sometimes we as patients have to become &quot;patient advocates&quot; for ourselves.There ARE other sleep aids out there.

It is very addictive, and now I can not sleep without it. I will go almost sleepless for 2 when I stop taking it. I do not recommend use for any long period of time. The side affects are too great. Memory loss and sleep walking are a huge problem. This is NOT a great drug. Good luck, I know I'll need it.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Joan, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	9/17/2009 8:04:21 PM	My husband takes Ambien CR.  He is completely handicapped and dependent on my help.  He falls asleep for a short time, then wakes, sits up and lays back down several times.  Then wants to sit on the side of the bed and acts very disoritnted and confused.  This goes on all night long until I finally give in and help him up into his wheelchair and take him in the living room to his easy chair.  Then, I go back to sleep.  He never remembers what he does.  Very ineffective.  Also, I can't sleep since he can't.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	lmeston, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	9/16/2009 1:27:57 AM	I am 27 years old and my doctor put me Ambien CR about a week ago because I had not slept in over a week due to pain. When I sleep it isn't very long maybe 15-30 minutes at a time. I broke a vertebre and hernieated and degerated discs in my back and neck, so I am in a lot of pain. The first night I took Ambien it was just 1 10mg pill at bedtime and it was awesome-it was the best night of sleep I ever had; however, my husband could not wake me up. Every night since then, it does me no good at all. I might as well be popping m&amp;ms in my mouth, afterall they taste better. I wonder if anyone else has found this drug so ineffective. I have talked to several people who have taken it and they all raved about it. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/14/2009 10:32:26 AM	I have been taking this medicine for about 3 years.  I have tried going off for a few nights in a row but after no sleep for a few days I would start right back up.  Before starting this medication I went for 12 years of only getting a total of 1-2 hours of sleep, so I am in my glories.  No, I do not always sleep throuth the night but some sleep is better than none for me.  I do not like the hypnotic side effects I get if I do not go too bed within 15 minutes of taking it. The things my family tell me are quite funny, they are normal things but I just do not remember doing them.  I have fibromyalgia so sleep is crucial.  I do not take it if I know I or someone else in the family needs to be up very early the next morning. I do not know what I would have done if the Dr. had not finally put me on this.  It has worked great for me.

The next morning, my boyfriend will tell me about my crazy antics.  Usually, I am overly affectionate with my dogs and ask my boyfriend about &quot;the baby&quot; or eggs.  But this is my fault for not following the directions on the bottle.

Ambien CR has made it possible for me to get to sleep and fall back to sleep when/if I wake up in the middle of the night. However, the next morning I feel bloated and swollen and my entire body hurts!  I have Fibromyalgia and Arthritis so I'm going to ask my Dr. if this med. is making those conditions worse.  If not for the morning pain and being swollen I would give this medication all 5 stars because it DOES WORK!

I take 12.5 mg and used to take just Ambien but would wake every hour. Now I sleep like a zombie for 7-9 hours. I lost my arm and shoulder two years ago and I'm in extreme pain all day, so with Ambien CR I have no pain at night. The other night my husband said I did eat a piece of cake at 1am. I did not remember doing that.

He asked me no other questions.  Some Diagnosis?  The CR version made me feel unsteady and foggy during the day.  It will help you sleep, however the daytime feelings were not worth it to me.  Regualar ambien may be better for daytime side effects.  I am trying Lunesta, sleep not as good yet, however daytime side effects are much better.  Whatever you do, do your own research.  Most doctors are well intentioned, however usually do not take enough time to properly determine underlying cause.

I forget things anyway, so I don't know if it makes it worse, but I know that if I stop, I probably won't sleep for days on end, so it is ok.  I cut the blue pill in half and it works fine. The directions tell you not to cut the pills but I do and it works just fine.  As far as having sex and not remembering it, that's a new one for me, never heard that before, but all the husbands out there would love that.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	ambiencrhater, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	8/9/2009 2:37:50 PM	This drug can be extremely dangerous. I think one of the biggest problems is that it is highly addictive. After a while you build up a tolerance to the drug and have to increase dosage. I had been on 20mg for almost a year and a half. I had tried to stop many times without any success. There was times I would take the med go lay down and still be unable to sleep. So without really remembering I would get up and do things, talk to people, watch movies, eat all with no recolection the next day. It's very much like being intoxicated. After taking Ambien CR one night I ended up in the hospital for a week. I nearly killed myself taking this medication. So if you are going to take it be EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS! And I would recommened trying alternatives to this. Also make sure you really advocate for yourself when talking to your doctor about side effects of this medication. If you want to stop it, make sure he helps to take you off of it. My doctor never supported me because I didn't advocate enough for myself. I overly trusted the medication and my doctor.

I woke up @6am,went to Walmart and filled the cart with items like a hedge trimmer and lingerie both being items I didn't need. So other than the $120.00 shopping spree this has been very helpful in getting a goodnight's sleep

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	6/9/2009 5:29:07 AM	My Fiance is in the hospital with a pneumonia. He has gotte n0 sleep since he has been here. He took Ambien, per doctors orders two nights ago. He took the pill, then turned on the TV. 15 minutes later, he was telling me he couldnt find what he was looking for, he had two hands, and then he proceeded to try and take out his IV. Needless to say, I sat up the entire night staring at him, every time I would turn around he would be twitching, trying to get out of bed, trying to rip his oxygen off, his IV out, halucinating really badly, or screaming. At one point he decided it would be a good idea to knock over his IV stand..... DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS, AND MAKES YOU HALUCINATE AND REMEMBER NOTHING.

Other	Caring RN, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	5/21/2009 12:08:42 AM	As a caregiver have found this medication or it's generic equivalent to be EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  The patients in my care have been (both patients!) been observed sleep walking, sleep cooking and sleep driving (one patient) that ended up driving into the interior wall of their garage - this was without my supervision and AFTER me informing the patient's prescribing physician to not refill!  Luckily no person was hurt however there was serious damage done to the patient's vehicle and garage.  Both patients not only had complete amnesia of these events, they also had no recollection of the following day's events either (an RX hang-over effect).  This cannot be a coincidence - I believe it happens more often than reported.  Please use EXTREME caution using this med - and if you decide to take it please be sure to have someone observe you for at least 24 hours.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	5/3/2009 2:48:55 AM	This medication was very effective for me in terms of sleep but there came a point when I actually woke up during sex several times with no recollection of having started the act, which freaked me out.  On other occasions, I began getting packages in the mail that I didn't remember ordering that I assume I did &quot;in my sleep&quot; while on Ambien.  Another night I almost burnt the house down cuz I apparently attempted to make coffee in the middle of the night and did so with no water and left the pot plugged in.  In short, I slept, but didn't stay laying down. lol I flushed the rest of the Ambien CR. These things scared me.. I am currently taking Klonopin which doesn't cause these side effects for me. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	65-74	4/30/2009 10:26:04 AM	This medicine caused me to sleepwalk.  One night I found myself in the bathtub and another night my husband found me down the street on my block telling him I couldn't find my house and then went back to bed.  Do not take this drug.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female		4/17/2009 1:51:35 PM	I have had insomnia for years and tried several OTC drugs.  I had been getting about 10 hours of sleep a WEEK for about 2 years, and it was really affecting my health and life.  My doctor finally gave me a script for this and it was amazing!  About 15 minutes after I take the pill I start feeling a little drunk, and I noticed that if I do not go right to bed after taking it, the feeling gets worse. I did notice feeling a little more, um, sexual after I took it.  But that is NOT a bad thing. I am very happy that I tried this drug and I am love the results!  The only problem that I noticed was when I was woke up one night by one of my children, I think that I &quot;tripped&quot;.  I saw a lot of really pretty colors swirling around my bedroom.  But it only happened once, so it didnt bother me.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	TheRealRom, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	4/16/2009 4:12:04 AM	I had my physical, told the Doc of my getting only 3-4 hours of sleep a day (I work nightshift).  He prescribed the CR 12.5 and warned me &quot;take it and go straight to bed- the 8 hours you can get is no joke&quot;.Well, he was right.  Personaly, I find it works within 15 minutes, causing a feeling of &quot;fluffiness&quot; in my legs.  On the very first time I took it, I slept 7 hours- something I hadn't done in almost a year- and woke up &quot;refreshed&quot; but with that &quot;fluffiness&quot; now in my head (it dissapated within 5 minutes of waking up).  Now, I take it every other morning when i get home from work.  Personally, I found that even on the days I dont take it, I can still get 6 or more hours of sleep- this stuff works great!  Doc suggested trying to go every two days soon, to see if my sleep pattern has adjusted to where I can get off it.  I'll let you know what happens!Other than the &quot;fluffiness&quot; mentioned above (which has either tapered off over time or I have just gotten used to it), there have been no side effects.  I do like my doc says- I dont play around with the stuff.  I make sure I have 8 hrs to spare, and I take it and go straight to bed.  Period.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	db, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	4/6/2009 9:30:48 PM	Suffer from chronic tinnitus..which causes my chronic insomnia..have taken ambien cr for about 2 yrs now..does have side effects..eating in my sleep..making phone calls that I have no recollection of..it seems to total erase my memory from about 5 minutes after taking..until I wake up about 5 hrs later..but is only way I can go and stay asleep. Have tried other sleeping drugs..but only sleep about 2 1/2 hrs..so this is much better for me. I only take this drug once I have gotten into bed..otherwise..my husband has trouble getting me into bed once it has kicked in (trying to go eat..do chores..or just be argumentative)...but like I said..only way I get 4.5 to 5.5 hrs of sleep. I am thankful for this drug..eventho I think it should be a last resort drug because it does have the side effect of having NO recollection at all of what I have done during my *sleep phase*...but at least it gets me *away from my tinnitus*..even for just a few hours..I am so thankful for that.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	4/3/2009 3:43:15 PM	I have been taking ambien CR on and off for about a year now. I suffer from insomnia sometimes due to anxiety attacks at night-thinking to much etc...at first this was the miracle drug but over time your body gets used to it and it is not as effective. It leaves you with a awful headache and your memory goes down the drain-I was making mistakes at work all the time. I also started getting depressed and angry. I took ambien 3-5 times a week. I spoke with my docter and she prescribed me Trazadone-50 mg. So far its been great. i sleep at night and wake up with no headache and I feel great. I def would recommend this over ambien CR-but i know everyones chemistry differs.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Jwright, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	4/3/2009 6:41:37 AM	This medicine works but It causes me to have weird dreams, really weird. Within 30 minutes of taking the drug I feel funny, for example like I had a lot to drink or was drugged. I found that if you take it took a shower when your done GO TO BED and the weird feeling will not be so bad. What is really weird is it makes my sexual desire high when I take it just for a couple of hours. I did wake up feeling like I got sleep and was refreshed I just wish the dreams were not so weird and I didn't feel drunk when I took it.

My husband tells me that i act like im a sloppy drunk.. wich i have no recalition of.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/31/2009 9:16:48 AM	I have been taking this for over a year now and I have had experiences with no memory such as singing in my sleep, and also intimatcy w/my husband and no memories at all.  No eating issues THANK GOD, but you do need to be very careful to go straight to bed after taking as the meds can kick in within 4 minutes of taking it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping		1	1	1			3/17/2009 1:11:26 PM	I started taking Ambien CR last night and it did NOTHING!!! Has anyone else had this experience? Does it take a few nights to work.  I called my Doctor and I think they think I'm crazy
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/17/2009 11:10:13 AM	I have to admit that this medication is the best for my anxiety that causes me to have insomnia at night! I've taken ambien and can relate to the 'not remembering things' if you don't go straight to bed but fortunately because it releases so much of the medication at once and that is not the case with ambien cr! I am able to get 7 hours of sleep every night and wake up so refreshed and ready for the day! I am amazed at how a great nights sleep can do some may wonders and get you through the day :)

But you do need to definitely heed the warnings and go directly to bed. I took two and stayed up a while longer picking up around the house. That is the last thing I remember for the next 30 hours. I hadn't put the bottle away and they tell me that I must have taken several more without knowing it. I had to be hospitalized for 2 days.

I have been satisfied with Ambien b/c it allowed me to go to sleep and remain asleep.  I took for over a month, but decided that after I got off of Cymbalta to stop Ambien because I didn't want to become addicted.  I am able to fall asleep on my own now and stay asleep.  Overall, Ambien CR worked for me with no side effects.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/6/2009 3:05:13 AM	I was put on Ambien CR after being on regular ambien for 1 1/2 years. Ambiens CR actually allows me to get at least 7-8 hours of good, hard sleep a night, where as regular Ambien only allowed me 3-4 hours of broken aleep a night. I have never had any of the side affects that other people have spoken of. I would highly reccommend this drug if you are having troubles sleeping.

I have several side effects that I did not realize were associated with this drug until reading these reviews. It does put me out within 30 minutes but most recently I have discovered massive memory loss of conversations or things I have done the previous night. I've even called my husband after finding out his brother has passed away from an email from a family member and asked him why he didn't tell me. He replied &quot;your the one who told me last night.&quot; Do not take if you have anything to hide.

Was falling asleep fine, but couldn't stay asleep. This stuff works great! Wish i had mentioned not sleeping to my doctor earlier. No side effects for me except my husband says he can ask me something and i will have an actual conversation with him! Thank goodness i have nothing to hide, because you DONT remember this!Lol! I would also like to mention that i only take this medicine when i've just got to have a really good nights sleep or have not slept good in a few nights. I'm sure it can be addictive-it says it on your information you get when you have this filled. READ your prescriptions BEFORE you take them and follow the directions and they will work for you. This is a good medication when taken properly.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Xarkun, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	19-24	1/26/2009 9:24:56 PM	We all know by now this medication DOES help you sleep, but the side effects are really not worth it. I have been on this stupid drug for over 6 months, yes it helps me stay asleep. However, I recently have had massive memory loss, have had many conversations at night with people even IM'ing people without remembering what I said. Yes I even would eat, zone out, and become a walking zombie(without the flesh eating of course).So to all of you who are thinking about trying this drug, stay away. I went one night without it, couldnt sleep, had cold sweats/hot flashes. A person my age shouldn't be having 90% of the side effects that I am having. PLEASE for your sake and ours, try something else.

My fibromyalgia pain and arthritis in my knees kept me awake, and in the morning I felt absolutely horrible..! Since I have been taking Ambien I feel like a normal person again. No side effects whatsoever...simply deep, wonderful sleep. Make sure to take it on a somewhat empty stomach at night otherwise it takes longer to kick in. Once it kicks in - you are out dead... :)
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Cangel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	12/9/2008 1:14:39 PM	when I was in my early teens to early adult age 23 I had problems with sleeping. It went away okay for the past couple months I have tried tylenol PM, advil PM, benedryl, until I talked to my doctor. She put me on Ristoril 50 mg still did not work, then another doctor in the office put me on trazodone 50 mg, still nothing would help me go to sleep and stay asleep. Last Monday my doctor put me on Ambien an that did nothing. So Yesterday my doctor gave me Ambien CR, I took it at 9:45 and by 10pm I was asleep and only woke up once during the night and I went right back to sleep. I have not had no side affects like others have and I would recommend this to anyone having trouble sleeping.

I have been taking this medicine for a very long time.  Orginally, satisifed, long term, I cannot say.  Obviously, if it worked TOTALLY WELL by itself, I would not have to be using &quot;Trazodone&quot; AS WELL as &quot;Ambien CR&quot; for a good night's sleep.   If I take &quot;Trazodone&quot; without the &quot;Ambien CR&quot;, I cannot sleep.  For me both medications work well, alone not so well.

Weaned myself off it, then my mother died and I needed it again. I have been on it for about 10 months maybe 5 times a week. Now I notice I cry all the time and feel like I am in a terrible depression. My dreams have been strange and I don't sleep as well as in the beginning of usage. I wake up suddenly feeling like I can't breathe. I think this is good for short term use only.

It's helping me to get to sleep on my own. I take the pills only when I'm completely restless, so they help me to get back in a decent sleeping routine when I DON'T have to take them. Although...they do make me feel very drunk for 30 minutes or so before I go to sleep. I'm not fond of that, but it's helping me deal with insomnia temporarily so I'm satisfied.

I take the pill 20 minutes before bedtime and wake up 5 1/2 - 7 hours later feeling refreshed.  I have chronic sleeping disorder and was taking 100mg Trazodone, which gave me headaches from hell and when I woke up, I felt like I had been drugged. It left me with no energy, feeling tired when I woke up.Now, 2 weeks into this regimen, I wake up refreshed and ready to go with no side effects at all. As I said earlier, so far so good.

Taking it with 0.5 mg. clonazapam for sleep. Taking this as it works better than 10 mg generic zolpidem. Problem is cannot sleep without it.Very important to not stay up after taking this. Elderly people may fall, they must be sure to be supervised they dont walk around after taking this.

Then next thing I know I am taking it every night.  At first it works, and now I only get 5 hours of sleep.  If I don't take it I can't sleep.  I am going to get off this crap and exercise.  Sometimes it makes me feel out of control.  I am having trouble remembering things and being very forgetful.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	jellybean, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	9/23/2008 8:56:44 PM	I have been using this drug for two months now.  Originally it worked great, but recently I have trouble falling asleep. I have also become quite groggy and sleepy during the day. I can't seem to stay awake the next day which results in my not being able to go to bed until quite late. One vicious cycle. Side effect?

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	MissyMay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/11/2008 2:46:44 AM	Wow, this stuff is crazy! I went to my Dr last week because I haven't been sleeping well for about 3 years, he gave me Ambien CR. No joke... I filled my prescription, and took it that night at 9:30pm, and didn't wake up til almost 9:30 the next morning!!! Did I mention, I have to be to work at 8:30am?!?! I slept right through my alarm even! So, I thought it was a one-time occurance, and took it again the next night. My boyfriend actually said I yelled at him in my sleep, and I made sure he woke me up at 7am... it was the worst morning of my life!! :( I drank so much coffee to stay awake. I get the appeal of this drug... it totally makes you sleepy, but I guess you can't take it if you have to work or be productive in the morning. What do people do if they have small kids to tend to in the night? Or need to wake up early for a presentation at work? This isn't the drug for me obviously. I've decided to either try &quot;self-hypnosis&quot; now or that newer Rozerem drug. I would recommend taking the Ambien CR only if you can commit 12 hours to sleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping		3	1	1			9/9/2008 10:03:08 AM	Have someone tie you to the bed. This med puts you out. However, I did drive, go to the doctor and then woke up at noon at my desk at work. This was even after I had taken it for a while.  While I appeared alert and communicated, I have no memory of any interactions. (this was the next day) At night if you do not go straight to bed, you will stay up chatting and acting drunk. Do NOT take this med alone. Make sure you have someone else has your keys and can make sure you are capable of driving. (Although everyone thought I was okay, and I still drove with no memory)  Just be careful and take extra precautions
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	9/9/2008 9:32:42 AM	This medicine is great at making me fall asleep, however...I go to sleep at about 9:30-10 pm and EVERY night since I started taking it 4 days ago, I wake up at 2 am and cannot fall back asleep and get very anxious.  Last night I stayed up for 2 hours before taking a xanax and falling back asleep.  This medicine makes me very groggy and tired in the morning.  I find myself almost falling asleep driving (all i do at work is drive most of the day) at work and having &quot;blonde&quot; moments do to the fact that I can not think straight.  But this is also do to the intense fatigue of fibromyaligia
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	8/31/2008 7:50:07 AM	After lunesta stopped working for me (was only on it for a few months), my Dr. had me try Ambien Cr. I tried it for two days and hated it. It caused me severe amnesia-I kept getting up to eat twice a night when I should have been sleeping-I didnt know when I fell asleep or woke up, and couldnt remember how much I even slept in the morning. I woke up with my eyes feeling like they were going to fall out of my head, so I know I didnt sleep good. Bad headache too. Atleast with Lunesta you can function and figure out how much you slept while it works. I am going back to my tried and try Ativan for sleep. It is an anti-anxiety drug that relaxes you enough to gently fall asleep on your own without any side effects. Your sleep feels natural too. You wake refreshed. It is addicting so just be careful not too double up-just take as described and when its time to wean off, do it slowly. I was on it for 4 months and weaned off just fine. I had a month break from it, and am now restarting because all else is failing. My Dr. wants me to start Zoloft (an antidepressant) along with it today. If Zoloft works, she asked me to try to wean off the Ativan to get as low of a dose as tolerable. I am now taking 0.5 Ativan 4 times. One at dinner, 2 at bedtime, 1 in middle of night if I can't get back to sleep. With the Zoloft, I am supposed to wean off to one ativan at night to as little as possibe to sleep. My insomnia came on suddenly after a couple years of unrelentling chronic stress.

I am now addictive to it and try to get off Ambien with other sleep meds but they dont work. I have built a tolerance up and now I dont sleep even w/the ambien. Its not for long term use. I have experience conversations or doing things I have not remembered the night before.

After 10 days with about 8 total hours of sleep I called the Dr and was put on a more effective med. Wow. It feels good to finally sleep!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	35-44	8/14/2008 4:41:44 PM	Ambien CR worked great for me. I have sleep apnea and wear a CPAP. I slept very well on Ambien CR with no after effects the next AM. I had been taking Ambien CR for over 2 years when I began having severe memory loss both short term and long term. After stopping Ambien CR I have begun to regain memory and concentration however, the insomnia is back.
Other	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	65-74	7/8/2008 9:02:26 PM	When stopping this drug, .625mg, I had lots of horrible side effects, hallucinations, nightmares that did not end after awakening.  I will never take it again.  I have tried this drug on 3 seperate occsions and the results are the same.  I think this is a very bad risky drug.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	7/8/2008 6:09:01 AM	I have taken ambien CR 12.5 mg on and off for about a year and a half. It does help me fall asleep for the most part, but I have built up a tolerance for it over time. I have also experienced memory loss, such as having conversations with my roommmates and not remembering them. DO NOT take more than one of these at a time. I recently took 2 12.5 mg pills to fall asleep after building up a tolerance and had severe hallucinations, thinking there were people and dogs everywhere. Bottom line: this drug does work well for short-term insomnia, but it's easy to build up a tolerance and the reports about memory loss and hallucinations are true.

If she is on a 6.25mg dose, then 2 is equivalent to one of the larger dosages.

It lets me sleep for a good solid 6 hours and I wake up wonderfully refreshed.  Absolutely must be taken right at bedtime, after all activities.  I would take it every night, but am too concerned about becoming dependent on it.  I take it 2-3 times a week to catch up on my sleep.  I have been experiencing insomnia since I went into menopause.

Now its awful.  I have memory loss, which is affecting my work,  It takes forever to fall asleep, I wake up a few times during the night and I'm always up very early in the morning...still feeling tired.  Mood swings.  I freak out if my prescription starts to get low and I'm afraid I can't get to the pharmacy to get it refilled.  I hate this stuff. DON'T TAKE IT ! Now I just want to get off of it and you can't stop cold or the symptoms or worse than staying on it.

I started with regular Ambien, it lasted about two months. Told my doctor and he changed me to Ambien CR. I have been on it for 2-1/2 years now. It is the only way I can get any sleep. I have tried weaning myself off several times, and my sleep problems come back in a big way. As long as I don't go trying to drive the car, I will keep using them.

Every now and then i wake up in the middle of the night but i fall back asleep since the med dissolves slowly. I noticed i &quot;gag&quot; more when i smoke a cigarette the next morning and throughout the day.  Overall, i give it a 9 out of 10. Im taking the 12.5 and it works well.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	CJ, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	4/15/2008 10:49:00 PM	This medicine didn't work for me. It took over an hour to fall asleep and I wasn't able to stay asleep. I would wake up hungry. I took this medicine for over 3 months. I only slept about 4 hours a night. I became very depressed and lost 25 pounds. I also developed diabetes and had extreme memory lost. My doctor decided to take me off the Ambien CR and put me on trazadone. I'm now 30 pounds heavier and my diabetes is gone. But, most importantly, I'm sleeping like a baby!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	lagalh, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	4/13/2008 9:52:35 AM	I took 12.5 mg of Ambien CR for 2 months and it worked great. Then I started to feel horrible during the day..i.e. brain fogginess, headache, exhausted, memory loss. I asked my doctor to decrease the doseage to 6.5 mg and have been taking that for 2 nights now.  So far, so good. I have still slept thru the night and I have not had that lingering headache or drugged feeling the next day.

The first couple night's I took only one, and the middle of the night I would wake up with not being able to see anything except Kadiscopes of bright colors, lasted about fifteen minutes, before my vision was back too normal. And Now I am hearing voices, wispering , just my name, I see no vision, or parts of a dream.this has hppen twice now.It's a very small, almost angelic sounding voice. Not a voice I reckonized. Kind of freaked me out. Has anyone else experienced anything like this.

However, the stronger dose actually gave me nightly memory loss. I feel like I need at least 9 hours of sleep to not have that &quot;groggy&quot; feeling in the morning. Overall, it beats endless, sleepless nights by far.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	4	5	4	Male	45-54	2/14/2008 1:12:51 AM	Ambien CR 12.5 - When I first took this I hated it because I was sleeping for 10 hours and waking extremely hungover - groggy, loss of memory, telephone converstions that I didn't remember.  I stopped taking it after about a week. After stopping I did not sleep for two nights but then returned to my &quot;normal sleep&quot; pattern which was very light sleep and not feeling rested in the morning. After about 10 months I decided to try the medication again. To my surprise I slept well and the side effects were much less. I have found that as I continue to take the medication its effectiveness has lessened, but I still get a solid 6 hours of sleep. To a much lesser degree, I have still had some memory problems with this drug but overall it has helped me get a restful nights sleep.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	2/14/2008 1:04:46 AM	Ambien CR 12.5mg works much better for me at getting me to sleep quickly and letting me sleep through the night than regular Ambien or the CR 6.25mg.  However, if I take the 12.5mg more than twice a week I plunge into a deep depression, I can feel it coming over me in waves.  Haven't taken this in several months, took it two nights in a row as I desperately needed sleep and the Rozerem I tried caused nightmares and itching.  This time the Ambien caused bizarre dreams.  I slept 9 hours and awoke still very sleepy to my alarm, probably due to the dreams.  Unfortunately, I still had the bizarre dreams the next two night and I did not take the Ambien, so I think it must stay in my system an extremely long time.  I did notice that the second night I took it, it was much more difficult to wake up and get moving the next morning, even after 9 hours of sleep.  Have to take this very sparingly, like only 3 or 4 times a month, and only when I really, REALLY need sleep.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	girlinterrupted, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/1/2008 6:28:54 AM	In the past I have used Ambien 5mg and when my tolerance went up, 10mg.  I used the 10mg dose for several years in college and afterward with great success.  After a brief period with no sleep medications I was prescribed Ambien CR 12.5mg. This medicine works great, IF you follow your doctors instructions.  Takind it on an empty stomach works best, and you must take it literally right before bed. The initial dose released peaks at 15 minutes. Then the delayed release slowly absorbs into your bloodstream over the next 4-6 hours. You should NEVER talk on the phone, be on the computer, watch television, or be in the kitchen eating after taking this med. For it to work properly, you need to take it, hop in the bed, and turn the lights off immedately.  This drug gets a bad name for &quot;sleep-driving&quot;, binge-eating, and memory loss because people take it improperly. If you take it every night, one or two out of seven nights it may be less effective. No drug is fool-proof.  Especially for those who suffer from anxiety and racing thoughts. I apologize for the length of my comment, but I feel it is important to get the proper info. out there. I know how hard it can be to function after multiple sleepless nights. (Tonight is one) I hope this helps some of you out there.  GOODNIGHT!

Lunesta had less side effects; and worked better Unfortunately, my insurance will not cover it. The CR, is more effective, in my opinion, than the original Ambien formula. I will not ask my physician for a refill.

It will provide you with 7-8 hours of sleep, but that is it.  If you take it at 9:00 p.m. you will be up by 5:00 a.m.  Also, I experienced the short term memory loss.  After I would take the drug I could not remeber what happened the rest of the night.  Also had trouble remebering the next day what happened.

This does work faster on an empty stomach and also you do not need to go about daily business, such as talking on the phone, e-mailing, etc. It is meant to be taken for SLEEP so go to bed! No other med let me sleep more than 4 hrs.

My symptoms have been waking up during the night and thinking too much to get back to sleep.  I use this when I know I need to be sharp the next day.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	10/26/2007 7:47:07 PM	Worked well at first, but over time lost effectiveness.  Now take trazodone 100 mg. along with the Ambien CR.  They work faster on an empty stomach than a full one.  
Other	mcsina, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	55-64	10/21/2007 7:05:07 PM	Had full memory loss after medication starting working with me, ie. speaking on telephone with family members at length and having no memory of it whatsoever.  Became aggressive with spouse with no memory of it.  Used for six weeks and became frightened of what I was told I did night(s) prior after use.  NO MORE.  Using different medication now for my insomnia.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	10/18/2007 4:13:56 AM	I took Ambien CR for less than a month.  After only a couple of weeks, this medication quit working as it was supposed to.  I started having difficulty falling asleep, it took longer and longer to fall asleep and I could not stay asleep for the whole night (7 or 8 hours).  When I first fell asleep, I did not have any dream sleep.  As the medication quit working and I was waking up in the middle of the night, I would eventually go back to sleep and have dreams.  But, the dreams started out as very vivid and disturbing, then over several nights progressed to nightmares.  I quit taking the Ambien CR at that point.  I was afraid the nightmares would progress into night terrors and I would (or could) have sleepwalking episodes.  I never had a sleep medication produce (or cause) nightmares or night terrors.  I also had no success with Ambien, Sonata or Lunesta.  My insomnia does not respond to well to medications, I have great difficulty finding something that works for me.
