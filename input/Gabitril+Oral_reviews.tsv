Other	 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		8/24/2010 4:48:50 PM	Took this medicine a few years ago for about 2 months.  Took the prescribed dosage.  Made me very irritable and confused - which was the complete opposite of what I and my doctor were expecting.  It still bothers me when I think of its effects on me.
Other	kat, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	8/17/2010 2:02:31 AM	Within a couple of days of starting this medication for psychiatric reasons I started to talk to walls, made absolutely no sense when talking to people because I would say really odd things, wondered aimlessly talking to nothing. Then lost all my coordination and eventually couldn't talk or walk. This all happened in a matter of days.

But, after several days of use, I became sleepy; a few more days &amp; I became very sleepy and an occasional use of the drug Providgal did not help keeping me awake. -and really no additional relief for my problem - &quot;Peripheral Neuropathy&quot;. 
Other	45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	6/27/2009 7:00:36 PM	I take Gabitril with several other drugs for chronic major depression. It works great as part of a cocktail with Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Trazadone, and Abilify. It's well worth a try.
Other	Happy Feet, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	6/24/2009 7:06:12 AM	I was first prescribed Gabitril by a Neurologist for nerve pain in my extremities, especially my feet, caused by Fibromyalgia, or more accurately &quot;unknown&quot; etiology. I have tried other meds from time to time, but none of them work as well as the Gabitril does. I had a bad reaction to Neurontin, so my Neurologist switched me to Gabitril approximately 10 years ago, and I now take 12 mg. every twelve hours gratefully.
Other	Person in a Fog, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	6/9/2009 12:01:22 AM	I have suffered with insomnia for years. In the last several months saw a sleep doctor for my disorder. He put me Gabitril 4mg, and then I increased up to 12mg. For the last several months I was taking Trazadone, Ambien, and Gabitril at bedtime for my insomnia. It was a dream come true, was able to sleep though the night, woke up in the morning in a great mood for 3 months. Just in the last month, I have suffered from extreme memory loss, no short term memory, feels like my head is in a cloud, nausea all day long, and tired all the time. I discontinued the Ambien, went from Gabitril 12mg, to 6mg, then to 4mg, and still having the same side effects. Now I discontinued Gabitril all together with hope of getting rid of this medicine head I feel 24 hours/7 days a week. Want to be back to normal and get this medication out of my system. 
Convulsive Seizures	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	2/26/2009 4:49:28 PM	I was put on this for petit mal and grand mal seizures at 16mgs. three times daily it help but cause a continous cycle for two years during this time I was in and out of seizures. With that and loss of seizure control my doctor chose to take me off. Now off the drug my cycle has gone back to once monthly. NOT NOTED in side effects.
Other	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		1/5/2009 8:36:21 AM	I have been on 3mg per day for 4 months, and at first my PTSD was helped.  But in the past month, I've had HORRIBLE weird feelings, shortness of breath, out-of-body sensations.  I will never take this drug again!  It did give me decreased hunger, but that just made me even more weak and the side-effects were more potent.

Convulsive Seizures	I have had epilepsy for 38 years, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	8/22/2008 1:37:28 PM	I had taken Gabitril for at least two or three years, and after over a decade of being seizure-free (I have grand mal and petit mal seizures) I had, first one seizure, then a year and a half later, another bad one, then from then on it was really downhill.  After changing neurologists to one  who was an epilepsy specialist, I was taken off Gabitril, and learned that it can make generalized seizures worse--the kind of seizures I have.  I was fortunate that my doctor was a specialist.

It controls my explosive nature, and allows me to concentrate. Its not perfect but with out GABA &quot;over the counter&quot;,  at times I'm a basket case. Cheers

But I felt like I was on &quot;Speed&quot; at first and had to take it in the morning rather than at night as prescribed. I find it helps me control my weight also. I only take 3 mg per day.

I felt like getting out of my own skin or jumping out of a window.  Obviously, this drug should noy be used to treat depression...
