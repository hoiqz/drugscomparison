Painful Periods	Mom of handicapped daughter, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	9/23/2011 8:54:56 AM	My adult daughter has Rett Syndrome and cannot talk.  After we gave her the multi symptom pamprin, she started staring blankly and drooling and became very pale.  Then in the night she feel head first out of her bed, which she never has done and turned blue.  This drug effected her in a dangerous way.  It it was not good to give to her before she went to sleep as well.

I took the pills 7 hours ago and I still am not thinking clearly. However, the bloating is gone, so I guess I will take these at bedtime from now on.

It says on the bottle it may cause excitability, and thats true! Im 14 and was dying from the pain. Most of my friends take pamprin so i decided to try it cause of the unusual bloating and overall pain. I only took one dosage, (2 pills)over 12 hours ago, and im still OFF THE WALL. Its like i have no control of myself. Lol. I just have to be careful when i take this med, but overall im still very pleased, great product. Very Recommended.

It actually makes me moodier, my body feels down, and the pain is still there.

It had been a couple years since trying it, so I decided to try - and again with the nightmares.  They say it's an uncommon side affect, but apparently there is something in it that my body doesn't like.

Migraine Headache	Mom on a mission, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/13/2010 12:57:29 PM	I'v had menstrual migraines for years and I have never, I mean never had any relief.  I'm usually sick and in bed during my period and completely out of it. I didnt want to continue missing work for a migraine.I tried this medication out of the blue and it workded wonders. This took away my migraine, nausea, bloating and fatigue. This medicine is truly a blessing. The only thing that I didnt like was I had to use the bathroom all day and all night. As far the other symtoms they were completely gone. I had to take the good with the bad. Make sure you take it as scheduled. It says take it every 4-6 hours. I kept in on scedule and could definitely tell if I did not. Start the meds a day or two before your period is scheduled to start and you will feel like a new woman and completly functioning as normal. Good Luck

I usually have to take 2-3, 2 makes me sleepy and 3 makes me pass out, straight up.

Painful Periods	myself_refined, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/28/2008 6:45:30 PM	I have had painful periods sense i can remember.  My periods weren't all simply pain, I also had extreme irritability.  I was so snappy with everyone my entire period and even for a few days afterward.  About an hour after taking pamprin I, as well as everyone around me, noticed a significant difference in my mood as well as pain level.  Pamprin has worked better than any strong, narcotic pain medication I have ever taken.  Pamprin is truly my wonder drug.
