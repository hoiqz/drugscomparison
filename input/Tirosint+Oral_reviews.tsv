Cancer of Thyroid	Schneeky, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/1/2012 11:04:57 AM	After 11 years of trying to find a levothroxine that I was not having allergic reaction to, I found Tirosint. I have been on this drug for 2 weeks and feel wonderful. I havent felt this good for 11 years. I've lost water weight and hair lose has slowed greatly. I feel as good as I did before my thryoid was removed. I havent had a TSH blood test yet, so not sure if the dose is correct for me. 
Underactive Thyroid	Isabelle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/16/2012 8:17:36 PM	I have tried many thyroid medications for my Hashimoto's, and I've never felt well until I switched to Tirosint. The important thing to remember is that this medication is about 25% more potent than an equivalent dose of, say, Synthroid or Levothroid. For example, 50 mcg of Tirosint would be equivalent to about 62.5 mcg of Levothroid. Keep this in mind before switching or you might end up taking too much!
Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/3/2012 12:05:02 AM	I have tried all of the major brands over the last 11 years and so far this is the only thing that has worked without the side effects and for once in 11 years they do not have to keep changing the dose like they had to do for the synthroid, levothroid, armour....I feel better than I have in 11 years.
Underactive Thyroid	campindaisy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	6/29/2012 10:09:39 AM	I was recently switched from Synthroid to Tirosint due to the fact that one year post thyroid removal, my tsh is at a 27.75. I already feel better, have more energy and have seen a large improvement in my overall mood. My doctor put me on a dose of 200 mcg, coming of a dose of 175 mcg of synthroid and having a extremely high tsh level.  I will leave another review after my first blood draw.  I hope this works!!
Underactive Thyroid	dogmomaz, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	6/16/2012 8:53:14 PM	Took tironsint for one week because my TSH just wouldn't go low enough on synthroid.  I felt awful on this drug.  Terrible headaches that increased in intensity every day.  Although i wanted to give it a go, I couldn't live like that.  
Underactive Thyroid	75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male		5/28/2012 7:16:56 AM	On Tirosint about 18 months. At first very, very, pleased now much swelling in legs with thigh and buttock pain. Left leg obviously larger than right. Left knee very painful. Hair falling out, nails breaking. Not really certain it is the drug and not something else. 
Underactive Thyroid	rainbow girl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	4/3/2012 1:29:34 PM	I was on synthroid, but decided to try tirosint after my dr agreed to switch. The first two months I felt much better, more energy, less hair loss,ect.. Then I went hyper so dr reduced dose, still hyper. Dr. reduced dose again and still do not feel good. I am giving it a little more time , then  I may be going back to synthroid. BEWARE- this is STRONG stuff so keep close watch on symptoms and labs for the first 6 months or more!! It may be great for some, but others??? The jury is still out!!
Underactive Thyroid	Onnie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/10/2012 7:56:08 AM	Wow, I only lasted 2 days on this med, 88mcg . I started out feeling a little anxious on the first day, and the second day I had a headache that got worse as the day went on, and a fast pulse of 120! With aches in neck &amp; shoulders.  I was on synthroid 100 mcg for 20 yrs, and never had an issue once the dose was regulated. I have been experiencing itching and both endo dr and allergist dr thought it could be triggered by the sulfa dyes on the outside coating of the synthroid, as I do have an allergy to sulfa....FYI:  the 50mcg has no dyes and will be calling dr today to request going to 2 tabs of that.  The allergist is doing skin tests as well to see exactly what is making me itch.  Like my endo but definitely not this new med.....
Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	2/9/2012 9:33:47 AM	I have been on Tirosint now for 12 days. I have chest pain, heart palps, &amp; irregular heart rate since taking this med. I had my labs done yesterday. T3, T4 &amp; TSH levels all came back below normal. My dr wants to switch me now to Levoxyl. I'm worried about the side effects Levoxyl will have.

Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	1/10/2012 12:51:22 AM	I started taking 88mcg of Tirosint 8 weeks ago because I was allergic to levoxythorine. I feel much better- less muscle aches and pains , a little hair loss but has started to lessen. I like this drug.
Underactive Thyroid	2feelgood, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	45-54	9/2/2011 9:33:37 AM	Having moved recently I had to get all new doctors.  Found that my thyroid was being over treated due to changes in hormones from hysterectomy. I had been taking Armour for years and loved it. New doctor did not want to deal with trying to my numbers right on Armour so put me on Tirosint.  My numbers are good but I feel tired and aching joints and my hair started falling out. Trying to find a doctor who is willing to work with me on Armour.
Underactive Thyroid	suzieq, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	65-74	8/24/2011 3:57:39 PM	Been on this for over a month, only have a partial Thyroid, been on Levo for years but do not feel right tried brand Snthyroid that was the same as this Tirosint, very bad pain in joints now neck pain, can not continue on this, gone back to Levo, the only good thing I can say about this, I'm not so irritable, but be very aware this is strong stuff I took 100mcg, plus pharmacy needs 10 days to get it. You can taste it during the day, do not like it. There must be something out there that works without the side effects.
Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	8/18/2011 12:38:20 PM	I experienced swelling, irregular periods, hair falling out, and weight gain with this drug. Plus, I have been told by my doctor and pharmacist to take this on an empty stomach and not to eat for 1 hour after taking this medication which is a pain. I am calling my doctor today to get switched back to Levothyroxine. 
Underactive Thyroid	scrap, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	65-74	7/26/2011 3:03:10 PM	I have only taken it for a month and I see no difference, except my sleep cycle is better.  I have tried most of the others, armor, synthroid, it is too early to judge this one.  All the others have just worn out and I have gained 70 lbs through the 16 years following diagnosis of hypothyroidism.  I take 225 mcg a day (two tablets).  I think that is a high dosage.

Underactive Thyroid	Lynn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/11/2011 1:19:44 PM	I have been on tirosint for months, the dr. started me out at 13mg, I am now up to 50mg.I am so depressed, all I want to do is sleep, my hair is still falling out and has never stopped, I don't want to go anywhere, I am tired all the time.  I do not feel like this medicine has ever helped me one bit, I am calling my dr. to make a appt. and to also let him know I am going to quit taking the tirosint.  This is going on 3 years that I have had a thyroid problem and nothing seems to work.  Any suggestions.?
Cancer of Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/13/2011 6:26:20 PM	Tirosint didn't work for me. I am allergic to the dye in Synthroid so my Endo thought that this would be a good substitute for me! Wrong!!! With in 10 days I was going from squalling to fits of rage. Did not work with me at all. Do not let me discourage you though, I am hyper-sensitive to most medications. 
Underactive Thyroid	Shug, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	5/27/2011 11:33:32 PM	This drug caused my feet and hands to sweel because of the sodium.  I had to use and additional water pill to eliminate the swelling.  Can't be sure but the first three weeks after taking it, I became very depressed and cried for 2 weeks.  
Underactive Thyroid	cajigas, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	4/29/2011 12:17:18 PM	I have just taken it for two days and by the evening of that second day my ankle and wrist were sore and my grip was very weak.  I cannot think of anything else to blame for these pains, just because I have never had any thing like this before.  I am back to my Synthroid and all ready feeling better.  So, just keep an eye out for symptoms and don't ignore anything that does not feel normal...
Underactive Thyroid	sol313, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/21/2011 3:24:34 PM	So far this has been a good experience.  They started me on this b/c brand synthroid caused horrific headaches and bad acne.  So far, these items are going away with Tirosint.  Drug stores have to order, but doc gave me sample.  Recommend it for people who are frustrated with levo and synthroid brand.  I am just hoping that within 6 weeks acne is totally clear and things are smooth.  this is my 5th or 6th dose try of levo.....
Other	Jackie D, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	11/15/2010 1:23:50 AM	The first week everything seemed fine but the second week my hands and feet began to swell.  I also experienced tingling and stinging sensations in my hands and feet. My feet also felt hot and I could barely fit into my shoes.  I regularly exercise at the gym - including running on the treadmill, but this side effect made running impossible as my feet felt like bricks.  I have stopped the medication and two weeks later I am better but still have  slight sensations of tingling and numbness.  
Underactive Thyroid	heiding, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	9/10/2010 1:23:03 PM	I have been on tirosint 125 for three months. At first it felt like a wonder drug. For the first time in over 4 years i didnt feel the swollen thyroid gland in my neck. I could swallow comfortably and had no pain. My body felt better than it had in years, my  energy increased, my body temp was normal, everything associated with thyroid ( symptoms) felt better than ever. However, about a month into using it, i started to develop anxiety symptoms, i kept blaming it on my business. Then heart palps, a tremor, leg cramps SO bad i couldnt sleep. This continued for a month, i was still blaming it on stress and anxiety. Finally one night everything was so out of hand i finally went to the E.R. at which point we realized i had toxic amounts of the drug, low potassium and low magnesium. I was immediately taken off the tirosint, and literally felt better within days. I am back on synthroid and have no symptoms of anxiety, or any of those horrific leg pains. SO, be careful with this drug as it is new, my experience with it was wonderful at first, but just pay close attention to any possible side effects, and do not brush them off as just stress as i did for so long. I should have called my doc and had my levels checked.

Every muscle, deep pain, total agony and my lower back feels broken.  If you are sensitive to meds, you might want to rethink trying this one.
