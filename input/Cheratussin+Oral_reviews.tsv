Cough	cmgentry, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/28/2010 6:56:58 PM	I have a horrible post-nasal drip issue and get a cough like no other!  When I get a cold, the over-counter-products just do nothing for me.  I was prescribed this a year or so ago and when I have gotten sick, since that time, I do not worry about the after-cold cough I usually will get for about a week.  No heart racing problems, just plenty of good, sound sleep.  I'll take this a dew days and be over it.  I think between the stress of not coughing all night long and the sound sleep, it cuts my symptoms in half.  I would highly recommend if you can take the codeine.  YES, go lay down about 30 minutes after taking because that about how quick it hits me!   
Cough	a mommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	10/4/2010 3:03:55 PM	I wwas coughing soooo bad before this med. It dried me up and cleared my breathing. No more cough. Just a quick question: am I supposed to get nauseas hours after the stuff has worn off?????
Cough	relax, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/25/2010 3:07:23 PM	i was given this for my cough with walking pneumonia. Once you take it you need to lie down &amp; shut off any distractions like the tv &amp; you should go right to sleep. The dr. first perscribed me hydromet which contains A LOT of sugar &amp; WILL raise your blood sugar &amp; it kept me up! when i did fall asleep i would wake up constantly. This cough syrup does not contain the sugar like the hydromet does which is why people says it has a yucky taste-but it tastes way better than over the counter brands &amp; my precription was only $4.
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/28/2010 2:06:03 AM	My insurance did not cover this medicine and I am likely to throw it out after tonight. Briefly after taking this medicine I wanted to go to sleep, but could not. My heart was racing and I could not stop coughing. This was my first dosage but will no longer use this medicine.

Cough	ScripMaster, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	2/1/2009 10:40:17 PM	It should be noted this product contains codine, and older versions containted pseudoehpedrine (most likely the racing heart sensation people used to get). 1 dose contains 100mg Guaf, 10mg Codine (2mg more than Tylenol3)Fun stuff... very satisfied lol.
