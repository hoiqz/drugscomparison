High Blood Pressure	GM, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	7/23/2012 12:31:35 PM	I take only 25 mg of metoprolol, what my Dr. referred to as &quot;a little candy dose,&quot; so I didn't check into it carefully enough. After one year I was going crazy wondering about this unusual weight gain around the middle, swelling feet, and a lot of joint pain (which made exercise, the real answer to most of these problems, much more difficult). After making lifestyle changes and still seeing no improvement suddenly it hit me--the ONE change in my lifestyle I hadn taken into account was the metoprolol. This is my third website, and now I see a pattern of wt. gain, swelling, and joint pain in some patients on this drug, so I am going to gradually come off the drug and see how I feel.  The biggest issue to me is joint pain--becoming a sedentary, limping old lady before my time cannot be  a healthy result of a medication--and there is no other reason my joint pain would have suddenly become severe, NONE. Nothing else changed. I'm so glad for the info on this website! I will report back after a couple of months off it.

The first time required hospitalization with IV meds to get the 30 lbs of fluid off of him quickly.This is a bad drug.

Everyday it's getting worse and worse since switching to generic due to insurance. I have complained to my dr and they tell me it's anxiety. And give me another pill. I'm dizzy everyday, off balance, see spots, and exhausted. I have to sit everywhere I go cause I feel weak and faint. Not to mention the swelling of hands and feet when it's hot and hair loss. AT times I feel like I'm sinking in sand. but they say it's all my anxiety. I don't think I'd be so anxious if I felt good! I have 4 kids I cant live like this!
Diastolic Heart Failure	bob, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male		5/28/2012 5:29:19 PM	I take this medication at bedtime, I think to control my blood pressure overnight. I always check my blood pressure the first thing in the morning and the diastolic pressure is usually above 90 psi. I then take Norvasc and usually go for a walk, which brings my pressures down to a normal or near-normal level. I have also experienced atrial fibrillation and this is perhaps the main reason my cardiologist has me on this medication.

Of course, I had side effects when I was first started it, but they went away after about two weeks.  If I had side effects like some of these other users, I would have run to my dr's office and asked for it to be changed.  I have been on several different ones, and this is the only one that has worked for me.  I will NOT use the generic form though.

It progressed to a bout of very severe depression with panic attacks, disorientation, night terrors, and severe mental incomprehension. Was prescribed Tenormin after this with the same horrible results. Had to take Paxil to relieve this horrible experience which took 5 months to get back to normal.

Fatigue, weight gain (20lbs in year), sexual side effects, dizziness, shortness of breath.  It's hard to exercise because of this! I am so frustrated!

Have had continual weight gain of almost 50 lbs, terrible probs with bloating, with stomach and with constipation since starting BP meds about 6 years ago. Had severe Afib attack landed me in ER and BP meds have helped. Docs say no way BP meds cause any of these symptoms but I don't agree.  I've also had issues with dry throat and hoarseness in my voice and for that one they do agree and have changed me to different meds until found one that causes least hoarseness.  Overall it keeps my BP down which is good but at the cost of now having other things to deal with.

We monitored BP before &amp; after med - higher after med. Monitored her BP at least 7 times a day, at rest, sitting (legs not crossed) standing, laying down before and after meals, am &amp; pm. Toprol made her worse. She was taken off it abruptly and within 30 days had nightmare hallucinations of my father being murdered and he was also the murderer when she looked at him at times - other times she remembered him. After 10 horrible months we had to put her in a nursing home which was also a horrible nightmare. This is a dangerous drug and that side effect, hallucinations, while well known is not listed on the materials you receive - only after researching did I find that.  It dramatically reduced her quality of life.

Also the erratic heart beat that I had had turned into my heart skipping a beat when the heart doctor ran a echo gram. Have been on 50mg of Metoprol KL for 4 months now. Had a follow up with another echogram and my heart is now almost normal with no skipped beats but still a slight erratic beat. Heartr is beating stronger with heart rate in the upper 60's and low 70's. I feel much better with no side effects. I am 65 years old, retired and driving a school bus which the Dr. made me stop because of my heart stopping. Now I can go back to driving again thanks to the drug. 
Other	leaping_lizard, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/27/2011 3:12:38 AM	I've been taking Toprol XL for 10 years for heart arrythmia (SVT).  My dose is very low (12.5 mg daily), and I insist on the name brand only -- no generics for this one -- because I have heard that there is a lot of variance between generics for this drug.  (Insurance company refuses to pay for it, but worth it to me.)  I have been very happy with it overall, it works well to minimize the severity of the arrythmias.  I do experience mild chest pain from time to time, though, that I think are from the med.  But the good definitely outweighs the bad.

High Blood Pressure	Retired, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	3/3/2011 1:41:30 PM	Suffered severe altered mental state after taking this med for only 3 days.  No memory of two days prior to family member finding me in my home in altered mental state of severe confusion disorientation.  Did not recognize family members, unaware of my surroundings, etc., etc.  Rushed by ambulance to ER.  After recovering and then speaking with health care professionals I have learned that this ia rare, but very real, side effect of this drug.  Doctors should report this to their patients when prescribing this med.  I had no idea this was a possible side effect.  If I had known, my family and I would have been diligent and this horrifying episode could have been avoided.

My bp has always been normal, so I think my cardiologist prescribed it for chest pain.  Only thing is I haven't had chest pain since he put the stent in.  This med is taken at night, so sleepyness/dizzyness isn't a problem.  The problem is WEIGHT GAIN.  I do aerobic exercise (elliptical) 45mins to and hour every day and I eat fruit and veggies and fish as well daily, I am trying to lose weight and I am gaining weight.  It is very distressing.

So I started breaking them in half and watchin my blood pressure and it's workin my feet and leggs are feeling better and I cound't be happier as I've with my feet and legs hurting for a long timee.

I am in a constant state of mild confusion. I suffer muscle weakness amd lethargy. When I told my doctor that the side effects were taking a pronounced toll, he just said that I had to work through the side effects. If I had known how terrible the side effects were, I would have never started taking it. As it is, I have reduced my intake by 1/2 a pill each night, otherwise I would be unable to perform my duties at work. I feel as if my doctor was not honest in informing me of the potential side-effects nor has he made any suggestions of available alternates.

It manages my blood pressure extremely well and lowers my pulse which was typically around 100 and now stays around 70-80.  It has also kept my PVCs in check.  My doctor says no other medication can protect me like Toprol but it is causing me to lose my beautiful hair (I'm female and 62), which causes me great stress.  I have lost a good 70% already.  I also have experienced considerable cognitive decline and memory loss.  I haven't gained weight but have not been able to lose a single pound although I have totally changed my diet and am restricted to a heart healthy, very low fat and cholesterol way of eating.

My cardioloist prescribed this drug after other measures to control my HR failed.  My fainting spells are gone, and my BP isn't lowered that much.  My heart would wear out 10-20 years early without beta-blockers.  I urge anyone who cannot control their BP with a DASH diet and nice exercise to go ahead and take a beta-blocker.  Taper on slowly, keep in mind that they will make you a bit tired at first, and if you get evil side effects, get a different beta-blocker from your Dr.  Every person is different -- they react differently to various drugs!  I like this drug, and it works well for me....

So to those of you who are having bothering side effects, I suggest you gradually take yourselves off this medication. To those who haven't started taking yet, DON'T. Too many side effects. I have decided to take my own advice and start treating my BP with diet and exercise. My DR. is too quick to prescribe meds when lifestyle change will probably be the ticket. You've heard the saying &quot;Drugs Kill&quot;, I'm not willing to take the chance. Good Luck to each and everyone of you and happy exercising and healthy diet.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	5/2/2010 11:24:56 PM	I was prescribed this drug for both high blood pressure and migraines...and it made my life a living hell for 6 months by causing very severe depression that very nearly sent me over the edge. I thought death was a certainty for me. I complained bitterly to the doctor about it, but he kept telling me to keep taking it...my depression keep getting worse. I went back to my regular doctor, i he took me off of it and put me back on calcium channel blockers, and had to prescribe Paxil CR to me before my depression would start to improve. Toprol XL and all other Beta Blockers are poison as far as i am concerned...and this crap didn't even lower my blood pressure one bit. They did help the migraine problem, but i had rather have migraines than go through what i did with severe depression. I never had a problem with depression until i took Toprol XL.

I work out at the gym 5 days a week and eat healthier and can't lose a pound. I had cluster headaches for a week at the time.  I haven't had those since 1 mo after starting.  What to do?  I believe I now have gout, and am having lots of joint pain.
Other	Mac, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	45-54	3/24/2010 7:33:03 AM	I was put on toprol about 4 years ago after experiencing pressure in my chest and trouble breathing while exercising. I have a genetic hemolytic anemia and my cardiologist felt that because I was seriously anemic, my heart was working too hard to provide blood to my muscles as I was working out. This also happended when walking up hills and stairs.  I still have shortness of breath but the pressure is not as bad.  I also get dizzy, but that could also be the lack of blood in my body.  The only side effect I noticed @ 50mg is very weird night dreams.  Hard to describe, but I would be laying in bed and open my eyes and can see &quot;things&quot; like bugs, sometimes faces. This happened within about a week of taking this drug and still occurs.  I'm used to it and sometimes it'll spook me and sometimes it's funny, usually I just go back to sleep.  Very weird.  All and all...no severe side effects.

I found that generic TOPRAL XL does NOT work same as name brand. Generic releases ingredients much faster, hence STOPS working in your body faster without most aware.Look @ Pharmacy.com for this info. If your MD will write &quot;medically neccessary&quot; for named brand only, most Insurance will / must pay &amp; you wil pay LOWER co - pay as it's medically neccessary. I am posting all this info from personal experince.

I am in constant pain from joints--hip and knee.  I didn't connect it with the medication until I read some of the other reviews.  I have been to several doctors plus chiropractor, physical therapist, etc. with no relief.  I will stop the medication and see if that helps--provided the condition is reversible.  Also, it hasn't done much to improve my blood pressure and my pulse, which is already low (50's)sometimes hits 45. My doctor doesn't seem concerned.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	1/25/2010 5:44:32 PM	I have been on toprol xl 50mg for about a year now. I take it for palpitations due to a tear in my heart valve. After the first couple months I noticed extreme fatigue and numbness in my arms. However it reduces the stress on my heart tremendously, lowering my emotional stress as well, I find myself not angering as easily as before and my chest pain is minimal. Over the past year I have more side effects like being &quot;over-emotional&quot; and nightmares. I have a nightmare 1-2x a week. Now I am a brave woman, and these nightmares are getting worse and worse each time. The dreams are so disturbing that I cannot go back to sleep after wards for hours and sometimes not at all out of fear. Not nightmares about scary monsters or murderers, no. Dreams about horrific things happening to loved ones. Now, the medicine does prevent me from having a heart attack which is great, but just be aware of the possibility that the side effects will test your strength mentally and physically.

During this time I also developed a colon tumor. Where did that come from? Not hereditary in my family. A very bad medication, should be taken off the market.

The drug has been very effective in preventing SVT episodes. I also have hypertension, and take two additional drugs for that. I took 100 mg Toprol XL once a day but a few years ago noticed I was having some asthma-like symptoms. My doctor decreased the Toprox XL to 50 mg/day, added another blood pressure med, and I no longer have respiratory problems. That's the only side effect I ever had with Toprol XL, but only at the higher dosage. It's a good thing, too, as the docs tell me that I will likely need the Toprol to control the SVT for the rest of my life. 
Other	NervousNelson, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/3/2009 2:16:09 PM	I take the generic for occasional situational anxiety and it works like magic.  I go from shaking nerves and uncontrollable heartbeat to a calm state in just a few minutes.  This is off label and my Dr. was even skeptical of the near instantaneous nature of the effect. He recommended I take it daily.  But that is definitely not necessary for this off label indication.  Anybody who experiences &quot;high anxiety&quot; in a few specific situations once in a while should definitely take this.  Furthermore, after using it a couple of times for a particular situation, I have noticed that a the situation that previously caused uncontrollable nerves often becomes less traumatic to the point of no longer needing the medicine or not even thinking of it.

It did take my blood pressure and angina prob away, however, my voice problem (ability to speak clearly), has become so bad people have a hard time understanding me. Sounds like I have no oxygen to form words. People think I have COPD.I have been taken to the hospital twice(most recently 2 weeks ago by ambulance)couldn't get my breath, no air. Had all the tests, my heart was not the problem. Doctors at the hospital were not listening to the feeling of lack of oxygen symptoms, as my tests are showing 100% oxygen in my blood stream. I get to go to the clinic this coming wen. New doctor, mabey she will listen. I have also started with great foot pain in my heels and numbness in my right arm. There is always the possibility that this is not due to toprol, however these prob didn't start until my toprol started. Also my vision has required new prescriptions twice this last year. Be careful and don't just attribute your symptoms to overweight or age as this is not normal.

For about 5 1/2 years, I've complained of shortness of breath just from walking short distances, trouble sleeping, blurry vision(worse in the morning), swelling of feet/hands, gas/bloating, fatigue, numbness in hands at waking in mornings, moodyness, weight gain(50lbs), hair loss, Sex drive/ED and now, the shortness of breath is so bad, they claim that I've come down with adult onset asthma but can't control that cause I'm still on 200mg of Toprol XL that might be contributing to the breathing problems (or maybe not even have asthma?).... How to get off of it now?  Primary Care doctor wants me off, don't think the cardiologist wants to bother, just like the pulmonary Dr....They would rather get me on an inhaler and be done with it!!!

I will say that the generic had me experiencing more side effects and I will never go back to generic.  I was being treated for high blood pressure and irregular heart rhythms mainly due to stress.  After reading that my hair loss and weight gain is probably due to the medication... I will try harder than ever to make lifestyle changes to slowly get off of it.  Overall..I have been satisfied taking Toprol XL and it has helped with BP and heart rhythms.

I took Toprol for 11 years, up to 150mg 2x daily because my a-fib continued. I had two catheter ablations to relieve the a-fib. I had an easy time taking the drug. I took flecanide (300mg) with it closer towards my procedure. All in all it ended up to do the trick... It has now been 4.5 years since the catheter ablation and a-fib is back. I am now on 25mg at 40 years of age. I am not hesitant to take this drug at all.

I tried several other drugs and this one seems to be the best for me. I found out I had HBP when I was pregnant with my first child 3 1/2yrs ago(my pregnancy was rough-had preclampsia and toximia). My OB said that I could not go to full term or there was a chance I could loose my life and the baby's, so my daughter was born 7wks early via c-section. I was also told that it was not wise for me to have another child due to this problem. I never knew I had HBP until we figured out that I was born with only one kidney(via ultrasound and testing through Dartmouth Hospital) and that kidney was working too hard by itself. All these years I have always had HBP and they told me and my mom while I was growing up is that I had the &quot;white coat syndrome&quot;-afraid of Dr's, but if I had not been pregnant I would have never knew I was going to have this issue for the rest of my life. I am veey pleased that this medicine is working for me............I need to be around for a long time to see my daughter grow up!

I had a significant increase in palpitations and shortness of breath.  So much so, that I ended up having a stress test and cardiac cath.  The response to my complaints was to continue to increase the dosage until I was so lightheaded and fatigued, I was miserable.

It has worked well for me but I have noticed a weight gain. No other serious side effects. The past few months as I refilled my prescription I noticed the pills were different each time. Also my BP would seem to be better on one form of the pill than it was the next month on a different form of the pill. At my physical the Dr. said there was a problem with the manufacturer and switched me to atenolol. Only been 4 days since the switch so am not sure of atenolol yet. Toprol worked well for me, wish there was no problem with the manufacturer.

Also given to me were HCTZ and Lipitor. Within a day I was very ill (nausea and vomiting) and blood work showed liver enzymes out of whack! My primary care doctor took me off the drugs and sent me to a heart specialist. Under the care of the heart specialist (for 18 months) no heart problem was found. My liver enzymes continued to be abnormal. Seven years later, my blood pressure was 128/75 at my last physical. I have two other high blood pressure incidents since the first...one due to a compression fracture of the spine, after a fall; and recently during a bout of bronchitis with extreme coughing. Both times, blood work and extensive testing were done. Both times heart problems were definitely ruled out. So, patient beware of drugs such as Toprol, unless your doctor is sure your heart condition warrants its' use!

The generic for toprol was recalled due to size differences in the pills. Torprol XL is still being dispensed. Got some just yesterday. I'm having my dose cut in half as it is becoming harder to get an aerobic exercise in due to a slower heartrate. The toprol fights against aerobic exercise.

I was to start with 25mg a day in the am for the first week then increase to 50mg. I stopped the drug at the end of the first week because I was experiencing almost narcoleptic-type episodes - falling asleep without awareness, extremely tired, irritable, wild dreams at night disrupting my sleep. I waited two weeks and tried the 25mg again, taking it in the morning. Again, I nodded off while interviewing a job candidate! I thought maybe it was a seizure! Stopped the drug immediately and symptoms have gone.

High Blood Pressure	Maria, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	3/24/2009 12:25:50 PM	I am a 56 yo female. I began taking Toprol XL 50 mg over a year ago with 2 other BP medications. My blood pressure came down from 160/100 to approx. 130-140/80-90. The doctor increased the Toprol to 100 mg. Recently I started having symptoms that I attributed to cold symptoms. I have been very sleepy- not tired- sleepy. I would pass out on my sofa after work, and then fall asleep on the sofa again at 8 PM until it was time to get up and go to bed. I would even close my eyes while I took my daily walk because I was so sleepy. I also had dyspnea at the slightest exertion. I also had severe sacral pain and muscle pain in my thighs. I don't take any statin medication, so I couldn't understand why I was having so much musculoskeletal pain.I decreased my dosage to 50 mg daiily and experienced immediate relief. My dyspnea is better, I feel more alert, and my sacral pain is gone. Toprol is a medication that must be reduced gradually, so be sure to see your doctor if you're having any side effects.
High Blood Pressure	BH, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/22/2009 7:22:27 PM	I have been on this drug for 5 years. Started at 50, now on 100.  I am a diabetic, and it slightly increased my blood sugar, so I am now on metformin 1000. I do not get nervous speaking in public, or meeting new people as before, as it blocks adreniline from your heart.  Still able to orgasm, ( female), no hair loss, weight gain, like others describe.  When I workout, I cannot get my pulse above 120. But the treadmill run everyday does help me control weight, as I am also recently menopausal.  I am having trouble losing weight 5 11, 194 lbs. I should weight 164. Feel very good though. Better than without it. Have not tried generic..I would rather pay extra 30 dollars than loose control of BP.

TOPRAL XL helped control skipped heartbeats also.  Is there an issue with TOPRAL XL?
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	45-54	3/17/2009 8:50:03 AM	I have been taking the Toprol XL, 25mg generic by PAR Pharm. for over a year now, in conjunction with Lisinopril-HCTZ.  I only take half a tab of the Toprol once day (at bedtime), but I am so exhausted in the a.m. I can barely get up &amp; go to work. This a.m. my pulse was 51. I am either going to try taking it during the day or ask my Doc to switch to another med. It is really effective at keeping my BP low, but at the cost of being extremely fatigued. It is especially bad in the a.m., does not matter how many hrs of sleep I get.

I was reading on the web about the side effects of the generic, fatigue, anxiety , irregular heartbeats and other things. I've been on it since June and I was wondering why I felt so bad all the time and I was only taking 50mg per day. I was on the brand name and there is a difference. I argued with the doctor and got him to ok the brand name. I was son the brand name before and thigs were ok.  I read that the manufactuer of the generic  was reported for poor quality control and documentation of processes. What the heck was the FDA doing for all this time. The complaints aren't new they have been receiving them for a while is what I'm told. So the generic is off the market and it was recalled. The pharmacys all lie and say it is back ordered, but I don't think it is comming back at all.

Feels more like a sore back because of the cold weather. It will make you tired so take it at night before bed. I seem to pee more too but not much than before with all the coffee I drink! I think this works for me so I'll stay on it until it doesn't work any more.Don't listen to all the bad stories.I was on another pill and had a mild case of ED. Never got a hard erection. This brought it back but I still have lost a bit of the desire. Before all these pills I had no problem staying hard or being ready.
High Blood Pressure	MikeD, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	2/6/2009 2:23:59 PM	The TOPROL/METOPROLOL recall is mainly for the generic drug which is manufactured by ETHEX pharm. and SANDOZ pharm. The generic manufactured by PAR pharmaceutical is OK. The brand drug TOPROL-XL is manufactured by Astra Zeneca pharm. and I understand that PAR pharm. is also alligned with Astra Zeneca. either one appears a good choice. These generic (junk pills) were investigated and reported by both CONSUMER LABS (White Plains NY) and THE PEOPLES PHARMACY in April of last year. What was the FDA doing???

I have very good results with this medication. It took a week or so for my body to adjust to it, which the Doctor explained to me from the beginning. My druggest switched me to the generic brand which was not a good thing, the generic drug does not work for me. My doctor has to write dispense as written on every prescription or the drug store will give you the generic form. I have been on this medication for almost 3 years now and it has made a big difference in my life.

I took that particular dose 13 hrs. previous.  Constant fatigue and drowsiness. Almost like I had narcolepsy. Felt better after out of my system. I must mention this was the generic version.

I tried the generic but it didn't work. Only since my last refill has the prescription version been working like the generic. My blood pressure is up, my heart beat is irregular; it's like I'm not taking anything at all. I came here to learn what might be wrong and find someone says it's being &quot;quietly recalled&quot;. Why quietly? Why hasn't my Doctor or Pharmacist notified me? I'm going to call my Doctor as soon as he opens but where can I go to find out more information? I did use the pill identifier to verify the markings match the prescription but something is obviously wrong and I have been endangered by it. If you're taking this, ask your Doctor if he/she's heard of a recall. Thankfully there is a site like this where I can get information at 5 AM.

Other	klb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/15/2009 6:05:33 PM	The brand works best for me.  I used the generic for several months only to find that my sx increased, palpatations.  I was going to increase my dose; thinking drug was ineffective at 50mg but saw an article in the prevention magazine about generic drugs.  Toprol xl was one of the drugs discussed in the article.  The author stated that if the generic was not produced by a certain (can't remember the name)pharmacutical co. you may experience increased sx.  I finished the generic then refilled the med with the brand toprol xl.  After a couple doses I noticed that my sx were under control again.  I was so excited when toprol went generic I thought I could save money but I'd rather pay more for the brand than feel awful.  I am a believer in generics but in this case it didn't work for me.

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	1/12/2009 4:53:49 PM	I was diagnosed with high BP a year ago which was a complete surprise since I've always been very thin, healthy and reasonably active&amp; only 38.  I started taking generic metoprolol by Sandoz- and at first felt really good- it lowered my BP, plus completely eliminated headaches, chestpain&amp; tightness.  However, after 2 months I became extremely exhausted, I began having episodes of numbness&amp; tingling in arms and legs at night and suddenly gained 10 pounds all around the middle. By month 10, I was waking up several times a night with my arms and legs heavy and numb.  Finally I requested the Brand Name TOPROL XL. I've been taking it for 2 months and feel MUCH better.  My energy is back, the numbness&amp;tingling has decreased significantly, and hopefully now I will also start to get rid of that weight around the middle!  It is my personal theory that perhaps the generic metoprolol released the dose too quickly, dropping my BP so much at night that my arms&amp;legs &quot;fell asleep&quot; due to lack of circulation- sometimes my AM BP was 85/55. Then I'm thinking maybe my body released a bunch of cortisol to raise my BP again- which contributed to my weight gain around the middle.  My doctor disagrees and suggested I see a neurologist.  Is there any other MD out there who thinks I could be on the right track?  I would suggest to anyone prescribed this med to first try the BRAND NAME TOPROL XL for at least 3 months to see how you react to it and what to expect before using a generic.

I am so very sleepy all day long and it seem like I am just sleeping my precious hours away. But I do understand that it takes time to get used to a new medication.  My Cardiologist wants to increase this medication to twice daily....that will take a tremendous toll on my waking hours, but in the next few months I believe that the cost of the fatigue will overall be more of a benefit to my condition than not, and as us patients understand the process of new medication it will just take time for us to get used to the new med....and than our bodies will adjust to the side effects and we will have a better enhancement of life.

I can't loose any weight since I have started taking it. I have actually gained weight and now I have to take Prilosec or the purple pill daily to maintain my tummy. It just sucks!!!

It has not helped with the Afib.  The doc recently put me on propafenol to help with the AFIB.  He left me on Toprol XL (generic) to help keep blood pressure down.  My sex drive is dead, but I have not gained weight, had abnormal hair loss, joint pain, etc.  I do have memory problems, though.  I'm thinking I may ask the cardio to put me on something else for BP.

Have been great ever since, until the metoporol generic came out.  Now the insurance companies claim the cheap one is &quot;preferred&quot; and covered.  Unfortunately, have tried it twice and it is definitely NOT the same. Blood pressure was unstable, got headaches, and the drug wore off half way through the day.  Paying the extra thinking generic metoporol is a lie. You get what you pay for, except with health insurance of course.

I recently went tot he doctor and he upped my toprol from 50mg to 100mg and that is when the issues with my feet and ankles started. Not to mention my checst just really hurt. I have been taking this medicaion for a few years and to be honest it has never really worked that great. I have gained a bunch of weight and I am constantly tired. My feet have been a constant problem form the tingly, numbness to severe pain in my ankle joints. It dawned on m that it could be medication related and upon others reiews I think I may be on the right track. I am going to the doctor for the fourth time in ten days to once again discuss this concern. Either wya I need something different!

My doctor put me on 25mg of Toprol XL (generic version: Metrolol). A month later my BP is barely down still around 162/114.  Dr now has my dosage at 100 mg a day.  I still have occassional headaches, pounding chest, and fatigue. But now something weird is happening with my hearing, and my eyes are 'crazy.' I also cannot stay awake.  Overall though, it's better than feeling like I'm having a heart attack.

I have noticed lately my hands go numb at night and have a shortness of breath more often.  My hair is beginning to thin and I have noticed my memory has gotten worse.  I thought these were due to age, but I'm not that old!

This week I spoke to my cardiologist and told him I wanted off the pills because of the weight gain and he told me it's not the toprol that makes me gain weight but that I was out of shape and shoould exercise more. I told him I would if I weren't so tired all the time. He then told me that one of the side affects of toprol is fatigue and since my stress test came back really good he would take me off the drug but I have to ween off it,one week half a pill one week quarter of pill one half a quarter. So far so good. I'm feeling much better, more energy and thanks to the help of weight watchers I've lost 2.6 lbs this week. If my pressure goes back up the dr. said he'll increase my water pill.

After had taken for awhile began to have shortness of breath and pounding of heart with physical exertion. Also experienced severe head aches especially in back of head. Was fatigued with no energy.  Heart rate was low.  Finally had to go to ER and heart rate was in 40's and BP ok. ER doctor thought was Toprol and called family physicial.  Had heart test to elimination heart problems.  Was taken off Toprol and symptons began to disappear very soon.  Now taking Avalide and Verapamil which working well.

After Thyroid Cancer Surgery and radioactive iodine treatments something changed.  I was constantly tired, lost a lot of hair, my eyes have been a mess blurred vision and constant tearing, tingling in my legs and hands.  The sympton became worse when the doctor raised the dosage from 25 mg to 50 mg.  I have since stoped and now I'm on a different medicine which I'm not sure is going to be any better.  At first the doctor wouldn't believe these symptons were from the Toprol until I forced the issue.
High Blood Pressure	Lee, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	65-74	10/31/2008 3:14:42 PM	I have been taking Toprol XL for about 5 years. When they came out with the generic last year I was switched to the generic Metroprol. This medication was prescribed for high blood pressure. It has no effect on the blood pressure, but does slow the heart rate down and make the heart beat with less force. It seems the side effects increased with the change to Metoprolol. I also take an ACE inhibitor and an Alpha  blocker, Terazosin. The Alpha blocker is the only medication that has lowered the pressure much at all, but still too high and the effect only lasts for 3-4 hours. I have Diastolic Heart Failure and Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) with some Atheriosclerosis. These 2 conditions lead to a reduced blood flow rate. All of the traditional antihypertensive medications make the flow rate even lower and are mostly ineffective in reducing the blood pressure. The internal organs sense the reduced flow rate as a reduction in oxygen in the blood stream and do everything they can to raise the flow rate, which usually exceeds the effect of the medication and the blood pressure goes back up. So those of you that have unsatisfactory pressure reduction and side effects from your medications, look at the symptoms of low blood pressure and you will find they match your side effects. You probably have diastolic dysfunction, your heart does not allow enough blood into the chambers to be pumped out. Good luck convincing your doctor to even consider this possibility, it goes against what they were taught in Med School. Also there are no procedures for this or medications. Exercise, weight deduction, limiting salt intake help lower pressure, but do little to increase the flow rate.

A little over a year ago, I began randomly fainting. I assumed it was just low blood sugar the first few times and did not seek medical attention. After the fainting became more frequent and began to worry me, I decided to go to the doctor. It took months of tests and several missed college classes, but I was finally diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome and put on this medication. Since I have taken it, I have not fainted, because my blood pressure and heart rate have regulated(their irregularity is what was causing the fainting). I have only experienced minor side effects from the medication, such as crazy dreams and very minor weight gain(which may be associated with getting older and not having a teenage metabolism anymore), but overall the benefits have far out-weighed the side effects for me! I'm not the type of person who takes medication for everything, in fact, I rarely take medication for anything, so being told that I may have to take this pill for the rest of my life was very scary to me. But, if it keeps me standing upright, I guess &quot;I gotta do what I gotta do&quot;.

Also the medicine also makes my heart feel like it is tightening up and beat real fast.  I have problems with walking if I take the medicine within few hours of taking Toprol.  It leaves a metal taste in my mouth all the time.  It has never lowered my blood pressure.  In fact it keeps my blood pressure at 165-169. I took this medicine from January to August 2008.  I started out at 50mg then upped to 100mg then upped to 200mg(which I refused to take). I wished that I have never let the doctor talk me into taking this medicine as I was doing a lot better before taking it.  Now I have problems that I didn't have before.  Diet is a better way to go and that is what I am doing. No more drugs for me.

Cardiologist changed to 100mg and Hyzaar and have had very few side effects. Got dizzy when I started taking it but Dr. told me to take it before bed and it helped. Also bothered by sweating and weight gain. Have a feeling the side effects may have to do with the combination of other drugs with Toprol.

Toprol XL generic is the most effective drug I have had prescribed. No side effects. Have taken it twice daily for years; now I take a single 100 mg dose at night. Never be caught without it. Also, carry some with you in case of hospitalization; some hospitals will substitute.

However, as the warning reads, don't stop taking it cold turkey. I had an ocassion where I ran out of the RX and couldnt get it refilled immediately.The results were that I couldn't walk one block without stoping to rest. I felt tired, dizzy and some minor pains in my chest doing the most simplest of things like standing or a short walk to the kitchen. Becareful !

Now average 120/70.  Switched to metoprolol generic recently, no differences noted.  I love this stuff for the positive side effects:  greatly reduced anxiety and I am not as quick to anger as before.  In my profession I frequently speak before large audiences and occasionally do live or taped television interviews.  With metoprolol my performance anxiety (stage fright) is now gone.  I have not experienced any negative side effects from this medication.

It has slowed my heart rate down considerably..I was in tachycardia all the time well over 100-110 beats even when resting.  I still run high but nothing like before.  My qt intervals are somewhat shorter now, but still must be VERY careful when taking any new meds OC, or Dr.  I guess these crazy dreams I have now are from this, I have also noticed I perspire much more now and stay hot all the time???? I will continue to take this as directed...

Any weight gain is due to my lack of exercise which I should be doing. I do feel tired, but I think that is due to the lack of exercise. I am wondering how many who wrote of feeling tired and low energy are overweight and do not do enough exercise-walking 3x week (I know, I just don't always do.). However, I have felt weak and lightheaded, but I wonder if it was caused by my eating foods that had sodium in it (visiting family &amp; friends, eating what they eat; going out and eating in restaurants who salt the food even if you request that they don't). When I control my food preparation and use either no salt or low salt seasoning, my bp is fine.  If I get adequate water that is important.I am trying to take my medication on time, do not drink any alcoholic beverages and cook with salt or with very low salt seasonings. I do some walking. I do have some numbness in my hands when I sleep on them-but I will pay attention to if it happens when I am not sleeping or lying on them.Sometimes I get a rebound headache-but again, I think that happens when I am not drinking enough water. If I am drinking water-not just liquids-I don't seem to have those problems.But all the comments are very helpful, and I can be on the lookout for things that may occur.Overall, I am satisfied with the way the medication works.

It has worked wonderful for my blood pressure. I have been tired since I was started on hbp meds about 28 or 29 years ago. I was started on Inderal, so I can't blame all the lack of energy on just the Toprol XL. I would much rather have my hbp under control with Toprol XL and experience lack of energy than to do without it.

I would say that my symptoms have improved overall by about 90 - 95%.  I was very tired for a few months when beginning the medication, and I'm still probably more tired than I would be if not taking this medication, but I am able to function in life again, so it's worth the trade-off.  Good luck to all.

It has cut the frequency in half, which is a huge improvment (10 noticeable flutters a day to 4-5.)  Current doseage is 25mg 2 times daily.  I do notice some of the minor side effects: Drowsiness, bazaar dreams, frequent dizzy spells when standing up, and it is possible my recent vision change is related.  I missed 2.5 days of doses and my glasses were not right, 2 days later (4 does) my vision is back to the way it was before missing doses.  Heart Rate 60-70bpm, BP 110/65-120/70, was 130/70-140/80 prior.  I did also cut back caffiene consumption shortly after starting the meds.

After exercising would have a hard time breathing if I took Toprol.  Not so bad when stopped taking Toprol.  Had 85% clog in circumflex artery and the Toprol slowed down my pulse and caused the problem.  My doctor did not want me to stop taking it but when I saw a cardiologist he said quit taking it as it was slowing down the blood to my heart because it lowered my pulse and he put a stent in the artery.  Told me my blood pressure was ok.  I had a blood pressure monitor at home and my blood pressure was averaging 120/70.  Be careful what your doctor tells you-see a cardiologist!

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	2/7/2008 2:34:59 PM	I was prescribed this medication to control heart palpitations.  I have been on this medication for approximately 4 years.  I do have trouble sleeping, but I am someone who, if I awake in the middle of the night, has a racing mind that will not shut down.  I have noticed if I miss my doses for a couple of days the palpitations begin again.
Other	TommysMommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	2/5/2008 9:52:46 AM	I have had too many side effects to name. Mainly a weird lightheaded feeling. It goes away when I don't take the pill though. I am going to see my dr this week, and hopefully she will allow me to discontinue. A cardiologist prescribed this med at the ER. Had heart palpitations. He thought I was crazy. Some people are ok on this med. Just like with the thalium stress tests, they say if you are older than 60 you had no adverse reaction. I am 33, and feel like I am 80 since I've been taking this med. Yeah my palpitations are gone, but I feel like I am going to pass out all the time. I would much rather have palpitations! I wish everyone good luck on this med.

It appears to be working for me as I don't feel the palpitations anymore however I have gained about 20# and feel that it is from the Toprol.  My cardiologist said she had never heard of people gaining weight by taking it but in reading some of the other folks comments, it appears that I am not the only one who has experienced weight gain. With that exception....I am pleased with the drug.

I have been taking 1/4 of a tablet every third day, with supper, and that lowers my blood pressure without the adverse effects.  I am 70 years old and weigh about 95 pounds.  It would be very helpful if this medication could be made available in 12.5 milligram tablets; currently, I have to cut a whole 50 mg tablet in 4 quarters.  People come in different sizes and so should medications.

In terms of doing what its supposed to do I guess it does that, I dont have high blood pressure or angina and never have, but being on this  has made my blood pressure border line low like 90/60 which results in dizzyness sometimes. It has also made my eyesight worse, so now I wear reading glasses.

I have only been on it a week but it is definitely helping with the palpitations.  However, I notice some chest pain, moderate headaches at night and shortness of breath at end of day.  I hope these side effects will go away in time, assuming they are caused by the med.

Crazy vivid dreams.  Not being able to remember what you have just done.  Waking up in a panic knowing you are late to do somethng, you just cant remember what.
