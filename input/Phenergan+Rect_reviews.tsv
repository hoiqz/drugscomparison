Nausea and Vomiting	3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	3-6	2/14/2009 9:23:40 PM	I used this medicine on my 2 1/2 year old daughter when she had gastroenteritis. It works great the only downfall was it started to immediately melt when I went to insert it. The medicine did make her sleepy but that was good so that she can rest.

It worked great. Before my own salavia made me want to vomit but after taking this I was able to take a so much very needed pain medication. The only downfall was I could not take this medication during the work day due to drownsiness. I could not take this medication at home during the night.

Nausea and Vomiting	 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female		2/26/2008 12:42:32 PM	I used thid suppository on my child when she was vomiting.  She still vomited but was sleepy enough that she rested between.  I was afraid of leaving her while on this so I stayed in her room the entire time, even thru the night.  Due to her age (5) it was easy to insert, easier that convincing her to drink something.
Nausea and Vomiting		4	5	4			1/30/2008 11:49:52 AM	I used this drug at about 8:00pm to combat feelings of nausea.  It helped with the nausea and I was actually able to eat again for the first time in 3 days.  However, I had really bad gas and terrible stomach cramps during the night.  Overall I was satisfied that the nausea was gone, but I still had to take some pepto in the middle of the night do to the cramps.
