No. I knew this and you know it. I have RRMS have never have had a second flare up and due to not being able to tolerate injections, it was suggested I start Gilenya. By 9 months it was clear, this drug was affecting other parts of my body. My skin both outside and inside (I'm a woman) was dry and unhealthy. I had very dark bags under my eyes starting at month 3. Never had bags before taking Gilenya. I couldn't clear seasonal allergies. Abrasions from high heels would take 8 weeks to heal. Pimples didn't clear because there were no white blood build up for them to clean out the pores. My bowel movements were painful and constipated. My MS doctor while not adamant I stayed on, would never suggest that I stop taking the drug. Thanks to my primary care doctor I finally stopped taking Gilenya, and slowly everything has started to reverse itself. I think she saved my life. I may have to walk with a cane one day or be in a wheel chair MAYBE and that's OK, I'd rather deal with that than create something that wasn't wrong to begin with.

I have been on Avonex, Rebif and Copaxone. I was dx MS 9.5 years ago... I am 36. Used to have a flare 1-3 times per year. Have not had one since I've been on G and MRI went from 9 active lesions to 1. I am back to running and working full time. The drug does make me dizzy and I have heart palpitations- hence the 4 stars rather than 5.

Confusion, perceived heart attack, depression, everything that could have happened, happened.  Finally taken off if it and now suffering from joint pain, neck and back pain that I did not hae before I started this med.  I am not a doc but believe it is a permanent side effect of this drug.  I suffered SEVERE back pain during the use and its not as bad since I stopped.  I could not even get up in the morning I felt so bad.  My behavior was erratic and confusing to others and I really thought I ahd lost my mind.  Right now I have stopped MS treatment because I am terrified of side effects.  I was taking copaxone before with no side effects but the shot caused me so much aniexty that I would stay up at night just not to give it to myself.  Then Is started skipping the shots so we opted to try this drug.  My side effects were so bad that I actually was scared to sleep because I was scared I would not wake up.

I switched to a new Dr. he told me that there were other options, I was excited about the pill. Has not effected my heart in any way, no side effects at all like I was expericing with Avonex. I would recommend the pill to anyone. The first dose, sitting in the Dr. office for 6 hours was nothing, I took my I Pad and the day passed by quickly.

It took a long time to figure out what to go on since I was on Tysabri..taking it every two months and it worked great. I talked to 2 of the best neurologists in my state and boh agreed for me it would work. I have been on it since and have had no relapse like my doctor said I might from switching drugs. I am very happy with the results, and the side effects are minimal. Many are concerned about the first dosage, but when I went I brought someone who would keep my mind off of it and they said my heart rate was one of the best they've seen. In my opinion it is a stressful time, but in my opinion do what you can to take you rmind off of it and it will probably go better than you think. But overall I am very happy with the drug, and the fact that it is a pill makes me remember to take my vitamins as well:-)

All I wanted after my diagnosis (aside from them being wrong about it), was a pill form of treatment rather than the injections.  Don't know if any of these medications are actually doing anything, of if it's coincidence, but my last MRI showed NO NEW LEISIONS and some may have been smaller.  I'm all for it.  NO side affects at all.  Thanks Dr. B, for allowing me the chance to try it.

In fact my spasticity may be a little better. I have noticed weight gain (5 lbs in the first week which was alarming, but then it stabilized), yeast infection and canker sores also within a week of starting it, heart rate up and down, occasional dizziness and some fatigue (but not as bad as a bout of MS related fatigue). I was on Tysabri before this and did have the same problem with yeast infections recurring during the first 6 months of treatment, and am hopeful that it won't be as bad with Gilenya but am trying over the counter yeast infection prevention as well as avoiding yeast/sugary foods. Anyway, a pill is more convenient, plus less serious side effect profile than Tysabri, so I'm going with it for now. Gilenya has an assistance program that you don't need to be financially strapped to take advantage of - just don't let the Gilenya Go Program representative forget to make it work for you (pays your co-pay if you have insurance for the first year, plus the copays for the pre-treatment labs/exams).

I have almost gone blind taking this. I developed Macular Edema and am now going broke going to 2 eye specialists. 1st case they have seen. Trying to have a rep call me back from the co. to tell me what long term side effects I will have was a joke I was told no one can help me.  As a nurse I am so disappointed.  I really thought that this drug would help my M.S. but it has just cost me a ton of $ and now they won't even let me take my Avonex because no one knows if this will make me worse.  Now my M.S. is getting worse. I warn everyone I read the small print, was cleared to go on this med.  Macular Edema is a serious and potentially devastating disease.   Think twice about taking it.  When your vision starts to blur don't think it is the M.S. I lost all vision in my right eye within 20 days of taking this med.  Not worth it.

Ive been on it for 6 months now and I can honestly say its the best Ive felt since 2004 (when I was diagnosed). Ive taken: Beta Seron, Copaxone, and Tysabri (Copaxone being my least favorite).  I loved Tysabri, but it wasnt doing the job, so they put me on Gilenya. I noticed that I was a little out of breath doing normal activities the first few weeks after starting it, but it was only for the first few weeks.  I am usually a troll in the sun anyways, and I feared my eyes were not going to be able to handle it...but Ive had no problems!! Its easier and less painful than taking a shot. I have gained a little bit of weight, but I could chalk that up to the new birth control pills I started around the same time (a little meaning 5 pounds). I just hope it continues to work as well as it is... I go to my neurologist in December and Im sure they will give me an MRI...Ill let you know how things are going!

I was diagnosed in 2007, and initially, I felt the best I had felt in 4 years!  In May, I hiked over 2 miles up a steep mountain, and felt like my life was finally going to be back to normal.  Then, in July, I started the worst relapse ever.  I am still not back to my baseline and I fear the Gilenya may not be working.  My eyes are definitely more light sensitive and actually hurt sometimes.  I have gained almost a pound a month, despite a very disciplined diet.  I am likely going to stop this med if I don't start feeling better soon and stop gaining weight!!

I thought i needed to give myself time to get used to the drug. I notice I was losing a lot of hair. I became progressively weaker and was experiencing extreme dizzy spells. After deciding this drug is not worth my health I quit taking it after 7 weeks. I was able to work full time but with the extreme weakness, shakiness and dizziness I am not sure if I will be able to continue working at all. I find myself hanging on to things to get around and find it hard to even write my name. I have never experienced anything like this before. It is just getting worse even after being off the Gilenya for about 10 days now. I wish i never took the drug.

Went into a relapse, Dr. put me Copaxone. Worked good for awhile, the dr put me on Tysabria. All I did with that was go downhill. Dr now has me on gilenya. Been on it for going on 7 months. I really don't like I am improvong with this med. All I have gotten so far is a sore throat it took 2 mo nths to get over, that was wth the help of K-flex. Been having sleeping problems but dr prescribed gelinya, that works good. And now my first flar-up since I have been on gelinya. Don't get me wrong, it's easy to take. So much easier, not to mention the P.I.T.A from the shots of copaxone. That was annoying...shot every day. You eventually get a big pile-up of scar tissue, not to mention I had lots of exaserbations, almost like every 2 to 3 months. I like gelinya but truthfully I do not know if it is working.

I initially had throat issues,but that has gone away. Also, I experienced some hip pain which has subsided as well. I feel very fortunate to have no ongoing side effects. Some difficulty with falling asleep, creating tough bouts with fatigue, but I feel that is not related to Gilenya. A couple Sominex has helped the problem greatly. I'm not unrealistic about improvement, I only hope for slower progression. So far, so good. Positive attitude goes a long way. Don't concentrate on what you can't do anymore, but what you CAN do.

Within the first week of being on it I started having a serious exasterbation of symptoms.  I have tremors that run all the way to my neck, my legs have just recently started showing signs of tremors as well.  I am tired constantly. My head aches almost all day every day.  I started with numbness and tingling in my toes it now goes to my knees and my hands are now starting to act up too.  My muscles feel like they are trying to pull themselves from the bone. And my back spasms regularly...more noticably at night I think because I am trying to relax to fall asleep and my body is refusing to do so.  My doctor put me on steriods to try and control the exasterbation and instead we found out that i am allergic to Solumedrol...so now to add to all the symptoms I'm having I have a terrible rash all over my back and face and pretty intense swelling.  I want so badly to feel somewhat normal and this has actually made me worse...so it looks like shots are in order for me and I'm even more scared of those.

Don't know if it is helping, I'm hoping. I'm in a huge relapse since Feb '10. So I'm hoping that it can keep me from progressing. I need to heal because this is the worst since I was diagnosed in 1991. Was good for most of my adult life till past 4 yrs gone to pot..lol. O'well hoping for symptoms to back off for a bit.

I was lucky enough to get into the trial study for this drug. While I cant officially say I was on the drug the whole time, with the dramatic increase in cold sore frequency after starting treatment, my Dr and I felt very confident I was on the drug from day one.  I had no side effects from Gilenya and even noted a marked decrease in severity of symptoms on a daily basis as well as return of some lost feeling. I know drugs work differently for everyone. And if what you are on now is working, stay on it. But do not dissmiss Gilenya as a possible treatment.

I have moderate to severe problems with mobility. I use a cane or crutch to assist with balance and weakness. There are also mild issues with eyesight and muscle weakness. I used Copaxone for 15 months with no changes to my symptoms positively or negatively(no progression!) I have been taking Gilenya for three weeks with no side effects. If all this drug does for me is delay progression, therby maintaining my current quality of life, I will consider it successful. I have MS, it doesn't have me. Good luck to all of you.

I'm happy I'm not having to take shots. I was off Betaseron for almost 3 months before starting Gilenya and noticed a significant number of MS issues, a lot of pain.  I have notice I want to cry a lot and am wondering if this is the MS or the Gilenya (could be my new bipolar med but I just wanted someone elses opinion on the Gilenya and this new issue. My pain has reduced since beginning Gilenya, though.

My scar tissue had really piled up and this is so much better.  A few minor sinus/throat irritations but so-far so-good!Thanks to whomever founded this new med!
Other	Karen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/7/2011 1:15:10 PM	I have only been on this med. for 1 week but it shows a lot of promise after using Avonex for 22 years.  Avonex was losing its effectiveness after 4 days, and after all of these years injecting, I had some major scar tissue going on.  I do not use any walking devises, but was headed that way with the old med, now I seem to have more stamina, energy well into the evening, but I seem to be getting more of an alergenic reaction to pollen type things with Gilenya as my throat hurts/swells on one side.  My appetite has increased these days and my overall feeling of well-being has increased. I can only hope that the good continues!! 
Other	erica, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/1/2011 11:37:56 PM	everyone take a good look at the prices of all our wonderfull ms drugs and do some comparision they are all in the same range which all should point out to your insurance companies considering the benefits and less side effects push your insurance companies to do the math there is no reason its not covered. In many cases it is the same or less than the nasty shots!!!!

It was horrible! The minute I told my doctor what was going on he took me right off the Gilenya.  I felt better within a couple of days.  I am still taking a break from the meds and am now feeling symptoms of my ms.  I will be going back on the AVONEX in a couple of weeks.  The tremors, heart pounding out of my chest, dizziness and lump in my throat were the worst side effects from any drug I have ever taken. It's hard enough dealing with the ms. If the side effects out weigh the benefits then it's not a good choice.

I hated the shots but hate being constantly sick more.

Prior of taking Gilenya my vision was very blury and know I do not have to wear my glass.

It's been over 2 weeks &amp; already my hair is falling out , I've put on weight , noticed my walking is not as brisk and overall feel very fatigued. I'm going to stick with it for a month because I'm hoping these side effects will pass. As long as I feel pretty good otherwise , we'll see hot it goes.

I called my Gilenya support nurse and she recommended calling my doctor right away. My doctor directed me to stop taking Gilenya. **If the female that posted on 3/16 reads this, who had the similiar side effects, would you please post again to let us know what happened.

Gilenya is by far the best! I only get slight headaches and slight muscle tension but nothing like I had with Beta-Seron, Rebif, or Copaxone. I feel 100% better on this drug compared to the 3 previously mentioned. My eyes are slightly more sensitive to light but I have not experienced any other symptoms.

I have called my Gilenya support nurse and she recommended calling my doctor right away.  I hope everything will be ok because I dont want to have to go back on Avonex and weekly shots.

I've been on all of the other therapy medication's. By far Gilenya has made a difference. I no longer have to give myself shots. That means no more bruies!!!! I am very satisfied with the outcome of this medication.

I have been waiting 11 years for this, but if my insurance doesn't cover the costs, then it'll be back to the shot for me.  I couldn't believe the cost per month when I saw it!

Only issue so far is mini headaches that stay for a few minutes and go away.....NO MORE NEEDLES!!!!

Only a little sensitivity to light in my eyes.  Otherwise it's been great!  Cost is the only drawback, but for now Novartis is picking up my copay.  When that ends...I stop taking the drug.
