Anxious	RIchard, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	11/2/2009 1:23:39 AM	The Dr. replace Zanax with this one.  It only took 20 mgs. to raise my B/P.  It usually stays around 110/58 or 112/62.  Now it hovers at 124/76 too high for me.  I have been on it for one day and and twelve hours later, I am trying to get it out of my system.  I cannot take it no more, I left word to the Dr. on his voice mail to go back to Xanax in the morning - .25 mg.  The worst part is that I am not depress - just anxious in my job.  Other effects are Rapid Heartbeat - Headaches - Dizziness - Not able to focus.  Thank goodness I took it one time only!

I have no side effects so far, Thank God! I have no side effects with this.  I am off it soon.  It worked during the recovery of my Mini-Stroke. Remember this works for me, not everyone will have the same rssults. With the proper Diet and Excerise it does work. Richard J Bowden
