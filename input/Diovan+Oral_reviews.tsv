I stopped taking and I feel stronger. I gave my medications 2 years, and I was so afraid that I would simply wither and die. I am able to control my BP my self. Maybe I am just sensitive to certain meds. But I did what I felt was best for my well being.

High Blood Pressure	grandma of 19, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female		8/8/2012 6:27:32 PM	My BP was only 165/80 to begin with.  Dr. put me on Diovan 160 and am ony down to 130-145/59.  Have a multitude of side affects that Dr. doesn't attribute to Diovan.  Other BP meds I couldn't tolerate so I think he is just tired of trying. Ongoing cough, shortness of breath, back/joint pain, hair loss, weight gain, pounding in my head at times and blood sugar is starting to creep up. He refused to lower the dosage so I cut them in 1/2 to make 80 mg. has helped some but not with the cough.  I continue to try because I have macular degeneration and it is imperative the BP be kept down.  Going to try to get Dr. to try something else.

When I start to get cranked up about things, I can almost feel the blood pressure trying to go up, something is fighting it.My problem with tight tendons has developed since starting the drug.It maybe my body just getting older, but I must say the tendons are not as flexible.  I have gotten tendon strains in the left groin.  I have tendon stress in my left elbow that is the result of a shoulder injury.  The tendon in the long and short bicep are very painful, the tendons on base of the elbow are painful, the tendons on the shoulder from the shoulder blade are painful, and I have a least a tear on the front tendon going to the shoulder.  My foremarm tendons are acting up as well.I haver never had anything like this except tennis elbow a couple of years ago.Tendons seem to getting more sensitive to stressful usage, that being exercise out of the minimum normal stuff.  Yes, I have always been active - marathons, baseball, tennis etc.

Before the Diovan I was taking Prinivil and with that drug I did experience a very mild cough which is why I was switched to Diovan. Both drugs worked effectively for me. I will report on the Losartan after I take it for awhile.

However discovered through my own research  that I was experiencing significant reaction to the HCT due to an allergy to Sulfa which is one of its components. Reaction was serious swelling of eyes, throat and hives due to the allergic reaction- wound up using epi pen and brought to the emergency room (twice), KEEP IN MIND THAT YOUR DOCTOR MAY NOT TAKE THE TIME TO EVALUATE YOUR REACTION AS MY GP KEPT DISMISSING MY INITIAL ALLERGIC SYMPTOMS AS NOT SIGNIFICANT GIVEN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MED. Now on Diovan 360 without HCT and finding swelling/pain in feet, hands and joints.

After one month I began to have ringing in my ears, change in bowel movement which includes frequency and incomplete emptying.  some dizziness and pain in shoulder. My doctor says just take the med the symptoms are not severe and stop thinking about yourself.My pressure is rising again so she added a Calcium beta blocker which gave me a headache, worse ringing in the ears and thumping in ears as well.  I stopped taking new med and am going to try to change from Diovan.  I would like to take no meds and would appreciate any info on how to get off and start natural treatments. My doctor will not go along with this so I guess new Dr.

I am having horrible side effects, muscle and joint pain, restless leg, headaches and eye pain.  I've been taking it for 5 years at 320 mg.  The side effects have become more severe and affects quality of life.  Muscle and joint pain is the worse and has moved to my hands.  You can actually hear the popping sound from joints.  Will discuss getting off this med with my doctor.  I determined its the Diovan from the reading side effects, various reviews on this site and keeping a daily journal of symptoms.

I have a dry, hacking cough, like a tickle in my throat constantly and never thought this was a side effect until I came here and saw how many people were complaining of the same thing.  The ironic part about it, is that this med makes me feel worse and didn't even lower my BP!  I'm going back to Benicar, never had a prob, just switched because it was pricey.  I'd rather pay more for a drug and feel better than feel like I do now.

My doctor asked me if I was taking fish oil (yes, 2 tabs) and she said double it.  My BP went down quite a bit.  Then I switced to 3 women's Mercola krill oil tabs per day, plus CoQ10 and 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 (have this tested) and 2 large cups of green tea per day.  BP went down from 170/90 to 120/70--perfect!As we get older, our bodies suffer more and more irreparable damage from the environment.  You need to find out what is causing your BP to go up and fix it--not gloss over and chemically medicate it.  The American Heart Association is lying on it's website when they claim &quot;no one knows why a person has high blood pressure.&quot; There are tons of studies out there on natural substances and fixing your diet (no sugar, low carb)to lower your BP, the better your blood sugar is, the better your blood pressure will be, in general.  Get a meter and use it.  Keep your blood sugar in the recommendations of the meter mfgr which are the same as the American Diabetes Assn.  Good luck to you all.

When I had an episode with a blood clot which lasted for 1/2 hour and my BP went up to 210/90 I was put on Diovan. Systolic has not reduced and remains at 160 to 180.  Diastolic has reduced to between 50 to 60.  Heart rate has dropped from 60bpm to 40bpm. Slow heart rate is keeping me awake.  Have stopped taking Diovan to see what happens.  Can't get into my doctor for 3 days.

My bp is now 136/78 after 4 months with no side effects. I am usually very sensitive to drugs so am surprised at being able to take such a large dose with no side effects. I just hope it stays this way.

Diovan, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	4/20/2011 12:37:08 AM	Overall I am happy with this drug, very little side effects in a couple years.  However, lately my body temperature is lower, almost 2 degrees and my legs and feet seems cold.  I am taking Diovan W/Hctz 160/12.5 orally.  So last week I was walking with my wife about 2 miles and half-way through the walk, my left leg got slightly num, like when you sleep on your arm and a felt fatique so my wife helped me home; anyhow this happen twice in a row on walks so I decided to make an appointment to see my doctor and couldn't get an appointment for (4) days so I decided to cut the diovan pill in half and took half and I felt better the next few days, no pain when I walk or numness.  When I told my doctor about this he examine me an ordered a circulation stress test, which I am taking on Thursday; however, he told me to start taking the pill again full strength and about an hour after taking the pill I felt cold all over and my wife took my temperature and it was 96.8 not 98.6.  So I am confused as to what is happening to me.  I feel I should only take half the medication again like when I first started out the drug with my doctor at 80 mgs.  I never have seen these symptons discuss with diovan oral tablet--what gives?  My wife says I should get a second opinion.

Since taking Diovan 320 mg I have experienced the following side effects: fatigue, weakness, dizziness, blurred vision, and dry heaving. It has lowered my BP from 150/100 to 128/81 but I cannot live and function with these horrible side effects!!! Discontinuing today, my doctor has switched me to Lisinipril 20mg. BE CAREFULE WITH DIOVAN!!!! I HATE IT!!!
High Blood Pressure	Millie, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	65-74	4/12/2011 6:10:33 AM	Taken Diovan one per day for over 7 years and reduced to 3 per week 2yrs ago as I was suffering joint pain - unsure as to the cause I looked up side-effects hence my actions. January 2011 B.P raised GP said possibly due to not sleeping due to chronic cough, which I have had for over year as yet undiagnosed. I now have severe pain in my shoulders,neck,knees - feel low, weary,my osteopath thought I should get a blood test as it cold be Polymyalgia - test negative which is good but why have I all this pain? - expect a bit at aged 66 but I have always been active, eat healthily and I have a high pain threshold. Reading these comments on muscle weakness and pain so similar to mine has made me reconsider this drug and I am now reducing it and utilising natural remedies - including meditation - eventually will cease using it - I'll take my chances but at least I'll find out if the cause is the drug. Sometimes I wonder wheher these drugs make us dependent and diminish our natural capacities to address high BP

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	3/30/2011 4:31:20 PM	Diovan has effectively controlled my HBP, however, the addition of Savella for the treatment of fibromyalgia, has increased both BP and heart rate. The information provided about Savella included the two above mentioned side effects. But Savella has all but eliminated the fibro pain. Only changes in the barametric pressure override the the positive results of Saavella.

I was told this should have no side effects for me.  After about 3 wks, I began with aching ankles. A few days later, my right knee was quite painful.  The next day, I began having severe muscle spasms in both legs.  I would doze off and wake up screaming with the pain and unable to get out of bed! Had to call paramedics.  They gave me a painkiller.  Talk about my blood pressure being elevated!!!! Anyway, after speaking with my doctor, I was told not to take anymore of Diovan. It is a week later and I am doing much better, still a little sore in the thighs but nothing like it was.

High Blood Pressure	nanettel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/21/2011 5:23:18 PM	I have been well controlled on Atacand for 15 years, but a change in my insurance company made this a pre-authorized drug and they wanted me to follow their protocol and change to a different medication.  My Dr. changed me over to Diovan 80mg once per day.  Within 2 hours started having terriable side effects.  After 3 days of treatment side effects included, choking feeling, pain in left arm and left calf, insomnea and when able to sleep, nightmares and a pounding heart.  I have been put back on Atacand and we are hoping that there is no damage just from the 3 days I was on this medication.  The cost of the Diovan and Atacand are very close.  So I guess I do not understand why it has to be a prior authorized now by my insurance, just because they have changed RX companies. People in offices are messing with my health!  And may have caused damage for a few dollars.  How much more will this cost to correct?  If able to correct! I know that Diovan works well for many people.  And I am thankful that it helps them, but if you are asked to change because of cost?  It is not worth it if you are well controlled on a different medication....

In trying to determine the cause, I just typed Diovan into the search line on the web.  There are a lot more testimonials of joint pain there than on this site.  I am going to go off it for a few days and see what happens.  It seems also, like sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. (I could hardly walk today when I was out, which got me more determined to find the problem.)

Upon the passing of my wife my DR had me take a physical discovering mild increased BP he prescribed Biovan. It didn't change my usually normal BP much but soon I experienced loose bowels which became chronic making me evacuate several times a day and night which restricted me to home, Desperate I stopped all medications in case of an interaction, bowels slowly returned to normal. Adding back one medication at a time, under doctors supervision, we discovered the Diovan was responsible. Switched to another medication which seems to work. I can fly again.

High Blood Pressure	Peter, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	65-74	12/19/2010 7:45:02 PM	Having been on bp medication for some years,(which was working ok)my bp was showing signs of being unstable and due to the length of time I'd been on my current medication, my GP suggested I join a trial being run from my local medical center for Diovan. After three months I had been bumped up to 320mg. The side affects were dreadful: Dry cough, aching joints (especially knees and hips)and loss of libido. In fact an overall feeling of being unwell. I stopped taking Diovan 12 days ago and the side affects are still with me. I don't know what the shelf life of this drug is but I just want it out of my system! Be very careful before taking this drug is all I can say.

I have a visit this week coinciding with my first month on the full dose, followed by a visit to my GP. I will be insisting she gets me off this dangerous pill!
High Blood Pressure	Louis French, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male		12/4/2010 1:06:53 PM	Quickly controlled high blood pressure I didn't know I had. Have been a commercial pilot for 36 years passing biannual test. Upon death of wife, retiring from aviation new doctor discovered mild hypertension giving me DIOVAN and LEVOTHYROXINE.  In three months I developed bowel cramps which led to multiple bowel cramps with liquid DIARRHEA several times a day. I personally stopped medication. In 4 days diarrhea slowed and bowels are slowly returning to normal without changing my basic diet. Have appointment with doctor for review and possible change to medications.

High Blood Pressure	Gremaw5, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	10/2/2010 2:18:18 PM	I was prescribed Diovan in hopes it would help lower by BP which can run 190/100. I've had high blood pressure for 23 yrs and have tried so many drugs it's not funny. I hadn't been on diovan 3 days and I began to feel sick, like I had the flu. I also had diarrhea 5-6 times a day. I was afraid to go anywhere. After 2 weeks of being on this drug, I went back to my doctor and told him how awful I was feeling and the diarrhea. He told me that it couldn't be from the medication and to keep taking it. Well, he didn't have to live with the side effects so I stopped taking it and guess what? No more diarrhea or feeling sick. Big Pharma should be sued for allowing some drugs to be on the market!

I had a cough that would come and go through the years but would never stay away for long. Since the very begining I had constipation and sexual disfunction. In the last year I had increased dizziness and sleep problems. The disiness part was happening as I'd try to work in my garden and stand up quickly. I'd nearly pass out. Told my Dr. about all this stuff and he said to quit taking it for a month and then we might try a different drug if the problems persist. Now only a few days after I stopped taking it my stupid cough went away, constipation quit, the dizziness stopped completely and my libido has returned!!! I'm full of power again and keep busy getting my work done and then some!!! Shocked that this was the cause!!! Incredible!!!

Stopped the drug for about a month and started taking it again and developed a fast and pounding heart rate and lost 15 lbs in 3 weeks. Felt terrible!  The pounding heart rate was the worst.  I could feel EVERY BEAT....pound, pound, pound. I was sent to a cardiologist and a work up camge back negative. I finally stopped the Diovan and the pounding, fast heart rate went away and by libido came back.  I would NEVER recommend this drug!

I had difficulty breathing in the night, lying down sleeping,this eased almost at once.  I had a dull pain in the chest area, this also vanished.  The only symptom that I experience, once in a way, is slight lower back pain, mostly in the night after I have been sleeping for hours.  I thought this had something to do with my kidneys.  Other than that I have no discomfort at all and lost 3 kgs during this time.  I have to confess I started walking regularly as soon as I started taking this medication.  May be that is another reason for not having any joint pain.

I am a 49 year old male and have taken Diovan 80MG for several years. I have experienced fatigue and a blase attitude (almost depression like), no muscle pains but very concerning palpitations on occasion. 2 years past I told my doctor about this, went on cardio monitor which revealed nothing...but it still happens on occasion. Libido is reduced too. I am very fit and run 3 miles 3 times a week. 
High Blood Pressure	Freckles, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/31/2009 5:39:02 PM	I've been on the Diovan for awhile and it is working to lower the blood pressure.  Interesting, the doctors believe it's that &quot;White Coat Syndrome&quot; that's causing my problem, as I am deathly afraid of the doctor's office, anything to do with it, ever since my mom passed away.  Plus, I had a very traumatic experience, which I believe initiated my whole fear of the doctor.Anyway, anyone who gets put on this stuff, stay with it, the side affects eventually subside, did for me!  You want to make sure you take care of yourself, eat well, exercise, get a good night's sleep, and you'll be fine.

High Blood Pressure	Captresq,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		8/24/2009 2:59:15 PM	Started taking approx 2 yrs ago.  Noticed arthritic symptoms soon after.  Was diagnosed with possible Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  I saw several Drs for the pain and swelling in my joints.  None of them agreed what was causing it.  This past April, I broke out in hives,had acute renal failure, severe joint pain and spent several days in the hospital, during that time was taken off of diovan.  Joint pain and hives disapeared.  Six weeks later and after starting diovan again joint pain and hives returned causing another stay in the hospital, bu tno renal failure.  This time I convinced my Dr to take  me off of diovan and try something else.  I am now taking Norvasc and for the last six weeks I have had no joint pain, no hives and kydneys are functioning fine.  The diovan was the only common element to both hospital stays.
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	8/21/2009 2:58:25 PM	This review system does not include race, which is an issue for this drug. One very important fact about this drug is that it may not work well on African-Americans, of which I am one. So, it may not be advised that this drug be used because the natural inclination for the doctor is to 'up' to dosage when another drug might work better with a low dosage. Doctors are too quick to prescribe and then up dosages. This isn't good in the long run due to the effect that drugs have on the liver.

High Blood Pressure		1	1	1			7/25/2009 7:00:28 PM	I forgot to mention something. In addition to improved diet and walking every day, I have been drinking apple cider vinegar in a glass of water once or twice a day. I can't say this has helped normalize my BP without meds, but I don't know that it hasn't. There are numerous websites describing the health benefits of ACV. Check for yourself. If you decide to try it, stir one or two tablespoons of raw organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar with &quot;mother&quot; into a full glass of water. (Mother is the name for the little cobwebby nutrients that float in the vinegar.) Bragg is a good brand. So is Hain. If you don't like the vinegar taste, stir in a little honey. I first started doing this to help my irritable bowel but it has the rep for controlling BP as well. Be patient and give it a few weeks; nothing will happen overnight. 
High Blood Pressure		3	2	1			7/24/2009 12:51:01 PM	I posted on 7/21 about getting off Diovan.  I had to do something because the drug was causing unacceptable levels of bowel looseness plus a number of other annoying side effects. I was amazed at how easy it was to normalize my BP by becoming more active and improving my diet. The most important thing I can say here is get off your rear and get moving! Walking is ideal because it is gentle and works almost all your muscles. Start out slow and build up gradually. Start your new program several weeks before attempting to reduce your meds, and then talk to your doc first.
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	7/21/2009 3:24:33 PM	I stopped taking Diovan about a week ago. Several weeks prior to that, I started walking about a mile a day, every single day, half in the a.m.and half in the p.m. I walk fast enough to be out of breath when I get home. I also improved my diet. More fish &amp; seafood, whole grains, more fruits &amp; vegies, almost no sweets. I feel better than I have in several years with a lot more energy. Saw the doc today for a followup after quitting Diovan. My BP was 124/82 WITHOUT any meds at all. So tonight I celebrate. Bottom line, be sure you really need those drugs.

High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	7/16/2009 9:49:15 AM	I quit taking Diovan and am making major lifestyle changes instead. If you are plagued with side effects, that means your body hates the stuff and it probably isn't good for you. What good is artificially &quot;normal&quot; BP if it's causing so many other problems? People still have strokes &amp; heart attacks while on BP meds.  Better to try to control it naturally and keep the body happy.  Suggestion if BP meds are a must: Try low doses of 2 or even 3 meds rather than high doses of a single med. This is suggested by my cousin who is a pharmacist. He says doing this minimizes side effects.

Well - after taking this for a week, my pulse rate has increased and I feel like I have the shakes. Today - I was changed to Avapro (150 mg) and after reading the reviews, this drug is less effective on African Americans so now I have to deal with discrimination of a drug .  Wow - I am gonna lose weight and hopefully do away with all of this. I am now 205 so I lost 6 lbs. (probably water), I have started exercising and also changing my diet.  With the help of God -- this will be done! The doctor feels that the diuretic part is what is giving me the shakes but overall, my BP decreased from 144 / 92 to 117 / 78 (today)... so it may work for some but not for me!

Have seen good results although I get light headed and server headaches. When i exercise then wait 1 hour prior to taking later in the day I will get extreme headaches that knock me down for several hours. On the days I do not exercise no headaches? I plan on cutting dosage and watch BP. Otherwise beside price it has worked.

My BP today was 144 / 90 and I am 44 yrs old and 211 lbs. Dr. advised me to lose weight and that is where I stand (presently).  One visit to the Dr. or BP check should not confirm such a condition..

First on head then hands, arms and legs followed. I am calling doctor tomorrow. This sure is frusterating!No other symptoms from diovan to report, but then again, it is only 5:00 and first dose was taken at 1:00.

She then put me on diovan, 160 Mg's per day, then doubled it.  It brought my bp down, but not low enough. Being an herbalist, I looked into an Ayurvedic formula called Mutka Vati-this works like a charm!  I'm still on meds, after finding the correct dosage of both; brought my bp down to 115/75, which is exactly where I want it.  I will bring this to my doctor and tell her I want off these meds.  I am constantly exhausted while on it, and I don't want to be dependent on meds.  Mukta Vati can be found on ebay, google the term and Ivy's is the brand I bought.  Very satisfied with it!!

However, it has done a great job in controlling my BP. I was 225/110 and now I'm 120/75. If you can deal with the exhaustion, it's a great medication and will DEFINITELY work.

Did fine for about a week but for feeling alittle light headed. But soon my left lower back and right heel were killing me. Could barely walk more less exercise. Doctor said the pain was not related. She switched me to Lisinopil because of the dizziness with pressure reading 96/55 (was 159/89). She told me to start with 5mg, I'm starting at 2.5 and monitor my pressure at home.

Blood pressure WAY high - 200/100 ! Scary.  Diovan 160 did not help.  Changed to Diovan 320 and been on that for a year.  No side effects.  Keeps my BP &quot;normal&quot; - last doctor visit 120/80.

I have to keep increasing the dose. Started with 80 mg. Went to 160 mg. Now on 320 mg. It's been keeping my numbers at good levels. Feel a little tired at times but would never consider dropping Diovan.

Does anyone else suspect hair loss from high blood pressure medications?  Diovan does lower blood pressure, though, but who wants a bald head unnecessarily so.

I have experience lower back pain, fatigue, and chronic sinusitis.  I'm now considering discontinuing the Diovan to see if it alleviates my sinus issues, otherwise it has worked well.

Diovan eliminated the cough completely. My concern is the cost of this brand Rx is quadrupled that of Lisinopril. I am looking for a generic alternative that does not cause severe coughing.

My doctor prescribed 160 mg 1 X per day.  Within a week my BP was significantly reduced.  After 5 months my BP hovers around 117/76.  I have to make sure I drink plenty of fluids.  At times I experience mild dizziness if I stand too rapidly;  otherwise, no side effects.

High Blood Pressure	E. Claire, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	55-64	3/6/2009 1:40:53 PM	I took this drug for 3 or 4 years.  It lowered my blood pressure pretty well but I had to increase the dosage to 80 mcg (I'm very sensitive to drugs) about a year ago.  I gradually started to feel worse and worse, with my back aching and soon my joints and muscles.  I couldn't exercise without 3 days of really sharply sore muscles.  I told my doctor about the sore back and joints and muscles and was told that &quot;It's part of getting old&quot;.  But it wasn't.  I finally pulled/tore a ligament and muscle in my shoulder and needed Physical Therapy.  Through all of these sore backs and joints and muscles, I was taking Ibuprofen just to function in my daily life.  My doctor ran my blood tests and my liver function tests were bad.  Bad enough that she took me off of Diovan.  It was like a weight was lifted from my shoulders--within 2 days I could get out of bed without hobbling when I started to walk.  My back started to feel better. My shoulder began to heal.  I could exercise and not be sore for 3 days. I don't need Ibuprofen anymore. My normal energy level has returned. And my liver function tests are getting better.     I should have insisted that my doctor take me seriously when I told her my muscles and joints and back hurt and that the hurt was different from sore muscles, much sharper.  Plus, what good is a drug if you need an NSAIDS to tolerate it's effect on your body.  Hopefully my liver is not permanently damaged!

I tried diet, exercise, but the only thing than helped me was medication, I used to be &gt; 160/95, now i'm hovering around 125/85. I had no side effects at all, at least not yet, I'm 32, and have been on this for 3 years.

This worked fairly well, but my physician was concerned about my 'dry cough'. I was changed to Valsartan (80mg). This did not affect my (labile but often high) BP. Another physician increased the dose to 160 mg per day. This has made no difference. The side-effects are very slight (slight gastric distress). Will need to consider alternatives. (Magnesium supplementation seems to help, as does a low dose of Diazepam and massage as well as Coenzyme Q10.)Valsartan is expensive and does not work for me. The original physician did not like the idea of Thiazide diuretics (he was concerned about metabolic disturbances. Perhaps I should concentrate on 'life-style' changes? I am currently in a sedentary and stressful job.

No problems except dystolic stayed high. Added amlodipine 2.5 mg 2 weeks ago. Combination of meds seem to have brought on dizziness, feeling faint, low energy, &amp; rapid hair loss. BP under control, side effects increasing stress level. Not sure the combo is what I need.

Changed to Diovan and seems to be working though I would like to see my numbers a bit lower.  It's been only a few months and I'll give it a few more to see if there's a change.

Among the worst was extremely agitated. Got upset, felt like blood rushing to my head, felt like something was about to happen. Had to lay down to calm down. Reduce the amount to 40mg and kind of tolerating it. Headaches, muscle weakness and pain, head whirling, sinus aches daily and infections, back pain. BP not reduced so far as much as would like. I think I need an internist doctor??

High Blood Pressure	Diovan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	1/10/2009 6:32:30 PM	I was on this drug for approximately 3 months.  It helped to lower my blood pressure a little bit, but not enough, so Dr. increased dosage.  Blood pressure started going back up, acquired a weight gain from an increased appetite and a very strange dry, scabby rash on my lower back and stomach.  Biggest problem with this drug was the &quot;hangover&quot; type of effect I had every morning when I tried to get up.  I don't drink alcohol or do other drugs at all.  Dr. has now switched me over to Lisinopril which is working quite well - some side effects but not like with Diovan.

It has worked great in protecting my kidneys, however the swelling of my feet, ankles and lower legs has made my life hell when it acts up.  My doctor is positive its the diovan causing my edema, but since my father had kidney disease that led him to a transplant, my doctor is putting the kidneys first and my swollen legs second.

It somewhat works for that, but REALLY EFFECTS my asthma!  I have coughing spells that are out of control!  So, I did my own on-line research and found the side effects are worse than the high blood pressure!  It seems that ALOT of the Rx'd meds have MORE side effects that are much worse than the original problem!!!  Whether it was smart or not, I stopped taking Diovan on my own because the coughing was so bad!!!  However, I will be contacting my Dr with my decision.

RECENTLY HAD A HEAT ATTACK AND WAS PUT ON COREG ALONG WITH DIOVAN 40.  MY STOMACH HAS BEEN EXTREMELY UPSET AND SWELLS UP WITH SO MUCH BLOATING WITH EITHER FOOD OR WATER.  FIRST I WENT OFF THE COREG, DIDN'T HELP.  THEN I WENT OFF THE DIOVAN AND THE STOMACH PROBLEMS WENT AWAY TWO DAYS LATER.  I'VE HAD SCANS, UPPER GI, AND LOWER WHICH HAS SHOWN NOTHING WRONG.  THESE TWO DRUGS DID NOT FAIR WELL TOGETHER AND THE DIOVAN DID NOT PREVENT A HEART ATTACK.  I ALSO HAD LEG PAINS AND MANY JOINT ACHES DURING THE YEARS WHILE TAKING DIOVAN.  
High Blood Pressure	j, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female		11/24/2008 11:57:00 AM	Dr. for some reason started me on the 320 mg. My reaction was severe spiking 200/101 and dropping to 112/59 2 hours after taking pill.  My chest started hurting and I began gasping for breath with movement. Spent most of my time in a chair. After 1 week I stopped pill myself.  Dr. then gave me the 80 mg and I am doing fine. No side effects, but b/p not dropping as fast as we would like so I will probably agree to take the next step up.

On the fifth day, I felt dizzy in the morning, then in the afternoon my heart began racing.  I called my MD who at first thought I was having a panic attack, but I have never had one before.  My body temperature dropped to 97.  Then my feet turned white.  I felt very cold all over and shivered for the whole five days.  I also became sensitive to light and sound.  The left side of my face and my left foot became numb, which lessened, but did not disappear even after I stopped the Diovan.

Will cut 320mg in half to 180mg. So far, only slight headaches.
High Blood Pressure	 (Patient) 	3	3	3			11/14/2008 3:13:52 PM	Couldn't handle the 160 mg.  Can only equate the side effects as making me feel like I was in the first trimester of pregnancy, minus the vomiting.  Total exhaustion.  80 mg seems to be tolerable.

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	11/6/2008 2:08:59 PM	I've been on Diovan for about 3 months. It does control my BP but, there are drawbacks. Switched to taking it at night due to the fatigue it was causing (couldn't keep my head off my desk at work.)  When I take at night, it is like taking a sleeping pill - until the dieretic kicks in.  I am typically up several times a night to use the bathroom now.  I suppose there is a perfect time of day to take this med but, I have yet to find it.

(Except diareah)  As soon I stop taking it, my blood pressure came 120/60 and below, the combination was am: Norvasc 10 mg., HCTZ 25 mg and pm: Atenolol 25 mg.  Also gained 2 pounds each month.  As soon I stopped, have loose the same, 2 pounds each months, for a year, I am now my same weight I was when I started taking the Diovan.  I was a PPA patient.

Just an FYI, it did give me nightmares almost every night!  I know it was the diovan, because less than a week of going off of it due to trying to get pregnant, my nightmares completely stopped (and i'm still on the toprol). For me it was worth it though, as it kept my BP low.

Switched to the regular 160mg Diovan with better results. It has made me dizzy at times but it has been tolerable. When squatting be careful when standing, some dizziness may occur, it does with me. I have taken this medicine for several years and so far no major issues. My blood pressure varies from 115/75 to 135/85. Good luck with it!

Alot of doctors who treat diabetics suggest using an ace inhibitor to help with diabetic renal issues but I tried ACE inhibitors and got really really dizzy all the time. I do not have high blood pressure but he seems to think that this ARB as its called works good by taking stress off kidney function. I cannot really claim any serious side affects from it other then sometimes my ankles swell ( end of day ) thats it. No cough or anything like that for me. You might ask your MD about it as an alternative to an ARB if you get really dizzy though...it worksed for me great no problems.

I'm just wondering if any other patient on this drug is expieriencing this probelm.  I started two months ago, I got terrible pressure on top of my head then two days later I had difficulty walking straight.  My primary and Neurologist dent me to the hospital for a cat scan and mri.  They showed nothing but for two weeks I had to walk with a walker.  Now I'm still dizzy off and on.  No one knows why, could it be diovan?

High Blood Pressure	mamajoan, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	65-74	8/15/2008 11:09:21 PM	Following CABG-5 surgery I was put on Lotensin 40mg/Coreg 12.5mg bid along with a couple other meds for other non-related conditions. I was discharged 6 days after surgery, full recovery within 10 days, bp remained steady at 140/80 consistantly for two years. My Family Practice MD changed the Lotensin to Diovan 7 months ago. My bp is all over the place, cannot keep anything on down, have lost almost 75 lbs, cannot stand, have developed Orthostatic Hypotension (bp drops upon standing) so bad that I have fallen twice requiring sutures/stapes, several other times not as serious. The change was due to post-nasal drip. Now the problem has become critical, but nobody believes that the symptoms started 7-10 days after starting the Diovan. I have never suffered from stomach cramps this bad in my life, even with diverticulosis/litis. I know this is the problem, but I cannot get my MD to agree. I have not been able to hold anything on my stomach for longer than 20-30 mins after eating, even water. My feet look like they're going to explode! I'm going to the ER in the morning to have staples removed and my Family MD told me not to sign the d/c papers and insist that I be admitted for further testing and he will be involved.

Every morning my eyes would water for hours and my dry nose was so painful inside that I had to apply petroleum jelly several times a day. The dermatologist and internist told me it was due to menopause, but finally an eye doctor told me it was the medication. I went off the med and my eyes and nose problem was rectified within 3 days.

Tried the Diovan with HCT, swelled up like a balloon, had horrrific joint pains, and pressure went UP. Tried another combo, and made it for two weeks; then had joint pains, terrible cramping, carpal tunnel agony, swollen ankles, and difficulty swallowing.Doctor insisted I try Diovan 320mg. B/P is good, but by 8th day have terrible back pain, all joints very painful, and now I'm itching.  I cannot sleep more than 4 hours, am tired, weak as a kitten, and irritable. Need to take both Ibuprofen and Benadryl which both raise B/P, to survive. Where is this going?

Due to the fact that it's not a case of it being &quot;just me&quot;.  I have been on Diovan for apprx 6mths (chngd from Lisinopril-bad cough)and have experienced chronic reflux issues, extreme hairloss and thinning, weight gain (very active 39 yr old female slightly overweight)joint pain, (knees creek and crack) slight libido change,but overall, BP has stabilized. Now the question is...with all the side effects,is there another, just as effective medication available?  Your reviews have really helped me narrow down the cause of my symptoms.  Thanks WebMd and the many reviewers.

It helps to drink a lot of fluids with this medicine. When I take the pill I follow with a full glass of water and usually drink about 4 more glasses throughout the day. It seems like a lot to drink but it helps to keep the headaches away.

High Blood Pressure	runsfree48, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	55-64	5/30/2008 2:18:19 PM	59 year old caucasian with 10 year history of HTN. Was on 2.5 mg of Vasotec, but it stopped working three months ago (a lot to stress). MD put me on 320 mg of Diovan ... all hell broke loose: severe abdominal cramping; felt like I was getting an ulcer with gastic burning; explosive and watery stools; extreme fatigue; weak as a kitten (I was an Olympic lifter in my youth and am still very strong ... before Diovan); chest congestion; very runny nose; cannot make sense of a simple newspaper article (I have five graduate degrees); very cold extremities; and memory dysfunction. MD told me there would be no side effects! I hate this stuff! I will cut my dose to 80mg for the next week. I'd rather have the HTN. Be very cautious with this stuff (Diovan).

The blood pressure has really dropped to normal readings and my heart rate has superceded all my expectations in descending by 15 points. This medication was prescribed for hypertension but I am concerned about the headaches since I'm not one prone to them there has also been a small amount of muscle cramping in the calves.The drug works well but I would stay in close contact with my physician and my pharmacist.

I also used to get head aches, but when you take diovan, you have to drink a LOT of water or you will have head aches. It helps to drink stuff like gatorade or vitamin water or other fluids containing potassium to get rid of leg/muscle cramps, in spite of what it says on the &quot;drug interactions&quot; part.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	4/17/2008 11:41:34 PM	the blood pressure's been impressively lowered, but seem to have lots of fatigue, back pain, and joint aches with this med. Liked ToprolXL but developed a nasty cough and had to discontinue. Norvasc caused lots of swelling in lower extremities. Guess the Diovan is the best so far but would like to get rid of the back and joint pain that seems to be a side effect of the med. The 10 pound weight gain hasn't made me a fan of this med, either, but dropping the systolic pressure from 237 to 130 is pretty impressive.

I had tried an ACE inhibitor before Diovan and was taken off of that due to a cough. My doctor kept increasing the dose but my blood pressure remained high. My doctor switched me to Avalide 300/12.5 and my blood pressure is finally controlled. I'm happy with the new drug and it's working much better. I only have to take the Avalide once a day which is much better Diovan twice daily.

Ceased taking the Diovan HCT after 30 days as I got angry red itchy welts on my neck. Switched to regular Diovan &amp; welts went away but the itchiness remained around eyes &amp; dry somewhat itchy flat rash replaced the welts.  Discontinued after 2 months.

I have AFib and also take digoxin and coumadin. My doctor prescribed Diovan to help lower my BP since the Toprol was not keeping it low enough. After taking the Diovan for almost 2 weeks, I resumed getting heart palpitations(which have been minimal since starting ther other meds last June, 2007). Is this a known side effect of Diovan? I certainly do not want to continue to take it and have to deal with the palpitations again.

No other medication has worked as well as Diovan HCT. I would recommend this to anyone who has been through all of the insurance company approved drugs that I have tried. I take a dose of maxide with it as it appears that water retention is one of the causes of my hbp.  Nothing bad to say at all, except for BCBS telling me they won't pay for it as they want me to try alternative therapy.  However, I won't give it up.
