High Blood Pressure	Poke and Roll, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	35-44	1/4/2010 5:20:38 PM	This medicine causes BAD HEADACHES!!!  Don't take this pill on a full stomach or with other blood pressure/hypertension medications (like lisinoprol or lopressor).  Tried taking it different ways and I still kept getting horrific headaches.  So doctor took me off this pill and put me on another pill in another category that helps blood pressure.  This pill helped lower my blood pressure but the side effects of horrific headaches was not acceptable or livable for me.

High Blood Pressure	Speech Recovered, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	2/22/2009 8:04:29 AM	Is that where my appetite went?  Thanks for your comments.  And also noticed dry pskin patches on forhead if I don't moisturize daily.  Diagnosed w/ deadly high blood pressure so figured that was the worst.  Nope, it moved up to eminent stroke/heart failure. (Did have the stroke). Rx'd 240mg. 2x's a day along with 40mg. Lisinopril 2x's per day for high BP.  My deepest concern is that missing a dose or two can be deadly.  My BP soars, angina &amp; rapid heart rate.  May have had mild heart attack.  Took my Nitro &amp; laid in bed for 2 hrs. w/ spouse by my side.  No ER b/c bad insurance, but really was not coherent enough to make good choice &amp; kept telling spouse no &amp; he might have listened to me at the wrong time.
Ventricular Rate Control in Atrial Fibrillation	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	65-74	2/10/2009 10:04:10 AM	Originally prescribed Cartia XT to control heart rythym. Dose was 120mg 2x day. Worked well for 8 years. Dr. changed to DILT-XR 240 capsule 1x day. Had significant lowering of BP 4=8 hrs after ingestion. Then rapid increase in BP.  Also experienced poor appetite and sandy, metallic taste for most foods.  After 6 days Dr. returned to original Cartis XT and 120mg 2x day.

I don't have an appetite some days and things that use to taste good don't taste good to me any longer. I have also noticed that I do have more excema outbreaks and I have found that with this med., it is wise to moisturize your skin regularly if you have allergies like excema.
High Blood Pressure	sem04222,  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3			6/3/2008 2:25:54 AM	I have lots of allergies including excema and dermatitis so my doctor's still trying this one out.  I have seen an increase in skin problems and was glad to see the other reviewer notes about foods not tasting good.  I have had the same experience. My bp is gradually going down but still needs help after 1 month on the drug. I never realized that some of my asthma and migraine systems were really bp issues. Migraines have decreased with this medicine as the DR promised.
High Blood Pressure	DayDreamerJenny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/19/2008 3:05:36 PM	My blood pressure has gradually gone down to a safe level while I've been taking this medicine. I feel a lot better now---never knew I felt bad.     I have noticed a change in my appetite tho---some of my favorite foods taste terrible now, and I can't seem to get enough of others, such as raw veggies and brussel sprouts. And my appetite has decreased too---I get fuller, faster.     Has anyone else had this &quot;reaction&quot; to this medication? It's not really bothering me, I just find it strange.
