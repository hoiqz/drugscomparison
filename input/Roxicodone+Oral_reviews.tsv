I have been taking less and dealing with the pain.  I HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH TOUGH WITHDRAWS. I was on 6 30mgs daily down to 2 daily.  I wish I was never prescribed them.  FloridagirlKay

My doctor presribed Oycodone 5 mmg. bid as need for breakthorouh pain. The medicacation is ineffective in resolving my pain, diffult to take and in m opinion I feel the the dosage sshoud be incresed. I also have neuropatic pain; this medication doesn't even hhave any effect on that pain. Believe me when I say a lot of pain. I'm getting to the point of almost losing y mind due to how much pain I endure every day of my life for 7 years now with an incurabule disorer/disease! Any suggestions?

It felt like I had a clothes pin on my tongue with someone holding a match on it 24/7. I went every where to find someone to treat this injury, well I finally found a pain specialist in the Chicago area that designed a Pain Pump that is inserted inside me, the box &quot;pump&quot; is inserted by my waist line and then I have tubes running up my side, under my chin with a catheter that administers the med's that are in pump. The med's are Novocaine and Hydromorphone. When I have break through pain is when I use the Oxycodone, it works well. With all the med's that I have tried before the pump the Oxy worked the best. This has been a life changing experience , I have had to quit my job, because it required a lot of talking and I just could not do it anymore, I worked there for 10 yrs, and I have not worked since. My injury happened in Oct.2007 my last day of work March 2009. I'm writing this because I wonder if anybody else has ever had this happen. I have No taste buds, my left side of my face is numb, I can not chew with out having pain. I'm one in 5000 that this could happen to, if any body has ever heard of this please let me know I would like to talk to them because I feel like I'm all alone in this, it is very depressing, which I take like 4 other med's for nerve pain and depression.

I have been taking 4 30mg roxicet, 60mg oxycontin, soma &amp; valium. Along with injections of botulinum.  in combination, they work well, I do need additional shoulder surgery and the dystonia may need a type of brain surgery but for now, medication managment and my neurological procedures every 3 months seem to control as much as possible. HAS ANYONE NOTICED CHANGE OF COLOR IN OXYCODONE TO A VERY PALE GREEN (ALMOST YELLOW??) My pharmacy was out and I had to go to different store, the print out read correct but I've never seen anything looking like this. Was told new generic but I cannot find on pill identifier.  Would like to know if anyone has had this situation or change in their oxycodone 30mg??

Pain	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	10/8/2011 4:02:47 PM	I have used all the RX pain medications in the market (Opioid and non-opioid) and right now a combination of Oxycontin and Roxicodone has given my life back to me I'm 98% pain-free all day. I use the Roxicodone 30mg every 6 hours for breakthrough pain and it works in 20 minutes and you can feel its full effect in 1 hour and its a superb pain-killer, opioid analgesic; I use a lot oxycodone - Oxycontin and Roxicodone 240mg a day, so I do have side effects mild to moderate  sedation and moderate constipation are my two main complaints but otherwise it's a Godsend. I was previously using Fentanyl Patches 75Micrograms and Oxycodone IR 30mg for breakthrough pain but I wasn't getting enough pain relief so my doctor switched me to Avinza and liquid morphine but had a lot of severe side effects and finally after trying 2 other medications I was put on Oxycontin &amp; Roxicodone and that does the job(Pain Relief). Sometimes I do use a muscle relaxers like Soma, Valium, or Ativan (Lorazepam), (those three work best for me) together with the Oxycontin and Roxicodone and that adds more pain relief.So if everything fails I would strongly recommend the oxycodone in the form of Roxicodone alone or for severe pain Roxicodone with Oxycontin; just find a doctor that listens, cares, and will help you with your pain. Please take it as prescribed if its not working well or as desired tell your doctor! At first I was given small doses but after 4 months I was on the dose that I am on right now so be as patience with your doctor and with the medications. Give it a couple of weeks to work and make sure your at the appropriate dose for your pain level, liver/kidney function, age, and individual case. If your not happy with your pain level and/or your doctor keep looking for a different one never give up, eventually you'll find one that will help you! Never lose hope or give up. Good luck, God Bless and hope this helps.

I am writing this post in the hopes that it will save a life. My cousin, who is like a brother to me, has had back problems since he was in auto accident years ago. Last Friday night Marc took a few of these pills and went to sleep. Marc had built up a tolerance to pain meds and this is why he took more than just one. When his daughter went to wake up Marc he was dead. The corner said that he died around 3:30 AM. He left a beautiful granddaughter along with a family that will all miss him very much.Please if you are taking any pain meds and build up a tolerance let your system clean out and DO NOT TAKE more than what you should just because the recommended dosage does not work. Marcs birthday was supposed to be September 1st, mine is the 19th. Marc was 45 years of age.

I have been taking Norco (Hydrocodone/ Acetaminophen 10/325) for about 6 years, along with a 100mcg Fentanyl patch, and the occ. use of Robaxin for muscle spasms, and have had really good maintenance.  I have Lupus, RA, fibromyalgia, and lost a leg above the knee to an infection mixed with a stupid nurse mistake.  I just saw a pain management doc for the first time and he put me on Roxicodone IR 10mg 4x/day.  I am a nurse (30+years), so I was aware of the benefits vs problems of taking this med.  I have to tell all of you that there is one thing you need to know and always remember regarding addiction/dependency for any pain med.  If you take the medication because you are in pain, and for NO OTHER REASON, then you are NOT an addict.  If you take the pill because you think you may be in pain later, or because you want to sleep, or get high, or for any other reason, then you are an addict.  Dependency is a word that needs careful use.  You are dependent on air, water, food.  As for me, using Roxicodone may not be, as I immediatly got short of breath, my heart rate went up to 194bpm (not a common response), and I started itching more than I ever have before.  Itching goes with Lupus, but this was much worse.  Anyway, if people give you a hard time about the (proper) use of these meds for your pain management, offer to let them walk a mile or 10 in your moccasins, so they can judge you without being such a pitiful idiot.  Good Luck, and Blessed Be.

I have tried many other medications including Oxycontin and have not had the relief that this medication has given me. The only thing negative that I would have to say about it is if for any reason I were to lose...forget to pack or whatever the case may be, not have any to take for more than a day...the feelings of physical withdrawl are horrendis. I hate having to depend on anything to live pain free or less pain...but you do what you have to do to live and be a happy, productive part of socieity.

I have five either herniated or bulging disks, L1 thru L5 due to an auto accident. I only rated three stars for satisfaction after living the total and uncomfortable addiction to the drug. I made a very careful decision after long consultation with my doctor and only after months of working up to the doses I'm currently prescribed. I basically traded the addiction for the constant pain. so there are definately benefits but at a high cost.

I've been on Oxycodone 30's for at least 5 yrs. I've worked up from 7.5 milligrams almost 8 yrs. ago to the 30's 3x a day. My problem now is there just not working well anymore. I'm also taking 10 mg Methedone 4 pills am and 3 pills pm, Valium as a muscle relax.. and Elavil for nerve pain and help sleeping.   I was wondering if anyone knew about the liquid or a higher milligram Roxi.?? My BIG prob. is price. I was looking to switch from the Roxi's to Hydrocodone if price was similar, but can't find a higher dose then 10mg. I go to my pain management Dr. on Mon. and was hoping to call my Pharmacy this evening to check on prices, so maybe I'll have an idea of what and how many mg and the cost. If anyone can PLEASE HELP I'd really be appreciative.

While I do not take this medication my husband does.  He was knocked down a 3 1/2 story elevator shute and landed on his feet sending the bones in his legs to blow out both knees.  Does he need medication for pain Yes,but the hell that it has put our family thru I can not justify. He stays in the room all the time,does not spend time with family,does not want to do any of the things he once did and has made the relationship between his 3 older children so strained that 1 had a breakdown. The side effects are bad enough because he even has seizures from them and if he should run out for even a day he's in such agony. I hate these pills the are the DEVIL in disguise.

Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/1/2011 2:15:42 AM	I've never taken it but opana doesn't seem to work. I was on 80mg. oxycontin er. Since Purdue has changed the formula they made me sick, vomiting, and other ailments.  I would like to try the medication that is closest to what I had been taking.  I'm a chronic pain patient with several issues.  Beginning with fibromyalgia, chronic pelvic pain, chronic abdominal pain, DJD, etc... I would like to know what is the the closest pain reliever that is close to the previous medication since the pharmaceutical company has messed them up.  My doctor doesn't know exactly how I feel we've tried Opana 40mg.  I'm tired of being in pain constantly.  I'm searching for suggestions.  I know that the company has lost money due to the change because my insurance covers any medications. What could you recommend I take that would be in comparison to the previous meds of oxycontin 80mg.oc not those new op's I couldn't even take the generic brand of those.  I'm allergic to a lot of medications.  I've been to an Allergy Physician, yet we only narrowed it down to latex, sulfa drugs, ibuprofen, lyrica, penicillin, compazine, neurontin, some other new medication, and I'm not to keen on taking medications that are always advertised with so many side affects.  For many years my previous Dr. was giving me Darvocet, and now they're being recalled.  I'm tired, and I really don't want to be a lab rat,so all I'm asking is for advice as to rather opana or roxicodone is the closest to the oxycontin er?
Neuropathic Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/21/2011 9:43:09 AM	I'm tired of the pain!  Between my Fibro and nerve and back/neck issues it's hard to find something that works all day without retaking this addicting medication. My Dr. has me on this and Galapentin, which, in my opinion is a total waste of my money. I really need to see a Neurologist but no insurance and being unemployed makes it impossible. Is there anything out there that works and you don't get looked at like a druggie when trying to fill this medication. Most pharmacies don't even carry it anymore and if you can find it they charge an arm and a leg. I just want an end to this pain and swelling...any suggestions?

Started treat ment with vicodin7.5, then norco(10mg vic's0 then we moved on to the roxicodone, Well they workked for a little while, then My doctor threw in MScontin 60 mgs. 3x a day.The roxy;s also 3x a day. I have had 2 back surgeries+a breast reduction, Anything to help with the pain right? well here it is 13 yrs. after my injury and the doage of all the meds including Soma350mgs 3x aday has not been working as much anymore. I agree the roxy's can become addicting I think the reasons are as follows: they pack a good punch intially,then the wear off quickly. Then u are trying to get that same initial pain relief. All tthese years later and the doc says &quot;i don;t know what to tell you&quot;, what kind of crap is that? there has to be something out there that provides LONG TERM pain relief. I am at odds over this and don't know where to turn next as one pain mgt. Doc thinks I'm a drug seeker, and the new MRI that I just had shows small changes ie. Disc herniations from the L2 thre the L5-S1 with bone spurs, disc protusion and bulging some of which are pinching, or pinching off the nerve root. One of the left side nerve roots is so badly pinched, the leg pain is unbearable. There has to be something out there that you don't build a tolerance up of so quickly, and REALLY works. I'm so frustrated I am or get depressed. Ugh. Any suggestions, I'll take em'. Stay strong everyone I'm trying to.

Pain	carpenter, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	4	3	Male	45-54	12/30/2010 9:57:46 PM	I first started taking pain pills back in 1975 after a very serious cycle accident. Started off with the more tolerant meds like darvocet  loratabs..ect. But there are several issues that I believe are most important thing that I most peoplemay not realize. Bones may break, legaments get torn and dislocations occur. But what does'nt EVER leave is the fact that though you might think that you are healed, but comes back in later years as arthritis, fibromalgy... So people start taking pills that are prescribed by people we are suppose to trust with are health and well being. Our PCP or pain management physician to give us treatment, therapy and if all else fails , surgery. In the meantime we are given stronger doses of pain pills that eventually become ineffective. I am currently on 30mg Roxicodone times 3 per day. Now I am dealing with a pill that is no longer effective after over a year of use and having grown a dependancy for these pills. I can certainly understand how EASY it is to abuse these pills, I mean how often does anyone of us stick precisely to the script order? People here are dying at a rate of 7 per day here in Florida from fatal drug overdose. Whose to say which one of these addicts were LEGALLY allowed to take these pills, whom with proper physician diagnosis missed on the telltale signs of abuse. I part I take responsibility for what I take medicinally. However those PHYSICIANS whose only concern is to PAD there bank account through Medicare and Medicade patients, should be held accountable. It is my hope that one DAY either on a state or Federal level that specific LAWS and proceedures be put in place that were create a treatment plan that would focus on the patient than on having all these pharmacuticals and pain clinics reap all this money from patients who continue to suffer.

I take a lot of other pain meds., but these Roxys are very effective.  They're also very popular, so unless you can trust someone, keep the fact that you have them to yourself. People will take advantage of &quot;borrowing&quot; something for help. When you're lucky enough to find a Dr. willing to prescribe pain meds. that help, do exactly &amp; take them as you're told.  Mistakes costs &amp; will follow you forever. God Bless &amp; Best of Luck to everyone dealing with chronic pain.

Pain	MacAttack, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/7/2010 3:22:14 AM	I am a 47 y/o white male that suffers from degenerative disc disease with 4-5 fractured vertabrae that my doc found only 2 summers ago. I was dianosed with DDD in 1992 and the pain manifested itself in the beginning as bad headaches or cluster/migraines. After going through the usual maze of Docs that almost every chronic pain patient must go through in order to find a pain mgt. doc that won't treat you like a drug addict and will prescibe enough meds to manage the pain adequately I finely found one 5-7 hrs. from my home. The trip has been hell on my back but well worth it to find pain management docs who don't judge you and they have always directed me to a pharmacy where one doesn't get the &quot;you'll get hooked&quot; lecture along with the dirty looks and being lied to by the pharmacists by them telling me that they don't carry this medication or don't carry &quot;anything like this&quot;. Anyway that is only part of the maze mentioned earlier, the other part has to do with docs that either won't prescribe opiates or won't prescribe adequate amounts to get you through the month. So after being on several different opiates,I have been on the regimen I'm on now for about 8-10 years. I currently am prescribed OxyContin 80mgs--2 pills every 6 hrs., Valium 10mgs--1 tab 4 times a day, Roxicodone 30mgs--can take up to 10 per day for breakthrough pain. This regimen has given my life back to me. I have 2 children-my son is 20 and my daughter is 22 with 2 beautiful children. My wife and I spend as much time with the grandbabies as we can. I could not enjoy them like I do without the pain meds. I recently had to go out on medical leave from my job, though, due to absenteeism and through the direction of my supervisor. I still have some &quot;bad days&quot; where I don't feel like doing much. I must say that Roxicodone has greatly improved my day to day activities since I finally was prescribed an adequate amount. Yes I am prescibed 10 30mg tabs each day. I must agree that brand name works much better.

I did not realize I had the disease of addiction till I found these pills. I'm not trying to preach or convince anyone that they will end up like me BUT the  14 out of 23 ppl in rehab with me are in for roxicodone addiction. 2 of the people in my last rehab are dead from a roxi overdose. Just PLEASE be aware. I wouldnt wish dependence on this pill(or any chemical for that matter.) on any other living creature. If you have to be on an opiate, have someone you trust give them to you to make sure you take them as prescribed. If you can, please avoid taking opiates at all. I have severe back issues. I take IB Prof. 800. and yeah, I still have pain every day. But I will take that pain over the unmanageable hell my life had become. Guess I did get a little preachy.

I have degeneration of multiple vertibrae and several pins plates and screws in my back and shoulder from an atv accident.  Before taking this medication I was miserable, irritable and basically nonfunctional.  As a father of 2 and a husband this medication has given my life back to me as far as being able to participate in family functions and everyday life.  Your body does however build a tolerance rather quickly if not taken as prescribed but is effective if not abused.  I have to say the negative effects of addiction and high tolerance come no where close to the positive outcome of taken this medication.  I cannot speak for everyone but have to say that it has given me my life back and no longer have to feel severe pain, depression, and guilt when my children ask to play or swim or go riding 4-wheelers.  I will take the chance of the side-effects over not being a father to my children or a husband to my wife.  You will know if you are going to have issues with abuse early from this medication cause it come on quick and can if not controlled last a lifetime and will lose everything.  You, yourself have to decide what is more important.  Your family or a medication that alot of people take even though they do not need it.  There is a happy median of prescribed medication and a family life.  Myself have been given a second chance of life because of this medication.  If you have issues have someone help with the despencing of the medication so you don't run out.  The withdrawls a miserable and debilitating themselves not to mention the increase of your pain by 100 percent.  So be responsible and remember you have a choice,  make the right one.  Thank you

Neuropathic Pain	nolifeleft, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	55-64	3/12/2010 9:12:27 AM	ive just finished my 6th(oct) 7th (nov) &amp; 8th(jan) back surgeries. been on pain meds since 1986, 60mg oxycontin and 10/325 percocets since 1999. I now have had 3 fusions and an osteotomy. my dr. is trying to get me off the oxy`s. he lowers the mgs each month and has replaced my percocets with roxicodone 15mg. the roxi seems to work fairly good, but at my next appt im just going to tell my dr. to  get rid of the oxycontin for good and raise my roxi`s to 30 mg 6x day. the only pain i deal with now is constant chronic pain in my legs and my left foot burns at times which i think i can control with the 30mg roxi`s. by the way, all these &quot;codones&quot; are VERY addictive and easy to overuse ie &quot;selfmedicate&quot; my wife keeps these meds locked in a safe and gives me my daily doses.

Pain	armyssg, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/10/2010 3:43:54 PM	Hello I used to be in the Army but had to retire due to debilitating pain suffered from a back injury.  I went from civilian doctors to the ones at the VA hospital.  Am I EVER glad I did that, because now I am getting the relief I need.  I take 4 15 mg oxycodone 4 times a day, and I cannot believe how much more I can do with my life.  I just wanted to say on here that there is a BIG difference between addiction and TOLERANCE.  Yes we are ALL physically addicted because thats the way opiates work.  Unfortunately, your body does become accustomed to the drug and you become physically addicted to the meds.  But when you require more, it is NOT because you WANT more, but your body has built up a TOLERANCE to the drug, meaning you need more after a while for the drug to work as effectively as what you are used to.  It DOES not mean you are an addict, just you need more to achieve the same effect.  Don't feel bad people; we are not these raving addicts needing a fix, we need the drugs for the relief of our pain.  No matter what anyone says about you,  they have NO clue what you and I are going through.  If you are taking the medications as prescribed, and have documented proof of your ailment, then you are a law abiding citizen and are doing NOTHING wrong.  I have been called an addict more times than I can remember, because people are just so uneducated about pain meds and why people take them.  You have NOTHING to be ashamed of.  I am sure that like most of you, if there was a fix to our pain through surgery or other means, we would not need the meds, true?  It's these idiots that abuse their medications that make those of us taking them for a valid reason, a drug &quot;addict&quot;.  Don't listen to them.  You are taking them for the right reasons, and it is unfortunate that many doctors today will not prescribe pain medications out of fear their patients will abuse them.  It is not fair to deny those that truly need them simply because the doctor had those types of patients!

Chronic pain that will not ever go away. I am on 5mg Roxicodone 4 x a day. I DO NOT take that many. This drug works, but is HIGHLY addictive and dangerous.  I take it in extreme moderation because if you take too much for too long you will get addicted and will not be able to live without it. If you are on this drug be very careful and NEVER take more than prescribed. If you become a slave to this drug you will be a slave forever, and when it comes time to come off of it, you wont know what to do with yourself. Take as little as possible and only at time when you really need it. Don't make it a ritual to take it at certain times everyday you will become dependent and need a higher dose ad pretty soon you will loose sight of why you were on this drug in he first place. MODERATION IS KEY!

Roxicodone is great for long-term pain because it does not have the tylenol in it that damages your liver... I will agree that it can make you a little &quot;giddy&quot; and confused sometimes, I've noticed that I just blurt out things the second they pop in my mind. I can drive fine, I only take the 5mg tablets though. One thing I thought was strange, it feels like your heart and/or blood pressure go crazy when you take this medicine and something makes you really mad. I've felt like I was going to pass out before, but it only does that if I'm really mad, no other time. But the side effects are rare and worth the pain relief in my eyes, it has helped me waaay more than hurt me. The main thing I will caution people on, is this is a VERY addictive drug. I have taken vicodin for years and I did not have withdrawls like I did after taking Roxicodone for 2 months. I had to go to the emergency room! Don't run out of these meds if you are used to taking them every day! You will definitely regret it!! It feels like you are dying, literally. Be careful with this medication, it can really help with chronic pain.

Of course with anything that is too good, there is going to be a negative or two.. just make sure you dont abuse them and take them correctly and things should work great! i also take Kadian 200mg in the am and in the pm plus my 6 roxi per day for the break through. I would eventually love to get off of all this stuff, but until then, i will keep on my same regimen.. good luck to all those out there

Pain	dan , 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4		19-24	5/19/2009 8:47:40 AM	Hi, I'd like to start off by telling you I am 22 take this medication for chronic pain (8 herniated and 6 bulging discs from a car accident, football injuries, and working construction for 8 years). I am prescribed 30mg Oxycodone HCL 7x/day and it has been a lifesaver for me. It has changed my life and enabled me to go back to college and it has kept me from bedresting. It almost completely numbs out my pain and I'm not going to lie compared to hydromorphone (dilaudid) it gives me a feeling of euphoria to go with my pain relief. The only downside is the addiction potential that comes with taking the medication for chronic pain. I would only recommend it to people with chronic conditions and only if nothing else works. Side effects for me are constipation and nausea when I first started using the drug. If you are prescribed the drug or are thinking about asking your doctor for it to help with your chronic condition, make sure to get as much info on it as you can and do read the information paper that comes with the prescription at the pharmacy so you know what you are putting in your body. Just remember it is one of the strongest narcotics out there so make sure the benefits (helping you deal with your chronic pain) outweigh the risks (addiction and other health hazards). Good luck with keeping your pain tolerable and I hope this review helped.

I L4 and L5 disks bulging, severe sciatica, and water on my knee. Nothing seems to really help; and since I started the Roxycodone, I have taken to my bed, as standing or sitting causes horrible pain, and I have nausea and lack of appetite. I have been trying to get outdoors to walk a bit, but it only causes more pain.  It just seems that I ampopping pills and feeling generally worse! And I am so depressed due to not being able to do anything!

It is very addicting and if you abuse it it can cause permanent damage or even death.The withdraws are the worst i've ever had and wish i would of never agreed to start on them.Im dependent on them now and cant even get through a day if i dont have them.My advise is if you can get by with a different medication then do it and never start on roxy's. I've personaly seen it ruin many lives.  
Pain	BigT, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	4/4/2009 6:38:37 AM	If i take too much i get alot of itching and it affects my breathing a little. Be very careful if you have allergies or asthma like conditions triggered by stress, allergy episodes or taking too many of these. I recommend to new users to get the 15mg especially when driving. After 6 months you will be use to them and can use the 30mg ones. My biggest cautions to everyone is to watch your respiratory functions and try not to take too many as they are very addictive. I developed a high level of tolerance to them in as short as 6 months. I recommend switching to Dilaudid 8mg tablets for a few months once you feel you have this high tolerance. I also recommend not to take the Oxycontin or Oxycodone ER unless it's 20mg tablets or less as those are twice as addictive and time release. Make sure to eat food since it makes the medicine last longer and be careful driving. My last caution is don't share these with anyone since they can be very harmful and even giving someone 1 pill is a felony!

Pain	singleblonde, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	1/9/2009 2:22:10 AM	i just wanted to say this med is amazing. before i suffered with an extreme amount of pain due to a messed up back going on 15yrs from a car accident..anyway, this is good stuff but there are some drawbacks to this medication as in once you start taking it you can't just feel better and then decide not to take it that day, your body reminds you, that you haven't taken it and it can make you feel really awful. otherwise, this stuff works...by the way, you can be phyiscally addicted w/o being mentally addicted..i think that every person taking this that doesn't abuse the med. is physically addicted and unfortunately there is no way around this..i just wish they could come up with something new that would relieve pain but that you didn't have to depend on even if you're having a good day...

This person also stated and I quote: &quot;it has Heroin in it&quot; which it certainly doesn't. It is a different drug altogether. Herion is closer to morphine,which takes about 1.3 times the amount to do the same job and have the same pain treatment effectiveness as Roxicodone. I just had to add that as I wouldn't want people to believe this error. I am also not trying to be flippant or derogatory towards this person, but as far as I know, we don't use Heroin legally, except in one form of rarely used morphine. But over all this is the most effective pain control drug i've taken, and besides Opana and Fentenyl, I have use just about all others with less effectiveness than Roxi. It's a great drug! I've been taking narcotics for my pain for 10 years straight, and often before that, for the 5-7 years before that in fact.

Neuropathic Pain		5	5	5			6/24/2008 10:46:12 PM	Drug works great as a breakthrough Medication. I'm on Methadone 10mg twice daily and Roxi's up to 8 per day. Both working together is a charm.
Pain	me, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	6/6/2008 8:27:35 PM	The Roxi is different from the generic, the generic I do fine with, but they changed me to the roxi, and they made so very groggy, not to where I go to sleep, but tiredish, groggy, irratable feeling, stomach upset and I would not drive with these in me. I am happy they work well for all you, I wish they did for me, cuz I still have the pain with the generic, maybe I did not give Roxi's enough time to really see if I get better feelings with it? I only took it for one day, but that groggyness was all I could handle was the one day. hmmmm
Pain	Mandy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/24/2008 1:14:26 AM	I have been taking Roxicodone for two years for severe back problems.When I fractured my coccyx my Doc added kadian and I began using the roxicodone for breakthrough pain.kadian 2x day roxi 4x day.I have suffered with heart arrythmias for 5 yrs. however,once I began taking the roxi my rythem improved.I very much believe that the lortab that I took for five years was causing this along with migraines.

This has been the best thing for me. I have noticed that if I take it with food I do not get the side effects of nausea, lightheadedness, and dizziness. I do have to remind everyone that is taking this to keep your doctor informed of side effects, tolerance to your dose (need for more than you were told to take at one time), and if you want/need to stop take this medication. Your doctor can help you with all of these. I take this for breakthrough pain and use a patch for chronic pain. That has kept my dose and need low for both of them. As someone who cares about people and for people, I just want to say READ the handout that comes with this DRUG. DO NOT STOP TAKING IT ABRUPTLY! Doing so can cause withdrawal, which besides being absolutely miserable, can be life threatening depending on how severe it is. If I have not harped on it enough already talk to your doctor and keep him/her in the loop. That's what you pay them all that money for. Make them earn it.

I've tried many differnt meds for acute pain and they seem to do the trick the only time I seem fuzzy is if I take one too soon so that they over lap. Sometimes they seem like they are waring off too soon and then they seem to give you a last kick.

Its an amazing pain killer that helped me through many bad car accidents... However, the cautions are the fact that after about two months use your body becomes addicted to the medication physically, and when you try to come down or off of it. (Remember, it has heroin in it!) Your body goes into a shock and bad withdrawals. Including: Nauseous, diarrhea, cold sweats, body aches as if your bones want to come out of your skin, sleeplessness, and shakes. You want to stay in bed and feel worst than the flu. If this is the case, Suboxone is the &quot;Miracle Drug&quot; I used to get off of Roxies. It takes the withdrawals symptoms away within an hour. I was taking 30mg - 10 to 20 pills a day of Roxis.
