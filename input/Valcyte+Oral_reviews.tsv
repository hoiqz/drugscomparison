Please, report to your Dr. and demand an alternate med if any nerve pain at all!

Cytovene 95-2000 when Valcyte pill came out.  2005 Dr said immune sys stable long enough to go off Valycte- had breakthrough within 30 days. Not as effective since, but helps to slow blindness.  Compny chgd copy from $50 to 25% of cost.  Will seek resources for help.  Will advise if I have to ask Roche for med assistance.  Wondering when patent runs out so can get generic unless they can renew and stop that.  It's a cash cow.   Another economic hardship cause by healthcare system and insurance.  I don't wish either of my illnesses on anyone.  peace up

May try again on a lower dose. It was hard keeping up with required blood work while I was away from home.

I have just begun taking it and was doing research (my pharmacist told me nothing) of this drug, side effects, etc.  was wondering if it helped others (should at the cost..luckily this time I have insurance).  I am just beginning today, so I will post back when I have taken for awhile and know more.  Oh, I am taking it for CMV, for which my IGg levels have been very high for 5 years and the acyclovir not helped.  Iv'e been so sick the last 5 years and so many doctors, i hope this works.  Most drs don't even check for this illness!!
Prevention of CMV Infection Post Kidney Transplant	3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	3-6	6/8/2009 4:53:03 PM	Used this as a liquid med for about 6 weeks after transplant then developed a rash and vomiting, so stopped it. Patient info and all med info I found about this med said that it has not been studied in the pediatric population. Also can react with other anti rejection meds (Cellcept).

I can say that without my health insurance I would not be able to afford this medication.  Market price is about 2500-3000 per month.  With my prescription drug coverage it is only $25.00  I can say that I am lucky in that regard.

HIV+ now for 20 years. Blind in one eye but virus has been controlled since then, now with Valcyte. No serious side effects so far. But the thought of necessary lifelong treatment is sort of depressing.

Other	Jim, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	3	Male	55-64	12/27/2007 9:47:38 PM	lung transplant in 2003, new lung has cmv while I do not.I take one pill a day and so far it has kept me free from the virus. My only concern is the cost of valcyte!!! I am on medicare and myself and others suffer not from the transplants but from the cost of VALCYTE which is why we know of many who have given up the chance to live because of the drug. how sad for our country that a drug that does work is sometimes impossilbe to afford.
