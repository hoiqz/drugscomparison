Pregnancy	blessedmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/6/2012 2:06:04 PM	I was given this vitamin by a fertility specialist, discontinued my old vitamin and started taking it immediately. Conceived naturally, breastfed for over a year &amp; am now pregnant again. I have been taking the vitamin the entire time &amp; love it! I get the DHA without the fishy after taste and no acid-reflux/heartburn from it. And yes, it is easy to swallow. 
Pregnancy	MiracleBaby, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/5/2011 11:39:14 PM	I was given samples of OB Complete at my Gyn's office while I was trying to conceive.  I never had any side effects no matter what time of day I take them; therefore, I requested them once I was pregnant.  I am now 21 weeks pregnant and still taking the same prenatal vitamins.  Easy to swallow too.
Pregnancy	missbeer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/14/2011 2:49:23 PM	I have been taking this pill for three months, and just found out I am 6 weeks pregnant. I never had any side effects, although when i was just taking other vitimins I had nausea. I am glad that this pill works so great, and will continue taking it for the rest of my pregnancy. 
Pregnancy	Dani, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/11/2011 2:07:24 PM	This vitamins were prescribed by my ob gyn but I'm not satisfied with them because have too much iron in it causing me costipation. I tried to counter balance this side effect taking more probiotic (2caps day instead of the regular 1) but still doesn't work. Plus I believe is not made out by real food like other brands and I'd like to get the more real food possible available out there. So I'm switching to perfect prenatal by new chapter available on line and in organic natural stores. They are made by real food and they also have lots of probiotic and veggies in it!

Pregnancy	baby3, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	11/27/2009 11:43:57 AM	Although this prenatal vitamin is great for fatigue, I suspect it was the culprit that caused my bladder infections.  I had never had a bladder infection before and was surprised to find out I had once and then another,etc.  I switched to Ob complete without the DHA and have not had a bladder infection since then.     
Pregnancy	pregomommy2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/5/2009 2:47:47 PM	I've been taking OB Complete with DHA for a while now and have had no issues at all. The company recently came out with OB 400, which contains 400mg of fish oil DHA and is the highest out there right now. It also now has 800 units nof Vitamin D, plus tons of folic acid. I'm now taking OB 400 and absoultely love this pill. It's by far the best prenatal out these because it's one, easy gel coated pill to swallow and the OB 400 now has a vanilla taste, so no fishy taste or after burp to worry about. Insurance covers it too so even better. Highly reccommend this prenatal! Those taking the 2 a day prentals switch to this one &amp; you'll be a lot happier!
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/19/2009 8:30:15 AM	The only issue I seem to have with this is being able to really swallow it (it has come up before). I found the best way to take it is with food, a lot of water and then follwed by something hot like tea.  Though I cannot see to find a way to get the odd fishy taste out of my mouth...
Pregnancy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/12/2009 5:06:44 PM	This vitamin/supplement has been great for me! It helps with the fatigue also! I am more awake and alert thoughout the day. Love it!
Pregnancy	txclairbear, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/22/2009 1:54:20 PM	It's small so it's easy to take.. the first DHA supplement I took was twice the size and tasted like robins eggs. This one is a lot smaller and even those it has fish-oil in it I think it tastes like wheat bread.
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/1/2009 11:11:51 PM	I absolutely love OB Complete DHA!  My doctor had me try a handful of prenatal vitamins and OB Complete DHA was the only one that was smaller in size (all in one pill) and easy to swallow.  Also, it didn't make me nauseous like some of the others b/c it has B-6.  I highly recommend this prenatal to all expectant mothers!
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	7/18/2008 8:37:06 AM	I forgot that this pill has fish oil- everytime i take it i gag. if you can get over the fishyness then your fine-they are gel tablets and easy to swallow, like asprin. 
Pregnancy	Gustavsson, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	5/15/2008 1:58:48 PM	This vitamin worked very well for me; however, it was difficult to swallow, but the food really helped to push it down.  I do have to admit, that this vitamin smells and tastes awful. I do like that it does not upset my stomach or give me headaches like the DuetDHA.  I will continue to take OB complete DHA; the taste i can get past. Just be sure to wash your hands after taking this vitamin because it left an odd smell on my fingers. Overall a good vitamin.
