Stop Smoking	Breynolds, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Male	25-34	8/6/2012 7:29:31 PM	I started Chantix February of 2011 and completed a 3 months trail of the drugs. It definitely help me slow down/stop smoking for a few months, but there are many reasons why I discontinued my use of the drug. First I would like to point out that the urges are somewhat repressed once you stop taking the drug, but they are still there, it's the change of habit that helps you continue to be smoke free. As for the side effects, all taking into consideration there is no history of anger, depression, etc before taking Chantix. I realized after 2-3 weeks I became on edge, intense dreams 1-2 times a week, and over thought everything. Never experience this before in my life, but continued taking the drug. Week 3, I had completely quite smoking beside 1-2 a week while in a bar setting. After taking the drug for 3 months, I decided to stop taking the drug, due to the side effects that were occurring, and simply not being worth it. I had always been the happy go lucky, laid back, care free person, but quickly realized that had all changed. I always seemed on edge, ready to snap at a moments notice, emotions suddenly going from one extreme to another for no reason, not be able to depicted certain dreams from reality, and gaining a since of depression and anxiety. (Again no history prior to taking Chantix) During this time frame I spoke with my doctor about the changes and he stated all of these are common side effects and I should not be worried and they effects should go away once I stop taking the drug. I took his word, and repressed a lot of what I noticed had changed. Now that it has been over a year since I have stopped taking Chantix, I am still dealing with most of the side effects. Talking with my doctor again, the drug can alter some brain receptors and cause long term effects. The effects are not a severe as they were, but the effects of this drug are long lasting. I thought I would post this for others to see, and realize the true side effect.

Stop Smoking	WendyMay, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/30/2012 8:10:46 AM	I am only on my third day of taking Chantix, and already I am smoking less and find myself somewhat disgusted when I do smoke. Tomorrow I switch to .5 twice a day. I expect it will help even further. I plan to take this for 24 months to be sure I do not pick up again. No side effects, except some odd and vivid dreams. I hope switching to .5 twice a day will not increase side effects, but I am determined to get through this. I want to quit smoking sooo badly. Thanks for reading.

I laugh and joke alot with my wife and kids.  This is actually my second day, and the nausua has kept me down a little bit.  Not mentally, just physically.  I believe its because I didnt drink enough water with the pills.  Will adjust that.  Even though its only the second day, my cig. smoking has dropped.  I have smoked less today than yesterday, and I find myself putting them out before I am done with one.  I will monitor that progress.

I smoked for 40 years before using Chantix...Now I'm smoke free! The first time using Chantix I allowed myself only 3 months using the medication. While my smoking was curbed the fact was I still smoked. So I tried again taking it for 6 months. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to stop smoking!

Althogh it did work for me the first time, I assumed I was ready to stop taking the drug after the first month. I relapsed a month later. This time I plan on taking the medication the full three months. I have not smoked in two days and honestly I have little or no cravings. The days prior to stopping all together I was only smoking three to four a day, I feel I smoked those just to smoke not due to cravings. I have experienced a few side effects headaches, nausea, and a few dreams(not nightmares.) I would take all the side effects over and over again if it meant not smoking. Chantix is a life saver I know with the help of chantix I will stop smoking and that is a good feeling!!!!
Stop Smoking	courage to quit, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	6/10/2012 10:49:23 AM	After 15 years of smoking with asthma I decided it was time to quit. I talked my mother into trying Chantix with me; she had been smoking for 30 years.  We set our quit date and started the medication. First thing I noticed was severe nausea if I didn't drink copious amounts of water when taking it. Mom didn't have that problem; hers was horrible gas. We both had vivid dreams but they weren't nighmarish.  We were both able to quit on our quit date and had very little urge to smoke; I think we both slipped one or two times. We stopped taking Chantix at month #2 because we felt like we didn't need it. 8 months later, we both are back smoking (and hiding from the world) So, back on Chantix we went. Side effects were about the same with me; I decided it was the amount of liquid you drink when taking, not the amount of food in your stomach that makes a difference in the nausea. The dreams did not get bad this time either. Mom had the same effects; none of which were bothersome enough to stop the medicine.  This was June 2010 and I haven't had a cigarette since. Mom quit a couple months later for good. I have never felt better. I still have an occasional craving, but it doesn't last long and I'm distracted before it even really sets in. People need to realize that while their bodies are detoxifying, the MAY NOT FEEL GOOD. Look up withdrawal symptoms and you will see that some things you are experiencing are probably NOT caused by the medicine. Its your body healing itself and getting out all those impurities!! Also, mom and I both have depressive tendencies, and take mild medication for it; neither of us had any adverse mental side effects while on Chantix. Hopefully, your insurance will help with the cost (mine didn't the first go around) but even if they don't; call around to the pharmacies, they all have competitive pricing; you can get it for around $ 100; MUCH less than a cigarette habit for a month. Stop taking when you can confidently NOT SMOKE and not before.

SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME TO DRINK LOTS OF WATER WHILE TAKING IT TO AVOID SIDE EFFECTS. I DID THAT AND HAD NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL. I HAD MINOR CRAVINGS, BUT IT WAS EASY TO TALK MYSELF OUT OF IT. I HAD SMOKED FOR OVER 30 YEARS 1 1/2 PACK A DAY. I'VE NOW BEEN SMOKE FREE FOR 2 YEARS. LOVE YOU CHANTIX!!!!
Stop Smoking	Amy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	5/21/2012 2:25:42 PM	This drug has been a life saver, I just don't want them anymore. The only problem I've had is on/off abdominal pain, (which is unfortunatly getting worse on week three, I'm switching to a bland diet today to see if things improve). The weird dreams are less frequent, my mood has actually improved and so has my attention span (I have severe ADD). I find it weird this medicine is actually working like a benificial antidepresant on me. 
Stop Smoking	Trav, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	2	Male	45-54	5/20/2012 1:14:29 PM	I am 46 year-old male and smoked for over 30 years.  I took the Chantix as prescribed for 2 weeks and it stopped the urge to smoke.  But, the side-effects I have are the dreams-some are nightmares that I remember clearly and the worst side effect is a constant massive headache.  I am stopping Chantix after 2 weeks.  It made me feel horrible.  I am a stable person and I would recommend this to others but only if you are not depressed or mentally ill. I only wander what the irreversible effects to my brain are? The nausea and gas were things I could tolerate, but the headache that won't go away and the more than vivid dreams are not for me.  I did quit smoking and I will never smoke again.

I took Chantix for aproximately 6 weeks. I stopped taking it when I realized I had forgotten three doses and had no desire to smoke.I experiernced mild nausea which was relieved by taking the drug with food. Strange dreams occurred occasionally the first three weeks.I smoked for 18 years and tried several times to stop. Cold turkey was always a failure. I did try nicotine patches and Wellbutrin but the cravings for a cigarette never ceased until I used Chantix. My opinion is this medication saved my life.
Stop Smoking	Anners, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/30/2012 8:47:34 PM	I started Chantix a little over a week ago.  I felt like I didn't need a cigarette after only a few days!  It was amazing.  I did keep smoking, but only occasionally until my quit day.  It's been a few days now and I still don't feel the urge to smoke!  It has been tough because smoking is such a part of my routine, but I'm optimistic that'll change.  As far as side effects, my dreams have been normal, no mood swings or depression.  However, I have had some terrible nausea.  I highly, highly recommend eating something substantial before you take a pill.  The nausea is still present for me, but not so bad that I hover over the toilet.  If this is the worst I can expect, I'll be fine.  To be honest, the side effects scared me so much that I put off trying Chantix for months.  Give it a try.  If it bothers you, stop.  But at least give it a chance.
Stop Smoking	WickedWanda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/28/2012 4:54:31 PM	Chantix is the ONLY smoking cessation treatment that has worked for me. This is my second attempt, the first being in 2008. I have been smoke free for two months now and hope this time I can do it for good. Side effects I have experienced are nausea, insomnia, constipation, water retention, weight gain. I will discontinue taking the pills today as I no longer feel I need to take another month supply and really want to get back to normal. 
Stop Smoking	Koby Taylor, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/26/2012 2:00:05 PM	MY wife and i used Chantix to stop smoking.We took it for 2 weeks, then stopped. The pills do take away the desire to smoke. But stopping was still difficult,but we did it with Chantix help. we have been smoke free for 2 months almost. I smoked for 30 years, never thought i would be able to stop. One side effect for me and wife was constipation, we had to get prescription to deal with that, but well worth the extra meds to stop. One key thing to remember, when stopping smoking, the medicine cannot do it all, you HAVE TO WANT TO STOP first.

I continued to smoke for 2 weeks then quit. Haven,t started again for 5 years after a 40 year habit. Only side effect was tremendous intestinal gas the last week of taking Chantix.
Stop Smoking	Happy Camper, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/16/2012 12:46:29 PM	Hello again, I just thought I would come back and update my results with this drug. I am currently on day 7 and it's almost lunch. I haven't touched a cigarette this morning and I have not wanted to at all. I did smoke a few yesterday, maybe 5 total, but I only smoked half of them and then had to put them out. I still don't taste a difference, but I have noticed that the smell of them really bothers me. I also can't stand the smell of my clothes that I have worn while smoking. I mentioned it in my previous post, but there is still absolutely no change in my mood or behavior. If anything, it has improved because I am quitting smoking without the terrible withdrawals that I usually have trying to quit cold turkey. This drug has made me not want to smoke, so I don't crave them, I don't get mean because I &quot;can't&quot; have them, instead I just don't WANT them. My husband is also using Chantix to quit smoking and I believe he smokes more than I do still. He works in an environment where he is able to smoke whenever he wants to, but I am not sure how many he actually smokes a day. Overall, I am very pleased with my results so far. 
Stop Smoking	Happy Camper, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/12/2012 3:14:14 PM	Hi. I'm 26 years old. I have been taking this medicine for 3 days. I have not had any side effects yet after taking this rx. Maybe some of the dreams, but I have always had nightmares. My husband and I are quitting together. We have 3 young children and are ready to stop smoking. I have read a lot of the comments on here and some of them don't make sense to me. You should know the side effects before taking any medicine. I don't know why some are saying they didn't know that this could worsen depression. How did you even find out about this medication? The commercial, right? Have you heard the long list of side effects throughout the entire commercial? MAY INCREASE DEPRESSION AND THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE. I really do not understand. Some people blame the doctors for not checking them out before prescribing it. That is absurd. I went to a nurse practitioner and she ran blood tests and asked plenty of questions before she would prescribe it. The same with my husband. But as far as my husband and I are concerned, we have definitely cut back on smoking. I believe tomorrow will be my quit date. I have had 2 cigs today and have not wanted to finish either one. I put it out before I smoked half of it. It doesn't taste bad, I just don't want it. I'm very sorry to those of you who have experienced the negative side effects. If you are on this site because you are thinking of starting it, please understand prior to taking it that it may negatively affect you. I still will recommend this medication to anyone who is interested, as my friend recommended it to me.

By day 8 (February 9, 2012) I was smoke free. On the NEGATIVE side, the side effects are so scary I've modified my dosage and will quit taking Chantix in about a week.I take Chantix just after eating yogurt. I've never had the nausea. However, my appetite increased and I was gaining (on average) two pounds a week.Hot flashes, feeling light headed, muscle aches, insomnia, lack of energy are all reasons I'm weaning myself off the drug. What scared me the most was what my daughter-in-law called &quot;the homicidal day.&quot; That was the day I lost my temper and went into a rage. Fortunately the only person I hurt was myself. Started lowering the dosage the next day. Here's MY schedule to wean myself off of Chantix if anyone is interested. Remember, this is MY schedule and you may need to modify it for your own needs:If you're taking two pills a day, lower that to ONE pill per day (take the pill in the morning with food if possible). Take ONE pill per day for ONE week. Cut the pills in half and take one HALF pill per day for ONE week. Cut the pills into QUARTERS and take one QUARTER pill for a week. The take one QUARTER pill EVERY OTHER day. Then every three days. See if you can go four days without a pill. From what those in my support group say, you should be able to quit Chantix altogether by then.Chantix is extremely addictive. If you just quit cold turkey you could have withdrawal. Please be careful and talk to your doctor BEFORE you run out of Chantix!

Just felt like I didn't need it any more, I still sometimes want a cig just for the simple fact but I just say no, but still only side effects I had were the dreams, they were all good dreams! But I hope the cravings don't get stronger cause it wouldn't be hard to go get a pack of Marlboro:-) but I'm gonna stay strong....it is what it is
Stop Smoking	VIPeezy, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	2/15/2012 2:41:57 PM	I took Chantix the second time around anticipating I would be a moody person and go through the previous side effects, but more importantly I created my own plan, which may or may not work for you but it was PERFECT for me. I knew that 1-1.5 months in was when I started getting the worse side effects. The first week of using Chantix is the most cruical part in this whole process. You set that date - and the first 7 days go by and you get ready and ready and ready and ready and BOOM by the end of the 7th day you (or I should be saying I ) was so excited for day 8 to be cigarette free! Cigs started tasting so bad by the end of that first week, it completely removed my desire for a  cigarette . The mental obligation I had to smoke a cigarette dissapeared. I changed my environment because I hate being around cigarettes. I can handle it now, but am I sill dreaming? I dont even remember my last but what I do remember is chain smoking 4 ciggerrets on a 20 minute ride to work every morning! I can only Imagine how bad I always smelled! This second chance I gave  Chantix was completely different then the first. I took Chantix as directed for the first couple weeks, took advice off the website, recieved there afternoon call every day at 5pm to check in and after a full week without any ciggarettes I started my wend off plan. After the first week of smoking + chantix, your chantix mg dose increases. After my second week of chantix's normal dose 2mg a day, I cut back .5 mg - therefore 1.5 a day, the following week 1mg, the following week .5mg a day  until nothing. The week after that it was to such an advantage that the desire had  disappeared. It was amazing I avoided the severe side affects and overall reached my goal.            I am so grateful for Chantix, honestly so far I have saved  over 1200$ from not smoking, and I have a long way to go. If it weren't for Chantix I still would be eating tastless food, wasting presious money, and most importlantly killing myself

Had nausia with the morning pill, then I began eating 2 pieces of toast &amp; half glass of milk &amp; waited 20 minutes before taking it &amp; I never had it again. Have had some dreams. I'm on day 36 without smoking &amp; only taking pill once a day.  I admit that I've used an e-cig (0 nicotine) occasionly that has really helped alot. I keep it put away so I don't see it (out of sight, out of mind) &amp; may use it a couple times a day now. If that's the worst thing I do then so be it. It's cheaper &amp; better for me than regular cigs!  So I say if you can live with some side effects for three months to be smoke-free for life, then by all means it's worth it!

First three days of not smoking were the hardest cravings but I don't think I could of do it without chantix! Had a couple cool dreams a lil gas in the morning! And that's bout it! I'm 31 and been smoking for bout 18 yrs. Two weeks ago I was smoking pack to two packs a day! I'm almost convinced that I could stop the meds and be good! But I'll prob finish the third weeks and start taking 1 blue (half in th a.m and half in the p.m) just to wing me off.......sure hope all the bad side effects don't happen to me! But I'm pretty strong minded! I like to control my life!

Stop Smoking	carolynviola, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/30/2012 7:43:29 PM	The first week on Chantix I took 1/2 a pill in the morning and 1/2 a pill at night.  No real ill effects, so I took the medication as perscribed the second week.  As my desire to smoke ceased, I cut way back on the cigarettes and by the end of the third week I stopped smoking.  I had read all the warnings about this drug, so I decided to taper off of the pills in the 4th week and I had no side effects whatsoever.I am a stress patient with Graves disease and high blood pressure.  My adjustment to thyroid medication was traumatic for a full year because of my sensitiviy to very slight adjustments to my chemical imbalance.  Having no adverse effects was very surprising to me, considering all the press about this drug.  From my experience, I seriously considered that the warnings were more suggestive to the patients that tried to quit smoking with Chantix.  I believe I had more adverse mental experience when I tried to quit smoking years ago with the nicotine gum.I believe in cold-turkey with most things, but that didn't work with the smoking.  I am also a recovering alcoholic with 34 years of sobriety thru AA, so I am totally aware of the cold-turkey approach.Chantix helped me reduce the need to smoke.  After quitting for a day or two is when the concept of knowing that I was only 1 smoke away from 1.5 packs a day again.I've been smoke-free for 5 years.  
Stop Smoking	happydog, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	45-54	1/28/2012 8:41:43 PM	This is slightly effective but essentially it is poison. Known and personally experienced side effects are; blisters in the mouth, rash on the body, constant state of ague and exhaustion coupled with waking up every hour and therefore being unable to get a decent nights sleep, change in taste buds responses, sleeplessness, difficulty breathing and swallowing, blistering skin, numbness in the arms and legs, light-headedness, achy muscles and more. This is TOXIC!Did it help me quit smoking? Yes. It helped stifle the craving. But who wants to smoke when you feel like crap due to the side effects of the drug? In fact, who wants to do anything? The manufacturer (Pfizer) has been instructed by the FDA to change the maximum amount of time you take it to 35 days...FROM THEIR RECOMMENDED UP TO 12 WEEKS!!The day after I quit taking it,I was able to breathe and swallow more easily. After 2 days of not taking it my rash began to go away and the aches in my upper torso began to ease. It has now been 3 days and I feel 1000% better than I have for the past 2 weeks. I DID quit smoking. I also HAD to quit, after having experienced throat and neck cancer surgery and treatments from July through September. If I had known how this drug would have made my body react I would not only have completely avoided it, but I know I would have recovered more quickly from the reactions I experienced due to my chemo and radiation treatments.My advice? THROW OUT YOUR CHANTIX and try the patch, hypnosis, nicotine gum...anything you can!Pfizer has been challenged many times over this drug and lawsuits have been filed.Please beware...and good luck quitting...some other way please!
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	1/26/2012 4:14:00 PM	This is probably one of the most dangerous drugs on the market.  It may help a patient to stop smoking but the risk to one's mental health is not worth the price.  I had the most severe reaction to this drug and I know that I am not the only one or they wouldn't list all the possible side effects on the commercials.  Besides the constant nausea and horrible nightmares, this drug put me into the deepest depression, and I have never been depressed.  It completely destroyed my mental health and almost killed me.  It did help me quit smoking but not because it worked as it promised, I just was so motivated to quit on my own because of the horrific side effects because I knew I could never risk taking this poison again.The FDA should be investigated for allowing Pfizer to release this drug to the public.I'm lucky that I am alive today to write this review.

Yes I had some gas problems and constipation but not the whole time but to me its worth it for 3 months to get rid of cigarettes. I feel like I have never smoked. I am so happy and free from that addiction thanks to chantix. I thank God every day that I am delivered from that.

I have had few side effects but none that is worth me not taking it so far. After 40yrs of smoking and now COPD I hope I continue to have success. I have had dreams, gas and nausea but it not out of control. Also ask God for strength.

That was 3 months ago, and I haven't touched a cigarette since.

I really havn't had any side effects.  I was wondering if any one has had Thyroid problems while or after taking chantix? I now have a underactive thyroid don't know if it has anything to do with chantix or not.
Stop Smoking	lifeisgood45, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	12/8/2011 3:35:00 AM	I quit on 10/11/11. I took Chantix 30 days and quit taking because I feared negative side effects.  I only had weird dreams and lack of interest in anything except going to work and coming home while I took Chantix, so I figured it was a small price to pay to be able to finally quit.  I wasn't prepared for what happened AFTER I quit taking it.  I have been quit for 58 days now and have no joy in life, am depressed, cry for no reason, get mad and irate over little insignificant things.  My husband has been so patient, but he finally said, &quot;you're always in a bad mood&quot;.  I feel like I have no control at all over my mood and depression. I manage to function normally at work weirdly enough, but after that I just loose it.  I have never taken any drugs besides prescribed thyroid meds.  I have never had psych issues.  I still am not smoking but it's a miracle.  The disappointment I feel daily makes me want to go back to my old self including smoking if that's what it take to feel normal again. Of course, that will be a last resort.  I am praying daily for God to get me thru this and have faith it will end eventually.  I plan to have a talk with my Dr. at my next appt. in about 2 weeks about these issues.  Good luck to all who are trying to quit and congrats to those who have.  If you haven't used this drug yet, I would recommend you try everything else first.

Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	11/27/2011 12:44:49 PM	I smoked the 1st month I took Chantix and was amazed at the diminished desire to smoke.  I read the side effect warnings but felt good and thought Chantix was a miracle. I quit without a problem the 2nd month.  The dreams were wild beyond belief, but not grim or too scary and I figured a small price to pay to be rid of a 30 year addiction.  I prayed daily for help also. I stopped taking Chantix after 4.5 months.  The depression crept up on me bad!  You don't realize how much of your life gets infiltrated by the effects of the drug.  It has been one week and I am still aware of being down.  I never had suicidal thoughts, but have been unmotivated and feeling some things are too hopeless to change.  I don't regret taking the Chantix and thank God for the help in quitting, but be aware that the depression is more than a possible side effect!

My side effects are gas - tons of gas! A little constipation, and fatigue. I have had a few of the vivid dreams but I consider that the best side effect! The weirdest thing for me is I also haven't had a drink since I started - I used to love wine almost every day and the idea of it sounds gross to me. I'll post further updates after I finish the 30 days, but so far, the benefits far outweigh being a nasty, smelly smoker.

The product definitely decreases my urge to smoke, but I am experiencing terrible side effects. I have severe gastrointestinal problems, I want to sleep all the time, my appetite has increased, and my &quot;taste&quot; and &quot;temperature gauge&quot; are both off. I also am having vivid dreams and experiencing wakefulness during the night. Today I started to wean myself off in the hope that I can stop smoking on my own without taking this drug.

After a pack a day for 10 years, I figured id try this drug since patches/gum didn't help. The side effects severely outweigh the benefits. I had a total mental breakdown with this drug with attempted suicide. Gastrointestinal problems were rather severe and disrupted my daily function. And the agitation and lack of sleep due to extreme lucid dreams/nightmares have caused severe strain on my relationships with friends and family (aiding in the breakdown). I have completely stopped this nightmare of a drug and have had to start taking hearty doses of Valium to get my anxiety, panic, and depression under check. If I knew then what I know now about this drug I would have never ever started it in the first place. Keep in mind that all of these side effects happend all within 3 weeks of taking this drug! Please please try alternative ways of quitting smoking instead of taking this drug. It is not worth the side effects what so ever.

I haven't really even thought about it! Also, i haven't had a single side effect. I will complete my month of pills, but at this point, I absolutely recommend this to everyone! I'm so excited about the money I will save, and years i will add back onto my life!

In 2008 I took the drug for 3 months and have been smoke free for over 3 years now.  I had no bad side effects with the drug, although I had vivid technicolor dreams.  Since I took this drug it is like I have never smoked. I can sit next to someone who smokes and I still don't crave a cigarette.  I have highly recommended this drug to my friends.  My Dr. suggested that since I had smoked for so many years to smoke for 3 weeks rather than the 1 week suggested with the directions and I think that is one of the reasons I had no bad side effects.

I smoked 3 packs a day and planned to retire at age 62, but didn't want to smoke aftr retirement. A friend told me about Chantix , so I went to my dr.,got the pills and on March 2,2007, took the 1st. pill. There were no side effects for me, and haven't smoked since. I would and have recommended Chantix to several friends.It worked for them too. Chantix is the best thing I ever did for myself. It's a great product!!!

Nothing stuck until I took Chantix. The side affects were terrible - joint and muscle pain that I'm STILL feeling, but it did what it's supposed to do ; I quit smoking. Not only did I quit smoking, but I don't even miss it. Both of my parents smoke, and I don't mind being around it.  I like the smell of cigarettes better now than when I smoked... but I still don't want one.It's weird, but it's great. I'm really proud of myself, and despite the side affects I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to quit.A friend of mine took it to quit and said, &quot;I'll never smoke again, so I never have to take Chantix again.&quot;  It's a pretty good analogy.

My husband is a smoker, and having cigarettes around the house was just too tempting for me.  I'm determined to do it this time!  I'm on day 9 and my smoking has cut way back.  My husband has decided to join me and he picks up his prescription today!  Yeah!  The one thing I noticed this time, is the smell of smoke.  After taking my bath the other night, I put on the pajamas I was wearing the night before.  I had to go change because I could smell the smoke in my pajamas.  Last night we went to dinner.  As soon as I walked in the house, I could smell the stench of smoke.  My house smelled like an ashtray!  I hope it's just a side effect of Chantix and my house doesn't really smell that bad to people who come to visit!!  Wish me luck people.

However, the last few days I have been experiencing hallucinations, and really questioning whether some of the things that I have been experiencing are real or not. The nausea and headaches have not subsided, and are getting worse actually. The medication does work, but it's just not for me because of the side effects, and I don't want to continue with it because of what else I may experience. I am going to try the patch and lozenges to finish out my quest in quitting smoking, but so far I am doing quite well.
Stop Smoking	WickettWI, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	7/27/2011 4:34:41 PM	I have been taking this medication for about a week (hence the low star ratings so far) now and I have noticed that the taste of ciagrettes and the cigarette itself is no longer that &quot;satisying&quot; to me anymore. I can already feel the medication working. I do also feel nauseated after smoking. However,I myself, have had some side effects. I have had trouble sleeping, and staying asleep, nausea, headaches, dry mouth, sore throat,dizziness and a little irritability, but I think the mood changes have to do with less nicotine as I have smoked less, and ones body needs to adjust to something being taken aeway that it has had for many years, and I have vivid dreams, not bad ones, but vivid, and some are actually kind of cool. This drug has really worked for a lot of people, so don't let the reviews scare you off. Everyone reacts to medication differently, and I personally do not want to stop taking this med because of what other people say or experience as I know it will work for me. Hopefully some of the side effects will subside, if not I can deal, because quitting smoking is worth more to me and I can deal with an upset stomach and losing a few hours of sleep!
Stop Smoking	Rips241, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	7/26/2011 7:56:03 PM	I decided to give it a try with no prep at all. My mind WASN'T right and all that. I just hoped it worked. A week into it I actually began to miss cigarette breaks. Just forgot to have a smoke. I didn't set a quit date like they say you should. I instead set a slow down to quit date. I would smoke just a few puffs and butt the cigarette for later. The few puffs were enough to satisfy me each time I wanted a cigarette. Before long I was taking only a couple cigarettes to work for the day. Eventually stopping all together. Stopped in my mid 3rd week. No kidding it works to lessen the craving. If you keep busy you won't miss cigarettes. Today, 45 days without a cigarette, I still have the occasional craving. Probably always will but there's no way I'm going back to smoking now. One final tip.. It can make you feel sick. 15 or 20 minutes after taking it you sometimes feel a little sick. It passes quickly though. Sometimes after having a cigarette break you'll feel a little sick. This passes also. Its all worth it and easier than you might think.... Try it.

The first few days, there was some nausea but it went away after the fifth day on the medication.  I didn't have any other problems with the medication.  I STOPPED SMOKING.After completing the treatment, I was smoke-free for almost six months.  Then a &quot;natural and organic&quot; cigarette given me by a friend undid everything.  I started smoking again.Now, I'm back on Chantix.  I will stop smoking again.  This time I will know that I cannot even smoke one cigarette without re-starting the addiction.  I will have to stay a non-smoker for life.  There is no give-and-take; cessation has to be total and unbroken.  I am just glad Chantix makes it so discomfort-free for me.  I also realize that no medicine is safe for everyone, but Chantix works safely for me.  Honestly, that's what I care about, and I'm honestly sad for those who were unable to use this medication.  For those who can use it, it works wonderfully.
Stop Smoking	Gypsy , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	45-54	7/21/2011 4:30:54 PM	Three times is a charm.  My first time was short because I was not ready to quit smoking.  I tested the effectiveness of Chantix by having one cigarette and started smoking again.  The second time, I tested the product again and started smoking again.  This is my third time and I am ready now. I noticed that the product acts more swiftly every time I started using it again.  I have taken the product as prescribed and it really does help to eliminate the cravings.  I remind myself that &quot;I don't do that anymore&quot; when I want to have a cigarette because I am on the phone or in the car.  I remind myself that I have a new lifestyle now, so I think of something else and easily forget that I want the cigarette. My friends and family are a great support system for me and I am working on the weight I am gaining from quitting.  I follow a 1,200 calorie a day eating program and exercise to detox my system of nicotine.  I support Chantix and hope not to smoke ever again, but if I do, I will return to Chantix as my tool.  
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	7/20/2011 1:01:59 PM	I'm in my second go-round of taking this.  The first time I took it was for 3.5 months the way I was supposed to take it.  The only side effect was severe nausea and sleepiness (I missed work a few times having to &quot;sleep it off&quot;).  It worked great for the cravings.  I moved and ended up not keeping up with the pills (every once in a while I would remember to take them), but iI started smoking again a few a day. When I started back in my regular pack-a-day habit  I started back on them regularly but only once a day.  This time around I have been tired, anxious (moreso than usual), angry angry angry (almost hatred towards fiance and family).  My fiance has asked me to give up the Chantix and I'm hoping this will fix it because I do not want to be an unhappy angry person! I will try to quit on my own.
Stop Smoking	Carol, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	65-74	7/20/2011 11:42:03 AM	Chantix swiftly and definitely eliminates the desire to smoke--the few urges for a cigarette one might feel are easily brushed aside. HOWEVER, after three weeks, I had to get off the stuff. Even on a doctor-approved reduced dosage (1/2 mg., 3x day), I suffered from continual low-level nausea and fluctuated between either diarrhea or constipation. I was bloated and extremely gassy. I became unable to sleep through the night; I'd wake up several times each night, drenched in sweat and unable to fall back to sleep for at least an hour; sometimes I couldn't fall asleep again at all. Worst of all--I developed an attitude of crabbiness and impatience that quickly mushroomed into out-and-out senseless hostility toward everyone and everything. In my roles as a mom and at work, I deal with all kinds of situations and people, and my suddenly &quot;bad attitude&quot; was really crippling my ability to do my jobs. In other words, I felt sick all the time, was sleep deprived, and was becoming a real bitch on wheels. I'm happy for people for whom Chantix is a good solution, but I'm not one of them. My advice: prescribers should inform themselves on the possible side effects of this drug and closely monitor their patients. My side effects were bad--if I hadn't decided to quit Chantix on my own, and the hostility had escalated any further, really bad things might have happened. I think I was skating on the edge of psychosis.

I've started taking an antiacid and it seems to help.  Forgot last night and paid for it.  Other than that I'm very satisfied with Chantax.  I'm very happy as I've been a smoker for about 30 years.  I hated the cost of cigarettes, the smell on my clothes, etc.  I have had quite vivid dreams but I've always had strong dreams.  Good luck to us all and I hope anyone who tries to quits succeeds!!

Stop Smoking	Free@58, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	55-64	7/6/2011 12:56:39 PM	First let me say that Chantix DOES work.  If you want to quit and you take the medicine as prescribed, it will be a significant factor in helping you quit.  I quit using Chantix at the 2 month mark, earlier than recommended, because I could not deal with the cumulative side effects.  At the time I quit taking it, I was totally smoke-free for 6 weeks. I am still smoke free.  The side effects I experienced included:  (1) vivid dreams (but not what i would consider nightmares) that did impact my quality of sleep; (2) significant gas, so I had to get creative with excusing myself; (3) moodiness, ranging from lack of interest (mild depression?) to outright intolerance (quick to anger; (4) constipation, which is easy to fix but contributed to my moodiness; (5) weight gain, even when carefully monitoring what goes in my mouth and 50 mins of daily exercise, which also contributed to my moodiness, and (6) nausea, regardless of when I took it.  In the end, it was the nausea and mood swings, coupled with the fear that I was experiencing some level of depression, that caused me to stop taking Chantix.    I experienced minimal withdrawal symptoms, I think, with the most significant being short intense but infrequent. This lasted for about 3-4 days.  My mood is much better, I can focus, but weight is still a problem for me, but I'm working on that too.  And since I do not have my Chantix crutch, my new mantra is &quot;There is no such thing as &quot;just one&quot; (cigarette).&quot;  I do not want to go through quitting again, and having to make a choice about which &quot;aid&quot; to use - I probably would not start with Chantix the next time.  Good luck!

Stop Smoking	Trish, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	7/3/2011 10:06:52 AM	I have been a pack-a-day smoker for 25 years and desperately want to QUIT!  I am considering trying Chantix for the second time although my first experience was NOT a good one, it did help me to quit until I failed and gave in 8 months later.  I know first hand that Chantix WORKS...I'm just not sure that the side effects are worth it.  I was not under a Dr's care when I tried it the first time...I was using someone else's prescription when they decided NOT to use it due to the side effects.  I weined myself onto it as directed on package....but then experienced horrible nightmares...the worst of the worst nightmares...I was attending the funeral of both of my children...it was so vivid and so real that I carried that hurt around with me for days.  Although I had quit smoking for 3 weeks already, after my 5th horrible nightmare I decided to completely stop using Chantix...in fact, I was so discusted with it that I actually picked up the bottle and walked outside and threw it as far into the woods as I could!  I was DONE with it!  This is when the WORST part begins...When I stopped using Chantix cold turkey is when the panic attacks began.  The panic attacks turned into PHYCHOTIC RAGE!  I have never had a panic attack in my life so this was very scary for me.  I would be at work and start to feel very sweaty and uncomforitable not knowing where I was or what I was doing.  They didn't last more than an hour or so but stil was horrible.  The psychotic rage came one day when my son made me angry...I got myself so worked up over something little that I had NO controll over my actions.  This was, by far, the scarriest thing that has ever happened to me!  I knew I was out-of-controll breaking things in the house and screaming at the top of my lungs at my son, but I could NOT controll my anger.  My son sat on the bathroom floor and cried with me until it passed.  I will never forget that experience.  I am still considering trying Chantix again cuz I know it works. Crazy?

But that morning I woke up, and did not smoke.  I finished my pack the night before and I was surprised that I was not full of anxiety and tension and cravings.  To be honest, you just don't want to smoke.  I can't really describe it any other way.  The hardest thing to keep in mind, is that the behavioral habits are the &quot;reminders&quot; that you used to smoke.  When I woke, got in my car, drank coffee, drank alcohol.  Now, I just think, oh yeah, I don't do that anymore.  Side effects were most harsh in the first 3 days and in the first 3 days of the second week.  I think my body is getting used to it though.  I've dealt with major stomach cramps, gas, and the dreams - I can't really complain about those.  They are pretty fun - many of my old schoolmates from 20 years ago are in them.  Today is only day 3 of not smoking, but I feel confident and great.  My mood is just fine too - but I know to keep a look out.

I realized about 10 years ago that I had to quit and as many smokers, tried and failed repeatedly.  I saw the tv ads for Chantix and ended up buying the 1st pack.  After reading the inserts and investigating the drug on the internet, I threw the pack in the garbage.  Several weeks later I spoke to a friend of mine that was diagnosed with lung cancer, she had been a smoker for over 45 years.  My friend told me that she had quit smoking using Chantix with absolutely no side effects.  I purchased another Chantix start pack.  I am thankful that I did not experience any side effects whatsoever.  I ended up buying the 2nd pack and am still smoke free today.  I have to say that the only effort I put forth to actually quit smoking was remembering to take the pills.  After 35 years, I have been smoke free since March 7th, 2011!!

I tryed so many times to quit smoking with other products.  Chantex worked the best. I smoked for 35 years and its great not to smoke anymore.
Stop Smoking	saved, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/10/2011 4:05:36 PM	After 40 years of smoking off and on it was two and as half years ago I made up my mind that i was never going to smoke again. My doc prescribed Chantix for me. I was a little concerned at first but was deseperate to kick the habit. After just two months on this product I stopped smoking and have continued to be smoke free every since. I would advise anyone to take Chantix. I feel that it has saved my life.

I am no longer smoking and don't have the desire to.  Side effects are mild bloating, slight nausea and tiredness.  Vivid dreams - not scary, just weird.  So far no menatl issues beyond whay a typical quitter may experience.  Looking forward to being a non-smoker.  A little discomfort is well worth it.

Feel nausea sometimes...but the other option is much worse...I can live with that for 3 months...no brainer
Stop Smoking	diva1963, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/31/2011 11:32:02 AM	I'm a 47 year old female that has smoked since age 12 (about 1pack/day). My mother died of lung cancer in 2006 (smoker for 40+ years) however nicotine addiction is so powerful that I still was not motivated to quit.  Initially I was afraid to take Chantix because of the side effects but a friend had taken it and he stopped smoking. Very encouraging so I got a prescription and set quit date of 4/4/2011.  Doing fine until I had a glass of wine 4/9/2011 and smoked.  Didn't give up though - chalked it up as an experience and kept it moving.  The side effects were mild for me - lots of gas, vivid dreams, headaches,  troubling sleeping and drowsiness (how you can have both simultaneously is baffling); at any rate I was tobacco free so I figured it's not that bad.  Got really sick when I did not eat enough food - didn't make that mistake again.  After taking it for 30+ days it dawned on me that when you stop taking the drug there was not a &quot;step down&quot; process which I found troubling; the starter pack has a &quot;step up&quot; process.  Contacted Chantix and was told the same thing.  I found this to be alarming so I decided to wean myself off Chantix and pray that I did not begin to smoke.  Started taking 1 pill/day and eventually went to every other day and finally I didn't take it anymore.  It should be noted that the urges to smoke got a wee bit stronger but I had learned good coping skills and did not smoke.  I took a calculated risk and it paid off - I'm tobacco  free and off Chantix.  I would recommend this drug to anyone who wants to stop smoking.  The side effects were mild for me but that is not the case with everyone.

Had a few weird dreams.. have gained a little weight.. but that happens when you quit smoking anyway.  Been quit for 1 month cravings are slight but tolerable.. I was severly addicted (3 packs a day) So far it's working for me.. hope withdrawal works too. (from Chantix that is)

I stopped taking it after 3 weeks, still not smoking but ya have to want to quit anyway, early on it did help with the urges but for all the side effects I had using it, WOW they need to ban this drug!!!
Stop Smoking	Optimistic, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	5/24/2011 1:18:55 PM	I have been taking this product for about a month now. No real cravings for a smoke anymore. The first 1 week I smoked regualrly, but noticed I was cutting back subconciously. The 2nd week I didnt smoke at all until late in the evening when I had a few drinks (maybe 3 cigs with drinks). Then I just stopped all together.I have friends that have successfully quit as well with no problems. So I figured I would give it a shot. I only really get nauseous in the mornings, even if I eat something. But it is not a daily thing, maybe just didn't eat enough with it. I dream now (never did before that I recalled later), but nothing horrible. My attitude, taste and appetite remain the same, and my sleep is fine as well.I read all these reviews and hear stories of the suicidal tendencies and such and laugh. If you have had issues with depression in the past, are not a strong willed and solid minded person THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. I don't believe it creates these issues, I believe if you have them, or had them, they will get worse/return. If you get upset easily, are not humble, think people are against you, get offended easily, hold grudges, etc then don't even bother. Just my opinion but do as you like.Best of luck quitting.

Everything seemed ok until the 3rd week, had gained 10 lbs and was very nervous and then by the middle of the 4th week I thought I was loosing my mind. I quit taking the Chantix and I think the withdraw as worse than the nicotine withdraw. Very depressed. I am now just 4 weeks off the Chantix and my mood and outlook is improving. Smoke free for 55 days but also still get cravings but I do have the will power to say no.  The Chantix was very scary for me. I have never had the kind of mind set I had while taking it.

I am on day &quot;8&quot;, and have very little desire to smoke. I have smoked for about 35 years, and never thought my desire to smoke would diminish. With Chantix, the desire has faded. No crazy side effects so far, just a little upset stomach when I take my pill in the morning, and have been sleeping really well.

I took it for 13 weeks and had to stop so I could sleep. It worked then and have started it again 2 yrs later. Doctor prescribed Lunesta this time. Smoke free at last! I've been smoking for 25 years and tried everything out there available to quit. This is the only medication that worked for me. 
Stop Smoking	Gwen, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/27/2011 4:34:27 PM	In September 2009 my husband and I both began on our Chantix adventure.  I am almost 66 years old and have smoked probably from the age of 12.  I remember dreaming of having a cigarette when I got off the school bus.  Chantix was so easy I can't believe it.  I had tried patches a couple of times just to see if I could quit but I still had nicotine in my system and would take the patch off at night and have a cigarette.  By the time I tried Chantix it was on a fluke because I smoked 2-3 packs a day. A lovely enthusiastic 58-year-old woman who worked at Ace Hardware raved about Chantix and she stopped after 29 years.  The first week when I began the Chantix I smoked less right away.  I did have some personality changes I am told.  When I reported that to my doctor he told me to stop taking it but I just started taking it every other day until I just forgot to take it.  The first month I would tell my husband to leave me 3-4 cigarettes and I might sneak and smoke one cigarette at three intervals during the day until I just threw them all away.  I am stopping!  I did and by end of November 2009 I no longer smoked.  I don't tell anyone that I QUIT smoking, I just say I haven't had a cigarette for a year and a half.  I would still like to have a cigarette.  Every day I would like to have one.  I know that if I picked one up I would be hooked again.  The life saver for me was taking Xanax for anxiety and to sleep at night.  My husband who is a few years younger than me could not stop.  He had sleeping problems and because of his job he could not afford to take sleeping aids or be any thing other than totally alert for his job.  It's unfortunate that our VERY good insurance did not pay for this and I do not understand why because they pay for many other smoking cessation aids. I am more than satisfied with my experience with Chantix and after more than 50 years of smoking, I am now cigarette free.  I did not use a support group other than my husband who is very proud of me.

After 40 plus years of smoking and numerous tries to quit I believe I finally did it! As a nurse of course I knew better but I was addicted. At a friend's suggestion I gave it a try, the desire melted away after about 2 months. The only side effect I experienced was mild nausea after taking the pill. I noticed I was calmer and I had a new lease on life. No more hiding or looking for a spot to smoke!

The side effects for me were weird dreams, swelling of the extremeties and body aches like the flu coming on every afternoon. I never was depressed or moody, and it did take away cravings. The only issue was the habit of when I smoked and trigger of the habit. I quit and only used for a month currently coming off of drug.
Stop Smoking	Seven, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/4/2011 10:50:57 AM	The first week was not so good.  Full of mood swings, and crying.  Now on week 3, and have been 8 days without a cigerette.  I am a social smoker, only with a few drinks.  Never throughout the day, so I wondered if it would actually work for me.  So far so good.  Dreams are vivid, but I sleep like a baby!  Great sleep!  If I take the pill before eating I get nauseated, but with food, I am fine.  I have noticed this week my hands/fingers are aching for no reason.  I am assuming that is from the medicine.  Let's not forget the hunger!!!  I am hungry all the time, and everything tastes GOOD.  Hopefully that will go away once I get off Chantix.  Overall I recommend this, it works.  Everyone I know that has taken it has stopped smoking for good.  Good luck!

They seemed to ease up after about 2 1/2 weeks, and then I missed them in a way.  All and all, it did it's job after the 3rd prscription attempt.  If you think you have smoking beat and stop before finishing the entire cycle you stand a real good chance of relapsing.  I went the entire cycle this last time and am going on 3 months now smoke free.  I still have moments where I feel a craving, but if I busy myself for 3 -5 minutes, it goes away.  I never did have use for their support line...good luck, I feel great!!
Stop Smoking	 Female 	1	1	1	Female		3/28/2011 10:49:04 AM	My sister took chantix and became psychotic. This medication was prescribed by a doctor in Sweden for her; the doctor did not know my sister at all, and was ignorant of her alcoholism.  The drug caused her to become enraged with everyone and everything, even after she stopped taking it. The danger of this drug is dire. My sister has not smoked since taking it, but her personality is forever changed and our relationship has been ruined. BE VERY CAREFUL with this drug. My own doctor refused to give it to me last year, because of its horrific side effects. Don't let Chantix (Champix) ruin your life.

It doesn't even pop into my head. However, it makes me very sick to my stomach. My doctor recommended that I take only 1 of the pills a day, but if I do that, then I want to smoke. My suggestion is to eat something 30 mins before taking it. Despite the feeling of wanting to throw up, I have stopped smoking. I don't even want one anymore ever, and I'm always around other people who smoke, so I smell it daily. IT WORKS if you can deal with the sick feeling.

It caused severe depression and constipation and internal bleeding as a result. Add a large dose of cramps and that's Chantix for me despite it taking the edge off and the desire to smoke somewhat, I don't think I should continue use of it as I am NOT poductive at ALL. COncentration even seriously lacks now as well. I sleep ALOT and have been missingt my college classes due to the pain from cramps. I DO NOT recommend this for anyone but the FULLY physically fit, maybe they can fend off these side effects better than I. I am almost 50.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/20/2011 2:31:08 AM	This is a horrible drug.  I should have listened to one of my friends who is a dr and stayed away.  While my smoking did decrease, my irritability was off the charts.  Week 3 so was my depression.  I cried for 2.5 days AFTER i quit taking the crap.  Evidently it BLOCKED my antidepressant (Lexapro) and ADD meds (Adderall).  that is the only way to explain it.  First we had to adjust my Lexapro (double the original dosage) and then my Adderall (also doubled) and so far so good.  I quit taking the Chantix on 12/5/10.  HORRIBLE depression for a month...then mood swings.  Once we adjusted the meds...i leveled out...but would rather smoke forever..the nausea was there but i didn't care - and it did affect my taste buds...including the taste of cigs...

I had retired and didn't work all those years to hand over my pension to the cigarette company. I got the first month of Chantix and decided this was for me. I had some financial problems and couldn't get the second month but a friends husband had used it to quit and he had about two weeks worth left. He sent it to me and in the next two weeks I was completely off smoking. I won't say it was easy doing it that way but it was very effective. I had no side affects and only slightly craved a cigarette about once a day. I did try one about a month after quitting and found them to be horrible tasting and have never gone back. Chantix is a wonderful crutch to use and it works and works fine. After smoking for so many years I was doubtful I could quit but to do it in 6 weeks was wonderful and easy.Thank you for a product that worksSally Freshwater

I had tried everything that was offered and all they did was slow me down alittle. I had to have a quad-bypass at fifty years old which made me think of trying again. I started Chantix a year later and about 2 weeks into the program I said this was the day for me to not smoke again. It is now 2.5 years later and have not picked up or tempted to have a cigarette since. During the program there were times I wanted one but all I had to do was take a few deep breaths and let it out very slowly (just like taking a drag) and/or to suck on a sugarless cinnamon disk candy (do not chew it). I also had some very vivid  dreams. Most of the dreams were about me cheating and smoking a cigarette - I would panic and had to ask my husband if I did and he would say &quot;no, it was a dream&quot; (thank God).There was no more smoking in the house allowed. My husband and both children smoke (which I blame myself for the children - they are adults now). My husband and son are very supportive - my husband will wash his hands before coming near me (it was like he was smoking a cigarette next to me). My husband is going to try shortly.

I do not know for sure if I would recommend this treatment for others! I have experianced Extreme anger and aggressive behavior. I nearly fly into a rage over the smallest things. I am happy that I have quit smoking but I may lose my marriage as well as other close relationships. I am not sure it was worth the outcome!!! 
Stop Smoking	Swanqueen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	55-64	3/4/2011 11:16:41 AM	I took Chantix for 4 months.  I still smoked but much less.  I thought I could take it for 6 months but my insurance ran out.  The last couple weeks I was taking it I smoked about 3 cigs a day and didn't enjoy it.  When the pills ran out so did the pack of cigarettes.  I was very happy when I went to the store and actually DIDN'T buy another pack.  I don't miss smoking but I still think about it.  I had no bad side affects but it was hard for me to remember to take two pills a day and with a full stomach.  So I missed quite a few doses or took them on an empty stomach... not a good thing.  Now I am only 1 week completely smoke free.  Probably about a month of less than 5 cigarettes a day.  I am starting to think of myself as a non-smoker.  I like that.
Stop Smoking	moxiesma, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/1/2011 6:08:20 PM	I'm only on day 9 and have no cigarette cravings. Dreams, yes, nightmares, no.  I find myself in need of consuming lots of water. I'm sleeping fine and experiencing no mood changes. I was happy to find out my insurance paid for Chantix and the coupon on the website paid for my co-pay. I would recommend this drug to anyone who seriously wants to refrain from smoking.
Stop Smoking	Lisa79, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/28/2011 3:32:09 PM	I started Chantix 2/6 and had my last cigarette on 2/14. I have taken Chantix twice before, but only for 4 weeks each time b/c my insurance at the time didn't cover it. I felt fine after 4 weeks and didn't think I needed to take it any longer. Soon enough the cravings came back and I began to smoke regularly. This time my insurance covers the pills and I have committed to the 12 weeks regardless if I don't think I need it. FYI, there is a $40 off coupon on the Chantix site that is available to print for a limited time, but is good through March 2011 I believe. I have smoked since I was 13 and I am now 31. In regards to side effects, I experience a bit of nausea for about 20 minutes after my morning pill, constipation here and there, and longer more vivid dreams (not scary). I dont have the same nausea with my evening pill when I usually have more than a full stomach! I have not had any of the anxiety, panic, bad thoughts, or rage as other people have had. Here's the deal, your body is still withdrawing from nicotine...if you look up the effects of quitting cold turkey, you will see irritability, rage, mood swings, cold sweats, etc just like some people experience on Chantix, but I guess it is easier to assume the drug is causing the side effects. I don't doubt there are some undesirable side effects, but I know a few people that have tried Chantix and say &quot;It didn't work&quot; or &quot;I had bad dreams&quot; and my response is that the receptors in your brain are blocked so you are smoking out of habit and still have to say no to the cigarette. If you are having bad dreams, those dreams are temporary and sure beat the feelings your family will have when they are burying you due to your addiction to cigarettes. I actually feel like I am being a nicer person now b/c I am forcing myself to deal with situations differently as getting angry and having a cigarette is not an option. Take a deep breath and ask yourself if it is really worth getting upset over...probably not. Good luck!! 
Stop Smoking	Ms.Kia,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		2/17/2011 6:43:51 AM	Oh my this pill is not a the scary experience others made it out to be. just like anything else its your attitude that dictates what happens.  I had mood swings I only gained 3 pounds (but I ate what I wanted just kept active) I had strange dreams, I had mood swings because i just broke up with my best friend for over 23years.  No matter what that Ciggerate was always there so the loss was huge at first. I just pushed through broke up with my boyfriend alot and just felt what i was feeling.  I am on the other end of things now and do NOT regret my choice.  I tried so many times to quit and this is the only time I feel like I am done! oh did i mention that i had to pay for these pills beccause my insurance did not cover?  178 a month also a good motivator its the same amount for ciggerates in a month. But guess who doesn't have to buy either this month?  ME!! and I smell so good just in time for my grandkids! But like I said it is up to you!!!! Good luck. and hang in there its soo worth it!

Stop Smoking	tallsweetdee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/11/2011 4:36:40 PM	It's been 47 weeks since I had a cigarette, and I smoked for 34 years! I tried Chantix once before. It didn't work, but I don't think I gave it a fair chance. I really wanted to quit this time, which helped tremendously, but I couldn't have done it without the Chantix and the support of my family, friends and my doctor. By the 4th or 5th day on Chantix, the cigarettes started to taste bad and I wasn't enjoying them. So for the first few weeks, my memories of cigarettes weren't good, which made me not want to smoke one. The only real side effect I had was the dreams, but they were very vivid, wonderful, colorful dreams. My parents were young again and we traveled together. I do miss the dreams. I still crave a cigarette but the cravings are brief and getting further and further apart. I still cannot believe I've made it almost a year. I never, ever, ever thought I could do it!
Stop Smoking	pixiedust, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	2/10/2011 2:13:48 PM	Chantix almost made me lose my mind. Yes, it reduced my desire to smoke, but I was so angry I was almost in a rage. Everything made me angry, the phone would ring and I would want to throw it across the room, the dog would bark, I would feel like kicking him (and I have never harmed an animal) I was spending most of the day with my fists clenched feeling like I wanted to hurt someone. I quit taking it after about 3 weeks. I didn't try to stop smoking again until recently when a friend introduced me to electronic cigarettes, after trying it, I quit regular cigarettes completely and didn't feel like I was going crazy
Stop Smoking	diane, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/9/2011 7:03:49 PM	I have tried EVERYTHING before without success. Now on my 20th smoke-free day after 35 years of smoking. I waited until 2 weeks of Chantix before my quit date, think that helped me. I tried it before after 1 week, and failed on first day. I still occasionally think about getting a smoke, but it passes quickly. Yeah for me!!!

Little nausea right after taking for about 15 minutes.  Cravings for smoking sometimes occure you gotta have some will power. Gums are very sensitive,  I cant find that as a symtom but I will check with dentist.
Stop Smoking	Pool_isCool, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/31/2011 7:34:30 AM	First for anyone to be totally successful you need to want to quit. No mystery drug will make you a non smoker. Chantix blocks the pleasure sensor in your brain from the nicotine you smoke. Eventually you can smoke a pack and not get pleasure from it. I saw things out of the corner of my eye that wasn't there. I did sleep good though, continued after I put the cigerettes down to take the drug for an additional week. I am now up on 4 years without a smoke. Nicotine replacement drugs just give you nicotine in a different form they don't address the nicotine addiction. I was addicted and am now cured. I still think about a Cigerette from time to time but I smoked for over 30 years. I wanted to quit and won't start again. That is your first choice you must want to quit deep down inside other wise you can not be successful.  Side not I had to quit Drinking beer as it goes hand in hand with smoking. I can drink beer today without an issue.
Stop Smoking	Smokey, 35-44 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	35-44	1/28/2011 11:12:06 AM	It really does help the smoking craving. I get bad headaches and sometimes stomach aches. I thought the wild dreams were fun but sometimes disturbing. During very high stress I feel very violent, homicidal, and suicidal and wonder if i will snap. Being a rational person I don't act on that impulse but need to vent somehow. I recommend lots of exercise to focus your aggression and take your mind off smoking. I am cutting back on the dose to 1mg a day. I have to quit smoking and feel this product will make most people successful. 
Stop Smoking	YouCanDoItWithoutChantix, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	1/27/2011 2:15:57 PM	I started taking Chantix and everything was great the 1st week, but after 3 week, I had swelling and deep purple bruising in my lips and SEVERE anxiety became an issue. I have never had anxiety or panic attacks before. My PCP told me to stop taking the Chantix immediately, and I did. It's now been 2 weeks since I've stopped the Chantix, I am back to smoking (less than before but still smoking) and I am on Prozac and Xanax (never needed that ebfore either) for the SEVERE panic attacks and anxiety that I'm having just trying to do daily activities like drive to work, take a shower or brush my teeth. Chantix may work for some, but the negative effects of that medicine has made my life miserable. I can't stand to be near people, wear a seatbelt or even in the worse case actually swallow water. I feel like I'm goinig to stop die, I can't speak, I can't breathe and I completely panic. I ahve smoked for 17 years (I'm 32) and I will keep smoking IF this is what I have to deal with in order to quit. It's not worth it. It actually got bad enough to the point that I even considered doing something &quot;final&quot; and &quot;everlasting&quot; in order to stop the panic. That is no way to live when you have a 10 yr old who depends on you. I WOULD NEVER SUGGEST THE MEDICINE TO ANYONE! My PCP said the only side effect would be upset stomach. Now I can't even stand to wear a winter coat because I feel constricted. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO QUIT, MAKE IT UP IN YOUR MIND THAT YOU WANT TO QUIT AND DON'T LET THE CIGARETTES WIN, YOU ARE STRONGER THAN ANY CIGARETTE!!!!!! I know it's hard but the Chantix did not take away the urge for wanting to smoke for me, I just had to say to myself NO, don't so it. And look what it got me....on Prozac and Xanax in order to make through a day.
Stop Smoking	cakey1953, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	1/26/2011 9:05:17 PM	In the first few days it made me feel nauseous, but I stopped taking it on an empty stomach, and the nausea went away. My cravings haven't been nearly as intense as they would have been without this drug. I have tried quitting cold turkey many times, but hated how I felt. Chantix makes me almost forget about cigarettes. I have had no wierd dreams or any other side effects at all. I have felt a bit gassier, but I think that is because I have been eating more fruits and vegetables lately. I am on day 7of my Chantix, and each day is better than the one before.
Stop Smoking	cbragg, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/25/2011 4:34:24 PM	I have been using Chantix for 3 days now and have been smoking since I was 17 years old and am now 25, I have a three year old daughter and decided I needed to quit for her, I was smoking a pack a day and am already down to about 3 cigarettes a day. This medication really helps with the urge to want to go outside and take a smoke break, the only side effect I have had thus far is gas, and an upset stomach if I don't eat before I take the medication. My quit date is set for Friday and I am really looking forward to it, if things keep going the way they do I think I may quit sooner because I have no need or want for a cigarette anymore. Good luck to everyone out there who is trying Chantix or wants to try it, and REMEMBER: medication reacts to EVERYONE differently, not everyone will have the same side-effects, I figure if I can handle the gas, upset stomach, vivid dreams, and tiredness than I will take that over lung cancer or dying early anyday! Good luck again to everyone! :)

I started Chantix and by day 6 I had almost quit, by day 8 I was done and have not smoked a ciggerette yet and it has been 2 months. The side affects are easy to manage and I am thrilled with this medication.

Stop Smoking	 on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5			1/21/2011 12:49:01 PM	I am nearing the end of my second week of Chantix now, I have been smoke free for about 6 days and I'm quite pleased with this medication so far. I have had very mild side effects such as gas, irritability, dry mouth, and vivid dreams. These side effects are more than manageable. I have had a few urges to smoke the last couple of days but they are so mellow and go away in a matter of minutes.About 3 days ago I had a hard time falling asleep but it was only for one night and it was only because my body was adjusting to the medication. I smoked a pack a day for 22 years. You really do have to have the desire to quit smoking, people need to stop thinking about it as &quot;I've got to stop smoking&quot; and start thinking about it as &quot;I want to stop smoking&quot;. Cause let's be honest, smoking does'nt do a damn thing for you, it does'nt relax you, it does'nt make you life any better. Don't listen to the bad things you've heard about Chantix, true it does not work for everyone, but try it for yourself and have your own experience with it, otherwise your just looking for reasons to keep smoking.
Stop Smoking		5	5	5			1/16/2011 11:35:23 PM	I just started my second week on Chantix, I am currently at the maximum dose required. Chantix has been amazing for me so far. I was suppose to quit on Sunday, Jan. 16th but decided to quit on the 15th instead because I ran out of smokes. The urges are all gone now, I have not had any major side effects, I have'nt even gotten nausuas from it, but I also make sure that I eat a full meal and a glass of water when taking it. I have been getting some weird dreams but nothing bad, their actually kind of cool, I can remember dreams from 3 days ago they are that vivid. I smoked for 22 years, I'm 35, I started when I was 13, hell I was'nt even in the 8th grade yet. I just hope that this little miracle pill continues to work well for me, so far it is saving my life, thank you, Chantix.

Stop Smoking	KristinHonan,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		1/4/2011 3:52:56 PM	I smoked for 15 years and took chantix because there was no way I was going to quit cold turkey. Within a week, I went from smoking 20 cigarettes a day to abour 4 or 5. The second week, I had the mentality that I still NEEDED to smoke so I kept buying them, even though they tasted disgusting. One day, I decided not to buy any more and that day was Jan 20th, 2009. I have not had a craving, or smoked since that day.The side affects were minimul such as:-weird and vivid dreams, but not heart stopping or nightmares- i tossed and turned alot in my sleep- I was irritable during the 3rd week. I don't know if I can blame it on Chantix or the overall withdrawl of not smoking.- skin irritation on my right palm - I developed a rash which needed topical medicine. As soon as I stopped taking chantix, it cleared up. I have my taste senses back! I no longer have to oversalt my food and to me, that is beneficial. I would recommend Chantix to anyone that is trying to quit smoking because it really DOES work.

The only side effects I had were some very entertaining dreams.Chantix is the best aid available, but it doesn't make you quit.  You have to make it happen by using all the tools available - online free help (quitnet.com), deep breathing, exercise, lots of water, and education.  Learn about N.O.P.E. - not one puff ever.  Learn about PAWS and how nicotine changes how your brain controls dopamine, hormones and acetylcholine.Quitting is hard, but dealing with the effects of years of smoking is so much harder.
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	1/1/2011 10:05:25 PM	I did the starter pack then the 1mg continuing pack and found 1mg 2x's a day was too strong a dosage and gave up. The next time I tried I requested just the .5mg tabs of which I would take one at about 7am and another around 3pm. I was almost there then to find our my doctor only prescribed .5mg for once a day and would not give me more at that dosage but wanted to prescribe the 1mg continuing pack. This means I would have to start cutting the pills. I will look for another doctor and keep trying. I really believe the smaller dosage 2x's a day will work for me.

For me, this has been a miracle drug.  I can't count the number of times I've tried to quit smoking.It took a little more than 2 weeks for the Chantix to 'kick in'.  I know the packet says to quit on day 7, but we (friend and I) were still having bad withdrawal symptoms on day 7, so we continued to smoke. We were reading the comments of other users and found that sometimes it took several weeks to start working on some people. After about 14-17 days on Chantix, the urge to smoke was drastically reduced to the point where we were only having occasional smokes and not enjoying them, so we finally quit.  This drug eases withdrawal symptoms so much that I was actually able to go out and have a drink and a meal without even thinking about having a smoke. What a sense of freedom!One side effect was nausea for about an hour or so after taking the pill. The nausea can be lessened by eating a light meal or snack before taking your pill.  The nausea decreases over time. Lots of flatulence that, unfortunately, did not respond to anti-gas pills.  The flatulence took a long time to go away -- about 5 to 6 weeks -- but it did finally go away.A bit into week #2 dreams became more vivid and memorable.  Actually, they were quite amusing and entertaining.  No nightmares.  We have no history of mental illness nor mood disorders, and Chantix did NOT cause any depression or mood swings or strange behaviors for either of us.  No sleep problems, either.The biggest drawback, aside from the flatulence, is the fact that not smoking has slowed metabolism and, despite trying to be careful, we have packed on 5-10 pounds.  If only Pharma had a solution for that side effect.  :-)[No, food does not taste any better than it ever has, so we can't blame it on the urban legend that food tastes better when you're no longer smoking.]

This raises the question of whether (Chantix) is suitable for use in the military, by police and others who are already in stress situations. One key characteristic of these events is uncontrollable rage. Not a good side effect for people paid to carry guns.I want this drug off the market. It is only a substitute for nicotine with more dangerous withdrawal. Sure it may help some people but what about the ones who end up taking lives as a result of taking a pill? Where has the neuroethics of prescription drugs taken us?
Stop Smoking	deckhandmav, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	12/29/2010 4:12:38 AM	I took Chantix a couple years ago and was able to quit almost immediately.  It blocks the effects of nicotine and allows you to see smoking for what it is: gross.  After about 4-5 months of being off the Chantix, I had a relapse.  17 months later, even though I didn't want to quit again, I knew I had to, so I started the Chantix again.  Like before, it started to work almost immediately.  I also noticed that the nausea symptoms are not as severe as when I used it the first time.  After your body gets used to the side effects, it's permanent, so if you're scared of taking Chantix a second time because of the side effects, don't worry--your body will remember.  The emotional side effects--ie mood swings, anger, bitterness, jealousy, hopelessness, loss of motivation, general idleness, strange dreams, etc.--I can say with confidence are from nicotine withdrawal and not the Chantix as I experienced them when I tried quitting cold turkey as well.  They persisted long after I took the Chantix and, to a certain extent, continued after I started smoking again (not the cure-all you imagine when you have cravings)!  This time around, I've found that regular exercise and self-affirmation are key and I hope not to make the same mistake I did before.  Bottom line: the side effects of Chantix are nothing compared to the effects of nicotine withdrawal in general.  Taking Chantix is a great way to get started, but don't forget that you will have to deal also with nicotine withdrawal for a year or two or three.  But it will be worth it and you will learn to solve your emotional problems without the aid of nicotine or other drugs.
Stop Smoking	JWC, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	3	Male	45-54	12/26/2010 2:04:09 PM	After 7 days on the medication I quit smoking and it's been 2 months since I had my last cigarette. It worked great for quitting, however I'm not sure the side affects are worth it. On my second week of taking the medication, I wasn't able to sleep, waking up at least once an hour, and I couldn't keep focus on anything. By week 3, my emotionalal state was all over the place. I would be laughing one minute and then crying the next. I started seeing a therapist because I thought I was loosing my mind. The anxiety attacks were scary. One night I was having suicidal and homocidal thoughts and that's when I realized that it had to be the medication that was causing this. I stopped taking the chantix 3 weeks ago. I still can't sleep thru the night and I continue to get minor anxiety attacks. My advise, if you are taking chantix, please have someone you see on a daily basis monitor you and your behavior. Thank god I still had my senses to realize that it was the medication that was driving me crazy.

I was out drinking one night and made the stupid mistake of having a smoke.  The next day I was again a pack a day smoker.  I then smoked again for a year and a half.  Dissapointed in myself for starting up again I went and got another script for the drug.  Yes the dreams are vivid, very vivid.  However, I will take that as a trade off to quit again, and have.  The thing is, is that once your body gets introduced to nicotine, it becomes accustomed to it.  I have tried to quit cold turkey and and the side effects coincide with that.  This drug eliminates many of the side effects.  However, initially taking the drug I find myself smoking more because apparently I am not getting my nicotine fix.  After a couple of weeks though the urge to smoke is only a habbit that needs to be broken.
Stop Smoking	blr0408, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/3/2010 4:08:01 PM	I smoked for 15 years and thought quitting would be impossible.  I used the Chantix for five months and found it very helpful.  I only took half the daily dosage (1 pill cut in half instead of 2 per day).  The side effects were too intense for 2 pills a day.  I did experience crazy dreams but was ok with the side effects once I lowered the dosage.  I haven't smoked in over 6 months and that is partly due to the Chantix.  I did attend a smoking cessation class and other support groups which were hugely helpful.  I am honestly starting to feel like a nonsmoker and would recommend Chantix.  The side effects can be minimized if you work with your doctor on dosing.

I have had no side effects whatsoever like nausea, dreams, depression. It has killed the urge to smoke so far. I am also using the 12 step reinforcement concept of &quot;one day at a time&quot;. I've thought about quitting a million times, this time I actually did it, and I tell everyone I know to keep building my support group. But the Chantix has been wonderful in eliminating the urge and helping reduce the nicotine withdrawal symptoms.
Stop Smoking	Gert, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Male	25-34	11/27/2010 6:52:13 PM	The drug worked wonderfully in making me quit smoking, but the side effects...Starting week 1 using the 0.5mg chantix oral tab was fine, but now at the end of week 3, I feel horrible. I have one more week worth of the 1.0mg tabs. I have NEVER had a reaction to any drugs whether this side of the law or not.  That said, my side effects with chantix include:- lack of appetite- change in palate- nausea- Diarrhea (week2-to present and also the WORST cases ever in my life)- intense thirst/dry mouth- flu like symptoms- debilitating muscle pains (neck)- muscle pains (back &amp; forearms)- random sweats &amp; shivers- dry skin - increased acid reflux- labored breathing- irascibility (w/disturbing malefic thoughts)- dizziness- mental stuporI don't discount the possibility of nicotine withdrawl, or compounding effects of symtpoms bringing on others (i.e. diarrhea can = dry mouth), but from my previous &quot;cold turkey&quot; attempts to quit smoking, I know I only experienced irascibility absent of the thoughts.I have only been able to stomach roughly 2000 calories in 3 days... lest muscle atrophy begins, and side effects increase, I am discontinuing my chantix use.   I hope this information was beneficial somewhere for someone.    
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	2	4	1	Female	45-54	11/17/2010 11:00:46 PM	So disappointed. My reaction to Chantix was negative. I looking forward to becoming a non smoker. My husband and I started Chantix together. After a few days I was not my perky self, after a week everything was bothering me. I was told &quot;stay aware that I could have some mood swings&quot; so I paid attention. By day 8 I was becoming reactive to things that normally would not bothering me enough for a reaction. Day 10 my emotions were on sensative overload. Anger, sadness, frustration and irritability took over. I know people who have had success. At first I said I'de stick it out, once I was done with the meds I knew the side effects would pass and I would be back to myself. The last day my mood scared me. I felt I had no control over my emotions and that is not my personality. Maybe I will try again one day or try another alternative. I am 1 in few. The odds are in favor of Chantix and I am in Favor of Chantix. I am one of the unfortunate ones whom the medication doesn't agree with. :-(((

I am now on day 48 of not smoking. I am only taking the Chantrix now every other day. The only question I have is just how long does the drug stay in your system. I am trying to ease off the chantix. I am very happy with how well it worked for me.

The first week you can still smoke but by the end of that week, I just didn't get anything out of it. Im having some wild dreams, and some very sexual :) I still have craving but they are manageable. First two days on week two I had a couple of crying spells but no more. Im so glad Im doing this for myself! Good luck
Stop Smoking	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/4/2010 8:07:35 PM	I never thought I would be able to quit.  Today is 1 year without smoking for me - a minor miracle!!  I know that there are potential side effects and, of course, a person should have discussions and be in contact with their doctor throughout the process.  That is true with ANY drug and that is what Chantix is - a drug.  When my doctor first suggested it and gave me a script, I did not have it filled for over a month.  Ya see I came to the internet and read all the &quot;horror stoiries&quot; and it scared the hell out of me!!  When I finally decided to try it, the side effects (for me) were minor.  Occasional constipation and upset stomach if I forgot and took it on an empty stomach.  I had some vivid dreams but it was actually a bonus as I normally do not rememjber dreams.Bottom line for me is that Chantix is not magic.  I have to participate in the process.  I have had to make some significant life changes.  I now run 4 miles most days and have lost about 40 lbs.  I even go to some nic anon meetings on-line.  For me, Chantix was a great starting point and I would recommend it as long as it is under doctors supervision.
Stop Smoking	Chris, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Male	35-44	10/26/2010 8:58:01 PM	Personally I have mixed feelings about this drug. While I was taking it I felt absolutely fantastic and didn't want to smoke at all. I was in a great mood all the time and actually quit caffiene at the time as well and didn't have any of the previous withdrawal symptoms. The problems started after I stopped taking it. The day after stopping it I became violently ill and two days later I suffered a dissociative panic attack (I didn't know what it was at the time. I just thought I was dying). The next three weeks I felt normal, then suffered another large panic attack but this time the anxiety stayed. For the next week straight I always felt anxious, kind of like I was falling, and had to keep my mind occupied to keep from getting ill. I went to a doctor who told me I was having panic attacks and general anxiety and was prescribed my another drug to control it. I'd never had any issues like this in the past and had always been the headstong person others came to to help solve their problems. Now I take Citalopram (30mg) daily to help keep things under control and Xanax as needed when things get out of control. Fortunately, I've been able to function somewhat normally but it's been 20 months since I quit taking it and I still have panice attacks occassionaly. Before taking this drug, be sure to ask your doctor lots of questions about side effects and potential problems. I assumed side effects went away when you stop taking a drug. I founf out the hard way that's not true at all as mine didn't start until I stopped taking the drug. Also, if you have any family history of anxiety (social or otherwise), panic, or depression issues, I would NOT recommend taking this drug.

Stop Smoking	Believer, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/19/2010 12:42:36 PM	My wife and I started this at the same time. Took it for a month before we even tried to reduced the amount of cigarettes per day. After a month we didn't feel any physical &quot;buzz&quot; from the nicotine so we knew all that remained was the psychological addiction. Within another couple of weeks we tapered off to zero cigs. We have been smoke free for over 2 1/2 years now. Chantix does affect your brain chemistry. With other tries at quitting the craving never went away resulting in a return to smoking. With Chantix there is virtually no craving remaining. Fresh tobacco smoke still smells good, unlike stale smoke, but it does not trigger any significant craving. Did have minor side effects: vivid dreams (technicolor and humorous); need to take on a full stomach to avoid cramps; gas (not smelly just noisy and at surprising times. We have friends who've also used Chantix. Out of the six of us, 5 have remained smoke free for over 2 years. I think this is one drug for which the manufacturer deserves to make as much profit as they are. After all, it costs less than the tobacco it replaces and after a couple of months it starts to save you a ton of $. P.S. I smoked for 35 years the last ten at over 2 packs per day.

But I am having trouble breathing, I am always short of breath.  My doctor said it is anxiety due to depression caused by the chantix. So I stopped taking it.  Still smoke free, Chantix gave me a good start to bad I had to give it up, but I still not smoking. I think this side affect was to dangerous and it scared me
Stop Smoking	Nubian, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/15/2010 10:45:02 AM	This is a little miracle pill. I took it for 10 days (smoke free) and I have not taken it in the last 15 days still smoke free Plus Chantix free. You have to want to have the will to try and Chantix will get you over the first few days of withdrawal. Then it seemed to work similar to a Paxil with small mood changes and huge sexual side affects, so I stopped taking it myself. I have smoked for 20 years and did not think it was going to work but it has. I did not experience any nightmares or nausea. I will continue my quit because I also started eating better and exercising.  I am also reading Quitting for Dummies Book.   My husband is a diabetic has been on Chantix for 2 months smoke free but he has complained of nausea. My review is give this one a try, I have also tried the patch and gum this has no nicotine, you owe it to yourself.  I thank GOD for Chantix everyday because I can breathe like never before!

The first couple of weeks, I felt this was a miracle pill, I could never see myself not being a smoker.  At week 7-9, my co-workers, husband, and friends noticed a difference in me (confused alot, sad, fuzzy, and not me)and told me to stop.  I stopped at the ninth week and that's when all hell broke loose.  I don't know if it was the build up of the drug or the stopping but I uncontrollably cried for a week and a half.  I almost put my self in the hospital.  I did have suicidal thoughts but never admitted that to anyone for fear of being locked up somewhere.  But the pain of the depression and complete helplessness made me want to drive off a cliff to make it go away.  I know everyone reacts different to medication but please, it is NOT worth it.  Still depressed and extremely anxious.  Waiting to be normal again but i have hopes it will happen now when as before I thought I'd never be normal again.  Been out of work for 2 and a half weeks trying to get better.  Please don't use Chantix.

I have never wanted to stop smoking or ever tried to stop before. Honestly I just thought I'd give this a try to please my 12 yr old son who has been begging me to stop. I was a smoker for 21+yrs and am proud to say that I have not had 1 cigarette in over a month now. The only side effect I had was some pretty bad nausea once I started taking the 1mg pills in the morning and night. It did get better with a small meal, and went away completely in 4 or 5 days. Totally worth it if you ask me. Coming from someone who didn't truely want to stop smoking, this stuff works.

Stop Smoking	disappointed, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	10/10/2010 3:45:41 PM	I took Chantix for 4 1/2 days before my Dr. told me to stop taking it ( I would have stopped anyway).  By the second day, I was a little tired but didn't contribute it to the Chantix.  Each day the tiredness got a little worse until the 4th day.  That's when I was stuck in bed, sleeping all day and so dizzy I could barely see straight.  I've been off the Chantix for 4 full days now and I'm still sleeping 12 hrs a night, am so dizzy I wouldn't think of driving and I just sit around all day in a fog. Honestly, I cannot live like this.  I will be calling my Dr. again tomorrow.  Something has to be done about this dizziness as I can't function.  I really wish this would have worked for me.  It worked for my mom, who smoked for 45 yrs.  She didn't have any problems other than nausea and vivid dreams.  It works for many people but not for me.  If I had known that if I experienced nasty side effects, they might not go away after stopping this drug, I never would have tried it.

Chantix is the best thing out there by farrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I heard all these bad things about Chantix. First off I did not have 1 crazy dream and I mean not 1! Nor did it make me &quot; crazy &quot; I think the people that go crazy on it are already a few screws short and are on other types of meds for mental problems I am not being mean just mean they are mixing too many meds together. And I took Chantix on a empty tummy many times in the 6 months I was on it and did not make me sick not once. Just give it a chance it worked for me.

I started smoking at 16 so I've smoked for 20 years. That's a long time and this is the hardest thing to do. The key is to keep busy... Good luck with everyone trying!!! we can do this and hopefully our children want pick up this nasty habit.

I have experienced some side effects, stomach pain and nausea (but not as long as eat something before hand, which I learned VERY quickly!), and unusual dreams.  No nightmares, humorous entertaining, strange dreams.  Completely different from what I am used to.  No insomnia, no headaches (I also usually get horrible tension headaches a few times a week) THEY ARE GONE!  I'm on week 6 now, and I still have about 3 cigarettes a day, but I don't have cravings for them, it's just out of boredom usually.  Even when I've been out drinking, I'm not smoking. Myself and others have noticed I'm in a better mood, (and I'm not normally a &quot;happy&quot; person). I have seen nothing about this, but I am curious if this has happened for others, but my sex drive has been through the roof!!  Has that happened for anyone else?  Has your mood changed for the better?  I know everything else says all these negative mood changes, but I have had the complete opposite result.

We need to quit smoking for our children, we have 4 beautiful kids that we want to live and be there for. After reading about the crazy dreams we are waiting to see what happens after we fall asleep tonight (will post another review tomm.) But since we have been taking it for 24 hrs , my husband claims he has experienced low energy followed right by lots of energy , kinda an up and down in energy spike. Myself i have experienced headaches and lpss of energy for a few hours today. But chantix has definatly worked so far , we cant wait to follow through with the program and see how it turns out. Hopefully we become NON-smokers :DWe wish to everyone else who is trying to quit smoking with chantix  the best of luck &amp; sweet dreams and mild side effects if any !
Stop Smoking	sad in tx, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	8/20/2010 1:43:21 AM	I took the Chantix one tablet daily after eating dinner because of the nausea it worked best for me. I quit smoking in less than one month. I stopped the chantix even though my doctor suggested I continue. I've been smoke free for 15 months and have not had any cravings. Shortly after stopping the Chantix I began experiencing extreme dizzness, insomina, and depression. I told my doctor that I wasn't feeling better after I quit smoking and was told that I would. I don't regret quitting because I smoked for 43 years and I wouldn't start smoking again. But the side effects have really affected my life. I went from being a healthy 53 year old to a dizzy, sluggish, depressed 54 year old and now my doctors can't seem to figure out the cause, I believe it's from the Chantix. I'm glad I don't smoke anymore just wish I felt better now that I don't.

In only a week we are seeing a few side effects.  I would encourage those with health problems, especially, to seek other treatment options.  I feel Chantix is too dangerous and their one year success rates are pretty low.  I would be interested in seeing more comments from those who have had long term success.

Stop Smoking	rlpinsky, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	7/23/2010 12:51:03 PM	Other than the nausea and weird dreams (which I have anyway), I've noticed that not only am I not smoking, I'm not craving more food.  It's almost like that thing in the back of your mind that says, &quot;I feel bad, so I want to eat, smoke or drink&quot; doesn't exist. I haven't felt the need to replace the cigarettes with something else that's bad for me. I'm actually eating less.  I haven't experienced the depression, but I've noticed that I am a little non-emotional, maybe a little numb feeling, not good or bad.  I guess that's better than being depressed.  I wonder if this medication could be used for other possible addictions like eating disorders or other possible drug addictions in addition to nicotine addiction.  People with drug addictions must increase their intake of what they are addicted to, to feel normal.  This medication blocks the release of dopamine when nicotine is introduced to the body, maybe it would do the same thing with other addictive drugs.  Just a thought.
Stop Smoking	vinnie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/22/2010 10:29:16 AM	Am grateful that I was a NON-smoker before I had my 2 children.  Came to the US and started hanging out with smoking friends and picked up the habit and smoked for 28 years.  Tried once before with the patch but that didnt last very long.  Decided it was just time to try again. Had my DR prescribed Chantix and had a nonchalant attitude of if it works, it works.  Did the starter kit but could not handle the 1 mg so did split in 1/2 , which worked great for me.  Had no problems with taking it with just coffee and no problems with dreams since I made sure to take the 2nd dose at around 2PM.  Still smokeded for the next 3 weeks and noticed that I was smoking less (about &#189; each time).  At the end of 3 weeks, I went home after work and it occurred to me that I did not smoke the entire day.  I just did not notice or had any cravings for one, actually I forgot that I needed a smoke.   AMAZING!  That was November 23rd, 2009 and have not looked back. I thought the holidays would have been hard to get thru with being a non-smoker, but Chantix really worked.  I did not follow thru with the full 3 months, I only took it for 6 weeks and that was enough for me.  Chantix is a very powerful drug. When I smell smoke, it does make me feel nauseus and when I see someone smoking in their car or outside, I am happy to report that I seldom get the cravings.  Today is 7months 22 days of being a non smoker.  I have gained 15lbs but not b/c I dont exercise, but now I have hypothyroidism and am dealing with new meds and hope to be optimized in the near future.  Thank you Chantix!  One step at a time.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/21/2010 3:20:43 PM	I started smoking as a young teenager and smoked a pack a day for 23 years.  I did not want to quit, but felt that I had to for my daughter.  On her 1st birthday, I said enough is enough.  I talked to the doc and got a prescription for Chantix.  I smoked on it for the 1st two weeks and at the end of 2 weeks, I said, this just isn't working and was going to talk to my doctor the next day to start taking me off of it.  The next morning, I went outside as usual to smoke my morning cig, lit it, and said.....ewwwww.  I put it out and haven't touch one yet.  I have been 3 1/2 years without a cigarette and NO cravings.  I did have cravings around the 6 months mark, but they weren't too bad.  The craving always went away very fast.  I cannot believe now how disgusting people smell after the smoke, it's the grossest smell ever and I'm glad I don't smell like that anymore!    Good luck to everyone/anyone who is reading this with the thoughts of quitting smoking!Chantix works - even if you don't want to quit.

I stopped taking it but the following day woke up with canker sores in my mouth and a sore throat.  Wouldn't recommend it... too scary!!

Stop Smoking	Eric71625, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	7/1/2010 5:01:30 PM	When I was prescribed Chantix, I was never told by my doctor not to drink while on the drug.  Based on my experience described below, I strongly recommend to everyone that reads this to abstain 100% from drinking any alcohol while taking Chantix.My experience:After drinking with friends (4 or 5 drinks) one evening while on Chantix for approximately 1 week (I was on the lowest dosage at that point), I had a significant black-out period of 8 hours, where I had almost complete memory loss during that time, suffered hallucinations, and put myself in potentially dangerous and strange situations (like hiding in bushes, changing clothes repeatedly, and stalking my own house and family members) all without any conscious decision making.  I awoke from this black-out in a panic at 2am, shaking and shivering, scared to death.Before this alcohol/chantix event, I had normal side effects, limited to trouble sleeping, strange dreams and mood swings.During my first week on the drug, it really helped with my cravings and I successfully quit for that week.  The drug works.  However, the side effects that many experience while taking this drug could be harmful to themselves or others.  I can only tell the users of WebMD that read these reviews to be very careful when taking Chantix, talk to your doctor regularly about the side effects, do not drink any alcohol while on the drug and only increase dosages when you have successfully accepted and handled the side effects from the lower dosage.I wish everyone the best in their quit attempts.
Stop Smoking	FDJess, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	6/25/2010 5:02:44 PM	I'll start by saying I'm very sensitive to medications of any kind. Secondly as a nurse, I have seen this medication work wonders for my patients as well as friends. My dissatisfaction is entirely my own personal experience. Yes, it curbed cravings for cigarettes. However, I couldn't keep up the treatment d/t the serious side effects. The initial discomfort was the nausea which I tried to tolerate. After a week, however, I vividly remember driving to work and I was hallucinating. I won't recap the details of the hallucination, but it took me three days to get back to normal after ceasing the medication. I will say my best friend had no side effects whatsoever and has been quit for almost two years now after smoking for over 30 years. Also take special care if you have had mood/anxiety issues in the past as it did amplify anxiety. That could also have been attributed to nicotine withdrawals, but it is something to consider prior to taking.   
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/23/2010 2:34:40 PM	I started my 1st does on June 13th and as of today I have not had the urge to smoke  and have not had one in 4 day.  The only side effect I have had is an upset stomach with my morning dose and it passes after about an hour.  My mood is GREAT, I am happier and less moody and have a ton of energy.  I am also enjoying all the attention i am getting from my friends and family!!

It costs too much...so I decided I would quit smoking.  My BP is BETTER than normal...and...I'm not smoking.  The only side affects..wild dreams..which is okay.  I don't have bad ones...technicolor man!
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/16/2010 1:55:36 PM	OK, First Off.. This drug is Not for everyone. It worked for my like a MIRICAL! I have smoked 1 pack a day for 15 years at times a little more. The medication can make your stomach upset so take it with food. Also you will have crazy dreams but so vivid you would think you are there, so the scary ones are scary. When I woke up I would just think to myself ok it is just a dream and I am a non smoker.. moving on! I was on the drug for 3 weeks and each day I did not want a smoke more and more untill no more smokes. It does cost you money most insurances do not pay for it but, $140 for one month supply to save $150 works for me! Also it clearly states if you have any mental health issues do not take this medication so your MD should know not to put you on it, also if you read your medication information when you pick up the drug you should also see this and not take it. This drug it is by far the best thing I have done, I am a non smoker in just 1 month no cravings I am saving money and I will recommend this drug to all smokers.

The only side effects I have had are upset stomach for about 30 minutes after taking medicine, feelings of euphoria (not a bad thing just happy) and increase hunger.

I feel like I would rather smoke 3 packs a day then to feel the way I do. I just cannot explain how awful this feeling is. I have not taken since this morning, I am done with this drug. I cannot go through feeling like this on a daily basis. No Motivation Just mentally distraut. Dont even want to do normal everyday activities.

I smoked a pack a day for 40+ years and have tried to quit many times.  Although I have had some of the side effects described i.e. mild depression and nausea, they were very mild.  I have not gained weight. I have one or two cravings per day but they go away very quickly.  I took Chantix for one month before quitting. It really works!! I had never been able to make it through a 24 hour period.  Now even when I'm stressed, having a glass of wine, around other smokers, I don't really want a cigarette.

Man, am I glad I did!  Taking Chantix as directed and have been 100% smoke free since May 4, 2010!The only side effect I had/have is nausea.  I simply make sure I take it on a full stomach, and no problems.  No suicidal thoughts, crazy dreams, mood swings, etc.  And I smoked for over 12 years!People, the bottom line is this.  All medications effect people differently.  What works for one might not for the other.  Talk to your doctor and decide for yourself.  For me it was the perfect option.  My company payed for it 100%, so I have already seen a dramatic increase financially from not smoking. For me, I couldn't have done it (and I tried several times) without Chantix, so thanks Pfizer...you have saved me money, my health, and possibly my life!

After the first few days I was smoking 1/2 the amount I was before starting Chantix. After 8 days I decided I would not buy another pack of cigarettes. That was 7 1/2 weeks ago, I have not had 1 cigarette (not even a drag). I think what made it easier was the fact that I've wanted to quit for about 2 years now. I did have some minor side affects.. Headaches (slight), vivid dreams, sick feelings in my stomach and constipation. They all seem very minor when I look back. I am 100% happy with what this drug helped me to accomplish!

Secondly, or maybe first, YOU have to decide you want to put those nasty things down. Cigarettes are a drug.  We are drug addicts. If we have made this drug a part of our lives for years, and then choose to remove it, we WILL experience changes in every aspect of our lives..... it is up to us to equip ourselves with HOW we are going to deal with our emotion DAILY since we no longer have our drug (the cigarettes) to turn to. If you PREPARE yourself with a GAME PLAN on how you are going to deal with every aspect of your life when you would normally grab a cigarette THEN you will be prepared to battle this addition. Drinking coffee, stuck in traffic, screaming kids, burned dinner, late to the soccer game, tear jerker movie, your favorite team lost AGAIN, drinking a caffeine loaded drink, you're tired, you're happy, you need to relax, you need to have a bowel movement, the list goes on and on....you are LOSING one of your &quot;dearest&quot; friends. SO FACE IT and quit blaming it all on CHANTIX.  It takes drug addicts months and years of work to stay clean, welcome to the club of ex-smokers aka drug addicts. For the obese, you have replaced one addiction with another. Stern words but the truth from one addict to another.  Join a support group BEFORE you choose to quit. Have a STEEL plan to battle this demon.You wouldn't go into battle without armour.  BE PREPARED!!!

It sure wrapped itself around more than just them. I have developed severe anxiety attacks, become obese (and I don't eat any more or any different now) and I don't really care about smoking or anything else. I was given medication for the anxiety and that gets me by...I was hoping life would be a little better. I have a very hard time concentrating which causes some problems with my work. I developed Carpul Tunnel and had to have surgery. I don't want to smoke though....isn't that what is most important?
Stop Smoking	mmboud, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	5/10/2010 10:32:30 AM	After some rigorous pep talk from our doc, my husband &amp; I went on Chantix together to kick 19-yr habits.  The first few days I just felt sick with nausea &amp; headaches.  My husband didn't have these symptoms.  Soon the sickness went away &amp; the moodiness crept in.  We thought it was just nicotine withdrawal &amp; tried to be patient with each other.  I developed severe muscle tension, extreme anxiety, paranoia &amp; panic attacks.  I couldn't function. My husband got unrelenting muscle tension, anxiety, paranoia and uncontrollable outbursts of rage.  Not anger, very dangerous rage.   We've been married for 16 years, I didn't even know him &amp; I was VERY afraid.Once we realized it was the chantix &amp; not the nicotine, he went back to the doctor.   He repeated his claims that chantix has NO side effects.  He said that he was just a little moody from nicotine withdrawal.  I was told that 19 yrs of damage to my dopamine and serotonin levels was more to blame  than the chantix.We had had enough.  My husband quit taking it cold turkey.  I gradually decreased my dose.  Then came the withdrawals.   My husband's uncontrollable rage mellowed into a constant state of aggravated  moodiness &amp; anger that was coupled with anxiety attacks, muscle tension, depression &amp; vertigo.  I got what has been diagnosed as an acute case of PTSD.  That's right, shell-shock.  Our doctor then decided that it still wasn't the chantix, that we must have been crazy the whole time.  I received Lexapro, klonopin &amp; Propranolol.  My husband was put on celexa.  Its been 2 yrs since Chantix.  We DID quit smoking.  But I'm convinced that it was not due to the drug but to sheer stubbornness.  We still experience problems with anxiety that we now try to control with dietary supplements &amp; yoga.  We both became obese.   (something else our doctor swore wouldn't happen with chantix).  Very long story short.  DO NOT take this drug.  DO NOT take this drug with your partner.  DO NOT take this drug if you live with children.

Every time I have a craving which sometimes is great I think about it and the smell it now makes me sick. By no means does this drug take away your cravings.
Stop Smoking	Julia, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	35-44	5/4/2010 7:51:16 PM	I read all the horror stories about this medication, but had several friends who used it successfully without issues.  So, when I decided to quit I asked for Chantix, and I am so glad I did.  While it certainly didn't stop the cravings entirely, I have no doubt it made them easier to manage.  And looking back, I was definitely a more happy-go-lucky version of myself while on it.  I only took it for 6 weeks total, because it started giving me pretty bad headaches after a while taking it, and the last week I used a week 1 pack to lower the dose down (even though my doctor said there wasn't a need to).  It worked for me my first time quitting after 20+ years, I'm now almost to my one year anniversary of quitting.  I would recommend it highly to anyone not at risk for the more serious potential side effects.  Just make sure that the people who know and are around you know what warning signs to look for so you can stop taking it if you need to.

He is irritable all the time when he is around me.  He is always getting mad at me.  We broke up over this medication.  He has no emotions what-so-ever.  He sees me crying and doesn't care at all.  This is not the man I know!  Just 3 weeks ago before taking Chantix, he was a normal human being.  Now, he is like a stranger but he is NOT smoking anymore.  So, I guess Chantix works...

I didn't have any of the side affects that others had mentioned, I didn't have vivid dreams, although I did dream more than usual.  I had read that some people experience side affects when getting off of Chantix, so I took half of the dose for one day and a quarter of the dose the next day.  I haven't had any problems getting off of it.  It's been 6 weeks now and, occasionally, I would like to have a cigarette, but it's not a craving, just someting I miss. I'd been smoking for over 50 years, I didn't think I would ever be able to stop, but, I did. 
Stop Smoking	Jus42DayMI, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	4/29/2010 11:44:28 AM	I am one of those low percentage folks, I guess. I was prescribed Chantix and jumped right in, followed all directions and experienced what I can only call complete disfunction. Every part of my body hurt after one week and by week two I felt as though I had the flu. Never mind the mental anguish of being in a continuos fog. Before you assume, NO I am not on any medication and besides smoking I am the pinnacle of health. Chantix did not work for me. I wanted it too and I was excited about everything I heard and read. But, I am in the minority. So, with the advice from my Dr. I stopped taking Chantix and re-focused on the quit.  Like all smokers, I want to quit. I just could not tolerate the Chantix. Good Luck and have someone close monitor your behavior if your going to take this drug and be mindful that it has been successful for a lot of people. Thanks,
Stop Smoking	Cougar54, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	4/28/2010 1:28:26 PM	Chantix does make the craving very small. Unfortunately, the emotional and physical side effects were more than I could deal with.  Sleep and dreaming problems, although unpleasant and energy zapping, were the least of them.  My hair stopped growing, my nails stopped growing, and my complexion got acne issues that I have yet to fully recover from 9 months later.  I cried over nothing, blew my cork, and yelled at my pets for no reason as soon as I got home from work. Maybe a result of having to hold myself in check all day at work (my boss was a real princess and made life a bit more stressful). I really wish it had worked!!  I had a plan and reasons, told my family, friends, co-workers, and was very motivated to quit.  The Chantix made me such an awful person that I called the nurse, from work, in tears...I am not a crier and this was totally unacceptable, especially at work(BTW, I changed jobs and didn't work for the princess at this point). I stopped taking it and the nicotine craving returned slowly.  I was still not emotionally all together.  I have unfortunately gone back to being about a pack a day smoker, but have not lost the weight I gained while attempting to quit.  I will keep trying, but never will I use Chantix again.  I tell people to be very careful and monitor all aspects of their heath (mental &amp; physical) if they should decide to use that aid.  I called Pfizer to tell them about the hair and nails growth issue and they basically ignored me.  Didn't ecpect anything different... Anyway.  Good luck to those trying to quit. Cheers and warm regards.

I smoked for about 17 years.  I attempted many times to quit &quot;cold turkey&quot;, but could only last a few days, and was totally miserable.  I have been on Chantix for 2 weeks now, and I feel wonderful.  I have occasional cravings, but they are nothing compared to what they were without Chantix.I must take it on a full stomach, or I will get nauseous.  I do have vivid dreams, but they do not really affect my sleep quality.

I now have to take medication to control my anger and feeling of depression something I feel I will be on for the rest of my life. and my dreams have yet gone back to normal! thank you chantix for ruining my life!!
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/6/2010 5:02:05 PM	I had no desire to quit smoking. I actually loved it, but it was doing bad things to my face. I ordered Chantix from my Dr.(which was actually covered by my ins) followed the program and I am smoke free. They tell you to use it for a few months after you quit and I know why if you around people who smoke it is very testing. I had none of the nasty side effects they warn you about just had to make sure I took it with food. I smoked for 16 years and it worked for me!

The first time i had no dreams or emotions. just functioned. so i stopped the pill. this time i dreamed and felt normal. i'm down to 5 cigs a day if it is a bad day. MY BLOOD WORK SHOWED A REDUCED CHLORESTEROL LEVEL, BUT A SPIKE IN MY BLOOD SUGAR. I SUGGEST A COMPLETE BLOOD WORK UP BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER TAKING THIS DRUG. I HAVE REPORTED THIS DRUG AND SIDE EFFECTS ON ME TO THE FDA. I HAVE SMOKED FOR 31 YEARS.

I quit smoking after the first week. I've had restless nights and interactive dreams. But, the overall sensation of craving isn't half as bad as quitting cold turkey. I've done that many times w/out success. Chantix has given me a new lease on life. I'm nicotine free and I feel great about it. I recommend this drug to anyone who wants to quit. I've encouraged my 72 yr old Mother to use it. But, she wont... Maybe I can lead by example. I encourage everybody to quit smoking, and Chantix can help. I can live with the restless nights for awhile. Good luck :-)
Stop Smoking	Good so far, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	55-64	4/2/2010 11:39:17 PM	I took Chantix for 5 months. I smoked the first month until all my cigarettes were gone. No problems transitioning to quitting. No Nicotine withdrawal symptoms AT ALL. You still get cravigs but they are short and manageable. It's nothing like going cold turkey when you are climbing the walls screaming you have to have a cigarette NOW! The cravings are nothing like that. I had most of the side affects. They were annoying but bearable. I chose to quit smoking over giving up the drug. I planned on going 2 more months on the Chantix but decided to quit after 5 months to see what would happen. I was tired of the side affects and wanted to give it a try. I spent 8 days tapering off the drug opposite to the way you start the drug. I've been off Chantix 2 weeks now. Cravings have not increased at all. I know a cigarette would probably taste good and I'm sure I could easily go back. But I'm not. I don't need them like I once did because I was so dependent on them. Chantix is an amazing drug for those who can tolerate it. I was up to two packs a day and have smoked since age 14. I had tried many things in the past and had nothing but failures. I didn't put much hope in Chantix but somehow it worked!! All of the side affects are gone. There are times you feel like reaching for a cigarette out of habit. I have put myself in all of the situations where I'd like to smoke in the past. A bar, driving, cup of coffee, doing projects etc etc. No problems. Even if others are smoking there still isn't a problem. Like I said before I'm sure one would taste good but I tell myself I don't want it or need it. I feel I've acomplished an impossible feat. Good luck to others and hang in there! Sorry for the long post but I just wanted to explain my complete experience.
Stop Smoking		4	4	4			3/31/2010 6:42:15 PM	my husband and i are on chantix. saturday april 2 will be our stop date! my husband was a 1+ pack a day. we are halfing the dose between us. and it is still working. im a little easier than he is on stopping. having some dreams, not bad ones just vivid ones. i had a little headache but now they are gone after 5 days on med. im hoping it stays this good even after we up our dose to the 1mg pack. i do agree with commment above on  packaging product so its not so exspensive, but we would be spending money on cig. we get our $200.00 bonus money to spend on whatever we want for not smoking at the end of april! new shoes or hand bag will keep me going.lol good luck to all.
Stop Smoking	Jaja817, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/31/2010 9:03:08 AM	25 years of smoking. Smoked the first week like I was told I could. Quit on my quit day and have not looked back. Still have the physical urge but not the nicotine need if that makes sense. I was worried about the side affects and have the dreams and don't sleep so well but I would take that over smoking, any day and the side affects from smoking (think about it). I think those that had suicide thoughts or other really bad affects probably have/had those anyway and this just brings it out more so and it might be just that you are trying to quit. Not right but just something else you need to deal with. Just take it one moment (not a day, a moment) at a time. Every time I have the urge I say to myself or out loud just one more moment. One more moment. Now I just have moments of those thoughts. And I am more into just one more day and it is getting easier. We think smoking controls our emotions but our emotions control our smoking. I know that to be true with me. Or was true as it was a lot of the emotions that made me reach for a cig...now I don't have that to reach for only excuses. So just get through the moment. You can...without smoking. I can. Be positive. Think about caring for yourself and just live in the moment and get through each one of those moment by moment. Next time you get angry and cannot reach for a smoke don't blow up either just take a deep breath, walk it off, and let go of the moment. Overall great stuff for me. I think though that the packaging doesn't have to be quite so fancy and it may be a little cheaper to bring to market. But I also think the higher cost makes me want to quit all the more as I don't really want to blow that much money on taking a drug...anyway...good luck, think positive and one moment at a time.

Stop Smoking	Marie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	45-54	3/24/2010 10:49:47 AM	After smoking heavily for 30 years, and trying to quit a dozen times, I've been smoke free for 3 months. Took Chantix for two months and at first I loved it. Once the anxiety and other side effects got too bad, I had to wean off it gradually because stopping suddenly was worse. The nicotine craving may be gone but I'm fighting the urge to smoke every day. I'm not the person I used to be: I'm now depressed, irritable, stressed, angry and screaming at my kids all the time.  I've put on weight, I can't sleep at all, and I can't focus at work. I've been seeing a therapist for a few years, and she's now trying to help me work through these awful side-effects that have completely changed my personality. My doctor doesn't really know what to do and Pfizer doesn't want to deal with it.  Two months ago I would have recommended Chantix to any otherwise healthy person, now I'd say find another way to quit.

I honestly have hardly ANY urge to smoke, but I need to learn how to break the habit of smoking. Yesterday was my first time with any side effects. I got really moody and had CRAZY dreams. Other than that I feel this drug is awesome. I have seen 5 others quit completly and still are not smoking to this day! I am very thankful for this drug and hope i can continue on strong!

Stop Smoking	Craig, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	55-64	3/20/2010 4:05:36 AM	I started Chantix in Dec.2006 I took it for 3 months, It appeared to be working fairly well,although I found myself VERY quick to anger and just thought it was from not smoking(my family also noticed the drastic change in my emotions)I was so irritable i went back to smoking in July 2007 and continued to smoke for six months. The aggitation continued this entire time. I started to feel so phyiscaly bad I decided to stop smoking again in Feb. 2008 but since the Chantix was so expensive I went on the generic nicoteen gum. I am not smoking and it has been 2 years and 2 months!! But the aggitation continues just as much or more.I saw a comercial on TV about chantix several months ago warning about these side effects of anger and realized that it was the Chantix causing these emotional problems. I finally decided it was time to see my doctor about this and was told it was probally not the Chantix since it has been 3 years since I have taken it??? and suggested I see A Psyciatrist as they would have more knowledge about this. I feel certain it is the Chantix. Iwill be making an appt. in the next day or two. I just hope he doesn't prescribe something else to cause even more problems.I WOULD NOT ever recomend Chantix to anyone.

Chantix has been very effective for me.  Be sure to take on a full stomach or you will get sick.

I was told about this pill by two close friends, wh has successfully stopped. I was thinking it wouldn't work, as I tried other things in the past. I was also afraid with all the side effects. But, I knew I needed the help and really wanted to stop. So, It's 3 weeks later. I feel good, I haven't smoked or even had the desire to smoke. I can't believe it. However, I am experiencing some constipation, but I'm drinking lots of water, yogurt and salad to help. I am happy I did this.

I am 36 years old,and I have smoked a pack and a half a day for 20 years. Because of my 6 year old daughter and health reasons, I decided to quit for good. I set my quit day for March !st. I took the pill, and smoked for the previous week like directed. The day came. It was easier than I thought. I will admit I have had 4 cigs since then, but I didn't get anything from it, and the last one tasted like an ashtray. I did not have any of the side effects. I was worried about that to the point, I almost didn't do this, but I decided what the heck??? I am so glad I did!!

Went from a pack a day to about 7.  So far, I have had an upset stomach and gas.  Also, my mouth has a nasty metallic taste in it.  I dont know if I will be smoke free in 2 days, but I hope I am.  I am still wanting to smoke out of habit with friends.  I am doing well on the side effects, but I am getting so scared of all these stories I am reading.  I am dreading week 2 and eventually stopping the medications because all of these experiences people are having.  I hope I will be alright.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/8/2010 4:29:49 PM	I was a pack a day + smoker for 23yrs. I started Chantix Tuesday 2/23 &amp; by friday i was down to 3 cigarettes. The taste &amp; smell were absolutely nauseating. I do need to make sure I eat when I take it though. If I take it on an empty stomach it is a stomach ache like I've never known. The dreams are pretty awesome, like dreaming in coloring book mode.. when I can sleep. I have had some issues with insomnia, but from what I've read nicotine withdrawl can also cause insomnia. I just started taking 2pills twice a day &amp; have noticed a slightly jittery feeling, but when I 1st started with 1 pill once a day I had the same feeling that went away once I adjusted. No mood swings, not suicidal thoughts, no anger issues. I've been smoke free for over a week now &amp; couldn't be happier. The cravings come &amp; go, but I've noticed that it's usually in situations when I would normally have a cigarette... after I eat, 1st thing in the morning... But it is the best decision I've ever made! I'm one of 5 other people I know who quit smoking with Chantix, I would recommend to anyone

Even though I had a heart attack, there is no way that chantix brought it on.  Diet and smoking did it all.  The dreams I had were awesome.  Some of the best I've ever had, and no nightmares.  Was on chantix for 4 months, more from worrying about not being able to stay smokefree than a real need as I found out when I went to the hospital.  My advice is have a good check up before starting chantix and don't go into it with preconcieved ideas of what to expect, good or bad.

I loved the medicine until I realized I was getting very angry over small things.  Weird dreams over the week 4 and 5.... depression is awful.    I nearly got fired over the anger issues.  luckily my boss is trying help me out.   more to come soon.

I had some difficulty for the first week getting use to the dosage.  It took my 3 weeks to get to full dosage and then it was a breeze to quit. If it gives you stomach problems, take it with food or full glass of water (like the directions tell you) and it will stop.  Had some vivid dreams, but in general, they were very entertaining.  Had some minor depression--which is why I took longer to get to the full dose. All in all--a heck of a lot easier than going cold turkey or buying cases of gum.  Go for it.

I hope everyone remembers how bad quitting cold turkey is and how crazy you can become.  Nicotine is one powerfull drug and your mind will do anything to get it once addicted.
Stop Smoking	Good so far, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/26/2010 5:24:35 PM	This drug has worked for me. I have had a lot of the side affects but for me they were tolerable. Very annoying but tolerable. I haven't smoked for over 3 months. But I could easily go back to smoking. This took away all of the nicotine withdrawal problems. I had none. Cold turkey and other rememdies failed for me. I was going nuts. This makes the cravings bearable. I'm afraid the cravings could be there forever since it was a learned habit for 40 years. I am going to take Chantix for 6 months which I'm not crazy about. I haven't gained or lost any weight. But I don't feel better or healthier either. I just hope when I come off this drug I can stay off the cigarettes because I'll tell you that I'm sure one would still taste good!

The Doctor suggested Chantix and I said OK I'll try it. I took my first dose on Monday and had my very last cigarette on Thursday night. I rook the medication for 4 more weeks and thats all there is.  I have been smoke free since September 2006.. I never even craved a cigarette since.  Yes, so I gained a little weight,but I never had a bad dream or a thought  of suicide, or even a mood change that I know of,( at least no one said any thing about my mood). The best thing is my Granddaughter doesn't say I smell like Yucky Sticks.

You still have to make changes in your life for stress relief etc, but Chantix helped me get started.  I took it for a month and got some smoke free time under my belt.  It helped me to believe that I did not HAVE TO smoke.  I still had some cravings with Chantix but they never got totally out of control (drive to the gas station) as they did in the past.  If you have been thinking about quiting, I would direct you to discuss it with your doctor and try it.  It worked for me.

I set my quit date the day after Thanksgiving in 2007 and have not had a cig since. I was on Chantix for 8 weeks and followed directions exactly.  I never had a craving for a cig, and when I thought about it, I would just tell my self that I didn't need it.  I turned my focus to other things like exercising, reading, etc.  The only side effect was nausea for a brief period of time.  Taking Chantix was the best decision I ever made in my life to date. Don't get discouraged, stay focused and realize you are doing this to save your life. Good luck to everyone trying to quit.

I started chanitx only 6 days ago and I am a NON-SMOKER!!! YEAH!  I totally think that if you want to try anything, this will do the trick. I wasn't sure if I was really wanting to quit but I thought about my 3 year old. SO, I did it. Chantix did have a few side effects; headaches, fatigue,   nausea, and I had a feeling of Vertigo(seeing stars and spinning rooms)(that went away with food). Every thing was easily controlled, and all the side effects went away after I halfed the dosage. I do recommend trying Chantix! I now know 5 people that have QUIT SMOKING with Chantix's help!  Thats A LOT!   Good Luck

I quit on Christmas Day and have not looked back, I just hit day 50. I have had few side effects, you do need to have something on your stomach or it makes you a little quesy. My sleep pattern was screwed up, that is why I might be writing this at 3 in the morning...lol!No real vivid dreams or other bothersome side effects. I am very happy to say this pill worked its magic for me, my cravings were so mild that I could overcome them and now that I have the monkey off my back, he ain't getting back on!

I started taking Chantix and didn't even really want to quit smoking but my husband did. I quit 4 days after starting and it's been 6 monthes. I did feel a bit sick for about 5 mins after taking it in the morning but mostly if I hadn't eaten yet. I highly recommend it to all my still smoking friends!!

About a year later he started it again as he picked up the habit again.  The second time he committed Suicide and was successful.  he was a wonderful man to loose him like this.  I answered the information below with my son-in-law to be's personal demographics .

It was working great until I had to increases the dosage of it.  Then I was VERY nauseous and tired.  I had terrible headaches and was consistently tired. And to make it worse, it was expensive, of course insurance didn't cover it.  $100 for the starter pack and I couldn't get through week 1.  I started taking Wellbutrin SR and it works GREAT!  I have been smoke free for 3 weeks. And i have no desire to start again.

Stop Smoking	dolli, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/2/2010 1:50:32 PM	I can't believe how well this medication is working for me after 4days the desire to smoke was almost gone then when I lit one up it tasted gross and gave me no satisfaction after a week I quit I have quit for 3 weeks now cut my dose to half the only problem I have experienced so far is if I take it on an empty stomach I feel sick for an hour or so but that is it I have not gained any weight yet with all the other methods I did. I have not been really edgy I have had some vivid dreams I kind of enjoy them and I do have some cravings but not nearly as many as cold turkey or the patch. If you really want to quit I think it is worth giving it a shot. I will let you know when I get off it if there are any side effects
Stop Smoking	KristinTalley2010, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	2/2/2010 10:47:19 AM	I started Chantix 5 weeks ago, and have been smoke free for almost 2 weeks. I started smoking when i was 13, and I am 29 now and I smoked about a pack to a pack and a half a day.I do not get scary dreams, just weird ones. my boyfriend wakes up because I am constantly moving in my sleep, sometimes pushing him out of bed. I find myself agitated at home, kind of short tempered but I chew gum or make myself busy and it goes away. I cannot say that being agitated is the medicine, I am blaming it on the withdrawl from not having a cigarette. Smoking has been my best friend for 15 years and it's really hard giving it up, but I feel so much better, I can breath so much better, and I actually have more energy. All in all, this is a great medicine, because it not only stops your cravings for cigarettes, it also decreased my coffee intake, from 4 cups a day to 2. I recommend this medication to anyone that is serious about quitting.My only suggestion would be to have the pills in a bottle, instead of a package; for convinience sake.

Stop Smoking	desert rose, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/26/2010 6:08:21 PM	Fortunately I did not have any severe side affects that some patients seem to have had.  I did have a few nights with vivid dreams, nothing scary and was a little short tempered at home and occasionaly at work.  I have been smoke free since August 2007 after smoking 1+ pack a day for 44 years!!  At times, far and few between, I think I want a cigarette but I smell an old ash try and that kills the desire immediately!!  Biggest problem for me has been the weight gain which I am now struggling with.  It is wonderful living in the desert and smelling clean fresh air and not wheezing while taking walks with my dogs.  Best money I have ever spent!!
Stop Smoking	Single mom..., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	1/26/2010 12:31:52 PM	I quit smoking over 13 years ago but became addicted to the the nicotine gum.  I was told chantix could help.  The first time I tried it was in Oct 2009.  I was on it for about two weeks and had to get off of it.  I was very nauseated, aggressive and very easily aggitated. Not good for a mom going through a divorce with a 3 and 12 year old boys. I have to say I thought possibliy some of the above side effects/mood could of been due to my husband moving out.  Today is 01/26/10.  Last week I saw a new doctor he talked me into giving Chantix a try again.  I still had plenty left so I agreed.  Around 3:30 p.m. I took one pill that evening I was nauseated and moody..irritable.  Not good..I have kids.  I tried another pill the next day (Friday) and by Friday night I didn't even like myself.  I told my older son Saturday morning what was going on and that I would never take the medicine again.  I do not recommend this drug especially if kids are in the household!!  I do believe if I would of stayed on this medicine I probably would of lost my job and I don't even want to think about the rest.

Stop Smoking	Ms Robbie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	65-74	1/24/2010 1:55:49 PM	I had smoked for 49 years when I began taking Chantix.  I started it on October 9 and have been smoke-free since October 25, which is now three months ago.  While I had vivid dreams, they were mostly entertaining; none was alarming.  My only difficulty was extreme heartburn (which is why I quit taking Chantix after the first 4-week packet) that has not yet (three months later) completely left me.  The heartburn is something I had never experienced before, and it's a real bear.

I've had an easier (and equally unsuccessful) experience going cold turkey.  I was cutting myself, and I'm no teenage emo character.  I was frequently nauseated; I threw up in the middle of the aisle at my local supermarket.  Charming.  My experience with this drug was so bad that for once, I actually felt good at resuming smoking and tossing the Chantix.  I mean, how bad can this drug be if I felt good at resuming smoking?

I asked about side effects and was told that &quot;the ONLY side effects were the strange dreams and possible upset stomach&quot; now that a few months have gone by all of a sudden these side effects have come to light. I think Chantix should pay for my medical care, thats the least they can do. 
Stop Smoking	Vinnie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/22/2010 12:24:14 PM	This is a follow up from a prior post in Nov 2009. Briefly, I started Chantix on Nov 3 and officially stop smoking Nov 23.  Stopped taking Chantix Dec 8 without weaning off.  Yesterday was officially 3 months smokefree.  I rarely think about smoking and if I do, it only last for a fleeting 1-2 minutes.  When I started Chantix, I had a very nonchalant attitude of if it works, it works, if not well, I tried. I would recommend this.  I had no serous side effects.  A little nausea and dream but no big problems.  Chantix made it so easy if fact too easy and well worth it.My daughter started shortly after I started and is now smokefree.  Now her husband has started and is down to 1 cig a day.  They are so pleased with Chantix.  They had both tried to patch but were so miserable and cranky.  The experience with Chantix is nothing compared to the patch.  Thank you Chantix.

Still have sleep issues.Wake up every night. I think the trade off is worth it.Never made me sick.Critical to follow dosage rules.I started with the full dose because I got the remainder of a friends perscription.No Dr visit.Had to stop taking it after 3 days.Was having bizzare dreams and wake ups.Waited a week,then started taking the half pills that I cut w/ a paring knife.Did that for aweek,then full dosage.Maybe that's how I &quot;earned&quot; this sleep disorder.Never,ever,ever had trouble sleeping till this pill.Still think it was worth it.I'm now trying Melatonin.Been taking Ambien for 7 wks. and feel my resistance building already(habit forming).Have trouble sleeping on the weekends w/o it.After almost 2 yrs. of waking up in the middle of the night,I needed to make a move.The Ambien was a Godsend at first,but I'm starting to feel what everyone says about this drug.Will continue my quest for a good night sleep.STILL WORTH IT&gt;hope this helps

Nausea is a side effect, but only if you don't take your pill's durring a meal. Check with your Dr. and they will say the same thing....I have smoked for 16 years and this is actually my second time quitting with Chantix. The first time I was smoke free for 3 months, and then one of my friends had a cancer scare, another friend separated and divorced from her husband, I was suffering financial issues, etc... 9 months later, I am quitting again. I am 8 weeks in and only smoke 1 or 2 cigarettes a day and that is just because I still have so many left in my pack! As soon as this pack is done, so I am. I very much enjoyed being smoke free last time and found out that not only was I saving money by quitting, but I had so much more energy and time as a non-smoker. Good luck to all of you!

It has been 7 months at this point, and I honestly don't think I will ever go back to smoking.  I highly recommend this drug, apart from a little nausea (bearable) for a few minutes in the 2nd week, it was smooth sailing.

Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/14/2010 10:58:33 AM	I have smoked on and off since I was 18. I am now 36.  I have tried everything to quit smoking and nothing, until now, has worked.  I have been on Chantix for over a week and find it to be the best thing ever.  I have very small cravings every once in while but, they pass very easily.  The only thing that I have a very strong craving for is exercise.  I was leary at first due to all of the side effects  with this drug but, if you monitor yourself and ask others to look out for odd behavior you should be okay. I have also lost 3 pounds since I began taking it.   I would definitely recommend seeing how your body reacts to both starting Chantix and upping the dosage (2nd week).  I did find my second day I was a bit sluggish but, it passed by the 3rd.

Vomiting, acid reflux, insomnia, just to name the worst. The good news is, I haven't had a cigarette for two weeks. but I'm afraid the cons are outweighing the pros at this point. Apparently Chantix isn't for everyone.

The pills messed with our stomachs until we ate something.  He isn't a big breakfast eater, and neither was I, but we were committed to trying to quit smoking.  My husband lasted about 3 weeks, then stopped taking the pills because of the having-to-eat thing, and started smoking again.  I stayed on the drug for 2 months and have been smoke free for 4 months now, but I am not happy with the weight gain and I have horrible crying bouts for weeks on end and for no reason.  The drug itself works great to suppress the urge to smoke, but not so sure the side effects are worth it.
Stop Smoking	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	12/29/2009 11:23:30 AM	This is a continuing followup. Been on Chantic 10 weeks now and haven't had a cigarette 6 weeks today. I have smoked 40 years and was up to 2 packs a day. Side affects: Stomach/nausea is fine if I take with food. Some days I feel depressed. It comes and goes. Still get strange dreams from time to time. These dreams by the way ARE NOT nightmares. Sleep pattern is a little screwed up. Chantix leaves a bad taste in my mouth from time to time. Sometimes the Chantix makes food taste different. I am doing much better than I could ever have imagined. There isn't any stress or anger like when going cold turkey. No withdrawl symptoms. Still get cravings multiple times a day but they are very manageable. I plan on using the Chantix until I haven't smoked for 90 days and then will start weening off of it. Will continue with followups.

I quit smoking with success. I let myself run completely out of cigarettes and never bought another pack. I have been smoke-free now since April 9, 2009. But it really helps to remember the reasons for choosing to quit smoking in the first place. Now no more lying awake at night listening to myslef wheeze. My breathing is so much better and I am so proud of myself. Chantix really does work if you have made up your mind to quit. But you cannot make excuses. Just be resolved to never smoke again. By the way, I had smoked for 46 years.

Quit again after 7months, also with Chantix.  The first time I had a horrible reaction after about 2mo off the drug.  I thought I would never get better - but I did, after about 4-5mo.  The second experience was not as bad and went through its cycle very fast.  After being sure that the bad reactions were from Chantix, I now believe that they are from nicotine (or other tobacco chemical) withdrawal.This stuff works, and works very well.  However, I didn't quit after a week, I just found that I knew when the time came - which was about 2 1/2 weeks.

Stop Smoking	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/21/2009 2:58:31 PM	I really struggled with the idea of taking a pill to quit smoking.  It took me awhile to get on board with that idea but I am glad I finally did.  Talk to your doctor and be aware and educated about potential side affects but if you really want to quit smoking and have tried all the other methods (cold turkey, nicotine replacement etc) please try this.  I am now over 2 months smoke free and have been off Chantix for almost 1 month.  During the first month, the normally off the charts cravings never happened.  Yes, I had cravings but they were not overpowering.  For me, making it through a few weeks gave me the confidence to see that, yes, I could make it through a day and lifes challenges without a smoke.  I am in no way trying to discount some of the negative stories on this site and others.  Honestly, it was those stories that kept me from getting the perscription filled for so long.  But if I had not finally given it a try I would be heading into 2010 with a Marlboro in my mouth!!

This is an experience I thought NEVER would happen to me. I started when I was 12 &amp; my last cigarette was 5 months ago. Even my cat thanks the new air he breathes.Although I took Chantix once before, I claimed it didn't work, because I kept on smoking and I ended up being nauseous a lot. Well, I wasn't working WITH the Chantix, I was expecting instant results without doing anything else but pop a pill.This time, I followed directions to a fault and I am so grateful that I did, and so are a lot of people who know me. I breathe better, I feel better, and I smell better (both in my nose and other people's noses).Thanks to my doctor and to Chantix for helping me accomplish what I considered an impossibility.

I started Chantix on 12/7.  I reached my quit date on 12/15, and still had the desire to smoke.  The first few days were tough, I didn't smoke the first two days, but slipped up on day three.  I've had two smoke free days since then and the urges are still there, but lessening.Overall have been satisfied.  I haven't had any major side effects.  I've made sure to take it directly after meals and with a full glass of water, so no stomach issues.  I do remember more of my dreams, which I actually enjoy.So far so good.  I'm hoping to reach the point others have -- where I have no remaining desire to smoke.  I still have urges, but I feel can manage them.  I would suggest anyone considering to quit, consider this drug, of course weighing some of the potential side effects as well.
Stop Smoking	UncleAl, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/15/2009 2:08:44 PM	This is a follow-up from an earlier review dated 4/22/2009. After 9 years of smoking, 4/9/2009 was my last cigarette. I have not had another since. I feel better than I have ever felt in my whole life. What an awakening, and all thanks to the assistance provided by Chantix. My total time on the medication was a mere 8 weeks. The side effects were minimal and were worth every second. The results now, 8 months down the road, are proof that there is truly nothing pleasurable about smoking. You aren't even aware of the life you're missing out on until you quit. With the right frame of mind and the assurance that a life without cigarettes is not scary or miserable but a healthier, more positive life without chains, you too can quit successfully with the help of Chantix. Good luck!
Stop Smoking	CrumpJ, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/14/2009 4:40:21 PM	I took Chantix for 8 wks,Quit smoking on my sixth day, and during The first five weeks I had no side effects other than vivid dreams, and a little sickness if I didnt take it with food.Into the last 3 weeks I started to have small bouts of sickness everytime I took it, with food or not, I just put up with it as it would pass after about 10 or 15 minutes. So in the middle of the eighth wk I decided to split my last four days of pills into 8 taking one a day till they were gone. I smoked for 23 years, I tried every over the counter product you can buy, but with chantix I quit in 6 days - fact. All I really had to deal with was a little sickness and some cool dreams.  I have been off chantix for over a week and feel great. You still have your moments - Food, Attitudes, Boredome, etc but they all pass easily if you try. The real funny thing for me is I wasn't a beleiver from gate, So thanx Chantix for proving me wrong.

Stop Smoking	JM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/11/2009 1:16:50 PM	I am bipolar, so I was very leery about taking Chantix. But I've smoked 2 packs a day for over 25 years and enough was enough. Under my psychiatrist's care, I started Chantix and I quit smoking. It was a breeze compared to all previous efforts to quit.  The only side effect were vivid, but entertaining dreams. Yes, I still have cravings (more habit/situational) but they pass and they are few and far between. One thing: Don't quit the pills abruptly. That was when I had emotional problems. Under my doctors supervision, I had to buy another month and slowly taper off over a 2 month period. Chantix should put out a last month package. My experience was good. I think it is for most people, since the people who have bad experiences are more likely to post in this forum than people who have good experiences. That said, listen to your mind and your body and only do this under the care of a doctor who knows you well with support from your friends and family.  
Stop Smoking	2Packs, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	12/10/2009 4:06:28 PM	Been on Chantix almost 8 weeks. Been smoke free 24 days. Side affects are upset stomach unless I eat something. I feel somewhat depressed from time to time. Sleep habits are screwed up. There has been no nicotine withdraw at all and the cravings are mild. The drug is much better than I thought. I didn't think anything was going to cure my 40 years of smoking and I was up to 2 packs a day. I intend to use the Chantix for 6 months. I am disappointed that I feel no better since I quit smoking. I guess it takes months or years for your lungs to get better.

I read all the bad reviews and was reluctant to take it. The only side effect I had was &quot;vivid dreams&quot;, which for me meant remembering all the details when I awoke.Not a bad thing at all. I also made a point of getting something solid on my stomach before taking in the morning. Don't just eat a cracker and a swig of water!! I would eat something like an English muffin with peanut butter on it. Also drink a full 8oz. of water.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	12/6/2009 8:50:27 AM	I started taking Chantix on a Friday and by Tuesday, I was sleeping 12-15 hours a night/day, crying on and off throughout the day and having feelings of worthlessness.  Since I had such a strong reaction to the medication, I stopped taking it.  I am Bipolar and have been on the right mix of medication to balance it, but since taking the Chantix, I feel even more depressed than I did before the Bipolar meds.  Chantix did not help me quit smoking.  If you have any history of depression or are Bipolar, please, please think twice about taking this drug...the side effects are nasty.  Ask you doctor if this med is okay for you to take and talk to your doctor immediately if you have any of the above signs.

However I have never been able to take it for more than 3 weeks because the side effects. I was fired from my job for acting angry toward a customer. THis anger was a side effect of the Chantix. I won unemployment in court beause I had no previous complaints in 2 years and had a note from my psychiatrist saying the medication made me so incredible angry. It makes me very irratable, angry, mad, and negative. I also suffer unbelivable headaches and my jaw hurts. I am bipolar and have never felt any suicidal thoughts or changes in my moods except the anger. I do not want to smoke while on the medication and I does truely work. As long as you can put up with the side effects, it will probably save your life.

Stop Smoking	Vinnie, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/30/2009 12:03:54 PM	Wasn't really sure it would work for me. This is my 2nd time trying to quit from being a 23yr smoker (I'm 53). The 1st was with the patch but didn't work. Started Chantix Nov 3 and cut down smoking signicantly 4-5 cig/daily (1/2 at a time) and was only able to finally quit Nov 23 without even realizing that I didn't think about smoking for the whole day.  Today, it is 8 day without smokes now and all is going so well.  My heart wasn't completely 100% quit in the beginning of the Chantix, I just did it as an experiment and it really worked wonders. I forgot to mention that I smoked 10-12 cig/daily consistently.  I thought Thanksgiving was going to be a struggle and really a test for me and I came thru with hardly any cravings and do feel great (I'm so surprised at this too). My lung capacity is so much better that I can run/jog for 15-20mins withou stopping.  In the past I could only run/jog for only 3-5mins.  The 1st week I was nauseaus in the AM, but now I'm doing great. I even take it without a meal (not a breakfast person). I take the 10mg in the AM and only .5mg at about 4-5PM.  Don't really want the dreams to keep me awake. The cravings are minimal. I know it's only 8 days not smoking and will give an update each week or 2.

This is the end of week 5 and my 6th day without a cigarette. I'm doing much better than I thought I would. So the Chantix must be having some affect. I get through the days much easier than I thought I would. Cravings and urges are not bad at all. My plan now is to continue the Chantix for 6 months. Side affects are not bad. The worse for me is taking it without food. After smoking for 40 years since I was a 14 I'm pretty convinced my smoking days are over. I'll check in again. Plus I also have been taking antidepressants for 25 years and there has been no problems taking Chantix.
Stop Smoking	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/20/2009 10:28:12 PM	I guess I am one of the lucky ones who has limited side affects.  Mine have been mainly &quot;irregularity&quot; and some nausea, but only if I forget and take it on an empty stomach.Bottom line so far is it has worked.  I took for 1 week and reached my quit date.  I still had a strong urge to smoke but thought &quot;I have paid for the Chantix and am taking it.  I may as well try and see if I can make it until lunch.&quot;  I have not had a smoke yet and it has been 17 days.  The best way for me to describe it is it brings the obcession and the cravings down.  There have been times that I have thought about it but it has never gotten so out of control that I drive to the gas station to buy a pack.  The best part is that I know know that I can make it through a day, my job, my life without a cig.  If I smoke tomorrow, it is not because I need it.  It is because I choose it.  I meet with my doctor next week to make a decision on wheter I go on to month 2 or ween off of it.  Friends ask about it and I hesitate to recomment id because I know there are people who have had very bad side affects.  Some of the stories I read on the blogs almost kept me from trying it but I am glad I did.  It has worked out very well for me.

I really haven't had any side effects.  If you take the medication as instructed you can avoid alot of the side effects.  I take at 6:30/7 then take again at 2:30.  I'm sleeping fine.

After starting chantix 10 weeks ago and quitting it 2 weeks ago, I'm smoke free for 8 weeks now. I'm also a mental mess. At 51 and actually very healthy and fit, I have never experienced anything like this before. Alternating bouts of severe anger and depression ranging to hyperactive giddiness. My symptoms have steadily gotten worse since stopping the chantix. I have NO history of depression. I am under a Dr.'s care, waiting on test results now after actually beating on my husband. I got that angry because he went to use the bathroom. I have NEVER had a temper issue, and I am scaring myself. This doesn't even take into account the horrible nightmares (first few weeks were just vivid but good dreams) heart palpitations, nausea, gerd, gas, constipation, confusion, memory loss, insomnia, aches and pains, restlesness. Please, think long and hard, do a lot of research, and think long and hard again before taking chantix. Don't assume it'll be ok for you, just because a Dr. is willing to prescribe it. It is your body, your mind, and your health. I truly regret ever taking it, and would not suggest it to anyone.

The first two weeks were kind of hard but after that I didn't even want to smoke. Fast forward 14 months and I'm a non-smoker! YES!  I did have some side effects, vivid dreams and feeling aggressive so ended up taking Chantrix for only 6 weeks but that was enough. This was my chance to be free from the smoking demon and I won!

Stop Smoking	crumpj, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/3/2009 12:59:18 PM	I didn't want to be so easy when it came to rating this medication, but there is no doubt its just shy of a miracle. I am beginning my 4th week pak and have been cigerette free for 16 days, the first 10 days i went by the book and suffered no side effects except very cool dreams ( no Nightmares). During the last 6 days my schedule has made me take my pills at slightly different hours and still no major side effects except dreaming. It seems if you take chantix without food you'll feel a little sick, but only for 10/20 minutes and the other catch for me was even though I have been trying to watch what I eat I still gained a few pounds. Chantix is my recomendation to anybody who wants to quit leteraly pain free, and I have tried most all of the other methods to know.

I smoked when I woke, ate, and slept, and every moment in between.  I married a woman who smoked, and our life was scheduled around smoking.  We recently decided to attempt pregnancy.  Our first step was to quit smoking.  The base where I am stationed offered a smoking cessation program with Chantix.  They provided every side effect up front and released the medication the first day.  We smoked for the first week, the first pack of Chantix.  By day four, cigarettes were tasting stale and cravings were minimal.  We were able to quit on day seven.  Irritablility, increased dreaming, and nausea are our primary side effects.  All are worth quitting smoking.

No side affects as of yet. Also there has been no change in my addiction so the drug hasn't started working yet. I smoke 2 packs a day and have been smoking for 40 years. I have tried the other things on the market with no luck. I am hoping this will work. I also have been on antidepressants for 23 years after having severe depression. So this drug is of great concern to me. I plan on making several posts on my progress.

I had  realy clear unusual vivid dreams for the first three days and unusual but normal the rest. I couldnt really tell if it was helping or not helping, only that by the end of the week i was smoking less, but that also could be because I am a little more self aware at the moment. I was instructed to pick a quit date 7 days from the start of my program and smoke till then, but on the morning of the sixth i ran out of cigeretts, so i just stopped. what I hav noticed in the last day and a half without cigeretts is im not really having any withdraw symptoms just lots of habits. I find myself ending up at the spot i would always smoke for no reason, also when the habit arises to go to that spot and i circumvent the urge I end up in the kitchen. my point is there is a difference, but you still have to fight the habit, if that makes sense.(will write again in a week)

It really made quiting seem easy.  Immediately, I had very strange vivid dreams but they didn't seem to interupt my sleep much.  During the 3rd week of taking Chantix, I began to have severe abdominal pains and nausea after taking Chantix, even when I ate.  So bad, that I decided to take a break.  I discontinued taking the drug on day 5 of the 3rd week.  After about 3 days of discontinued use, I became very irritable - almost unbearable to live with.  I don't know if I should take any more of my perscription or not.  I want to stay stopped, but I don't want to have these weird withrawls again...

When I began smoking it was social, gradually working up to 2 packs a day. I am now on my 6th day using Chantix. My desire to smoke has lessened throughout the day. I am still struggling with my problem areas which are in the morning when I tend to smoke the most, &amp; at night while relaxing. The taste is getting worse by the day, slightly metallic. I seem to be smoking more out of habit than enjoyment at this point. I have had some of the stated side effects... very vivid dreams, and feeling disoriented &amp; not well rested for quite some time after waking up. I have not felt any nausea, aggitation or depression thus far. Hopefully I will be smoke free by the 8th day. I will keep everyone posted on my journey!

Stop Smoking	KatyInLasVegas, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/27/2009 1:15:17 PM	For quitting smoking Chantix has worked for me. Not only has it let me quit smoking completely but the smell of cigarettes has changed which helped me to not smoke during visits with smoking family members. The biggest thing is that I didn't really want to quit but HAD to quit and it still worked out for me. I'd recommend this to anyone.As far as side effects, the dreams have not been bad for me. I just tend to remember them more than I used to and they're slightly crazy but nothing along the lines of nightmares or strange. Also, from time to time I get a crazy stomach ache when taking my pill. Not enough to throw up but it's not great. And the last thing, dry skin is a very rare side effect and it's all over my face. My skin has become very dry and scaly everywhere but it is at its worst on my face. And for that reason, I cannot wait to finish taking Chantix and be done. There isn't enough lotion to get my face looking and feeling normal again.
Stop Smoking	lydwnsal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	9/26/2009 10:15:31 AM	I am a 43 yr old female who smoked for over 20 years - the exact age &amp; smoking history of the test subjects. I smoked my last cigarette on the 26th day after starting Chantix.  The urge to smoke subsides quickly although it does reoccur from time to time but it is easily discarded. The dreams are really wild and vivid, luckily no nightmares. Just finished my 4th month and have been smoke free for 3 months which I never thought would be possible. Started noticing during this last month that the side effects (especially the hostility and emotions) have really intensified. I have become very easily agitated by issues that I deal with daily at my job and I LOVE MY JOB! My doctor wanted me to take it for 9 months but I said no way would I live through 5 more months of this! Not suicidal at all but have thought about whacking a few OTHER people! I will begin the weaning process this coming week and pray that the side effects go away.  I would recommend this medication for some people but do not believe that it will help everyone due to the side effects. If you DO decide to take it, listen to your body and mind because you know it better than anyone. The nausea can be curbed by taking it after a meal and with a FULL 8oz of WATER. THEY ARE NOT KIDDING ABOUT THE FULL GLASS OF WATER! It still made me feel a little nauseated but it subsides quickly if you just give it a chance. This medicine really works if your body AND mind can handle it.

I stopped the pill when I had ten days left due to nausea. Very happy, had tried and failed to stop several times, smoked for over 41 years. I also started walking and only gained 6 pounds, did get the vivid dreams but they will stop. Feel so much better, did not think that it would work.

The first week was just fine. I smoked my cigarettes during the first week like my doctor instructed me so the medicine would &quot;build up&quot; in my brian. In the middle of the second week I started to get insomnia really bad. I coulndt go to sleep untill about 7 or 8 in the morning. All I would do is sleep all day 'till about 5pm. Luckly its still summer or I would miss school. Ive been smoke-free for almost 2 weeks. It works for me but I dont think that I can handle sleeping all day. I want to sleep at night and I'am considering getting some ambien. I would remcomend this product but only to people who can handle the horrid side effects that come along with it.

Started to feel a loss of cig desire VERY soon thereafter. To date I seldom do I even feel the urge! Only side effect I had were dreams...SOME NIGHTMARES (as usual) MAINLY VIVID FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL DAYS, CHILDHOOD, ETC. I ACTUALLY LIKED THEM!!Sorry to hear some people had a bad experience. Maybe some latent pre-existing condition exercised by Chantix is the cause?

Stop Smoking	Texas67, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Male	35-44	9/1/2009 12:46:37 AM	I started taking chantix in Aug/07' for about a month and it worked really well but in Sept/07' i started being extremely thristy and urinating alot, i went to my Dr. and they tested my sugar level and it was really high he started me on insulin pills, after testing myself a few times a day with taking the insulin pills it wasnt going down i told my Dr. and he put me on insulin shots twice a day(it was horrible bcause i dont like needles or the feeling when a persons sugar levels get low after an insulin shot). During the same time i became very depressed so he started me on depression medicine(which i'm still on). So sometime around March/April of 2008 my Dr. tested my sugar and it was normal(like i never had diabetes so i know that it was from this med) and he stopped me from taking insulin but i have to test myself 3 times a week to make sure. But if i'd known that i'd get diabetes i wouldnt of taken it and its not a warning on the medicines commercial and labeling. So be careful!

Stop Smoking	Ann, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	8/25/2009 3:31:59 AM	I tried Chantix for months last year. Two months was all I could stand the constant nausea, given that I was no closer to stopping smoking than I had been to begin with. I'm bipolar, accustomed to a variety of psych symptoms, so tend to blow them off now, at my &quot;advanced&quot; age. Plus, at that time, I was nursing hubby back from injuries from a serious car accident. So I don't remember anything other than nonstop nausea and no help quitting smoking. 3 packs a day for 35 years. I felt like it was my last hope.
Stop Smoking	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	8/22/2009 12:20:01 PM	Great dreams no nightmares. A little nausea for about 10 minutes thats all. I might have to take ritalin again though I just cannot concentrate on anything. Us ADD people need our stimulants.
Stop Smoking	susan, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	8/20/2009 10:09:31 PM	It worked,never had any side effects what so ever, then starting to go down to 1 pill a day that's when the problems started I started having severe neurolgy problems all the sudden and quick, could not walk (legs felt like jello) double vision basically all that were around me thought I was having a stoke or seizure,could not speak righ at all this went on for 3 hrs (was taken to hosptal by ambulance) the doctors informed me they have seen such adverse reactions to chantix at all different phases of patients taking chantix. It was not always at the beginning or middle or even end of taking chantix. Thank god I do not smoke anymore, I would rather go back to smoking then see my life pass in front of my eyes!!! I pray to god NO ONE ever has to go through this side effect...you will truly believe that you are at the end of your life!!! Only on chantix for 3 months!!
Stop Smoking	brown bear, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	8/18/2009 7:28:03 AM	I was not a heavy smoker but definitely had dependency for about 10 years.  I took Chantix for 3 weeks (at half dose - I'm about 100 lbs and had alot of nausea at normal dose) and have successfully weaned myself off.  I stopped after 3 weeks due to some increasing side effects - what was weird dreams in week one became crazy dreams and not sleeping more than 4 hours/ night later.  Same with anxiety, the gas/bloating, sadness... it was the equivalency of 3 weeks of intense PMS.  Not sure if related to the drug or just quitting but I am much better now that I am off of it.  I still have some dreaming, not crazy just vivid, but from other posts I expect this will go away shortly.  Good luck to you about to take it- just make sure you have a support system to watch out for any mood changes- if it weren't for my husband I would still be taking it and who knows how I would be!  To me, I was being normal, to everyone else I was being very strange.  
Stop Smoking	Arlene, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/18/2009 5:26:19 AM	Like many others, hearing about the side-effects terrified me. But, the only side-effect I encountered were really messed up terrifying dreams. I didn't feel depressed (no more than I did last time I tried quitting without Chantix anyway), and it definitely helped ease a HUGE amount of anxiety. It seriously made quitting practically EASY!! I was a little crabby here and there of course, but nothing like I was when I tried to quit without Chantix! lolI stopped smoking with Chantix on November 1, 2008 and only took it for 3 weeks (that's including the one week prior to quitting) and in the 3rd week I was only using half of the dosage (one pill in morning) to try and ease the crazy, terrifying dreams. Unfortunately the dreams remained even after I stopped taking Chantix altogether. But they dissipated more and more each night and only remained for maybe 7 days at the most after stopping Chantix. Totally worth it though because I am still smoke-free on August 18, 2009. I definitely wouldn't be this far along without it!  Oh, and the online support really helps to push you further and further too. So definitely register for that! They provide you with what to expect, and offer ways to cope and things you can try to ease the brief encounters of wanting a cigarette. Best thing I ever tried to kick the habit. Totally amazing stuff! THANK YOU Pfizer! 
Stop Smoking	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	8/15/2009 11:25:59 PM	While I was nervous about all of the side effects I read about, I'm happy to say the only one has been vivid dreams - sometimes nightmares but also good dreams, just more intense. I'm a younger person than most of the reviewers here but have smoked about a pack a day for 10 years. I've quit off and on before but always restarted after a few months. I've tried cold turkey, counseling, patches and the gum. I'm happy to report no cigarettes and SEVERELY reduced cravings after 4 weeks on Chantix. Of course when I want one I still want one, but I found that after the first week I don't think about cigarettes for hours at a time. This was inconceivable before and certainly never happened while on the patches or the gum. I can still have a few beers or cocktails, no upset stomach, and while I have had depressive tendancies before, I've experienced nothing like the violent mood swings or other issues others have reported. The pill itself is small, easy to remember to take, and very very effective for me. It's completely worth the cost and I wish I tried it sooner. Good Luck!!

Smoke free for over a month now, no signifigant urges either.Now for the down side,,,If you are at all a aggressive/hostle personality or moody and/or depressive, be very careful while on this drug,Very glad to be smoke free,but if I had to do it again,,I would try cold turkey,not chantix.
Stop Smoking	David, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	8/8/2009 9:15:17 PM	I had to quit taking Chantix after the second day (one 1/2 mg tablet).  It made me feel horrible (sore, exhausted), irritable, and it gave me hours and hours of headaches.  I don't know how to describe the horrible feeling, it's kind of like if you breathe too much bug spray.  I was not nauseated or sleepy from it, and I did not take it long enough to have vivid dreams.  I did have to pee a lot, including during the night.  To be fair, I am sensitive to medications and I take other meds for fibromyalgia which may have affected the way Chantix made me feel: Lyrica, Buspar, ibuprofen.  If you are otherwise in good health, these things might not be an issue.  If you start taking it, I'd recommend starting on a non-working day in case you get similar effects.

I have smoked for about 18 years (a pack a day) The first day I had to quit I thought it was going to be difficult. It was very easy. Almost as if I never smoked a day in my life. WOW. I love Chantix. I found the drug to be very effective and have had no issues. The dreams are vivid but I love them!!!!! My stomach hurts after taking them but it makes me feel full and not hungry so I dont have much of a appetite so have actually lost alot of weight because of it as well. Overall, I love this drug and would highly recommend it to everyone.
Stop Smoking	jenn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	7/30/2009 1:54:11 PM	PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS, PLEASE READ THIS! i have been smoke free for over 2 months thanks to chantix! Letting go of cigarettes was very easy, even after smoking for 13 years. i experienced some side effects, headaches nausea, vivid dreams. The nausea and headaches were not bad and were gone after two weeks. The vivid dreams are my main complaint. i have had several dreams while on this medication, in which i believe i'm experiencing real life and wake up, only to find out after waking a second time that it was a dream within a dream mimicking real life.  VERY disturbing when it's a nightmare! I've had two vivid nightmares that i'm blaming on chantix. (i've never had so many dreams in such a short time frame, until taking this med). I have a history of severe panic attacks, and depression. though quitting on chantix  has been an emotional roller coaster ride, i have not experienced any attacks or bouts of depression. Just a few really bad days. Though i think the cause for the bad moods is really lack of nicotine, and having to learn new behaviors to cope with stress rather than the medication itself. if you have a anxiety disorder, don't be afraid to take this medicine. It's worth a few bad days and weird dreams to be smoke free and healthy. If you have understanding family and friends supporting you through the ups and downs of quitting, you can't lose! tell them you might be a pain to deal with for a week or two but it's not permanent, you'll be back to your old self in no time! Good Luck!
Stop Smoking	Geno, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	7/27/2009 7:59:28 PM	Was on Chantix for 3 months beginning Feb 07.  I did manage to quit with the help of this med.  I wanted to quit as well.  I didn't think I would ever quit until this med came to the market.  I smoked for nearly 30 years and enjoyed it immensely (or so I thought).  My experience with this med was good and bad, some aggression and weird dreams, vivid dreams of smoking.  That could be nicotine depravation though, who knows really.  If you decide to try this, do give it a chance to work, I was on for 3 months.  After 2 months, I thought I didn't need it any longer, but opted for another month and GRADUALLY came down from this med .. this I recommend greatly.  Don't just taking this med overnight, come off of it like you started, this I urge.  Good Luck..you can do it, if I can anyone can.

Stop Smoking	Jade, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	25-34	7/25/2009 9:01:49 PM	I took Chantix for 7 weeks and have been smoke free for 2 months now. Unfortunatly I experienced some of the issues with anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts that others have. Even though this medication does what it's intended to do; those 7 weeks were the scariest of my life. I was terrified to leave the house and thought people were watching me constantly. Even when I thought it might be the medication, I didn't want to stop taking it because it was working- I wasn't smoking and it was so dang expensive I didn't want to waste what I had left of it.  One day I had a panic attack and out of no where I thought of killing myself. I knew this was completly out of my character and immediatly (though somewhat begrudgingly) threw out the rest of the medication. I've been recovering and so far only have very slight anxiety since taking Chantix. However the experience that I had is always in the back of my head.  BE CAREFUL ON THIS MED. It seems like 50% of people who take it are ok and the other 50% have this very serious reaction (among other things- the gas was almost unbearable-ugh!). If you have any predisposition to depression, anxiety, bipolar-DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG.  The scariest feeling in the world is knowing that your brain isn't functioning right and that there's nothing you can do about it. But to those who have had this reaction, just know that there is hope and the side effects were not permanent. I'm back at my job now and functioning normally again. But it was one hell of a journey to quit smoking with Chantix.

I only wish that I knew that the good sensation that most of us enjoy was going to stop after a few days on the pill.  So make sure to get those last few smokes in before taking Chantrix.  Even though you continue to smoke for a week after starting the pill, the cigarettes stop doing what they normally do and are a bit strange.  I was able to go down to one a day after 5 weeks to conserve and also the mental desire is still there to smoke (no one really talks about this too much).  The physical need went away in week 3.  I have had no side effects from using Chantrix and definitly recommend this to others.  This was my first try to quit and so far so good.

I have experienced vivid nightmares that sometimes continue even after I wake up and go back to sleep-which by the way is evasive on this medication. I have lost a few pounds because I forget to eat. I no longer feel the urge to smoke-I don't feel the urge to do much at all...the medication is doing its job but it sucks the world of color.

It worked well and did what it was supposed to do. BUT after 2 months I had a panick attack out of the blue that was so severe I went to the hospital. I found out that it is an antipsychotic and people who are prone to depression, worry and anxiety should steer clear. I still had the newly developed &quot;panic disorder&quot; moths after quitting the drug. It has been a year and with the Good Lords help I am attack free. However, I still have problems with insomia which started then. I am a totally different person now too. I no longer enjoy the things I used to. I would watch your mood and how it changes on this drug. Even though the drug is long gone out of my system I am forever scarred. I had to have CBT therapy which really helped. I now know my brain and chemical makeup cannot tolerate alteration by these types of drugs. Im doing well now and am very much closer to God.

She began to seem pretty tense and agitated.  But when she began the two pill a day dose that was the real nightmare.  She had a big problem with aggression and had alot of problems.  she could feel the anxiety and aggression subside after stopping this med.  It is a very dangerous drug!!  My daughter could have had worse effects from this. She now has been ordered to therapy and if I can help it this will be a way of making others aware of the terrible side effects of this drug it should be recalled and removed from the market!!

I only took it for a week but what a terrible week, headaches, fatigue, concentiation, stomach cramps, could only sleep 3 hours with a sleeping aid, depression ( got worse each day) then the unthinkable..I started thinking about killing myself..in my state of mind that was the only thing to do. The next morning I took another pill and the thoughts came back stronger..thank God I realized what was causing the thoughts before I took another pill. I am really happy for the people that did quit but for the ones that just started or thinking about taking the pill...know your body, listen to your body. Quit smoking is great but being dead is not.

A friend had been successful with Chantix and I decided to try it since I had nothing left to lose.  I have had NO problems with Chantix.  The nausea can be easily avoided as long as you take it with food.  The dreams are vibrant but not unpleasant.  The best part is NOT SMOKING.  So far it's been 7 weeks.  This doesn't make quitting perfect, you will still have your moments and urges, but those pass quickly.  The first week was the hardest, but it was quite bearable.  Since I've never actually made it a full week before Chantix, this was quite tolerable!  I know the warnings all sound scary, but if you really want to quit, discuss it with your doctor.  The majority of people do just fine on it!
Stop Smoking	Leave this crap alone!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/1/2009 6:40:30 PM	If I knew then what I know now.......I quit smoking but the side effects were NOT worth it. If you have anxiety issues DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!! I have always had bad anxiety. This medication makes it worse! I was irritable and reclusive. I didn't sleep well because of the vivid dreams. Long story short- I stopped taking this crap yesterday. I feel a lot better today. My anxiety got so bad I had to be put on Klonopin to calm me down. Unfreakin believable! Chantix made it seem like Prozac didn't work. I'll never take this again. Look up stories on chantix on the web.

Stop Smoking	Celulure, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Male	55-64	6/27/2009 9:45:24 PM	I began Chantix 4/6/09, quit smoking on 4/13/09, and have not smoked since.  I stopped taking Chantix after about 6 weeks because of the side effects, primarily headaches, nausea, acid reflux, fatigue, some mental confusion &amp; loss of concentration, agitation, agressive behavior, tightness in the chest, palpitations, weakness and tingling in the arms.The good news is Chantix has been 100% successful in my quest to be smoke free.  I smoked 2 packs/day for 45 years -if I can quit anyone can.The bad news is after quitting I feel now worse than when I was smoking as many side effects continue .  So far all tests have come back &quot;normal&quot; however these continued symptoms (they are now diminishing) are distressing.  I believe my error was to stop Chantix cold turkey.  I now realize that a weaning program should have been followed which wass not advised by either my doctor or pharmacist.  Chantix worked for me but please be aware of the side effects and utilize a weaning process when quitting the med.  Good Luck To All

I did, after smoking off and on for nearly 30 years and most recently 8 straight years.. I have now been smoke free for 2 years + !!! After only taking the medicine for 3 weeks.  I kept the next month pack, but did not need it. I will never pick it back up again. Headaches were a side effect for me as well as some dreams, but it has made a huge difference in my life!!

The 1st week I started taking it, I noticed a decreased urge in wanting to smoke. By the time It was my quit day, I was exited to do it. I have been smoke free for over 30 days. The decision to quit smoking is a very serious one. If you are not serious about quitting, I don't think this drug or any other form of quit smoking aids will help. But for those of you that are serious. This is amazing. I am on a mission to help all of those I love to quit.

Side effects such as anxiety, nervousness, inability to concentrate were experienced within the first few days. After being on the drug as prescribed i was forced to make a decision.  The decision to continue with the increasingly unbearable side effects or stop was difficult.  I desperately need to stop smoking, but I am not one of the success stories with Chantix.  My experience with this drug was horrible.Sincerely,  Dan W.  I

On the 7th day I didn't need, nor want a cigarette.  3 weeks later haven't even smoked a single one.  It is amazing.  I would recommend it to anyone.  It has caused me to be a little tired, but I'm still working and I just take naps.  In the end I know it's going to be worth it.  Just try it!!!!

Had smoked steady for 30 years.  Read all the data and accounts I could find before asking my Doc for a prescription.  The potential side effects is very scary, but the only one that has stuck with me so far is the sleep stuff.  I dream like crazy, which makes it impossible to get any solid sleep.  I find that if I take a nighttime sleep aid every 5 or 6 days, I do get rest that night (I won't use a sleep aid more than that).  I changed up to a half-dose after the first 10 days of being cigarette free; that took care of any other lingering side effects.  I recommend it to any smoker, but only under a doctor's supervision, and only if you live with someone that can note any significant behavioral changes.

Once I stop taking the medicine I have had the urge to smoke twice.  I am still having trouble with the sleeping, but everything is fine.  I think that you have to be in the mindset to stop smoking.  I am now on my 45th day of not smoking.

I now have diabetes, and there is no family history of diabetes and I have never had symptoms of diabetes.  In an attempt to become healthy, I now have destroyed my way of life.  No one seems to know if it will reverse or not.  Have any of the people who also developed diabetes had a reveral of symptoms?  Pfizer should be sued for destroying peoples lives!  I think something needs to be done about this drug. 
Stop Smoking	Char, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	3	Female	35-44	5/18/2009 1:33:32 PM	I have been a smoker for 23 years (one pack per day) and only tried to quit once, two years ago.  I took Chantix for one month and had to get off, because I was under a lot of stress and thought that the drugs was causing my moodiness.  I thought I would try again this year, my quit date was 4/11/09 and I had no problem quitting.  My husband quit (two packs per day) with me but he stopped without taking Chantix. I have had no urges to smoke at all.  I am now going on my 6th week, but have decided to stop taking it.  I have not had a good night sleep in a long time.  I use to run in the AMs and can not anymore due to being so tried.  I am no longer the same person, I have been snapping at my family and don't even want to talk to anyone any more.  My kids are afraid to talk to me, not knowing if I will snap at them.  I have been crying all the time, but have NOT had any sucidal thoughts.  My husband is still smoke free, I am hoping not to get any urges but I know that with his help I'll be OK.  I just want my happy life back.

Stop Smoking	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	5/13/2009 8:08:53 PM	Quit date was 21 Feb 2009 - History 33 years smoking and was up to 1 1/2 packs a dayAs of May 13, 2009 I am still tobacco free.  Side affects not severe in nature.  They include gas, needing 2 more hours of sleep each night to feel rested, and I really haven't felt like myself since I started the regiment. My smell hasn't began to return.  Social / habit cues still an issue but subsidingPro's: Desire to smoke significantly tempered.  Mornings are surprisingly urge free.  Tobacco smoke tastes/smells bad (harsh).  No nicotine lift smelling second hand smoke.  Knowing that even if I did cheat, I would not get the nicotine lift and it tastes bad helps.Recommended to a friend.  He's been quit free for over a month now.

Stop Smoking	ed, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	5/10/2009 10:16:07 PM	Starting on my 3rd week of being smoke free using Chantix.  I had been a smoker for 22 years, at times almost 3 packs a day.  When I stopped I was down to 1 pack a day before taking this drug.  Had tried to quit seriously about 3 - 4 times in my life.  I am currently 47 years old and I feel good.  Taking this drug has caused me to have sleepless nights.  Before taking Chantix I was sleeping like a baby.  I am constipated like no other time in my life.  But, the side effects have yet lead me to quit taking the meds, so I guess they are not that bad yet.  I would not be sleeping good anyway if I quit cold turkey.  I don't seem to have the anxiety that I use to, but I don't seem to have the motivation to do many things as much as I used to.  I am tired all the time, either from the lack of sleep or not having any energy.  Because of these two things I don't want to work out as most of the time I can't even get up off the couch.  I am not sure if not wanting to be social is because of the meds or because I am just upset that I can't smoke again and I have not gotten over that yet.  I can't and don't want to smoke, so it is a catch 22.  The gum and the patch did not work for me, so here I am and I just want to get through this process so I can quit taking the meds and remain smoke free.  I know that the first puff will be my downfall and again, one day at a time.  I have to say, it amazes me I made it this far.  I WISH YOU THE BEST IN BECOMING SMOKE FREE TOO, if I can do it so can YOU!!!

Stop Smoking	paultmor, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	45-54	5/9/2009 7:51:49 AM	When I started taking Chantix it was working very well but after 4 weeks I started getting chest pains and headaches and deep depression and very moody, I thought it was working and it did but my side effects were to much to handle and very scary and I pulled away from my friends and family, so I have stopped taking this today and I can only wish that I get back to normal soon, I feel this drug will work with the right person, but everyone taking it should really watch out for anything that you normally would not do, I have been very forgetful and a bit hard to talk to and I have never had depression before and I am 47 and very young looking and happy until I started taking the drug, I did stop smoking but started back up again but nowhere near as much as I smoked before, good luck to anyone taking this drug, but you must be careful as with any drug.

I started Chantix three weeks ago and have been smoke free for one week.  I stopped Chantix yesterday because I have been so phsically ill.  I am very cloudy in my thoughts and feel so down in the dumps.  I feel like nothing is happy or light, but instead dark and dreary.  I experienced terrible constipation and have gained six pounds.  Not something that is acceptable for me.  I feel a bit better that I stopped the pills, hope tomorrow is better.  I am hoping that sheer will and maybe the NRT gum will control the urges when they rear their head again.  Listen to your body and if you don't feel right, stop taking this drug.  I really feel that the effects on my brain and thinking were serious.  I am glad I stopped.
Stop Smoking	jody, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	5/5/2009 7:37:21 AM	I was on Chantix for 6 days until yesterday when I was taking off by my doctor.  The drug was beginning to work for me reducing my urge to smoke.  The problems started when I went to 2 a day.  I started having numbness and tingling going up and down my left side.  I also started having a tension/burning sensation in my upper chest.  My blood pressure went from 110/70 to 136/89.  This is after only 6 days on this drug.  This drug was working for me but my body just didn't like it.  As for the unusual dreams they were ok to live with.  I would recommend this drug to someone else but just watch for warning signs and talked to your doctor.

Well on my quit day (4/25/09) I didn't smoke all day until I went to a party that night.  Then smoked about 6 cig's that night.  The next day I woke up and had no cravings, thoughts or desire to smoke.  I have had a few dreams and sleep has been an issue.  If you read the directions they tell you to take it with a meas and a glass of water.  I have always done that, except for one night I forgot to take it with dinner and took it before bed.  Stomach pains were pretty uncomfortable.  But I'm not smoking.  I couldn't have quit without Chantix. Now my husband is thinking about getting it.  I'm not crazy about taking any medication but this is great.  Good luck to all who take it.

I did quit smoking while I was taking it.  I landed myself in the hospital after trying to kill myself.  I have had the worst side effects ever.   I have been so sick with pain / headaches / blurred vision and many other side effects.  I have been through so many test to try to find out what was wrong with me until recently all the problems were tied to this medication.   My life has been destroyed.  Due to all the side affects I lost my job which caused me to loose my house and van.  I can't believe that just because I wanted to improve my life and quit smoking I lost it all.  I would never take this again.  ps. I now smoke.  I have been told I will never be the same after this.

Stop Smoking	UncleAl, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	4/22/2009 11:12:06 PM	I am a 24 y/o male, smoker for 9 years in good health otherwise, physical and mental. I just began week 5 yesterday and have had amazing results. Been smoking at least a pack and half per day for the last 3 years. By week 2 on Chantix, I was down to around 4-5 cigs per day. By week 3, I was completely cig-free and still am, not even one slip-up! I highly recommend this drug. It truly does curb cravings and prevent withdrawals 100%. You may experience side effects initially - slight drowsiness, nausea, changes in sleep, etc., as did I. I would definitely suggest eating a full meal right before taking the medication, and space your doses out evenly by 8-12 hour increments. I believe the idea is to keep a steady level of Chantix in your system to constantly curb the cravings. If you take them too close together, I believe you will have much stronger side effects. I keep seeing where people say they have all these terrible side effects from it, and obviously different people resond to meds differently. However, I had only mild side effects and they tapered off very quickly once my body adjusted to the medication. A word to the wise, if you are experiencing serious or bothersome side effects from any medication, you should always call your doctor and speak with him/her about the problem. A physician can properly tell you whether the benefits outweigh the risks in a case like this. Two thumbs up to Chantix, it has changed my life forever!

Cigarettes don't even taste as good as they did before.
Stop Smoking	DECKS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/15/2009 3:05:10 PM	This is day 9 of being smoke free. This stuff is amazing! I did a lot of research on this drug and was terrified by all the side effects. I take it with food as everyone advised and I am fine. The dreams are ususally really amusing and can be remembered vividly upon waking. One thing I did as I am 125 pounds and can be sensitive to drugs is that I would break the starter pills in half and take part in the morning and the other in the evening. I did that for about at week. I am now taking the 1mg tablets but only in the morning and not at night. I feel that I am doing good right now, why risk it by taking the evening dose and getting side effects. Also, my meds will last me twice as long. I still have mild cravings but usually just when drinking alcohol which I am baby stepping back into. I can even go on my deck where I used to smoke and take the puppy out! I don't even think about it! I am feeling better everyday! I really enjoyed smoking and didn't want to quit but knew I needed to. So, this works even if you aren't into 100%. Come one, give it a try. Good luck to everyone!
Stop Smoking	bbeehler, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/13/2009 2:58:15 PM	I started taking Chantix 4/4/09, stopped smoking 4/11/09 and so far so good. I was  down to a couple a day and each day I decreased by at least 1/2 a cigarette a day until quit day. At Easter I sat outside with the smokers and didn't bat an eye. The only side effect is the nausea. On .5mg it was not bad and lasted about an hour. On the 1 mg I have seen an increase in the duration and strength of the nausea. I have not yakked yet which would be better than waiting for almost 2 hours for the feeling of wanting to yak to go away. I took it at 7:30 am and my tummy is still hard at 2pm. I read taking it with high protein meals is best and thinking about it, over the weekend I took it with eggs and it was not as bad as this morning (cereal)and milk helped some. I told my boyfriend to watch me just in case. I cannot wait to cross the finish line on my first triathlon this summer as a non smoker! Hoping the yakking feeling goes away or I get used to it fast!

This drug interacted with my anti-depressant in such a way rhat it seemed as though I wasn't even on it. The depression and agression became so severe that not only did it cost me the relationship I was in, but I am now being charged criminally for stalking. I dont recommend this drug to anyone for anything, haven't taken it for 4 weeks now and wonder if I can outlast the side effects. It is a horrible thing that something that is supposed to be helpful can destruy your life in a matter of weeks.

What a great way to live, never thought it was possible.  I agree with so many of the positive posters here, if you really want to quit, you can do it, and Chantix can help.  Don't read too much into other people's symptoms, each one of us is different, you may be the one that has success, as I and many others have.  I hope that others will see the benefits &amp; hope that we have &amp; use this.  This message board helps, it presents all aspects of what can occur, good &amp; bad.  Good luck &amp; keep trying, you can do this.  I'm living proof.  Smoke free for over 16 months, after 35 years of smoking.
Stop Smoking	spunky, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	45-54	4/4/2009 1:30:50 AM	I did great the first week, really cutting down. I did have some nausea and extreme constipation. The 2nd week, although I am already being treated for depression and  did have some stressful things going on in my life, I began experiencing tremendous anxiety and sleeping problems. By the beginning of the 3rd week I was in such a depressive state I felt suicidal and absolutely miserable! I felt like I was having a nervous breakdown and needed to be committed. Needless to say, my smoking had not decreased anymore. I stopped taking it before the 3rd week ended and within 3 days felt like a new person. I guess I will have to try something else and make up my mind to really do it. I had hoped Chantix would be my 'miracle'....
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/2/2009 11:30:38 AM	I had smoked for almost 20 yrs, thanks to Chantix I am no longer a smoker.  I only took the meds for one month, I know I should have taken it longer, but the lack of sleep from the dreams was awful!  Good luck to everyone, and never pick a cig up again. That is the key! It isn't worth it. I wanted to quit smoking so my husband and I could start trying to have children, so it was a really motivating reason to quit. Chantix is a great product, trust in it, keep taking it, and believe in yourself. You don't need those cigs to live, you will not die if you don't smoke, you could if you keep smoking.  Anyway, enjoy your Chantix journey, it is so worth it on the other side!

Stop Smoking	SmokeFreeInLasVegas, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	3/26/2009 7:02:27 PM	I am just getting ready to start my 2nd month of treatment. I was a smoker for 14 years. I lost the desire for a cigarette on my eighth day of the medication. Cravings have been there - but are gone as soon as they come on. I was extremely tired on this med each time my dosage increased but after 2 days on the highest dose, I am doing much better. I have had the constipation and gas. Nausea only if I didn't each first (so I make sure I eat first). I am having more dreams or just remembering them more...but they have all been good ones (like flying to Tahiti with a check for $1 million). I am a bit spacey at times and the 2nd and 3rd week - everyone got on my nerves...not so much any more. I also fall asleep fast at night now...no tossing and turning. These are all minor things to put up with in exchange for a smoke free life...(PS - today it was so windy that my hair blew in my face and it was wonderful to smell my hair...it didn't smell like cigarettes...it smelt like coconuts and mango)
Stop Smoking	bella, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	3/26/2009 3:29:45 PM	thank you! thank you! if it was not for chantix i never would have been smoke free. i tell everyone if i can do it so can you. but im sad to say i may have to stop taking the meds because i have developed a rash almost looks like small chickenpox, i have yet to call dr's because i have  been trying to see if anyone else has had this type of reaction. i really dont want to stop taking this, i dont want to smoke. it has been 2 weeks since i have had the nicodemon in my system and i am hoping that the craving will not be bad after i stop taking this.. the vivid dreams are pretty fascinating though i always did have an imagination they have gotten better, something to look foward to at bed time, wondering what planet i will be on lol. thank you again and my lungs thank you.

This is the only time I have quit that I feel like I have it under control.  My quit day was 2/28/09, up until 3/17/09 I smoked about 1/2 a cigarette a day, they tasted disgusting but I HAD to do it!!!  I have gone the last 8 days with out that 3-4 puffs from a cigarette and I feel very strong.  I still consider myself a non smoker for 26 days today because going from 1&amp;1/2 pack a day to 1/2 a cigarette is a miracle in itself. The only side effects I have experienced is the nauseau if not taken after eating and felt like I didnt sleep at all at nite because of the dreams.  I now take .5 mg in the morning and .25 mg (1/2 pill) at nite which has helped immensley.  People say this is worse than kicking heroin, I wouldnt know that, but it has definitely been the hardest thing I have done.  I take it 1 DAY at a time and check in at the website every morning and it gets easier and easier!!!  Thank you Chantix!!!!

Stop Smoking	dskitty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/19/2009 6:47:48 PM	I am 44 years old and I am 35 days quit today after 31 years of smoking!!! The Chantix definately takes away the craving to smoke.  I find that if I don't eat and then take the Chantix, I get nauseated - I do have constipation, which is addressed easily with daily fiber intake and I am experiencing vivid dreams. I know that we all have dreams every night, it seems as though the Chantix just helps remember them - some are good, some are weird and only a few bad.  I have gained 9 pounds already but the weight is worth it!  I am also attending a &quot;Group&quot; meeting every other week which also helps as the support from others is very important when it comes to quitting.  It felt great to go into a dr appt yesterday and tell my Dr. that I am a non-smoker (even if it is only 35 days).  I have read some of the reviews about some people's side effects using Chantix and think that the medication has different effects on different people, we are all not the same.  I have multi-level degenerative disc disease and am taking Lortab 500/7.5 and Robaxin 500mg daily for the pain.  I also take 20mg Prozac daily for depression, .25 Xanax for anxiety, along with my Chantix and yes, it may sound like I am a prescription drug addict but my meds allow me to work my 45 hours a week and function as a &quot;normal&quot; person. After reading the reviews though, I am concerned about when I go off the Chantix, will I have adverse reactions?  If anyone out there is on the same regimen as me and has experienced any reactions, please feel free to leave me a message.  I wish all those that are taking on the challenge to quit smoking the best of luck as it is the hardest thing that I have done in my life and everyday I go without a cigarette I thank God for giving me the strength (and Chantix :-)).

Stop Smoking	Non Smoker, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	3/18/2009 3:43:10 PM	This is my 2nd time on Chantix, the first time I quit smoking after a month and also quit taking it which was a mistake.  As soon as the med was out of my system the craving came back so I'd definitely recommend taking it for a month or two after you've quit.I've been on it a little over a month so far this time.  The worst side effect for me both times is the nausea I'd get within 5-10 minutes of taking the 1mg dose.  It's a very intense nausea where I literally have to keep myself from vomiting.  It lasts about 10 minutes.  I always take it in the middle of meals or after a meal, NEVER on an empty stomach or I would uncontrollably vomit.  No matter what I take it with I can't avoid the nausea.It's definitely effective in helping you quit.  Ciggarettes taste terrible after a week or two and then you don't even want to smoke them.  I'd forget to smoke after meals etc.  While on Chantix I have very strange and vivid dreams.  Mine have all been humorous however I could see if you were prone to nightmares this could be bad because they also could be very vivid.I'd recommend this treatment to anyone serious about quitting.

Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/16/2009 9:44:03 PM	I really think this is an effective way to quit smoking, but I still find myself trying to reason with my brain about why it would be okay, just to have one more cigarette...but of course its never okay. I guess I never realized the damaging effects on your body from one cigarette, let alone smoking for 15 years. I guess I have realized that I am a real drug addict, which is sad, because it seems sooo easy to give in. Which it is. I decided to quit when I was taking care of a patient in the hospital and they where dyeing of Lung Cancer, from smoking, and no matter what treatment we gave him to help him breathe, it didn't help at all. He would cry and ask himself why he did this to himself and his family. Why was the big question for me. I had no answer. The man died in the ICU unit two days later. In nursing school, we where taught that COPD and Lung Cancer are like taking a deep breath, hold it, take another deep breath, hold it, and do it one more time and that is what it is like to breath with these diseases. How terriable! You feel like your sufficating. So, I finally decided that I'm quitting. Enough is Enough!!! And all of the side effects that come with this drug..Well I had some, but I decided to take it anyway. I would rather have nightmares, than lung cancer. Don't give up. If it doesn't work for you, try something else. Its all up to you anyway. Your the one who puts the cigarette in your mouth, so your the one that needs to take it out, permatly! Good luck!!!

But it's just like any other quit smoking drug, you have to really want to quit for it to work.I do notice that I get depressed for about the first week of taking Chantix.  After that the depression seems to go away for me.  The vivid/unusual dreams also go away after the first week or two.  The nauseous feeling sticks around, but I've found that if I wait about 30-45 minutes after I eat (protein heavy meal, anything else doesn't cut it) to take my dosage, then it's not that bad.There's no guarantee that you won't start smoking again -- this is my second time to take Chantix to quit (quit for quite a while after the first time), but even with all the nasty side effects, I'm grateful it's available because I hate smoking.I've also noticed that after the initial &quot;starter&quot; pack, that if I just take one a day instead of two, that it does the trick just fine and the side effects aren't as bad.But yeah, getting past that first week or two of feeling depressed can suck.  To me it's a small price to pay for the ease that Chantix makes quitting smoking.

I do not feel refreshed after sleeping 6-10 hours.It is because the dreams are so weird that I really do not rest. Have started talking, crying, and shouting in my sleep.Have written Pfizer asking if they ever go away, still waiting for reply.Was told they will get back to me. My husband experienced severe heart palipatations and was afraid of having a heart attack.Sadly I am smoking again, but if it keeps me calm after some of the bizarre, scary dreams, so be it. I got rid of the drug after just finishing the starter pack four months ago. The dreams are still happening and sometimes I feel like reality and fiction are merging together to the point that I can't remember if I just dreamt something or that it really happened. I take Cymbalta, but do not know if any studies were done to see if the two drugs together can cause this. I will continue to take my Cymbalta forever if only to help me maintain my sanity.

It took me 3 weeks to stop the cigarettes, I substituted rolling gum wrappers with my hand to help with the hand habit (I don't like gum much but the wrappers are prefect for rolling). It completely helped and I have been smoke free for about 1 year now. I smoked for 10 years. The only complaint was the severe mood changes for about 3 months after I got off the medication and I too had very vivid dreams but not scarey. My advice be careful with this medication. Have friends and family around to support you and keep you grounded.

Took pills for 12 weeks.Had myself down to one pack a day prior to quitting by only smoking on back porch. When I quit I stayed away from the back porch.Did not know of other peoples horror stories prior to using.  Had I known then what I know now I would have had second and third thoughts about using product.  But I do know that for me I would never have been able to quit without Chantix or something like it.  I also know if I have one cigarette I'll be back to where I was before quitting.

I have been smoking for over 20 years.  I could feel the medicine working even after the 1st day.  I have had some side effects though including vivid dreams, difficulty sleeping, nausea and now I have a head cold that feels like it is turning into the flu except that I look the flu shot. I don't have any cravings for cigarettes though.  I think I'm going to start to slowly ween myself off over the next week and hope I don't have any cravings.  So far so good except for side effects.

If my family had bet money on my quitting, they would have all bet against me.  I tried gum and patches, more than once.  This worked because you are still smoking when you go through physical withdrawl.  Then, you only have to get over the &quot;hand to mouth&quot; addiction.  I chew plastic straws and eat sugar free candy.  I am smoke free for 2 months and I feel great!  After week 2, I did have odd thoughts, but cut my dosage to half a pill, once a day.  That took care of the problem.  The vivid dreams were not bad at all!

On January 13,2008 she committed suicide by hanging. This is not a good drug. She went to the hospital 4 times the week before she died with all the symtoms of the drug and was sent away. The Er in our Town now knows why people are having these strange symtoms. Tradjic. Don't take it. Go cold turkey, or just keep smoking Death is not worth it. I am sure her little lonely boy would tell you that.

Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/26/2009 10:25:21 AM	I took Chantix for 13 days; the last week at a half dose. The nausea was terrible but I learned pretty quickly how much I needed to eat with it. 2 pieces of PB toast and a small glass of milk would do it if I wasn't super hungry. I had my last cigarette in the morning of the 4th day and I haven't picked them up since. Not a single drag or &quot;cheat&quot; and today is day 76!! I feel like a new person! Honestly I haven't even thought about taking smoking back up again. This was the best thing I could have done for myself. All my friends and family are now starting to follow my lead, and we had all tried numerous smoking cessation methods before this. Nothing worked before. I am thrilled with this medication.

Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/17/2009 12:28:47 PM	I have smoked for 22 yrs. A pack and a half a day. I started taking chantix. On the 8th day I put down the cigarettes. On the 10th day I thought that I would try and smoke a cigarette. I got sick from the cigarette. I said no more. On day 12 I stopped taking the chantix also. I have been smoke free since January 1st without the desire to smoke.
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/15/2009 11:02:26 AM	I have been smoking since the age of 18. I finally decided to quit and asked my dr. about Chantix. Been on the program for about a month, and am smoke free! I have had severe nausea after taking Chantix, but now I eat something before each dose and am fine. Dreams are vivid, but nothing terrible. I have tried the patch, 'Smoke Away', Wellbutrin, and trying cold turkey. This is the only thing that has worked. I was worried starting the drug due to my depression history, but have had no problems. My only complaint today is that I feel that I am forgetting something when I leave the house in the morning. Only then do I realize that I am 'forgetting' to grab my cigarettes and a lighter! I have truly forgotten what it is to be a smoker.
Stop Smoking	StephLK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/10/2009 9:18:52 PM	For 13 years I smoked AT LEAST a pack a day.  If I was out with friends I could go through a pack within hours.  To say I was addicted would be an understatement.  For me it was more than a nicotine addiction.  It was part of my life.  Chantix didn't make quitting easy.  But, it made it possible and I don't think I could've quit without it.  The first week I noticed that I wasn't getting the fix that I normally would get from smoking.  After that I cut back to 3 cigarettes a day but even that was for a short time because it didn't take long before the taste of cigarettes made me nauseaus.  I didn't have the depression or suicidal thoughts that some people have.  The only negative side effect I had was feeling sick to my stomach if I didn't eat enough before taking it but that was a small price to pay..I'll take an upset stomach here and there for a while over a habit that could potentially kill me.

It has helped me tremendously!!  No bad side effects yet, maybe some weird dreams, but nothing bad!  I've had a sore tongue, not sure why that's going on though.... It really curbs your cravings!!

A year and a half later I am still suffering from Post Herpes Nueralgal. I suffer joint pain, burning under my skin, my nerve endings everywhere in my body feel like tingles, sometimes my lips even tingle. I have started smoking again too. I had one doctor diagnois me with fibromyalga. Im not sure any doctor truly knows what is wrong with me.
Stop Smoking	Jeff, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	1/8/2009 1:10:04 AM	Unbeleiveable!  It is as though cigarettes never existed!  I am now in week 2 of the dosage and I have to say it is like a miracle.  I tried the patches, and the Wellbutrin to no avail.  As soon as the patch was gone, I wanted cigarettes, and Wellbutrin worked as intended by making them taste bad, but I wanted them just the same.This on the other hand is just purely God sent.  My first few days of quitting were riddled with tough spots, because I saw myself as more of a habbit smoker, as opposed to nicotene craving, thus situations which normally constituted smoking, and the lack thereof, were troublesome.  But I must say, as my shining moment thus far.  I woke up this morning and made it about an hour and a half without even thinking about a cigarette, and even then it wasn't in a wanting sense, it was just a random thought.  For anyone who needs proof it works, I am it.  I had tried the other methods, but this one works!Did have some leg cramps and general bodyache the first few days though, but I would have taken a brain annurism to feel like I do now, free of those nasty cigarettes forever!You can do it!

It put me in most down and depressed mood.  I woke up crying one day and could feel the actual depression.  I would rather take my chances at COLD TURKEY than go through this.  I stopped it immediately and within a day felt better.
Stop Smoking	noneofyourbusiness, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/4/2009 2:18:38 AM	I smoked for 11 years, tried Chantix in May 2008 and quit completely after 8 weeks.  I had vivid dreams.  I also had intense stomach pain after taking a dose, but this only occurred if I did not eat beforehand.  I had a bought of severe depression several years ago, but had no psychological reactions to Chantix.  The medication is expensive if your insurance does not cover it, but it is well worth it--I am presently taking care of a loved-one who has lung cancer.

However, the side effects are miserable (except for the vivid dreams, which I still miss having now!). I experienced severe depression and suicidal ideation, never attributing it to the drug while I was taking it. And this side effect worsened after I stopped taking it. I was a month or more of psychological hell going through withdrawal, and I had never experienced anything like it, and hope to never do so again. I also have kidney problems now, that I can only attribute to this medication. I'd rather keep smoking and risk dying of cancer, than destroy my kidneys by ever taking it again, or end up killing myself. I recommend that if you take this, tell your friends, family and co-workers you are on it, and to ask them to note changes in your mood or behavior that you may not be aware of yourself while on it, or after discontinuing it. I wish I had told people, so perhaps someone could have prevented the hell I went through taking it, as it was so not worth it. While I understand many people have had success, as far as I'm concerned, it was no wonder drug at all, and could have cost me my life much faster than smoking. Never again.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/28/2008 11:47:31 AM	I smoked for almost 20 years heavily, and had tried to quit many times before (once quit for 2.5yrs.) but always craved cigarrettes and was one puff from being hooked again. Chantix has been a miracle. I did have stomach ache with it so we halved my dosage, and I was able to quit within a few weeks completely, and had no adverse side effects. I have been quit a year and a half BUT the difference this time is I could care less about smoking, I can't believe I EVER smoked and I have zero desire to ever smoke again. It has been a wonderful miracle for me. I would like to note I started exercising (not overly, maybe 30 min. 3x a week on elliptical) to offset any depression, I had no depression. Before when I quit I was distraught. I took Chantix for a little under 6 mos. b/c I wanted to make sure I was quit forever. And I am! My counselor suggested Chantix to me. I also take Wellbutrin so that probably helped with no depression as well. Another great drug.  
Stop Smoking	fbcclaire, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/22/2008 1:36:45 PM	I smoked a 10-15 cigarettes a day and I took Chantix for 1 month and quit.  The first week on Chantix, I was smoking less because I did not have any urges or cravings.  The first couple days that you don't smoke were hard for me, but got easier just as fast.  I found that if I took the Chantix exactly 12 hours apart, I had no problems (the first week you don't smoke).  I recommend this medication to anyone wanting to quit smoking.  It works!  I have been smoke free for 4 months now and I have no problems being around people who smoke (I quit Aug 2008)

Stop Smoking	Carla, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/17/2008 1:32:15 PM	I am on my fourth week of Chantix. I do feel it is helping, but I feel as if I have an ulcer.  Only had one or two wild dreams.  The nausea has pretty much gone away now that my stomach is killing me all the time and I seem to have a headache even when I wake up in the morning.  Maybe it is the lack of the cigarette.  My father quit smoking years ago without drugs and was plagued by canker sores in his mouth for two solid years, so that is probably not the drug either.  I have a large one in my throat and one on the end of my tongue. Hoping all this is due to lack of nicotine and will go away.  Last weekend had the muscle and joint pain severely, thought I had the flu. Gonna try and stick it out.

(My mother and father both suffer from depression.) I have never had a problem with depression myself until I took Chantix. I did quit smoking but when I quit taking the Chantix, I fell into a deep and very scary depression. I started smoking again and am now on Lexapro for depression. I have been on Lexapro for a year now. I was the type of person that said I would not be affected by side effects, but I was wrong. During this I missed two weeks of work and temporarely moved back in with my mom because I never wanted to be alone. I couldn't sleep, couldn't focus on anything, didn't eat, lost 10 pounds. It was really bad. It was a complete waste of money and very terrible experience. If I could go back in time, I would have never taken Chantix. Please be careful and make sure you go back to your doctor right away if you start felling different at all.

Stop Smoking	galaxylove, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/4/2008 10:57:35 PM	I have been a chain smoker for 10 years. I tried everything and nothing could help me stop. I have now been completely smoke free for 2 months thanks to Chantix! The 1st couple of weeks were the toughest because I was severly short tempered and would go on a rampage for nothing, but I believe that was because of no cigaretts; It would have happened without the medicine! My family understood and supported my need to shut myself in my room for a while and it passed in about 2 weeks. And the vivid dreams are Great! Like going to cool, weird movies. Ever so often I may have a craving, but I can turn my thought to something else very easily and the craving will be gone! I Highly recommend Chantix if you really want to quit! It sure helped me! I feel much better now. My husband and my kids are very proud of me. As I am proud of myself and the Chantix! I send Thanks and my deepest gratitude for the developers of Chantix for helping me take control back in my life. Thank You!

Stop Smoking	ZYNE, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/2/2008 2:00:08 PM	Been smoking for 16 years, the last 3 years in excess of 2 packs/day.  Finally decided to try chantix since my prior attempts to quit has failed.  In 12 days I went from 40-45/day to zero.  I have very little, if any real cravings .. The side effects of the drug itself includes vivid and often bizarre dreams, often good for a laugh or two the following day.  The stomach upset is easily addressed by taking the medication with a real meal in the morning and the same in the evening.  Have had no bad effects of Chantix after the initial &quot;almost 2 weeks&quot; and I'm very pleased with the results so far.  
Stop Smoking	camiol, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/1/2008 1:49:20 PM	I've been on Chantix since mid September.  I love it!  My only complaint is that I had severe nausea after taking the second pill each day so I cut back to just taking the morning pill.  I do have dreams but they're not as vivid since I only take one pill a day.  I go through a bit more withdrawal not taking the recommended dose, but it's tolerable.  I'll just continue taking the pills until the prescription runs out, even if I'm taking them longer than the prescribed time.  Alot of people have commented on being constipated with this pill.  I've quit smoking several times before and constipation is part of it.  To avoid this I have a slimfast shake in the morning with about 4 tbsp of ground flax and 3 tbsp of hemp mixed into it.  Not only does it keep the plumbing working in top form, it's very filling.  I've been smoke free since October 27 and feel great!

However I am now under the care of a psyciatrist because of extreme anxiety and loss of mental function.  The doc wont admit to any connection to Chantix even though Ive never had any problems before.  I am hoping to find others with these problems through other forums since this one is just a review. I was on this drug for six months, and have been off for three and the problems wont go away.

I really did very well with this drug, but the dreams that I had where terriable!!!! I would wake up in the middle of the night and think that I was dieing, or sufficating. It was very scary. The drug is diffenitly not for everyone!! But, it was worth it.
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	25-34	11/16/2008 12:16:49 AM	I have tried the patch and quitting cold turkey before and this is by far the best way to quit smoking. I due deal with sickness after I have taken it, even if I take it with a full meal. But I have found that eating a light snack helps. I tried taking this medication a year ago but had to get off it. I have anxiety problems and I had recently gotten off Lexapro and found that chantix alone made my anxiety worse. This time I am taking my lexapro with it and it hasn't affected my anxiety. I do have strange and vivid dreams, but nothing scary. I've started talking in my sleep as well. It definitely helps with the cravings. I still get them but I can easily occupy myself until they go away. But these seem like small side effects to deal with when I think of the greater benefits of being a non-smoker!!

After I started taking it, I was under the impression it would make the cravings go away and I wouldn't want a cigarette. What it did, was make me sick. I did have the vivid (but good) dreams and the nausea right after I took it. I had to ween myself off smoking and smoke less and less each day. After I had gone one wk without smoking, I knew I was doing good. Chantix helped a little with actually quitting, but it did not take the cravings away. It was all on me that had to do the work. Chantix really just made me sick when I did smoke a cigarette.. Overall.. I quit myself. Chantix just gave me great dreams and made me really nauseas and moody

I've noticed that young males tend to report better results than anyone else, and males in general seem to do better than females. The question of drug interaction is not really addressed much here, though. Perhaps you should ask a really good neurologist. Good luck to your son.

Stop Smoking	lavj, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/2/2008 4:08:59 PM	I am beginning week 5 smoke free after being a 30 year smoker. I have had very few side effects from Chantix and it is really helping me to quit. Believe me I have tried EVERYTHING !! I am having a few sleeping issues, but I don't know for sure if it is the Chantix or menopause issues! I would love for anyone that might have had a problem with kanker sores in the mouth after starting this medication would post it on this site. I have been having these for 2-3 weeks now and my doctor can't seem to figure out what is causing them. He does know it is NOT oral cancer. Never had this problem before, so thought it might be a side effect of taking the Chantix, but want to know if anyone else has had this problem. Except for that I am happy to finally find something that helped me to quit.

Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/28/2008 5:02:21 PM	After many years of trying to stop I never thought Chantix would help. I have been smoke free for 12 days and not taking the medicine at all. I only took it for 2 weeks. NO CRAVING, NO WEIGHT GAIN. I did have some side effects like headache,body ache and upset stomach but went away when I ate a pack of crackers and than took my medicine early in the morning than took it around 5. Never had any problems with sleeping. NEVER had bad dreams,moody or sucidal thoughts. I can't I have been wanting to be smoke free for a long time and when my granddaughter was mocking me smoking that was it. You have to want to QUIT to do this. I would recommend it to anyone, by the way 5 other employee's have started this week. Good luck to you all. If I can help with any questions or advice email me at dana.bullard@comcast.net

I reaaly was looking forward to no more smokeing with the help of this med but WOW the side effects just changed me. I became bizzare and felt like crying one moment to wanting to smash everything in sight the next moment to being unexplaining happy. And this is all in addition to the intense headache which remains with me evan after stopping this medication.Avoid takeing this stuff
Other	KP, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	10/25/2008 9:47:24 AM	I was so excited when I asked my Doc to prescribe Chantix!  I made sure that I asked him and my pharmasist about any drug interactions that may occur (as I was taking Cimbalta) I was assured that none had been reported.  Within a week the side effects were so severe that I took myself off of the Chantix immediately.  The depression was so intense that it mimicked a PTSD episode; I was afraid to sleep except during the day, hypervigilant, startle reactions were extreme.  I was close to suicide and would have welcomed death at that point.  These side effects went on for about 6 weeks and I feel that they were due to damage to the brain receptors that occured while taking it.  If I hadn't been so familiar with my depression (as most people are not) I may have commited suicide.I contacted Pfizer and talked to a nurse who was a Quality Department employee to report what had happened.  They gave me a full refund for the RX that I had purchased with no argument at all.We all have to be aware of what our bodies/minds are doing, the doctors don't always know everything and they can learn from us.  I'm lucky because I have a doc that actually LISTENS to me.Please do your research before you begin taking meds that effect your brain function and that may have drug interactions.  We are responsible for our own health.Good luck to you all that are trying to quit smoking!

Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	45-54	10/23/2008 4:56:44 PM	DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!! I took chantix for 2 weeks in october of last year.  I have not smoked for since oct 15th 2007. I have gone from a normal healthy life to living on antidepressants, sleeping meds, joint and muscles pains and a variety of other health issues.  It has changed my thought process and I would rather be smoking then &quot;living like this&quot;. My husband and I agree that at least smoking kills you slowly. Chantix ruins your life. Not to mention on the new medical expenses.

You have to want to quit in order to quit.  This drug gives you support for the mental cravings but it won't break your habbit.  You have to want to quit.  The only side effects that I am having are the crazy dreams and waking up two hours into sleep.  I fall right back to sleep with no problems and sleep the rest of the night.  I have been smoke free since my quit date and I am recomending this to anyone that wants to quit.  I quit cold turkey 9 years ago and started back up again 2 years later.  This by far has been much easier.  I have zero craving for a smoke.

Still have the craving to smoke along with the need for the nicotine. But I have cut down to 4 smokes a day, for 5 days now. Im planning on quitting tomorrow we will see what happens. It says it takes 7 days to get into your system, I think that depends on your body weight and muscle mass. Since I weigh only 113lbs I think it has allready started to work, because of the not sleeping well last night. Good luck to all that are taking this medication stick with it!!

Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	10/7/2008 1:52:45 PM	Was a 30-year, pack-a-day smoker. Today is Day 92 of quitting.  No problems quitting, altho think I would like one now and again (but that's not an option for me, because I'm totally committed to quitting).  You have to still want to quit, Chantix can't do it all.  First month went great, but noticed increased agitation in months 2 and 3, and a bit of depression.  I'm usually upbeat and laid back!  Also had nausea regardless of eating beforehand for all three months.  Dreams were cool!  I'm not sure if I'd recommend it or not, but so far, it IS the only thing that has worked for me.  Good luck, everybody!

I do not feel as though I need to smoke but I do still want to smoke. I still buy a pack a week. The side effects are killing me. I cannot take the full dose every day due to the nightmares and insomnia. I don't want to take this medicine anymore.
Stop Smoking	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/2/2008 8:10:19 PM	I'm on Day 3 of treatment, the urge to smoke has disappeared.  I'm still smoking (plan to stop on Day 8 as instructed), but every cigarette I have is one I want, not need.  Am suffering no side effects at all other than vivid (easier to remember after waking) dreams.  I'll post a follow-up after a couple more weeks of use, but as of right now I'm confident I'll be a non-smoker in less than a week.  Fantastic, considering I've been a pack-a-day smoker for 30 years now.
Stop Smoking	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	10/1/2008 6:11:20 AM	10x Better than bupropion/Wellbutrin!!! I've been taking Chantix for about 4 weeks now.  Only reason I can't put 5 stars in the Satisfaction rating is because of the absolute destruction of my sleeping habit.  I'll fall asleep normally and wake up a couple hours later (usually after some really neat dream sequence) and not be able to fall asleep for about 4-5 hours.  Aside from that and a bit of nausea if not taken immediately after eating, it has worked exactly as prescribed.  All the side effects were previously noted and expected so really no surprises to me.  I can even go out to the smoking area during breaks and not have to urge to &quot;bum&quot; one.  Feels great!!!

I am getting off of this chantix after being on it for 7 weeks, i would rather live a short but happy and peaceful life and die from smoking then to live like i am now.  Good luck to everyone.  BE CAREFUL and read everything you find on chantix.  Chantix is worst then smoking.  OH MY GOD, i hope my thoughts are not like this forever.  Good Luck

Twenty years later, I was diagnosed with emphseyma and prescribed Chantix to quit smoking. I have not smoked in 6 weeks thanks to Chantix. It will cause some nausea if not taken with food but other than that, the only other &quot;side-effect&quot; that I've experienced is very vivid dreams. I like the dreams though...nothing scary.

At the sametime though at the begining it did make me sick to my stomach for like 35 min. after taking the pill this subsided after the first couple of weeks. Also it made me a little hyper (speed) off the pills for up to 3 hours after taking the pill.

Amazing to experience. I continued Chantix and smoking until the last dose, then quit. I had my doc prescribe welbutrin for the emotional withdrawl. I've been smoke-free for 2.5 months after having smoked for 39 years and don't miss it.
Stop Smoking	sekan97, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	9/13/2008 8:10:07 PM	I had smoked a pack a day for 20 years. I started Chantix on 7/19/08 with a quit date of 7/26/08. I am smoke free for 8 full weeks and I feel wonderful. My husband loves the way I smell now. As soon as I quit, the smell of cigarette smoke made me physically ill. Now I can tolerate it. It certainly isn't tempting. My #1 complaint is that if I miss a dose of Chantix, I find that I become quite irritable and have little to no patience at all when normally I have tons of patience. Another mildly annoying side effect was the nausea if I didn't eat enough food or drink enough water with the dose. Simply solved though by drinking plenty of water &amp; eating enough food. Yes, I have gained 16 pounds but I find that is due to the fact that I am now eating more when I am bored. Whereas I used to smoke whenI was bored instead of eating.  My doctor suggested 6 months of treatment but I am going to start weaning myself off. I have a feeling I have already become dependent upon the meds to stabilize my moods. BUT.... as others have said before me, in the grand scheme of things, I would do it again in a heartbeat. I feel 100% better being smoke free.... I suggest Chantix to every smoker I know that is thinking of quitting. Thank you Chantix!!!

Stop Smoking	cancer vs psychosis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/6/2008 2:21:42 PM	Took Chantix briefly to stop smoking. It caused severe nausea and vomiting. In addition, around the time I took this medicine, I had what I could only describe a psychotic episode, unlike anything I had ever experienced. My behavior became uncharacteristic of my personality. I was so utterly depressed that I missed a week of work and even sliced my forearm repeatedly with a razorblade one night while my family was sleeping, and then went back to bed, streamed blood drying on my arm. Never before and never since have I felt or behaved like this.  This drug is scary for me personally.  I would rather die early from smoking than feel this type of mental anguish again.

It worked, but now my doc has me on generic Paxil for a mood disorder.  I am sure my condition is related to taking the Chantix.  I noticed within the first 2 months of taking it that I was having wild episodes of mania.  I thought that I was just so elated to be quitting smoking.  I realize now that this drug had some kind of effect on my brain.  I wish the &quot;powers that be&quot; would really study this and find out how many people are affected this way.  Anybody else?

Stop Smoking	artva, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	2	Female	35-44	8/6/2008 11:48:51 PM	I have been on this medicine since the last week of april 2008.My husband had a heart attack so we both wanted and needed to quit smoking.Before we started the medicine we were smoking 2 to 3 packs daily,and now after a little over 3 months of the medicine i still smoke,but only 6 cigaretts a day,but my husband has only went down to 1/2 to 3/4 a pack daily.We both have been wanting to quit smoking,even before his heart attack.Now we are slowly taking our selves of the medicine because for me i have been depressed,hopeless,sad,and wanting to kill myself,I had instant weight gain upon taking the medicine but i have less of an appetite,i always feel bloated,occationaly sick  or upset stomach.My husband has experienced anxiety problems,short tempered or moody,upset stomach all the time having trouble sleeping.We both wanted so much to quit smoking all together,but we both can not handle any more of the problems we are haveing since we started taking the medicine.We are looking in on some other way to help us quit smoking.but it is sad that after3 months we still smoke,after reading how alot of people have quit with in 2 to 4 weeks.This medicine may be good for some people,and we are happy for them but we are not happy with the medicine.

Stop Smoking		4	4	4			8/4/2008 4:11:29 PM	I know it's kind of dumb for me to post on my expierence already because it's only my 3rd day but after 1-2 packs a day, I really don't even want a cigarette. Unfortuneatly, I am having some problems with depression...hoping that is normal and will go away shortly but so far I am pretty impressed with this drug!
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	4	4	3	Female	25-34	8/1/2008 8:48:38 PM	Chantix worked very well for me but I still have difficulty with the habit. The addiction is gone but I feel like I lost a part of my personna.
Stop Smoking	Jen Lov, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/28/2008 2:52:01 PM	It worked for me in as little as two weeks.  I was a pack a day smoker. First of all you have to really want it.  Then commit yourself to quitting.  The med made me a bit sick to my stomach the first week- then headache and constipated.  I stopped taking the end of the second week. I am now into the 4th week and have no urges to smoke.  You also have to change some social practices.  Mine was in the morning i drank coffee and smoked-  So i also gave up coffee.  I hate smoking and i really hope to never pick up this gross habit again.  I hate having something that dominates me or controls me like smoking did.  I wish everyone lots of luck.  And the benefits far out weigh the risks in my opinion.... just get on it, quit, and get off ASAP.  Dont drag it out.  God Bless
Stop Smoking	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/24/2008 12:39:39 PM	As a smoker for more than 10 years, I was also a quitter numerous times. None being as succcessful as I was using Chantix. I am the type of person with a ton of allergies, and a weak stomach-I will react to anything, yet I experienced hardly any of the side effects, have not once had withdrawal symptoms, and am completely and thoroughly turned off by smoking. It disgusts me that I even did it for so long, that is how well this drug works. I finished one and one half weeks of treatment and was done. I still have two full dose packs left! I am very very amazed by this drug, and would recommend it to anyone who is seriously wanting to quit. 
Stop Smoking	Jwest, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	7/21/2008 8:07:30 PM	Chantix does what it says.  It helps you quit smoking.  When I decided to quit, I consulted my DR.  He recommended Chantix.  You start off with the &quot;Week 1&quot; pack, which is 0.5mg of the drug once a day for 4 days. (I took it in the morning, but make sure you take it with food.) Then, you take 0.5mg twice a day for the next 3 days.  On day 7, you are supposed to acutally quit smoking.  I smoked 1 cigarette that day, and it was my last.  Then for the next 3 weeks, I took 1mg twice a day.  I experienced little to no side effects, except for the extremly random and vivid dreams. (One person explained them like this, &quot;I love going to sleep now. It's like going to the movies!&quot;)  Chantix was so effective, that for a full month after I quit, I drove around in my car with a full pack of cigs and never smoked ONE!  It even was not uncomfortable to go to the bar, or be around smokers.  If you are really serious about quitting, then I urge you to talk to your doctor about Chantix.  Good luck quitting!P.S. Chantix comes with a mediocre support program. Having said that, I really think it was worth the read.  (http://www.getquit.com) 
Stop Smoking	Linny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	7/13/2008 6:09:32 PM	If all you care about is quitting then this is IT. This drug more effectively and more thouroughly breaks ones dependence on nicotine.  The problem is that in altering the brain chemicals it could also possibly break ones relationship with all other items in life. I threw up the morning dose if I did not eat A LOT! I've gained about 30 lbs, woke up crying several times from dreams, am VERY angry, and I have very little will to live, but the good news is after 2 weeks without the drug I'm still not smoking (even when I want to).  I AM STILL NOT SMOKING and if I can stay out of the pen and out of the morgue, I MIGHT even have a life again at some point...MAYBE... But I'm NOT smoking and after all, that's what is important, right?
Stop Smoking	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	7/10/2008 7:53:04 PM	Headaches, irritability, anger.....of course. Ever try and quit before? It's called withdrawl!! The drug works great people. You just have to get through the chemical withdrawl. Because of the drug you're body doesn't get any effects from the nicotine it's been getting for 20 plus years. It's normal and goes away after a few days. Chantix works much better than any other treatment I've tried. The dreams are vivid but if you have a good dream it just makes it better. If you have nightmares go to a psychiatrist, don't blame the drug. You were messed up before you started taking it.
Stop Smoking	azjln, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	7/10/2008 5:16:55 PM	38 years a smoker and many times a quitter, the longest during my pregnancies and nursing my children, and even hypnosis didn't work as Chantix has for me.  My big problem with the drug is constipation which is hitting me big at the end of my 10th week.  I've neither had nor wanted a smoke although the scent outside the grocery store is inviting.  My husband quit after the hypnosis that didn't work for me over 2 years ago and it's wonderful to enjoy the shared kisses now.  I consulted my doctor and received physical tests prior to being prescribed this drug.  There have been no mood swings, no behavior problems, nothing like that, but I've had restlessness and vivid, odd dreams that have had no effect on me after waking.  Consult your doctor and be honest with him or her before you decide on this option to stop smoking.  I'm happy I did.
Stop Smoking	JimK, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	7/9/2008 9:28:30 AM	I took Chantix from July 31, 2007 through August 28, 2007.  On or about my third week I started to experience facial numbness.  Early in September the right side of my face became completely numb; was tested for a stroke it came back negative.  I also started to experience a burning sensation in my hands and feet; muscle aches in my hamstrings; and periods of total weekness particularly on my right side.  I was visted the ER four times in 2 months.  Prior to taking Chantix I had not visited the ER since 2001 and that was got a head injury to my son.  I was subsequently diagnosed with diabetes and sub-clinical hyperthyroidism.I remained smoke free for approximately 3 months but with the ensuing problems I encountered I continually recommend anyone from taking Chantix.I was also extremely angry at the FDA for allowing Pfizer to include a patient information sheet that lacked full disclosure of the side effects associated with Chantix, even the updated patient information sheet is inadequate.  Although the patient sheet informs the user about the possibility of suicidal ideation, the warning sheet mitigates this particular side effect by claiming it may be linked to nicotine withdrawal.  I did experience panic attacks and as I said other physical problems, none of which are listed on the Patient Warning Information.  My overall opinion for this drug is that it is overrated.  Also it was poorly tested prior to its introduction to the market place.  The drug from which Chantix is a derivative, cytisine, has been around much longer, over 50 years(Europe Only) and I don't think there have been as many problems associated with cytisine as there has been with Chantix.    
Stop Smoking	Beth, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	7/9/2008 9:07:36 AM	This drug almost killed me by hypokalemia. I hate Pfizer the FDA and the doctors for allowing a drug they call medicine which is really a poison. I quit cold turkey and it was much better. The harm this drug caused is still effecting me and there is no cure. DO NOT take this drug but do quit smoking.
Stop Smoking	Msprof, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	7/8/2008 11:01:31 PM	I have not had a cigarette in over 9 months, but, I wish I still smoked.  I have been through hell with Chantix.  I got very depressed, aggressive, etc.  I stopped taking it in December, and then absolutely fell apart by the end of January.  I still have problems with depression, concentration, mood, temper, etc.So, if anyone wants to do the &quot;you're just mad you didn't quit smoking&quot; thing, I can counter that argument.  I DID quit smoking, but at an incredibly high price.  Quite frankly, right now the main thing that keeps me from smoking again is because I NEVER EVER EVER want to have to take a medication that makes me that depressed and hopeless.  This medication DEFINITELY works for some people, with no side effects.  And I realize that people who are anti-smoking think the benefits outweigh the &quot;risks.&quot;  But, the real problem is no one KNOWS the risks, yet, because they didn't study them long-term.  There is still information we don't know.Meanwhile, I have a very &quot;intellectual&quot; job.  I can do it from a wheelchair if I have to, but I absolutely have to have a sharp mind, and I haven't had one in almost a year.  I do not recommend this drug for people who need their brains to earn a living.

Stop Smoking	Deceived, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Male	35-44	7/8/2008 10:13:59 PM	I took Champix for 3 months (started february 1st to end of april), while i was on Champix i had the common symptoms: nausea, lost of memory, headaches, weird dreams and sleeping problems and some joint and muscle pain.After I stopped Champix the joint and muscle pain got worse and did not leaved me yet 8 weeks after I stopped the use of this drug.  I still can hardly walk in the morning as my legs and feet hurt so much and during the day i have much pain in upper back, elbows and shoulders,  tingling and numbness in my arms and hands.  In the few days after i stopped Chantix I also experienced muscle spams from my thorax, every 30 seconds, and pain at the eyes.The ratio of people experiencing joint and muscles pain is 1/100.  Pfizer did not tell it in its documentation when i started to take Chantix.  If I knew the risk i was taken, i would not have used this medication for sure.  Now more than 40 000 of people are suffering from those joint and muscle pain.
Stop Smoking	phxeyes1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	2	1	Female	45-54	7/8/2008 7:25:11 PM	I acquired something NO ONE warned me about. Perfectly healthy UNTIL I took this poison. Now I have diabetes, just one of the horrible side effects they don't tell you. I also experienced problems with remembering things, depression, thoughts of suicide for no reason, aggression &amp; easily aggitated, some of which I still suffer from. Chantix has a history of over 3000 reported serious injuries to the FDA. Check out whyquit.com &amp; search Chantix. I WOULD ADVISE NO ONE TAKE THIS DRUG UNTIL FURTHER RESEARCH IS DONE.

The nausea has remained,it's less severe if you eat first and drink a full glass of water. I had vivid dreams initially, not any more. The side effects are worth being smoke free. Chantix is awesome!!

Stop Smoking	Ashley, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/2/2008 5:39:07 PM	I could only afford to take this medicine for 8 weeks as opposed to the full 12 weeks. It's expensive!  But I have to say that I have not smoked a cigarette in 8 weeks and that I loved this medication. The only side effect I had was I did have VIVID dreams-not night terrors. I also had a headache the first 3 days of taking the medication.  I do get cravings for a cigarette every once in a while..but they pass.  Now it is just a mind game not to smoke.  
Stop Smoking	alyk03, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	6/1/2008 9:36:42 PM	So, I've been taking Chantix for almost 2 weeks, and I've smoked a cigarette or two, but they taste disgusting. I'm happy that I'm not smoking and everything, but I've had a CONSTANT headache for almost the entire 2 weeks, so I'm going to the dr. tomorrow to see if I can't do something about them. The other symptom that has really affected me is the nausea / gas and bloating. I would definately recommend that anyone with IBS, Chrones, or any other stomach related problems try something else first because it has really done a number on my stomach. My best suggestion, eat first.

I thought quitting would be the hardest thing I have ever done but it has been pretty effortless thanks to Chantix! There are some side effects deal with such a bad dreams, upset stomach and gas but it is all well worth it to be smoke free. I could not be happier...thank you Chantix!

I am so happy with Chantix and am spreading the word to everyone I know.

Stop Smoking	Master Shake, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/24/2008 2:12:17 PM	The only problem I've had with this medication is naseua. Anyone that says it's not easy to use is delusional. It's like birth control but after the 3rd day you take it twice instead of once. I'm on day 4 and thinking of cigarettes makes me ill, so it's serving its purpose. I'd take a mild case of naseua anyday over cancer, emphazima, etc. So for those of you that want to quit but are having a hard time on your own, Chantix gives you the extra boost you need. I highly recommend it.

It was an awful experience and I dumped the rest of my prescription down the toilet.  The good news is that I have been tobacco-free for 2 weeks shy of a year, but the only credit I give Chantix is that it enabled me to get myself launched and for my  willpower to take over from there.

I think the drug is very effective, it also helps if you are really serious about quiting.  My side effects are being tired all the time and having a short fuse.  I would strongly recomend this to anyone.

I took it for three month (I had to reduce the dose because it was to strong.The only side effect I had was that I was verbaly abuses to my husband.Which I hated and I really don't know how he put up with me for so long.After I stop taking chantix the urges to smoke came back,so I tried a cigarett and it was gross and gave me headaches. I am still having those urges I went back on chantix taking 1mg a day.I believe this drug really works along with WILL POWER.
Stop Smoking	kgjartist, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/14/2008 5:45:24 PM	This drug is WONDERFUL! I have smoked for 35 yrs 1+pk a day.  The first week they did't even taste good.  I am in my 3rd week, and have had about 5 cigs in the last two weeks.  Just tossed 1/2 pack in the garbage.  I'm done.  No real cravings for nicotine.. just the emotional need to smoke, but that is leaving me too.  Side effects?  Yes, Gas, bloating, constipation, but I can live with that.  Just remember to take the pill with food and water as it is a little hard on your stomach.  I have been using lemon/honey sugar free cough drops as a substitute for smoking. They tend to open up you sinuses and lungs which is a good substitute for the deep inhale you do with smoking. It is important to eat foods that do not add to the gas problem, and watch what you eat.  Three weeks now, and I have not gained a pound.  Weight gain is a big issue with me, so I'm very happy with this product.  Good luck to all of you!

Since then I had moderate to extreme anxiety/panic for 3 months after stopping the drug. In addition, I can't sleep. I dream all night and get up exhausted. That started the second week on Chantix. I have been off it for 5 months and still dream all night long. I don't know how to make it stop. I would not recommend taking this drug. You may end up with more problems than you started with.

I have to say though it does make you feel kinda strange at times, and is hard to fall asleep and stay a sleep. Other than the few issues ive mentioned, i would reccomend Chantix to stop smoking. It really does help.

My insurance doesn't cover the cost so I cut the dose in half and felt more urge to smoke.  I have been out for a few days and the urge is just as strong as it was before Chantix.  It works very well if you want to quit.  Nausea if not taken with food and gas/bloating are a pain.  I found when taking 2 doses a day that if I took the 2nd dose at suppertime, the dreams were cut WAY back.  I have to pick up my refill tonight and am glad that I'm getting more.
Stop Smoking	Lindalu, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/27/2008 1:56:17 PM	After 40 years of smoking, I finally decided the time to quit HAD ARRIVED.  Spent a month preparing myself for this new way of life -- only smoking 1/2 a cigarette, also using water as a substitute.  Had decided not to tell my family or any friends that I was prepping myself for a new way of life.  You know how it is, if one fails at something like this, family and friends never let one forget about the failure.  Saw my doctor, got my prescription and never have smoked again.  While it's only been 2.5 months, I'm considering myself a non-smoker.  Physically I feel great and feel that I'm no longer held hostage by nicotine.  Had a few of the side effects but, in the long run, they haven't been a problem.  For anyone really wanting to quit, Chantix may be the answer.  I'm still amazed that it's worked for me.  If you're ready to quit, I wish you luck -- you CAN do it!

While I was taking it, I was able to quit smoking. Then figured I didn't need the Chantix anymore so I stopped the use of it. I started again April 10th of this year and was smoke free once again within the first 7 days. I still get some urges to light up but not like I must. The side effects are strange. First off (my favorite) the dreams are irregular, and the sleep...forget about it. Not refreshing. I'm bloated and sometimes can't make a b.m.. My mood has changed slightly as I am more irritable with much shorter patience. If you can look past that, its amazing how it works. I'm just hoping there is no dependency. Hope this helps ya.
Stop Smoking	Non-Smoking Cricket, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/22/2008 2:52:38 PM	Not a New Year's resolution, but 01/05/08, began taking medication.  Smoked at least a pack a day.  Started medication, &amp; prior to quit date, was smoking 1/2 a cigarette a day, to finish out what was at home.  When cigarettes ran out, never went and bought more.  Husband quit too, but cold turkey.  I had some of the sleep, vivid dreams, but about 1 1/2 months in, I simply cut dosage back to one pill a day, in the morning.  Dreams lessened.  Now take 1/2 pill every other day.  Still no desire &amp; smoke free.  I think you really have to want to quit &amp; stop looking for reasons you can't.  Husband smoke free going on 4 months, &amp; I'm past three months, into 4th.  I've been around people who smoke, it doesn't cause me to want one, mostly the smell bothers me, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  To all trying to quit this habit, hang in there, keep at it, I wish you much success &amp; reach for your goals.

I started taking it Feb.1st and stopped smoking Feb.14th. Easiest way to stop smoking. Well worth the minor side effects, weird dreams and metallic taste and gas.Even though it can be expensive its worth it.But still cheaper than buying cigarettes. If you really want to stop smoking no matter how long you have smoked, this stuff works!!! The support you get from the get quit program helps alot to. Chantix has saved my life. I have been happily smoke free for 68 days. I never want to be a smoker again.

Stop Smoking	Mark, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/13/2008 2:29:13 PM	I smoked a pack a day plus for 35 years. Always had an excuse for not quiting. I tried other methods, patch, Zyban, hypnosis, nagging wife. NOTHING worked. Then someone (see nagging wife) suggested Chantix. I had my last cigarette on March 27th 2007. My wife's not nagging anymore and I'm not hacking and coughing anymore. I guess I suffered some of the side effects that others describe on here. But, they were nothing to whine about. I consider my self a NONsmoker now. Thank you Chantix. And oh yea, Thank you too naging wife.
Stop Smoking	skier, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	65-74	4/11/2008 2:58:20 PM	I smoked for 40 years and tried to quit unsuccessfully several times.  This drug is the ONLY thing that has every truly helped in the battle to quit.  By the end of the first week I had no desire to smoke and haven't had more than 2 or 3 urges in the 4 1/2 months since.  Even those were easy to ignore as by the time I stopped smoking at the end of the first week cigarettes tasted just awful.  Therefore my last memory is not a good one.  I feel I've finally done it!

Still have cigarette craving but I feel that the medication made the first day possible(not nearly as hard as I though it would be) and it did help set a date for  me to quit. If symptoms continue-i will ask my doctor if i can stop taking the medication.

This medication really works well by the seventh day I had quite smoking without even trying. It does upset my stomach for about an hour after taking it and I have had some bad dreams, but nothing I cannot live with. In the end, it will have been worth it after all what is a little upset stomach and a few bad dreams compared to a lifetime of being tobacco free?

Stop Smoking	Smokeless in Life, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	35-44	3/25/2008 12:03:06 PM	I was a smoker for over 30 years, smoking one to two packs a day.  I have tried hypnotism, acupuncture, the patch, pills, lozenges, and cold turkey.  None of these worked.  My symptoms have been horrible.  You really have to take this medication with lots of food and water.  It burns my stomach.  I have an ulcer from smoking, so I have to take Prolosec everyday.  The nausea is terrible sometimes, but drink lots of water.  Also, I have had funny dreams, but not nightmares.  I have retained a lot of fluid in my body from this drug.  I have lots of gas, sometimes painful.  I went through a couple of weeks of feeling like I was starving, but now I am back to normal.  Also, remember when you take two pills a day, make sure you take both pills.  If you miss one, you will go back to smoking more.  After awhile of taking this drug, you feel like you are smoking air and don't get that fix you would without it.  I have quit now for two days and I'm going to continue to take it for another two weeks or until I have no more cravings.  The cravings are very weak now and that's enough for me to stop.  This is like a poison going through my body with each dose.  If you can take the side effects, please take this drug because it does work.

Stop Smoking	Happy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	3/24/2008 1:26:37 AM	Chantix is a miracle drug! I was a smoker for 37 years at two packs a day since going to ultra lite cigarettes. Tried to quit once around '95 with the patch. It was not successful. Again, when Zyban came out but had side effects and quit using. When I tried quitting before I had all the typical withdrawal symtoms. Lack of concentration, very grouchy, really irritable, totally preoccupied with the pain I was going through, couldn't sleep - and when I did sleep - had wild, vivid nightmares. I had NONE of these symptoms with Chantix.Went totally smoke free Nov. 29, 2007. Didn't even have any cravings to smoke the whole time.  Only change was a lttle more dreaming.  When I went to bed, it was like going to the movies (could have put a bag of popcorn next to my pillow). They were just dreams, not nightmares like when trying to quit with the patch. And each night they were different. No reruns here!If you really want to quit smoking, and have had difficulty with other choices, try Chantix, it is absolutely amazing. You still need will power to stay smokefree and I imagine that's how it will be from now on out.

Stop Smoking	slim, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/21/2008 3:06:57 PM	I smoked a pack a day for 33 years.  I quit on day 8 of treatment with Chantix.  I had no nicotine withdrawal, and it has been 9 days since I last smoked.  I feel much better alrady, and a confident that I have kicked the habit for good.  As for side effects, I have noticed that dreams are more vivid.  Also, I feel drowsy and require more sleep.  The product really has worked for me.
Stop Smoking	Greg, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	25-34	3/19/2008 12:08:55 PM	I started taking Chantix in late Dec '07. In January of '08 I only smoked 2 or 3 cigarettes. In the beginning of Feb, I had finished the medication and the cravings came back and I also suffered from appendicitis. It was so bad, I had gangrene and emergency surgery. Chantix did take away the cravings, but I believe it also caused my appendicitis. I noticed most the people writing reviews are middle aged women. Maybe Chantix only causes appendicitis in younger males like me.
Stop Smoking	non smoker, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/18/2008 7:36:16 AM	I have smoked since I was 14 and have been a 2 pack a day smoker for the past 20 years.  I have made 2 visits to the emergency room this past year for breathing problems contributed to smoking.  I started this drug in October and have finally quit 10 February.  As for the side effects, I have been constipated for the 1st month.  I tried all kinds of fiber supplements to no avail.  What I discovered finally helped was pounding water.  Drink, drink, drink water when on Chantix.  It does help with the constipation.  I still get naeseated from the medication and have constant gas and bowel movements.  These side effects are minimum compared to gasping for air as I had done during my emergency room visits.  I have over a month of sobriety from cigarettes and can breath allot easier.  To me well worth the risk of side effects.  Everyone has to make the decision for them selves if they want to risk taking Chantix to stop smoking and put up with the side effects.  Don't blame the medication or the Pfizer for creating the drug.  Be responsible make a decision and stand by it.  Stop wining about the side effects.  They are published by Pfizer.  What it really comes down to is my desire to stop smoking.  I live with the side effects and celibrate my quiting every time I take a deep breath.  Thank you Pfizer

Shame on them for pushing this on the public as any sort of remedy. I stopped taking this after Three weeks and it took a week for me to feel like me old easy going self. Good Luck if your trying to quit smoking. This is NOT the best choice for many,HOWEVER it seems to be being PUSHED as a cure all for this addiction. I be waiting for the final results of this latest FDA report.

What a miracle drug, only a few crazy dreams that have kinda been entertaining.  I've had no stomach problems, I was alittle concerned over the depression I've seen that others have had, since I do have just alittle problem with depression, but if anything I've been in a silly mood.  It has made me feel just alittle fuzzy headed, like a medicine head feeling,  my cravings haven't been that bad.  I really should be the poster child for chantix.  So far it's been a miracle for me!!!

My problem is that I had horrible nightmares and about two weeks after I quit the drug,out of nowhere I had a TOTAL mental breakdown. Got emitted to the emergency room now I have to see a therapist,and a physciatrist for extreme depression,anxiety,and insomnia,because the nightmares are still occuring.  Part of me feels blessed to quit smoking after 2 packs a day for 15 years,but at this cost I don't know if it was worth taking the medicine. It's been 12 days since the breakdown and all the Doctors believe its because of the chantix messing up the chemicals in my brain. Has this happened to anyone else?  Will I return to my normal self?  I am now on Prozac for depression,Xanex for anxiety,and Rozerem for insomnia for they say at least 3 months til I get under control.  I am not the person I once was...Hope this helps someone.....

Minor stomach cramping that would last for about 30 mins.  no major psycho dreams either just very weird dreams.  just make sure you have plenty of suckers and gum handy to help with the physical habit.  it's great to be back in control of my life.

Not the patch, the gum, nothing until chantix.  Other times when I have tried to quit I was a maniac.  I was depressed, mean, could not sleep, and my family and friends did not want to be around me.  Until, I used chantix!  Yes there are a few bad side effects like being sick to my stomach for a few minutes and having some very vivid dreams.  But, as I already mentioned, I have tried every other way to quit and feel 100 times better taking this medication than with any of the other options out there.  NO DEPRESSION THIS TIME!! TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!

Make sure you don't contribute your side effects to the pill rather than nicotine withdrawal! I quit smoking the day after I started taking it, stopped the medication completely last week and have not smoked for two months. It's a miracle and I advise it for ANYONE who smokes!

This time I used Chantix and it was the easiest thing I have ever done. By the beginning of the second week, I was down to one, and had totally quit by the beginning of the third week. It was as though I had never even been a smoker at all.   I also did not experience the nausea, headaches or other side effects that I was warned about. Thank God for Chantix!  I am smoke-free and feeling so much better.   My husband and I began Chantix together and he was a 2 pack a day smoker.  He has also had success with the drug and is beginning his second week without a cigarette. It feels so good to be free of this very expensive habit!  I recommend this to everyone who is serious about quitting!

It took me until week 9 to quit completely, but I did!  I just quit taking the prescription about two weeks ago and so far so good!  I think people have to keep in mind that some of these panicky and depressed feelings they are having may be from the withdrawal of not having nicotine.  It seems that everyone is quick to blame the drug, but if you visited a drug rehabilitation hospital, I bet you would find a lot of people with the same symptoms from drug withdrawal.  Your body is going through a lot when you quit smoking.  My thyroid medication even had to be adjusted!  If you really want to quit, you can....if you want to find an excuse not to, there's a million of them.

I have been on Chantix for almost 3 weeks now.  I am experienceing a great amount of depression and anxiety that I have not experienced during other quit attempts.  I am beginning an anti-depressant.  I am not quitting Chantix though.  ALL the hard emotion for 3 weeks, I do not want to quit again.  Will continue on this time.  I did quit on day 8 and never want to start over!
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	2/18/2008 6:05:36 PM	I am on day 7 of taking the pills. On day one I began to lose the pleasure of smoking. I must say it was upsetting. Still smoking but only about 1/2 as much. My only complaint is my tongue always feels very dry and when I do smoke it feels like its burnt. I do have more vivid/very strange dreams but nothing too bad.  I will also say that I have been a nervous/anxious person ALL my life (never been medicated for it though) and have no adverse reactions to this drug. I am completely confident that within the next week or sooner I will be smoke free. I agree with another response here that stated that its not for everyone and we all have to remember we have used smoking to relieve alot of stressors etc in our life and by removing that or even the thought of that can be very upsetting to anyone. I know that I am honestly depressed (in a way) that I am not enjoying smoking anymore. But I know that I will get over this and will be MUCH BETTER OFF in the long run.  Good luck to everyone!
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	2/18/2008 3:11:51 PM	People with anxiety or depression issues SHOULD NOT take this drug! Before taking this drug, both issues had not botherd me in years.  Within two days, I was extremely agitated and unable to control my anger.  Within the first week, my anxiety was throught the roof.  I took it for three weeks and then quit because of the side effects.  That was in November, it is now February and I am still not the same as I was before.  I have been working with my dr, but I am still having problems.  I am afraid I will never get better.  Before taking it, I read reviews and took my chances.  Please dont make my mistake if you have these issues.  DONT TAKE CHANTIX.  Taking it was one of the worst decisions I have ever made!

Stop Smoking	deranger,  Male  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male		2/17/2008 6:25:45 PM	After needing a two month dose, I have been smoke free now since August, 2007(20 year smoker). Aside from a little weight gain, everything is so much better overall, but after 6 months off Chantix, I am now currently experiencing enhanced sensations related to panic attacks and heightened claustrophobia. It has gotten to the point where I cannot fly on airplanes, or sit in the back of a car or bus, etc without feeling an overwhelming panic sensation. No problems with these extreme feelings prior to using Chantix.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	2/15/2008 9:03:52 AM	I have nausea and vomiting and really weird dreams. It's ok though. I've been a smoker for over 25 yrs. It's going to take time to break this habit. From 1 1/2 ppd down to 1/2 ppd. I know....but I am very very satisfied w/the results so far. I find I am smoking out of habit and not urge - thanks to Chantix. I will continue treatment and be smoke free. I have to. I want to see ALL my children grow up. Chantix is a miracle.
Stop Smoking	Quitter, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	19-24	2/13/2008 9:44:57 PM	Today is my 7th day on the pill also my last set date for quitting smoking, I feel very confident in not smoking from today forward. I gave a pack of cigarettes to my annoying neighbor today (who always asks for a cigarette) that pack of cigarettes is one of the 7 packs I had purchased to prepare myself.. I noticed that i dont finish my cigarette nor my usual pack a day. Although the side effects might be a pain here and there, i honestly think it is worth it. Think of the money you'll save, and once this 12week program ends you wont be dealing with the side effects.

Weird dreams, depression, suicidal thoughts, upset stomach, hallucinations. She was being treated for chronic back pain and had medication that could have created an overdose. She was found by my daughter in bed, after I sent her over to check because I couldn't get hold of her while I was out of town. She had been talking weird to her best friend and me the day before and we both got worried. I am still waiting for the results of the toxicology reports from the medical examiners office. Please be very aware of the risks.

Stop Smoking	 Jared, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male	25-34	2/8/2008 8:49:45 AM	I started this medication 8 days ago. Today is my &quot;Quit Day&quot;. I've done the activities they suggest, and while there are still cravings 8 days in, they're not too bad. Keep with it even if you cheat now and then...MAKE SURE TO EAT BEFORE TAKING THE PILLS OR YOU WILL GET SICK!!! I've never been the type to get side effects from anything but the nausea and vivid dreams are obviously there with this drug.  Also, my partner is taking Chantix with me and he is not experiencing many (if any) of the side effects.  So it does vary.  I take this with Aciphex for acid reflux, and I notice even when eating before it sort of bubbles up and makes my stomach sour.  So if you can, don't take any tums, acid reducers, etc (prescription or otherwise) except more than an hour before or after the Chantix...my Dr also said that would reduce it's effectiveness.  Good luck, and wish myself and my partner luck! Quit day: 2/8/2008

I was down to one cigarette a day, and that out of habit. My husband did not take this and he was still smoking. My medication ran out and my cravings came right back. I was to the point that I could go 8 hours without even thinking about a cigarette, when I saw somebody else smoking it did not induce the urge. The medication is wonderful. 
Stop Smoking	Kimc4572, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	2/7/2008 8:33:30 AM	Have been taking Chantix for 6 weeks, not smoking for 29 days and I was a smoker for 20 years.  Some side effects, nausea, interrupted sleep, agitated &amp; jittery.  The nausea stopped after a couple weeks but still experiencing the others along with a little hair loss-more than usual.
Stop Smoking	hanginginthere, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	2	Female	45-54	2/6/2008 9:33:39 PM	My husband and I wanted to quit smoking together and decided it was time to try Chantix. After taking the med for 2 weeks, I am smoke-free while he is down to 2 smokes a day. I am experiencing more difficulties with side efffects, i.e.,nausea, vomiting, dry mouth and metallic aftertaste, weird dreams and spaciness. I am also finding that my sense of smell is overcompensated, increasing the nausea.  Overall, I am thrilled to be smoke-free but am getting discouraged by the side-effects. I recommend to anyone considering trying Chantix to first find a support system, whether it be a partner,or family and friends for encouragement to continue this program. Being able to endure the side-affects remains to be unseen at this time since we are only beginning our third week.  
Stop Smoking	booter, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Male	45-54	2/6/2008 7:14:15 PM	Please do not drink alcohol while taking this drug. I had a suicidal tendancy combining the two. I got severe rashes making it feel like my skin is crawling. Lots of side effects, but it works for quitting. I'm off now after 6 weeks, still not smoking but craving!
Stop Smoking	Matt626, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	2/6/2008 6:50:57 PM	I have been on Chantix for two weeks now and I have never felt better.  After the first week, I have completely stopped smoking starting on Day 8.  During the first week, I could actually feel the medication working.  Towards the end of the week, the pleasure I received from smoking slowly disappeared.  I plan to take the entire 12 week program, and perhaps an additional 12 weeks after that (as suggested by Pfizer and other Chantix boards).  I also would like to note that I am currently on medication for bi-polar depression and have not had any side-effects such as suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, etc.  The only side effect I experienced were a few vivid dreams for the first few days.  I have tried the nicotine patch, gum,  inhaler, and cold turkey prior to this, and never went more than a couple of weeks (including cheating).  This has been the most effective yet.  When I stopped smoking, I had to get over the physiological habits of smoking (smoking breaks at work, waiting for the bus, etc.).  I'm handling those well, but that's probably the toughest part.  The key to quitting effectively after finishing the Chantix program, is just like any other method of quitting, which is to never take another drag again...ever.  If you do, your brain goes right back into the nicotine craving, and you just blew a lot of money on the Chantix routine.  Hope this helps those who choose this option towards quitting smoking.

Stop Smoking	footballmom89, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/4/2008 11:01:59 AM	I smoked a pack/day for 25 years.This rx really worked for me, although I couldn't stop on day 8.I continued taking it, and after week 2 was down to 1/2 a cigarette a day. Couldn't completely stop until week 9, but then it just happened!! I didn't need to cheat anymore!! My advice is that if you are like me and can't quit right away, keep taking the prescription and eventually it will work. I had a 10 pound weight gain and weird dreams, but it was all worth it. I do have depression and get panick attacks but have not noticed any increase since being on this prescription. I also discussed drug interactions with my dr. before I started this. None of my meds were a problem. Good luck to anyone starting!!  Don't give up if it takes you longer than other people!! Keep taking the prescription and try to cut down graduly and it WILL happen!!
Stop Smoking	Kel-FL, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	25-34	2/4/2008 9:50:06 AM	I am in my 4th month of taking this drug. I quite smoking my 2nd week in to taking it. Glad I was able to quit. My side effects are headaches, loss of appetite,vomiting, acidic stomach, nightmares or no sleep, sinus infection. Went to the doctor regarding my sinus infection and she tried to treat it with antibiotics twice and now she put me on more antibiotics and allergy medicine. (I have never had allergies) Would I recommend this product? Yes, because some people have not experienced these side effects. I am glad to have quit smoking and I guess this made me sick enough to realize that if I go back to smoking, I will have to start these side effects all over again. Also, now that I can really smell the smoke on people, IT REALLY STINKS. But if you do try this product be careful of side effects and know how to recognize them.

I stopped taking them the day of my first panic attack. While chantix may work for others I believe the side effects are not worth it.
Stop Smoking	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	2/1/2008 5:52:10 PM	I was put on the Chantix and after starting the twice a day tablet starting having vision problems- even in a sitting position, everything around me would seem to be spinning. If I was walking when this happened, I would have to stop and remain still until the spinning stopped- a minute or two. I tried cutting back on the dosage and the problem still occurred. After stopping the Chantix it happened only once. That was almost 10 months ago and I haven't had the problem since. I firmly believe that it was caused by the Chantix and shudder to think what would have happened had I been driving when this occurred.

Stop Smoking	supercat_63, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	1/27/2008 7:18:01 PM	After about 3 weeks on Chantix I ended up in the hospital with chest pains and shortness of breath I thought I was having a heart attack.  Thank God all my tests came back negative for any heart problems, but the mood swings and the drowsiness were too much to deal with.  I stopped taking the Chantix and can proudly say I am almost at the 100 day mark of being smoke free.  Please check with your doctor before starting this medicine if you have high blood pressure as mine remained high the entire time I took Chantix.

Stop Smoking	CPAVLICH , 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	1/23/2008 2:42:18 PM	Yes - Chantix does what it claims to do!  I am pleased to say I have conquered the evil cigarette!  But,after reading all the other reviews, there are a few observations from my own experience that may be significant.  First, I think hormonal balance (or imbalance) is related to an individual's reaction to this drug.  (Personally, I wasn't sure if the emotional rollercoaster I found myself on was due to Chantix, the loss of my coping crutch, or menopause! All three combined made depression inevitable and hard to control.)  Second, as with any drug, it's NOT for everyone - but it's USE SHOULD BE MONITORED by every physician who prescribes it.  Take great care - this drug works IN THE BRAIN! but it has the potential to affect much of your life; work, relationships, physical and mental health - just to name a few.  Again, reaction to Chantix use seems to vary widely.

My husband may have not had this stroke if not for this med. has any one else had a stroke on this med.

The first seven days were very hard, like an emotional rollercoaster. Side effects I'm experiencing still: Bloated/Gas, Weight Gain(food tastes really good, now), irritable, mood swings, really wierd dreams(not nightmares), lack of energy. I guess the side effects aren't as bad as what could happen if I kept smoking. Overall, Chantix has worked, where other methods have not(like gum, patches, cold turkey)
Stop Smoking	Mike, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	1/21/2008 12:30:14 PM	My doctor suggested this treatment to help me quit smoking. I was a regular smoker for over 20 years. My treatment was for 6 months instead of the normal 3 months. My doctor told me it increases your chance of success to @ 85%. This med is ver effective in reducing the cravings for nicotine. Within 8 days I stopped smoking and have not had a cigarette for over a year. There are some things you need to do to help you deal with the side effects. Please do not drink heavily with this medication as it can cause violent mood swings in some people. A few alcholholic drinks is Ok though. Always eat before you take the medication. It really made me sick to my stomach if I did not eat. Also eat a light snack before bed time to ease the occurance of bad dreams and headaches. I have had great success in beating the nicotine addiction I had for over 20 years. I would recommend this top anyone who REALLY wants to beat this drug.(nicotine)One of the other benefits to this treatment is no weight gain! Please beware if you try any tobacco product after you complete treatment your addiction will be even stronger than before treatment. DO NOT even try to smoke or chew or anything.

That turned out to be the nictoine withdrawl. I have been smoke free for 9 days. I have messed up once or twice but i could only have a couple puffs before i felt sick to my stomache. Day 9 is much easier this is a very good drug and I would recommend it to everybody. The side effects are not the bad though the dreams are very strange.It's a great product so far. I only worry what happens when I run out of the drug?

It has been 2 days since my last smoke. My doc prescribed me the meds as well. I am a little leary about taking them. I have asthma. I take singular and advair each day. My doc says this is fine. But I cant help being nervous about it. I want to completely be rid of the urges and the smokes. It is a very hard addiction to get over. But I dont want to die of cancer or have to carry an O2 tank around either. Good luck to everyone! Try to drink alot of water to fight the urges, thats what I do.

Side effects were mostly wierd dreams- like they weren't dreams at all. I took the full course- 90 days and have been cigarette free for 5 months and lovin it. If you are truly committed to quit smoking then any method will work- after a couple of days it is psychological not physica that you still want to smoke- good luck to all who fight against the urge to smoke &amp; to those who are in the process of quitting -it's worth every breath you can take without hacking.
Stop Smoking	CindySmokefree, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	1/10/2008 11:43:43 AM	I stopped smoking on the 8th day of Chantix.  I experienced nausea and irritability. I found that I could avoid the nausea by taking the pill in the middle of a meal (insulating my stomach from the pill).  I have had some weird dreams intermittently and tend to be impatient and irritable.  The cravings have mostly gone.  I remind myself of the health and financial benefits of not smoking when I want one.  The Doctor said I should get to a point when I would have no desire to smoke--since I still had some desire at the end of 90 days of Chantix, I asked for a refill.  My insurance did not cover Chantix beyond 90 days.  I've tried to quit several times in the past without success.  Even with the side effects, I found this to be the easiest and most successful method.  I am also taking Prozac and noticed that I am a little more down than normal with Chantix, but I have begun feeling better as the nicotine leaves my system.  I haven't drunk any alcohol because of the stories I've heard about Chantix and alcohol.  I slipped up twice after my stop date.  I stopped smoking almost 4 months ago and have been totally smokefree for almost 2 months.  Smoking was an integral part of everything I did, so the hardest part for me is to separate the smoking habit from all of my life activities.  I'm glad Chantix is working for me and it's unfortunate that it doesn't work for everyone.  Good luck!

My insurance covered most of it so I decided, what do I have to lose? I'm almost 29 and I've been smoking since I was 14. A pack a day. I'm on my 5th day without a cigarette, before Chantix I couldn't even make it 1 hour without a cigarette. My g/f continues to smoke and it doesn't even bother me. There are still cravings, but they are light and they pass. I eat a little before taking because of nausea and I did have the jitters the first day quitting. Thank you Chantix developers, you deserve the nobel prize. This is definitley a break through.

I also take a high daily dose of ELAVIL [antidepressant] I am concerned about drug interaction.I also have cancer [in remission 18 months]and wonder if I should take this medication.My PRIMARY says I can take it and can just stop if I can't handle the side effects.Any advice would be helpful.
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/8/2008 1:28:55 AM	This is my miracle drug. As of 1/6/08 it's been 6 weeks since I quit. The only side effect that I've experienced is taking it on an empty stomach made me alittle sick. Taking the pills with a glass of milk stopped the sickness. This has been the easiest thing I've ever done. Now if I could only lose the 15lbs that I've gained that easy.

Stop Smoking	mayfly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	1/4/2008 2:56:33 PM	I have been a smoker for 16 years and have never wanted to quit until recently.  I took the medicine for a short time and knew that I was done smoking for good.  It does make you feel nautious for about 20-30 minutes immediately after you take your pill but goes away.  I have noticed a 10 lb weight gain in the past month which worries me because I am a fitness instructor and know it is not because I am not exercising or watching what I eat.  I would add weight gain can be a typical side effect as with any medication.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/4/2008 10:47:10 AM	I have been on chantix now for 60 days and have been smoke free for 51 days. I had tried other methods to stop smoking before but nothing worked. I was a pack a day smoker for over 30 years and now I think cigarette smoke stinks..and as far as the side effects I have had very few unusual dreams and gas for the first 2 weeks.

Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/3/2008 7:19:37 AM	I smoked 1 pack(+) per day for ten years and was unable to quit. After taking Chantix and gradually dininishing the number of cigarettes I smoked (because I no longer had the urge-just the habit), at five weeks I had my last cigarette. I stopped taking Chantix in the middle of my seventh week. It has been two months since I have had a cigarette-and I have not had an urge to smoke since! I cannot say enough about this product. It saved my life.
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/1/2008 6:07:13 PM	I spent 8 days in the hospital with brain seizures that took the form of crippling headaches.  They cycled in 24 hour periods after 12 days on the medication.  I was finally transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  I was given every test to determine another cause for the headaches, but everything came up negative.  I was treated with pain medication until the drugs could clear my system.
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/1/2008 2:21:36 PM	I've had some minor side effects with Chantix, similar to those that I had when trying the patch, such as bad dreams, constipation, fatigue, but after the first few weeks, the symptoms have lessened. I still have the dreams, but they don't make me wake up as much. The worst symptom is the nausea that I get immediately after taking the pill. Eating crackers helps with that. There is something I've noticed recently that I think is related - when I go jogging, my sweat has a strong metallic odor. This has only started recently, so I think it must be related to the medication. This doesn't happen if I work out in a gym, so it must be related to the way I sweat when jogging. I've been absolutely smoke free for 40 days now with very little urges to quit. The side effects were worth it to be free of the constant mental desire for a smoke. This is the first time that its been easy for me to quit. Its been actually so easy that I feel like I got away with something!! I'm happy with my experience on Chantix and would recommend it to anyone. However, I will note that when my 12 weeks are up, I'm going to be happy to be off of it and get a decent nights sleep! I've been actively using the get-quit website and plan to continue using it until my year is up.
Stop Smoking	precious722, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	12/31/2007 8:50:27 PM	Me and my husband both have been smokers for over 30 years and smoked 1 to 2 packs a day.  We decided to do this together and it works.  After just a few days we were down to just half a pack a day.  Now we have quit totally and so glad.  Yes there are side effects like feeling like we have the stomach flu and some moodiness but that we can deal with.  I would rather have some side effects than keep smoking.  This is the ONLY THING THAT WORKS!!!!!!!!  I recommend it highly to anyone and everyone. My grandson told us now you get to see me grow up.  It brought tears to our eyes.  Our doctor gave us medication for the nausea which helps but there is no way I would give up on this medication.  I am also bipolar and have anxiety and major depression and doing fine even with all my other medications.  I hope others will give it a chance.  Just work with your doctor.  Adjustments can be made to your meds.  Its better to quit smoking than to stop this medication if at all possible.  Good Luck to you all.

Stop Smoking	inadilema, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	12/31/2007 3:21:44 PM	I started smoking 10 years ago and have been smoke free for 7 days now, but worried about the next weeks to come.  I had bad dreams the first week and continue to have an upset stomach, which forces me to eat more than I usually do.  I find myself to be irritable and yelling at people when I'm not one to get upset easily.  I hope that I can continue to take this drug for a few more weeks, but may need to quit if the side affects get any worse.  I have a history of getting most side affects that come with drugs, so I avoid them when possible.  I still crave a smoke now and again, but nothing like the times when I quit 'cold turkey'.  Please be careful if you are generally sensitive to prescription drugs!  Every time I take a pill, I weigh the pros and cons and make a decision.  So far the benefits outweigh the side affects.

I have COPD so I had no choice but to quit smoking. I was difficult at first but worth the money I saved, and my health is getting better. Thank You for Chantix the end result is worth the withdrawl 
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	12/30/2007 10:32:07 PM	My doctor told me to quit smoking and wrote a prescription for this. It made me not want to smoke. In fact I didn't think about smoking, but in the meantime I was angry, aggressive, depressed, afraid and it made me feel extremly bad about myself. I stopped taking this medicine, and I'm still smoking.
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	12/30/2007 9:23:00 AM	I have been on this medication since 12/13. I had trouble quitting on my eighth day. I tried and the fits got to me. I tried again, and have been smoke free for two days with very very minor fits. The fits have not been strong enough for me to light up again. If you fail at quitting the first time, try again! I feel great! I have not had any huge impacting side effects such as suicidal thinking or depression. I have, however, experienced side effects such as unusual dreams, nausea just for a few minutes after I take Chantix, and I have gotten a few sores on my tongue. All these side effects I believe are worth becoming smoke free!

Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	4	Female	45-54	12/24/2007 8:22:19 AM	I quit smoking after taking Chantix for one week, I was a pack a day smoker for 34 years.  It seemed easy!  After taking Chantix for almost 30 days, I feel that it was in conflict with the Lexapro that I have been taking for 3 years.  I immediately stopped taking the Chantix as my anxiety went skyhigh.  I have now been off the Chantix for almost 30 days, have not smoked for 54 days, it has been a struggle.  My anxiety is high (but getting better) so I want to smoke.  It is not as easy as it first appeared!  However, I am committed to staying quit and nothing worth while is easy, or so they say!

I have quit the Chantix, but after 4 days began feeling &quot;weird, dizziness and very tired. After 3 days of the dizzy spells my wife hauled me to the ER. CT, EKG, dopler on the carotid arteries, everything negative. My daughter insists its the effects of the Chantix, and it may be, as it is the only difference I have had going on. But I am smoke free and the ER DR says hoopefully it (Dizziness) will pass. To follow up with my Dr. after the Holidays

It is very effective and helps you quit smoking, but you must keep your will power going once you're off Chantix. The only reason I have started smoking again after taking Chantix was due to being drunk and around a crowd of smokers. I highly recommend this drug to anyone that is thinking of quiting.

I tried Chantix three times, for ninety days each, time after time, I failed. I was so hopeful this would work, I was quite excited about quitting, and thought this is it! I'm disappointed, and still smoking.

Anyone can quit with this drug. I quit twice before and had a very hard time, this time is a so different taking this medication.  I have had a few weird dreams but it is worth it.  I feel great after only 2 weeks on the medicine and 1 week smoke free.
Stop Smoking	Ivefallen, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/17/2007 7:33:08 AM	54 year old malesmoked for 35+ yearslost count on the number of times I tried to quit, twice I stopped for 3 years.stopped smoking for a a year now due to ChantixIt works, it works, it works.Have read about the suicidal and agressive behaviour. I have had the agresssive behavious, however I do not think it is due to the Chantix as my three month prescription ran out 9 months ago and the agreessive behaviour still persists from time to time. My thoughts are that it is the nicotine withdrawl which in the past was probably one of the triggers that got me smoking again after I quit. Only that gland no longer is part of the addictive urge and I stay off the cigarettes. Additionally I have experienced a huge metabolic shift in my body regarding weight, sleep, cognitive thought etc and I honestly believe this will go on till my body finishes re-adjusting. It is better, but only by small degrees and I imagine I have one to two years to go. But it is still better than smoking as far I am concerned.

Stop Smoking	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male	25-34	12/8/2007 11:57:13 PM	This medicine WORKS. I took it for 5 days and quit completely in 2. 3 months is the recommended period but why take meds if you don't need to? It makes smoking cigarettes pointless more or less. However, I have experienced nausea, headaches, drowsiness, and I &quot;space out&quot; and day dream since I quit. I think it's hard to determine if the lack of smoking or chantix is the cause. I suppose it's all worth it since it's been 6 weeks and I have zero desire to smoke.

After eliminating other possible causes, my doctor determined that Chantix was the cause. Days of severe pain, heavy pain meds, no food and hospitalization were not exactly the things I wanted to do to quit smoking.  I suppose I quit by default since I was on dilaudid then morphine for more than a week.

I did not need to get a refill. The two problems I had while taking Chantix were slight nausea and EXTREMELY graphic dreams. They were not nightmares, just incredibly realistic and vivid.Now that I have stopped taking it, I seem to have a lot of trouble sleeping. No suicidal thoughts or any thing like that.

Stop Smoking	25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5		25-34	12/5/2007 9:10:22 PM	My wife and I would recommend Chantix more than anything in this world.  I've tried those alternate ways like the &quot;quit nicotine by taking nicotine&quot; patch and gum and because you are still taking the nicotine you have to put 100% willpower into quitting and then the withdrawals were terribly nerve wrenching.  My wife and I both smoked.... I for 20+ years and she for 15 and we both quit using Chantix. The drug totally eases the withdrawls to the point you lose track of the time and smoking sensations and realize you haven't had a cigarette in a much longer time than you are used to going without a cigarette. After smoking 1 1/2 packs a day (sometimes 2) I was down to less than 10 cigarettes in just over a week without even trying yes that is right I said &quot;without even trying&quot;...I just didn't think to have that next cigarette like I would have before. That is what Chantix does....it blocks the nicotine from getting to those pleasure centers in the brain and therefore keeps the withdrawls at bay. The final kick requires some willpower but only 10% compared to 90% with the patch and gum. Side effects: Personally I had a couple very vivid dreams but no nightmares and my wife experienced slight nausea for a couple days on the 1/2 mg to 1 mg dose change and vivid dreams as well but not continuously. It was 3 weeks later and we both quit for good. We continued taking the Chantix for a week after but had no problems after having stopped taking the Chantix. No Chantix withdrawls as some falsified blogs have stated would happen. You will not feel a need to continue taking Chantix after quitting smoking or taking Chantix. Anything you read or hear about &quot;Chantix withdrawls&quot; are totally false. The price of the drug is well worth the savings you will see after quitting buying cigarettes as well!! Between my wife and I we now save $350-$400 month not smoking....in 2 weeks we payed for our prescriptions!

When I even smell the smoke, it makes me turn my nose.  I would recommend it for those who REALLY want to quit &amp; haven't been able to. I've done patches &amp; couldn't get off the lst step..Zyban..nothing..gum...nothing...natural...n othing... Within 1stwk my desire decreased greatly. I did the 3mo program &amp; by end of 2mos.. I was not taking the Rx twice a day b/c it was working so well.  If I ever get the urge or something upsets me, I just chew on toohpicks. CONS: I did have the terrible nightmares but that lasted a short time.

Stop Smoking	smokefree, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/4/2007 10:03:32 AM	Pack and a half a day for over 25 years. I have been on this drug for a little over a month and have had 3 cigarettes since my quit date. I have not had any reactions that some of the other reviews speak of.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/4/2007 10:02:47 AM	Was put on Chantix right after hysterectomy. I have been a 1 pack a day smoker for over 24 years. Been on it now for 2 weeks. Havent quit completely but today is my stop smoking day. I have cut back to 2 cigarettes a day! This is amazing. Have had problems sleeping the last week. And other problems that could be linked to this RX or my surgery. I will not give it up. Worth all of the side effects so far just to see my grandbabies grow up.My father died of lung cancer. He died a horrible and painful death. I dont want my grandkids to have to go thru that and this RX is helping me prevent that.

Have to change your behavior and old habits, so I'm trying.  But...some bad side affects.  Along with the vivid dreams, bloating, anxiety I had extreme swelling of my feet and legs to the point I couldn't even walk with out assistance.  the swelling didn't start till last week.  My doctor and pharmacist both agree it was the chantix.  Caused a rise in my bp and joint pain.  It works but can have some serious side affects.   Be careful and good luck.

Having difficulty with sleeping.  Not at all then can't get up no matter how hard I try.  Making me depressed. Cut back to 1 pill in morning.  Make me fell strange and make my mouth dry.

Stop Smoking	TNgal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	25-34	12/1/2007 4:26:09 PM	This is a miracle drug for smokers! I had smoked for 9 years, and this drug made it very easy to quit. I had two intense surgeries, could not quit smoking through the first one, chantix helped with the second. I have now been on it almost two months. I am still nauseous, sometimes worse than others, and doesn't matter how much I eat. My doc prescribed nausea med which helps. Vivid dreams I can live with. Been bloated. Very anxious at times. Walking seems to help dramatically with these side effects. The side effects are bad, but not near as bad as what smoking does. I just remind myself of the life long benefits vs. the short term bad side effects.
Stop Smoking	jkdkjkkk,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		12/1/2007 11:33:50 AM	The product works.  I have not had upset stomach, vivid dreams, or upset stomach.  I am smoke free for about 10 weeks and have only two to go.  The only side effect I have had is constipation and 5 pound weight gain and some bloated feeling.  My doctor cut the dosage in half so I take one half the pill in the morning and one half at night and that has cut the side effect enormously.  The side effects for me are tolerable to quit smoking and I would recommend this product to everyone and have.

I am bipolar--i stopped taking chantix because i found the nightmares intolerable and found it completely ineffective.  Two days after quiting, i became suicidally depressed and suffered excruciating panic attacks.  Welcome to the side effects (not advertised) of chantix.

Stop Smoking	tryingtoquit, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	2	Female	45-54	11/30/2007 8:48:50 AM	The medication does eliminate the desire to smoke (tastes like nothing)--however the side effects were unacceptable. 5 straight days of a headache that no pain reliever could touch.  Took 48 hours of not taking the medication for the headache to diminish.  This started at end 'end of week 4', so don't assume you are OK if it takes a while for side effects.  No way could I take this medication for longer than 3 weeks.

I just fear that the urge will come back after I stop the pills.Also Im not thrilled that my insurance did not cover this medication that could prevent so many other illnesses.Low income people will not have access to this drug and that is biased.
Stop Smoking	red hen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	35-44	11/28/2007 10:54:37 PM	One of the worst experiences of my life. After 2 weeks on chantix I was sleeping 18 hrs a day, slurred speach, chest pain, confusion,irrational thinking, unsteady gait, dissorentation, extremely emotional,major depression,  I became suicidal to the point of being hospitalized for 3 days in the phyc. ward. Horrifying experience to be admitted, strip searched, not completely understanding what has happened. How do I live with the memory of my children seeing me there and in that condition? completely out of control. embarrassed and ashamed and scared. Difficult symptoms continued for 2 weeks after stopping the medication, anxiety, slurred speach, dizzy, afraid to leave the house for fear of becoming like that away from home where I could not get help. I know this works very well for some people w/ little or no side effects, but please, if you decide to use this product, ask your family/friends to watch you carefully, and help you to contact your dr. if they feel your behavior has changed enough to worry them. You may not always be thinking clearly enough to seek help youself. I paid dearly, much much more than my $30 copay, to quit smoking for 10 days.... Be carefull.

My wife couldn't stand to ride in it ot the the smell of me.I used Chantix for 1 week and haven't smoked in 4 months. I have only had a couple bad dreams, no nausea or anything else. and the dreams were not that bad. If I feel bored, instead of eating I go for a walk.

I do have some bad side effects: nausea, nightmares(very scary), and mood swings. I am going to stop taking the drug because of these, but I am confident I will not smoke again. I tried Zyban in the past and Chantix worked much better for me.Great drug if you really want to quit!

Stop Smoking	teri h, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/24/2007 2:50:52 PM	I'd been a 2-pack-a-day smoker for over 30 years.  I'd tried the patch, gum &amp; hypnotism without success.  When I tried to stop smoking, I became a fire breathing dragon &amp; an employer can't afford a bad temper.  It isn't fair to employees, not to mention my family.About the dreams - I had the best dreams that I'd had in about 25 years.  I actually woke up giggling-yes, giggling!  THe vivid dreams lasted only about three weeks and have not returned.  Quitting was painless.  In fact, because you keep smoking while taking Chantix, you don't notice the medication at all.  One AM I was doing the braille walk towards the patio with cigarette and coffee in hand.  I stopped &amp; said to myself &quot;you haven't had a morning buzz in two weeks.  Try something different.&quot;  So, I put the cigarette down and played a game of solitaire on my computer.  I haven't smoked for over three months now.

Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/23/2007 2:11:06 PM	I started taking the pills and actually quit smoking before my quit date.  Which i think is excellent after smoking for 19 years.  The only side effect i experienced was my dreams were a little more strange than normal. 
Stop Smoking	EnoughisEnough, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	11/23/2007 5:12:20 AM	I think that this drug is a miricle!!!! I have smoked for 16 years and quit in a week. You really have to want to quit. And I really did. I was sick and tired of not being able to breathe, feeling sick all the time, depressed, and smelling like an ashtray. I had a couple of headaches when I was on the medication, but that was it. Overall, I don't smoke anymore and I'm very grateful that I quit. Especially, with all the health risks from smoking. I want to be here when my kids graduate from high school. The only one in control of your body is you! So if you really want to quit, you will, with or without this medication. Chantix helps make quitting a little easier. Good luck.
Stop Smoking	JennyV22, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	11/21/2007 10:59:05 PM	If you truly want to quit, this drug will help you do it.  I'd tried many times to quit but finally did w/this.  Vivid dreams were my worst side effect - my dr gave me lorazepam which helped immensely.  Took Chantix for about 45 days and didn't need it any more.  I was over nicotine withdrawal and it was simply a matter of mind over matter.  Knew I didn't want to smoke anymore and didn't want to have weird dreams or take any more rx than necessary.  If you're ready to quit...this may be the drug for you -- but you truly have to want to quit.  The initial cost of buying a months worth (~$130) is actually less than smoking cost me - and I'm healthier for it. 
Stop Smoking	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Male	35-44	11/21/2007 1:51:33 PM	Wife and I got on it together about 2-3 weeks ago.  Cravings for cigarettes were totally gone in a few days.  Unfortunately, both had severe mood swings, severe depression, even occasional suicidal thoughts for me and uncontrollable bouts of crying sometimes half the night for no reason.  Argued with her more in 3 weeks than in the entire rest of our marriage.  Drug works great but the side effects we had are NOT worth it.  Not going back to smoking, will stay off cigarettes but will NOT take this drug one more day.  Would only recommend this drug if very closely supervised by a doctor for psychological side effects not listed on the information pack.  Don't know if anyone else has experienced this but it's scary.  Total mood change in us both.

I have tried hundred of times to quit and have always failed. I am 49 and this is simply amazing. I walk into a smoke filled roomand I'm not even affected. It does have slight side effects. Weird dreams, restless nights, but I'll take that anyday. I'm only into my first week, the rest will come later!

If you are ready to quit chantix will get you there.  The only side effects that I experinced were felt a lttle sick to my stomach for and about 30 minute after talking the pill, a little restless sleep but not every night and it dulled my tatse.  But that's nothing compare to getting the tobacco monkey off my back.........I highly recommend this,

Before I started this medication, if someone would ask me when I was going to stop smoking, I would have said &quot;when i am six feet under&quot;. This product was great and I would recommend it to anyone. yes some side effects like weird dreams..but I would rather have weird dreams for a little while than lung cancer!! My cravings are managable, I have cut down from 2 packs a day to 4 cigs a day and I have not even reached my &quot;quit date&quot; yet!!

I slept fine, but it was completely non-refreshing. The gastrointestinal upset was severe. The anxiety and overall &quot;jittery&quot; feeling was what ultimately did me in. I felt as if I was about to climb out of my own skin and was extremely irritable. Someone told me that what happens on this drug is that it takes away the &quot;pleasure&quot; of smoking, but the problem is that it takes away the pleasure of EVERYTHING! Someone said this is being tested for use in persons that are addicted to other drugs????? My husband and I started this medicine at the same time and he almost suffered a relapse from recovery due to the side effects.

I alreay suffer from depression as it is and after the way the Chantix was making me feel inside, I quit taking the med. It is in the plan to discuss this with personal MD soon.  Good luck and if anyone else experienced similar feelings, please post something. thank you for listening and for being brave enough to post. tryingtoquit
Stop Smoking	refbum, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/10/2007 12:54:43 AM	Over 25 years of smoking a pack a day.  If only I could stop or cut down.  Somedays I'd light a cigarette and have no idea why I lit it.  I was overweight and having trouble breathing yet I lit a cigarette.  I started a few other methods and they did not work.I started taking Chantix and after about 1 week, I noticed I wasn't even reaching for my cigarettes as much.  I was now smoking less than half a pack a day.  I did not set my date to quit at 10 days.  At first, I fooled myself into thinking &quot;Man, I can only smoke a few a day, this is GREAT&quot;.  I felt my breathing getting better and suddenly justified that I could just smoke a few taking this medication and that would be ok.  I went to my doctors office on the next visit and saw a man carrying a portable oxygen tank.  My few cigarettes a day weren't worth it.  After about day 20, I'd say, I was greatly relieved that I could go all day long without even ONE cigartte, then day two, then three.  25 years of smoking and the last 5 years regretting every single second I lit one up.  All that gone and I am breathing and feeling much better.  My insurance didn't reimburse me one penny for the three month treatment, (so check your insurance) but that was the BEST money well spent I have ever did.
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/8/2007 11:46:20 PM	Chantix worked very well to help me quit smoking. I took the medication as directed for 2-3 months and have been 100% nicotine free since March 2007.  It did not at all minimize my cravings but it did make cigarettes taste like &quot;air&quot; and not enjoyable.  Please try it - any short term discomfort you may have to go through is so much better than smoking!!!!

The nausea gets pretty intense for me, but only if I don't eat before the medicine. I have had lots of vivid dreams, but I think that's cool. I think Chantix is great!

But it beats the heck out of smoking yourself to death. I do worry some may become addicted to this &quot;high&quot; whether it be physical or psychological. I would not recommend this drug to mentally fragil individuals.

This was like magic. I have been off cigarettes for 6 months or so and have had about three cravings. I could not have been happier. The only side effect I had was some very weird dreams the first week but they stopped. I can even be around smokers now without it making me want a smoke. It is like a pixie comes to visit and sprinkle her pixie dust on me while I sleep. I haven't felt better in years. Also, no gain in weight. I don't understand but I guess that pixie just keeps coming around. Now, if I could just start exercising!

Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/7/2007 10:01:03 AM	I am into week 8 of taking Chantix and have only smoked two cigarettes since the first week (in which you're allowed to smoke). When I smoked those cigarettes, I got absolutely no satisfaction from it and they tasted awful! I've tried many times and several methods to quit and while Chantix is no magic bullet, this has been the easiest method for me. I've experienced no side effects at all and within 2 -3 weeks began to notice that my sense of smell was returning and I could breathe easier. I've started including short bursts of jogging into my daily walking routine, which I could never do before without gasping for breath. I really feel that by the time I reach the end of my 12 weeks, I'll be able to continue being a non-smoker without the need for additional medication. My neighbors (who have both been smoke-free for 6 months now) told me about it and now I'm a firm believer that if you really want to quit, this medication can help you be successful.

I am proud to say that I am going on 8 weeks of being smoke free and never felt better. I continued to smoke the first 7 days and on the 8th day quit. Chantix made quitting smoking one of the easiest hardest things I have ever had to do. I suffered no side effects

I have tried quitting numerous times in the past- using various methods/techniques. I have been smoke free for 10 days now, having stopped on day 8 of Chantix. This time around has been by far my easiest attempt at quitting, but I do have cravings, which in fact seem to be getting stronger the last 2 days. I am concerned about that. As far as side effects- nothing too terrible- bit of crazy dreaming, insomnia and morning exhaustion that is cramping my productivity.

Stop Smoking		5	5	4			10/30/2007 2:55:42 PM	There are some annoying side effects with Chantix, i.e. the nausea, however, it worked so well to help quit smoking that it was worth the side effects.  It left no desire whatsoever to smoke again.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/29/2007 4:22:23 PM	My husband used chantix in june after trying to quite for a couple of years.  He has been smoke free for going on four months now.  He doesn't even want to smoke.  It is truly a miracle drug.  He did have some nausea when taking the drug, but he got through it.  the pill made his cravings go away almost immediately.  the hardest part for him was getting through the habitual part of smoking and breaking the routines he had built up in his life around smoking.

I am so proud of myself that I was able to give up this &quot;Dirty little habit&quot; with ease thanks to Chantix.  I never thought I would be able to continue with most of my normal activities, including those with friends that still smoke, and not crave one last cigarette.For those of you still not able to quit, belive me this drug will NOT eliminate the urge to smoke during the 1st 48 hours.  You must surround yourself with people who support you and your decision to quit.  Once you have fought the urge for the first two days, quitting is easy.  I am certain that I will never smoke again.The minor side effects are well worth it.  Hang in there, you'll make it!

The dream have kicked in as well since I upped to the full dosage packs.  I am kind of hoping that doesn't last becasue it makes it difficult to get a full night's rest.  Still, if it helps me kick the habit I think it will be worth it.

Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	10/22/2007 3:28:23 PM	I haven't smoked in 52 days, but there is no way I can continue this medication.  Besides the stomach issues, I have wild mood swings and am lashing out at people for minor things.  I am also exhausted all the time.  I read a recent newspaper article that indicated that Chantix could cause or intensify depression and/or anxiety; so, I can only hope that in a few days my energy level rebounds and I am not so crabby.  Drinking alcohol and taking Chantix does not mix well.  My alcohol tolerance has been exteremely low while on Chantix.  But, after all is said and done, I was able to quit my 16 year habit using this medication alone.  I also feel that the folks that have continued to smoke really don't want to quit that bad.  You must WANT it and WANT it BADLY...it is hell to give up a habit that is so ingrained in your personality.  Sure there are times that I want to smoke...but I WANT to be a non-smoker.  That's why the pills worked for me and not for my husband.  I would recommend them to others as long as the person was aware of the side-effects.

Lately, she doesn't have to give me 8, I still have a few left over from the day before, but I never have more than 8 on me at any time.  So while I haven't totally quit like my mother, she took Chantix and quit smoking after 7 days, I am getting.

I am a 61 y/o woman who smoked one to one and a half pks a day for 46 years.  I tried every product out there, multiple times w/o success.  Chantix works in the addiction center of the brain which in turns stops the craving for tobacco. So, it is not that I never had the willpower to quit before and failed ---- it was that other methods did not treat the addictive power of nicotine.  They merely traded the method delivery of nicotine into my body when using patches or gums, etc.  I thank my doctor and the makers of Chantix for every smoke free day I have.  I am in the eleventh week of treatment and plan to take an additional 12 weeks of treatment, because I don't ever want to smoke another cigarette as long as I live.pjb from Oak Harbor, WA

I am still smoking but the cigarettes are really starting to taste bad. Chantix does affect your taste buds and brain. It makes nicotine react differently in your brain so you don't crave it as much. I have also experienced some anxiety while on this med, with like a chest vibration which is weird, but I am sticking with it and will hopefully quit in a few days....

If I took the medicine with food, I did not have any problems, but I usually don't eat breakfast and this would cause a problem. When I took Chantix, I did not crave cigarettes at all. I have smoked regular for over 27 years and this drug is a miracle. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stop with their smoking habit. It really works.

She recommended Chantix.  My husband and I both smoked over 40 years (him 3 pks a day, me 1).  After only 1 month of treatment, we are both cigarette free and have been for 4 months.  There are occasional cravings, but easy to overcome.  I have had no side effects.  Considering the stress of having a spinal fusion, having to buy a new house, and finding out my 11 year old Doberman named Sugar has diabetes all during the same time frame, I consider this remarkable.  I am 60 years old and cigarette free for the first time since I was 15.  I don't know what I would have done without this drug.  My husband and I tried everything from cold turkey to hypnosis, and nothing else worked.  Thank you.

I was given a starter pack from my doctor. After I completed the first week titration and started the second week, I was able to quit. No withdrawal, no cravings, no nothing. Lucky for me, the only side effect I had was the dry mouth. A stick of gum or crushed ice cured that. I would recommend this type of treatment to anyone who wants to quit smoking. Quite frankly, since the government is making &quot;every where&quot; designated as no smoking, I think the government should make it mandatory that all health insurance plans/prescription drug plans cover this medication. Afterall, it does work.

Though the dreams I had while on the medicine were absurd and frightening.  Sleep was a major problem for me.  I only took the medicine for two weeks but remain cig free.

Stop Smoking		5	5	5			10/2/2007 12:43:15 PM	Cravings are easier to control but still there at week 2. 12 years, and never gone this long without a cig. Im actually really proud of me! Tried everything else in the past. gum, patch, herbal treatments, etc. No bad side effects at all for me personally. Wild dreams, Mild insomnia (normal for me anyways) and mild headache when i started, and with each dose increase. but usually lasted only half a day. eating mints, and Walking daily too though to replace the habbit, and hopefully keep my energy levels up. so far so good. Been really happy so far!

Stop Smoking	Rip, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	9/28/2007 3:01:38 PM	I've smoked for over 25 years and tried to quit six times prior with no success. Since finding Chantix this has been by far the best treatment for me. The only side affects I've had are some periods of constipation and Wild Dreams, the dreams are like going to the movies every night for me. I'm on my sixth week and have not had any craving's or desire for a smoke. It flat out works..

It was a little scary how well it controlled my cravings to smoke.  I told my husband it was like brain-washing.  The only side effect I had was nausea, which was alleviated if I ate before I took the medication.  I would recommend it to anyone.
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	9/25/2007 7:55:12 PM	I was able to quit after smoking for over 35 years.  However, I only needed to take the drug for one month and four months after stopping, I still have night terrors. I wake up every 15 to 60 minutes all night long with awful dreams.  I have occassional cravings for a cigarette, but have not had one.  It does work.
Stop Smoking	boator, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	45-54	9/24/2007 8:29:37 PM	I quit smoking after 40yrs.  Although the withdrawal from the Nicotine was and is bad.  I'm glad to be away from that dirty drug.  But-The chantix. Is a powerful drug.  The Headaches I get (I never had them) are the blinding type. They are getting fewer and not as severe.  The sleep deprivation and weird dreams when I do sleep is a problem. I will quit after my 12 weeks and I hope that I will feel good and not smoke. I wish I knew of a safer way to go, but the smoking habit is a crime to myself.  It took a TIA to get me here.

Stop Smoking	Dee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/18/2007 5:56:28 PM	I take only half of the prescribed dosage, I haven't smoked or wanted to smoke in three weeks.
Stop Smoking	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/18/2007 3:06:00 PM	THIS WAS A MIRACLE FOR ME.  I HAVE BEEN QUIT NOW FOR A YEAR.  DON'T MISS SMOKING AT ALL. I AM SO PROUD OF MYSELF.  I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.  THIS DRUG WAS IT.  I WAS A 40 YEAR SMOKER.  THIS DRUG REALLY WORKS.  
Stop Smoking	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	9/18/2007 11:31:37 AM	Starting with the 3rd day I had  a continuous headache bad enough that it interrupted my life.  I felt fevered and had trouble concentrating. When I started the second week ( mg twice a day) within 20 min I had the worst headache of my life, I couldn't see and couldn't talk.  My pharmacist took me off Chantix.  Now I still smoke and am $97 poorer.  Very disappointed.

Stop Smoking	exsmkr, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	9/18/2007 9:57:58 AM	I quit smoking after taking Chantix for only 3 days.  Although, I have experienced intense cravings for a cigarette during stress, I've managed to not smoke by using deep breathing exercises.  Also, I've experienced moments of nausea after taking a dose of chantix, overall I'm satisfied that I no longer desire to smoke after a month of taking it as prescribed. By the way, I had smoked for 20 years, up to a pack a day!
