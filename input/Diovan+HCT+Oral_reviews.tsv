High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	7/25/2012 11:38:27 AM	I have been taking Diovan 320/25 mg for over 5 years.  Other medications either had side effects or didn't lower my blood pressure enough.  Diovan has had the fewest side effects for me (no side effects noticeable to date), but is not completely effective (140/80 is my typical reading).  I take no other medications, am an active, healthy 70 year old female with normal weight, no heart attacks or diabetes or surgeries.

I has worked well to lower my blood pressure. However I am having severe finger nail problems and I am looking for input from anyone who has also experienced this while taking Diovan Hct. I think my hair has thinned as well.  I do have more back pain and see that as a side affect too. All in all less side affects than with other BP meds, I just need to determine if it is causing my nail delamination.

My pressure is not being controled at all. (140/87) and was causing rapid heart rate and some anxiety with intestinal issues, stopped taking it and I am going back to Benicar HCT, which worked fine until my insurance co. decided they would not cover it anymore so my dr. put me on diovan hct just not working out for me, ALSO COST KEEPS INCREASING!!

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	4/15/2012 12:16:56 PM	I have been taking Diovan 160/25 for about 2 years now.  At first I had not noticed what are now clearly the side effects of the medications.. light headedness, dizzy, joint pain, achy feeling, steady weight gain, new ichy rash as attributes of the meds.. other than I was feeling fine (if that can classifed as fine) BP was fluxuating between 140/110-90 to 110/70.. I have started exercising regularing, controling my diet and trying to lose some weight. My weight has not gone down, but seems to be going up despite all my best efforts. My husband recently experienced similiar reactions to other medications that he was taking - again, later discovered that the meds were causing the problem. I thought maybe this is my problem. I stumbbled across many of the same feelings and side effects.. I will be making an immediate appointment with the Dr. and getting off this stuff.. I often wonder why the drug manufacturers think that we will simply miss the ill effects in hopes for a greater benefit.  I never thought this would be me.. I am hoping to get a sense of normal back.

I have taken Diovn HCT 320/25 for the past 3 years, and have a severe rash on my back, hands, elbows and have developed puffy eyelids.  I've gone to the dermatologist and had a biopsy and they attribute the rash to a drug interaction with the Diovan HCT.

For me, it has been a God-send....nothing has worked as well as this medicine.  I make sure my weight and general health are good to excellent range and when I read about some of the side effects posted, I shake my head...Poor health management by the patient is usually to REAL reason folks like to blame the meds and not their personal choices and want quick fixes.Excercise and maintaining a low weight will fix 90% of your health problems.  Take responsibility for what you put in your body and you will be bowled over as to how great you feel.

I have a 190/110 rate. I have been on this for 3 years. Only issue is you have to drink enough fluids to keep from dehydrating. Yes, a few dizzy spells once in a while but all blood pressure meds come have that side effect. Just have to get use to them. It's important to take the same time each day. This has been the best medicine I have taken in 15 years since my blood pressure went out of control.

I read the other reviews printed here; and, I never had some of the severe side effects listed. This summer, I has sevre leg pain and disbility when walking. It cleared up somewhat.  When I was switched to another med, the pain completely disappeared.  Also, periodically, I did get rashes when I stayed in the sun to long. Furthermore, my lightheadedness meant it was time to take a nap.  If I was at work, I took the two hour nap when I got home.

I also had swelling in the ankles, leg and foot cramps and flushing of the face.  This was the 5th medicine that my doctor has tried.  I'm now on Micardis but am having a few side effects with it and it is double to cost of the other medicines I was on.  I'm ready to give up and just go off these medicines since they are all causing side effects that are almost as bad as the hbp.

Based on other reviews I suspect the Potassium has something to do with it.#2 I do experience tingling and sometimes numbness in my pinkies of both hands. This seems to come and go every couple of months. It lasts for about a week and then clears up. #3Once in a while I feel my heart racing for no apparent reason. #4 Every few months I'll have dry heaving/coughing in the mornings, usually in the winter.I am not a smoker. I have consumed alcohol on a regular basis. It does make you sunburn very quickly, but the warning is right on the bottle. I'm also very physically active and 6&quot;230lbs. I have never experienced stomach or muscle cramps before, during or after swimming lifting weights or exercising. Sometimes the light headed aspect does affect me while exercising but rarely.I don't think this has made a big difference in my pressure

I have been on HCT 160/25 for almost 3 years, experienced the low potassium last year when I fainted and added a banana to my diet everyday.  It does lower my blood pressure was 147/90 to 118/70.  However, I do experience the leg cramps, joint pain, lack of sleep, frequent urination and now major hair loss in the last 6 months.  I was attributing them to me beginning menopause until today when someone suggested it was the HCT so I looked it up and again am floored...I've been exercising and trying to lose weight and couldn't figure out why I was losing inches and not weight.

High Blood Pressure	fat lady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	35-44	4/7/2011 1:12:12 PM	I have been taking this drug for 5 years and it works relatively well as far as regulating BP. However, my insurance co. will no longer cover the cost of the prescription, which CVS wants to charge $144 per month for. In an attempt to find out if there is a generic or replacement drug, i stumbled across some user reviews. The side effects reported by other users have truly shed light on the problems that may have been exacerbated by this drug. #1 Severe muscle cramping! When I asked my DR 4 yrs ago if it could be this, he simply gaffed it off as me being a big fat pig who complains about aching muscles. #2 Severe sinus congestion that has been ruled out as any typical allergy by the ENT who thinks I am NUTS because I can get no relief. #3 Severe stomach pains and frequent bathroom visits, especially at the on-set. After 4 days of no MEDS - because the DR is stalling and won't write a replacement prescription, I have no cramps, I can breathe, and I am not popping pepto or gaviscon every few hours. Apart from the fact that my hands and feet are swollen and I have a headache, I feel pretty good. There are so many problems with this situation: #1 My doctor is obviously not too bothered by the fact that I may have a stroke - I should find somebody new. #2 This pill should not cost $4 a day - it's not made of gold and isn't experimental ar magic. #3 My insurance company blows. #4 The FDA needs to do more for patients. Why does it take a google search to help me find that many of my complaints and aches and pains could have been remedied 5 years ago? Yes, I am fat, but despite what my (also fat) doctor thinks, fat is not the root of my problems. A crappy physician is who doesn't care about me is.

I drink 8 oz of low sodium V8 juice ea.day to replace the potassium, which gives me immediate energy.Also, I found that taking my dosage(s) BEFORE meals cured the stomach problems I was having when taking after the meal.

It has been very effective. I was lightheaded for the first two weeks; but that passed. Sometimes, I get a tickling sensation on my face. Aside from that, no problems. For those of you who have weight gain and hair loss, please keep in mind that hair loss is common among men AND women over fifty, and it is impossible to gain weight on a drug that is calorie-free. My remedy: go the the barber or salon for a nice haircut, and stop stuffing your face with twinkies.

Working on trying other things, including losing weight to get off this stuff for good.

Back pain, muscle pain, nausea, light headed, abnormal kidney test (drank extra water and retested and it was corrected)Please pay attention to your bodies as some of these side affects are permanent.

It's been 2 weeks since I've been off and I'm still itching. I stopped taking it as soon as I did as it said so in the overall.  I guess I'm like the 2% that is vastly allergic to it.  I've tried benadryl, antibiotic creams, oatmeal batch and I still itch.  I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this. Is there anything I can do to get rid of the itching!

I have many of them and am checking with my doctor.  There is a generic for Diovan HCT called Valzaar-H. I get 90 Diovan HCT 160/12.5 for $113 from Global Pharmacy Canada 866-850-6021. I spend $313 for 90 days for all my RX's, which normally cost $ 777.  I know, I've had no insurance or job for over two years.  My doctor approved buying them there and has the name and number for her other patients.  Thanks for all the input from all of you.

I'm a 67 yr. white female and I have been on this drug along with Janeuvia (a diabetic drug). Could the hair thining be a result of Diovan alone or the combination of the two drugs?
Other	DJ, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	45-54	7/13/2010 5:53:26 PM	BP on the rise after initially on Atenolol 25 mg, was put on Diovan also rather than increase the Atenolol dosage. I attribute the BP increase to the use of a NASID called Meloxicam (Mobic).Anyway, this wasn't working as well as the Dr. wanted, so he put me on Diovan HCT. It has worked some, but not as well as needed (still get borderline numbers even with the meds).Besides not working well, the downside: extreme weight gain, fatigue. Also, after initially increasing urine output - which I believe it's supposed to do, output now seems lower than before I started taking it. Diminished libido but didn't kill it. Oh - and the cost is absurd! I'm becoming very skeptical...    
High Blood Pressure	searching, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	7/13/2010 9:00:28 AM	Diovan hct 320/25 has worked to lower my blood pressure but dr. added atenolol and aspirin to get desired results.  I have been complaining of fatigue, shortness of breath, and a lot of weight gain around my midsection. Have had a hysterectomy and a thyroidectomy. I can't seem to find a solution to my problems. dr's send me from one to another to find the cause. Am reallyfrustrated!

DiovanHCT dropped my BP 35-40 points.  The only problem I've experienced has been an increase in my heart rate when I started an exercise program and began having low BP problems while sleeping.  My doc lowered the dose and heart rate went back to normal.  I'm still exercising and hope to be off all meds in the next few years.  My insurance company doesn't like it, so it is 'top tier' expense for me but worth it.

All three ended up in the hospital with severe vomiting, and other abdominal issues. All three were fainting, dizzy, and had alot of the other symptons as well. Low sodium, yellowing skin and eyes, skin issues, sinusitus. Extreme low sodium and whacked out potassium levels. The list goes on. Only after being taken off this med were they better. This has to be the worst medication I have been a witness too. These patients were father, husband, and very close friend. I do not suggest this med to anyone.

I learned a few tricks when taking Diovan. First you MUST drink plenty of water or juice. Cranberry juice, flavored water, vitamin water, poweraide or gatorade really helps. And it also helps to take potassuim. And limit the amount of salt/salty food consumed. These are things that really helped my muscle cramps and fatigue.

Did notice weight gain in the mid-section, hair loss and cough but did not contibute to drug until reading these comments. However, within the last yr I've experienced severe muscle cramps &amp; joint pain (so severe I felt like my shins were breaking in half) and I wear out really quickly and frequent urination. Come to find out drug lowered my potassium levels so now I'm taking a potassium supplement along with the HCT which seems to help a little with the cramping but not take them completely away. Just walking around the grocery store still wears me out.  Also, have been experiencing lower back pain and not being able to sleep at night and extremely tired during the day probably due to lack of sleep at night. Anxiety attacks(feels like I'm on speed) and can be very moody.  Went to DR yesterday &amp; explained problems and she says that my dosage maybe to high therefore lowered my dosage. Right now I'm taking 2 - 160/25 a day so I'm going to try lowering to 2 - 160-12.5 a day. Hopefully that will help with the side effects and if not, I'm defintely trying something else. This weight gain in the mid section is killing me. :) All in all the drug is very good at lowering the BP and if you can deal with the side effects or don't have any at all it's a good BP med to be on. I've tried several different kinds and this is the only one that has actually worked at lowering my BP. Now I'm happy to say my BP runs around 126/80 which is a great for me. All I can say is, try it for a few months and if the side effects are so severe and you can't deal with them, then try something else.

Its good to see some of the symtoms I'm having are the same from reading a lot of the other reviews, like headaches, hair thinning etc. It sure would be nice to handle this issue using natural herbs, because I'm sick of drugs and there side effects which may cause some other issue's in your body.

I was hoping it would bring my BP down without bringing down my erections, no such luck. It might be the HCT part that is doing it.

At first my it kept my BP in check with no alarming side effects. (that I noticed) Now my BP is higher again and I have had a significant hair loss. My hair is half as thick as it was a year ago. Started so slowly I didn't really notice. My Dr said it wasn't the drug. I researched and found that it is a side effect. I am still losing hair, I wonder if it will ever stop now. If your hair starts thinning, don't wait to see how bad it will get, change meds. If BP meds cause hair loss in YOU... always ask the pharmacy if it is a side effect before you fill your next RX.

I have seizures .  The drug interfers with the seizures medication so that I have to take the dilantin 3 times a day instead of the once a day that I was taking it.  If I don't take the dilantin I get a pain in my heart.  The pain goes away immediately after taking the dilantin.  I keep getting hot flushing in my face at least 10 times a day.

The only issue I have with the medication is cost.  There is no generic brand for Diovan, therefore I am forced to purchase the brand name medication which is quite expensive.  Fortunately, my primary care physician usually has samples on hand when I need some to carry me over until I get to the pharmacy.

I went from extremely active to sleeping 12 to 14 hours a day and barely able to stay awake during the rest. My face is swollen every morning and I feel like I have a sinus infection.

If I cut back on it the muscle cramps seem to be lessened but that means raised b p so I am asking my new Dr to think of changing to another medication. I want to thank everyone who reviewed this drug -- It made me aware that some of the things I am experiencing are most likely form this drug.
High Blood Pressure	looking for energy!, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	7/20/2009 12:37:30 AM	I have been taking Diovan HCT 160/12.5 for about the last 12 years after discovering I had Type II Diabetes. The doctor seemed to think this was the best BP medication for diabetics. I have blamed my problems with shortness of breath, additional weight gain, joint pain, and severe fatigue on the fact that I am very much overweight. Now I wonder if this drug may be the culprit as well.  I have gotten to the point where normal daily chores are overwhelming and do not sleep well even though I have removed all caffeine out of my diet for the last two months.  I applaud the fact that these reviews are available to help us out.

I had severe htn secondary to severe hyperthyroidism. My b/p was 180/120 now it's 110/70. I gained alot of weight and lost alot of hair ( use thymuskin gold gel) it helps alot. But now I'm going off of it, since my b/p is lowered and the side effects seem to be outweighing the good. I'm greatful it did the job, but now I have to concentrate on my ever-expanding frame, and I can't do that while on an rx that caused weight gain. Good luck to everyone out there. It isn't fun finding the right rx that works with little side effects.

My MD I believe picked this med for this is what he had the most in samples. The first time I took this pill , i became very lightheaded and dizzy I was overwhelmed with sweat. My blood pressure was 160/90 and that quick my bp dropped to 90/60 it snowed me. My body could not take the quick change. So therefore i am tired of being a lab rat with bp meds, i am going to go to a specialist a cardiologist for now on. Hopefully they will provide me with the correct medication. I do not longer trust my MD. For I got htn through my birth control pill.

He said diovan would not, but recently I have noticed more coughing than usual.  I have also gained weight around the middle, experienced hair loss, has frequent diarrea, dizziness, fatigue, back pain, kidney pain.  Since I am on more than one medication I cannot one hundred percent blame everything on dioval/160mg/12.5 hct, but a lot of the problems some of the others described apply to me also.  I will ask my doctor about some of them.  He put me on diovan to help protect my kidneys since I am a diabetic.  My legs also hurt terribly when I try to walk. They say lose weight but if medication prevents you from walking and don't mention the tiredness.  I used to exercise morning and evening but am now to tired.  I usually go to sleep after I take the meds.  All of mine seem to make me sleepy and taking more than one is too much, not to mention after taking four BP medication my blood pressure remains above normal, usually 165/78 or higher.  What's going on?  I have headaches, sometimes for a week at a time.

Two years ago I stated taking it with 12.5 mg of HCT.  I soon developed diabetes.  I have been off the drug for 5 days and my diabetes has disappeared no matter what I eat.  What is going on?  Has this contributed to or caused my diabetes.  I feel so much better since quitting it.

As a female, this is very depressing.  I believe is has caused me to gain a lot of weight around the mid section. I am a vain person so I would advise no one to stop their medication because of this. I am thinking of asking my doctor to change my med.

Diovan was immediately effective in lowering my BP but I experienced a fast pulse and heart palpitations daily even being sedentary. I also felt sluggish, had a cough (like I did with Ramipril)and headaches. After being miserable being on Diovan HCT,my primary care physician put me on Benicar which I hope will the one.

I  have been on it for 5 yrs.  it does give you dry mouth but that is becasue there is a diarectic in it. You need to drink lots of water and yes that will make you go to the bathroom more.  My blood pressure stays at 110/65.  
High Blood Pressure	deswork, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	65-74	3/4/2009 9:42:01 PM	I have been taking for one year after trying many generics that had too many major side effects.  This one did for several months then all went away, but now I started a slight cough occasionally throughout a day or night, but doctor says not a side effect, but I disagree after reading many comments and the last paragraph of the instructions that mention cough.  I will stay on until I see him in April.  Does anyone know if the natural product sold by GNC and other health stores known as the seven flowers actually works.  Diovan HCT 180/25 has lowered my Bp to 120/75, but I won't accept any side effect as this tells me it is not natural for a medication to cause other problems.

But even taking 240 mg, my BP was at best in the 130's (often 140's and occasionally 150's) systolic and upper 80's (and sometimes 90's) diastolic.I've been on the Diovan HCT 160/25 for a week now.  My BP at the doctor's office today was 110/60, then 110/70!!  At home it's been running in the 120's systolic in the 70's diastolic.With no side effects (other than a few more trips to the bathroom because of the diuretic) and the great control of my BP, I'm lovin' this drug!

Lower amounts of either stink for me.By far the best in terms of my ability to maintain exercise tolerance, energy, etc which were probs with other BP medsMy main concern is that I have been in a prolonged depression flare-up and have to wonder if it is this med or not.

I stopped taking Diovan and the horrific cough and resulting incontinence went away within 3 days. Went to many doctors however not one caught that the cough was caused by Diovan. Found out that this was a side effect on my own thru reading. Diovan did a lot of damage to my body, however I am getting better.

I lost weight on a different medication and my blood pressure stabilized.  I was able to be off my medication for approximately 3 months before my blood pressure began to be elevated and I had to reuse the medication.  I had no hesitation to use it.  It works well.  I take it at bedtime so I don't feel dizzy after I take it.

High Blood Pressure	Hopethishelps, 35-44 Male  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	11/26/2008 8:34:56 AM	As a pilot, I was extremely satisfied with this drug.I did experience dizziness when standing for the first two weeks.  That has gone away.  My blood pressure has gone from 160/98 to a much more acceptable level of 130/89.  Although I'd like it a little lower, considering the stresses, my poor diet, and lack of exercise do to an unusual work pattern, this medication is extremely helpful even without my help.I do notice improved, easier, and more relaxed breathing and lowered blood pressure.  Side effects included the initial week or two of lightheadedness while standing, fatigue (not wanting to get off the couch).  Although once I began to move and get moving, I did not feel more tired than normal and I am able to complete a normal day's work without a nap.

As an MI survivor this was cause for alarm.  Also, after being on it for one week I saw my blood pressure drop at first then rise to the highest it has been in years (160/100).  My doctor put me on Diovan to try to get it down from 150/90 where it had risen to on a straight ACE inhibitor.

I've been on DiovanHCT for over 2 years and my BP normally runs about 119/72.  I check my BP about twice a month and find that it never varies much from 119/72.  I take the medication each morning. It is easy to use and I am very satisfied with the results. I've not had any negative side effects.

High Blood Pressure	marilyn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/13/2008 12:20:34 AM	I have severe hypertension secondary to severe hyperthyroidism. The result is that I'm living with an elevated sympathetic nervous system. I'm off the beta blocker(tenormine). My endocrinologist tried many antihypertensives to get B/p down. Diovan is the only one that worked well. However I find that If I take 320mg bid I feel wonderful and b/p is excellent. My Dr. says no way! So I'm back to 160 bid and only feeling ok. I wish I could take more but he said the side effects would be too harmful. Too bad. Any suggestions?
High Blood Pressure	TT, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	10/11/2008 1:44:24 PM	Diovan HCT 160/12 did not reduce my blood pressure for the year &amp; a half that I took it.  My doctor upped the dosage to 320 and 2 weeks later at my check up, my blood pressure had increased.  With this result my doctor added Norvasc a week ago and my blood pressure is still above normal.  But has come down slightly with the added Norvasc. Makes me wonder if it is doing more harm than good.  Since on this drug I've suffered with depression, hypothyroidism and just recently with a dermatologists diagnosis of discoid Lupus. This a rash that occurs whenever I'm exposed to the sun with or without a minumum of #50 protection. Is this related to the Diovan I'm taking? Who know's?  Neither my doctor or dermaologist knows.

Tried many generics and had too many side effects I could not live with.  With Diovan I experienced anxiety at first, then everything seemed okay, then I experience heaviness in my chest sometimes.  Doctor did all heart tests and all is okay including colestrol, but I want to get off of this medication that I am sure my doctor will keep me on forever.  Does anyone know of a good supplement that works????  I am on 160/12.5

One dosage brought my bp down 80 points to a &quot;normal high BP&quot; which then he bumped me up to the high octane flaver 320/12.5 mg which now has been keeping my BP around 130 / 80.  No side effects whatsoever and no rhyme or reason why the excessively high BP.  Doc called it &quot;bad luck&quot;

I have had really high blood pressure for a long time that went unnoticed. I was running 186/123 for the last couple years and have tried a couple different medicines. This one seems to work the best and has brought it down to 100/65. I have forgotten to take it once or twice and I get EXTREAMLY bad headaches. I have pain in my fingers that Ive never had before. I am only 22 and have had all the test done to see why I have high bp and nothing has come back abnormal. I'm not over weight and high bp doesnt run in my family. In fact, everyone has low bp. I am very active and run five miles a day. Anyone have any ideas? My Dr. says some people just have high bp, but its very uncommon for my age.

I have been on this medication for about 2 + yrs. now and the pain in my joints, muscles and back have been getting extremely worse.  I can't get out of bed without limping, I am in severe pain when I walk and most of the time I want to sleep.  Before I started taking this medicine I was very active.  Even my hair is beginning to fall out more and my headaches have gotten worse.  I have had so many tests done to find the root of my problems and everything was negative.  I believe it is all a result of taking Diovan HCT.  I am going to have the doctor change it to see if the pain goes away.

High Blood Pressure	Teddy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	45-54	9/11/2008 9:56:20 PM	Been on Diovan HCT for 2 years, increasing dosage to 320/12.5 mg. with no side effects until the past 8 months.  Side effects have since included pain in hips, legs and numbness of calves/feet when walking more than 2-3 blocks.  Mentioned to doctor that I had seen same side affects posted on web and suggested taking me off of Diovan HCT. He didn't think the medication could be the cause. I've been off of it for 1 week and hip pain gone after 24 hours.  Pain/numbness of calves and feet have improved although calves still feel tighter than normal.  Feet no longer go numb when walking.

Doctor switched me to 320/12.5 and blood pressure now regularly at 130/80.  Not sure why the increase in the systolic number, but the doctor hasn't been concerned.Other than that the medicine has worked better than the 160 with few if any side effects.  Actually with working out and eating properly I have experienced weight loss.

I use it with atenenol , which I take twice daily and with just taking the atenenol alone Ihave some headaches and heaviness in my chest and with the diovan it's not as bad.  Is it something I can do without?  By itself Diovan does much of nothing.  I really don&quot;t think I want to rate this product but find a connection to somewhere that can tell me the reactions between multible drugs

Started on 80mg/12.5mg, but needed to up it to 160/25 due to returning edema. Bloodwork is showing elevated liver enzymes now. Will be seeing MD for this next week. Could be side effect. I also have gained weight around my mid-section. Is this common and how long does it last? I can't afford to gain any extra weight. I'm also hypothyroid &amp; have maintained my weight (albeit not what I would like) for the last 15 years. Recently had a hysterectomy to remove a mass also. I really don't need any more problems.

It was very easy to take and I Taught High School, daily,  with NO problems.  But, my doctor INSISTED that I lower the pressure MORE and gave me 320/12.5 which I am on now...This dosage is UN-bearable. I have rapid, then slow breathing, dizziness, light headed, stomach weight gain, larger arms...But my doctor would not reduce the meds.  I wrote him a letter explaining all of this then called him, explaining, that I was in and out of the ER because of the increased pill. I wanted and asked the doctor to Please return me to the lower dosage that I felt worked well for ME...This doctor refused and refused to refill any more pills.  When I called his office he told me to find another doctor. I am forced to break the pills half until I can find another doctor.  The 320/12.5, somehow, are NOT Chemically the same as the 160/12.5 which I HAD NOT PROBLEMS WITH. msbobbie55@hotmail.com
