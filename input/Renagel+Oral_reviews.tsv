High Amount of Phosphate in the Blood	jessie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	9/8/2012 7:07:01 PM	Im writing this review for my grandmother. Renvela is WAY better folks! Grandma's phos. level doesn't change at all hardly with Renagel. Basically, it's cheaper, but it sucks. Renvela will bring your phosphate levels right on down. Switch to that if your taking this stuff! A bonus: most patients on Renvela have NO side effects while renagel gives heartburn and takes away the taste of food! I never heard of Phoso though. Maybe I might hint at grandma to try that. Anything seems better than ineffective Renagel.

I seem to require 5 tablets with a typical meal of protein to control my blood phosphorus level.  I have had no apparent side effects.  My pharmacy has switched to Renvela so I'm taking the same number of those tablets.  It is very expensive, about $1.80 per tablet.  I didn't want to take Phoslo as long term usage can lead to calcification of different organs.

Nothing like waking up with burning sencations in your chest!!

It has helped lower his phosphate level, but he has had frequent nausea &amp; vomiting.  Has also complained about the taste of food changing since he began this med.  He is requesting to be put back on Phoslo.

Bright red blood comes with bowel movements and sometimes makes me feel like I need a bowel movement.
