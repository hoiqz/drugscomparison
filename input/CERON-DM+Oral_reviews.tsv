Cough	mojo1485, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/29/2011 5:56:42 PM	I haven't had any of the issues listed here by others.  I haven't had any of the stomach issues and have slept fine at night.  I guess it effects different people differently.  The coughing is usually suppressed after taking it, but sometimes I feel like it takes a little longer than it should.
Cough	Ginny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	5/1/2011 2:43:37 AM	Dr. gave me this to take full well knowing I am a Diabetic with severe heart problems and have Liver Disease. I lloked it up here and it said for folks w/ these should be careful &amp; talk to Dr. What a quack he is! Time to change. It tasted awlful and only made me very sick. Glad I found out about Precautions before I took 2nd dose! I am my own protector. I think my Dr. graduated at the bottom of his class! :(

Cough	Borkranch, 0-2 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	0-2	5/11/2010 11:52:26 AM	My 2yr old son ended up at the er monday last week due to a HIGH fever.  They put him on this med.  2 days later my inlaws came for a visit.  My son is normally hyper but a sweet loving child.  While they were here he was biting, hitting, pinching, no listening to anything we were saying.  No disciplinary actions were working.  His normal wildness increased to 100 miles an hour.  He got these evil looks in his eyes.  He took a crow bar in the truck and tried smashing out the window (husband caught him in middle of the swing).  We have this one room that has a lock on the outside to keep little ones from going in.  He got an evil grin and tried locking me in.  On Mothers Day I had to get a babysitter for him so my husband, in laws, and daughter could go out and enjoy dinner.  My husband and I scratched our heads of any new changes that could change our sweet boy over night like this.  This med was the only major change we could think of.  We started researching it and came to find out others with children the same age are having simular issues.  We are taking our son off of the meds NOW and I cant wait till they get out of his system ~ just writing this he's hit me a number of times wipped soap on me and no is running around the house like hes possessed. Also I notice the cough get worst not better.
Cold Symptoms	Bija, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	5/7/2010 12:32:11 PM	I had every side effect and no idea why I wasn't feeling better.  My prescription didn't have a label that even warned me of the side effects. I continued taking the medication, as prescribed, and wasn't feeling any better; actually worse.  I was dizzy, had a head ache, nausea, &amp; dry throat.  I coughed till it hurt.  Please put side effect warnings on prescription.  I drove myself and my family to work and school for an entire week; this could of been tragic.

Cold Symptoms		1	5	1			8/12/2009 10:01:28 AM		The facts: Due to what appeared to be nothing more than a case of the common flu, my grandaughter was prescribed a cough syrup, specifically Ceron DM.  Some 24 hours later, this child was pronounced dead in the same emergency room.  The coroners ruling stated that death was probably the result of sepsis brought on by non MRSA staph.  No focal point was located for this infection.  Here are several more facts: A majority of pediatricians advise against administering cough syrups to children. Likewise, government regulators in the UK have banned giving cough syrups to children under the age of 12.  Note that cough syrups have absolutely no curative value.  If there is any positive benefit, whatsoever, it would be merely to relieve symptoms.  Yet, proof of even this minimal benefit is less than conclusive. 	What is incomprehensible in this situation is the fact that the FDA apparently does not compile statistics on what drugs were, or were not, administered when an otherwise healthy child dies.  Yet, our nations drug police appear to find time to OK cancer treatments for dogs or to protect the public from the evils of Cheerios.  (Which, incidentally, do offer statistically proven health benefits)	Here is my opinion: Administering a cough syrup increases the chance of serious complications in children.  Granted, it is a small risk.  However, since there are few, if any, positive benefits, it is still quite an unacceptable risk.  We do not place our kids in a car seat because this guarantees their survival under any circumstance.  We take this step armed with the firm knowledge that car seats reduce the potential for risk. This knowledge comes through government crash tests and by simultaneously keeping statistics on real world accidents. Is it too much to ask that we similarly track other potential risks

Other		1	5	1			3/22/2009 9:09:38 AM	My 10 year old grandaughter went to the emergency room in February experiencing flu like symptoms, including difficulty breathing.&#160; She was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection.&#160; The doctor sent her home after prescribing Ceron DM.&#160; Some 24hrs after receiving this medication this gifted, energetic child was pronounced dead in the same emergency room.&#160; Although the coroner could find no focal point of infection, sepsis (caused by staph) was listed as the &quot;probable&quot; cause of death.&#160; Curiously, the symptoms of this disease were nearly identical to listed side effects for Ceron DM. We may never know what role, if any, cough syrup may have had in this child's death. This much we do know however: Cough syrups will NEVER treat serious diseases such as sepsis or meningitis.&#160; If a child is in that minority who truly has a serious disease versus a simple cold the possible side effects of cough syrups wil only serve to confuse the dianoses with possibly devastating results. Worse yet, these drugs may be medically contraindicated in such a situation, i.e. they may cause even further harm.&#160; Now weigh this out against possible benefits. Even if a child does have only a simple cold, cough syrups treat only the symtoms, not the virus that causes the cold. Yet, many health care professionals doubt that they are effective at even treating the symptoms.&#160; In other words there are no proven benefits.&#160; But trust me on this; there are definite risks.&#160; Even though these risks may be statistically slight, remember that children are our most precious commodity; let us all strive to prevent them from becoming a statistic.&#160; Also, remember that if your child has a simple cold, they will recover quite well, even without ingesting cough syrup that by its very nature assigns additional risks.
