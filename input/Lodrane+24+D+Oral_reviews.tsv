Other	WMSturgill, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	3/24/2012 11:45:26 AM	I have absolutely terrible allergies and after numerous other allergy prescriptions my immunologist prescribed me this, and man am I glad he did. The only side effect that I have experienced while on this drug is slight drowsiness, but for me the pros of this far outweigh that one con. This takes care of my itchy eyes, sneezing,sore throat, and an array of other symptoms of my allergies. Personally, I have never experience some of the other side effects others here have mentioned (ex. high heart rate, not being able to sleep, increased anxiety, headaches...) and I have been taking this for nearly 8 months. Although this does make me slightly drowsy, it's really not something that I have not experienced with other allergy prescriptions, and if anything I am not as drowsy as I was on some of the others I have tried.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5		19-24	3/22/2012 7:25:53 PM	So bummed that the drug companies stopped producing this. The only downside to Lodrane-D for me was having to remember to take it twice a day, but it has kept me allergy symptom free for over a year and a half, and I take the drug several months throughout the year. I have chronic allergies so I need an antihistamine and decongestant regiment that completely knocks my allergies out of the ballpark and Lodrane-D did that.

Cold Symptoms	mad patient, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/2/2011 7:00:00 AM	This is the worst medicine I have ever taken!!! I went to Doctor's Care for a sore throat and the doctor prescribed this along with an antibiotic. It was a nightmare the first night I took it. My symptons were not severe when I went to Doctor's Care, just uncomfortable. The first night I took this medicine, I could not sleep, had a migrane, and pounding in my ear. I am glad I am not going crazy, and others know how terrible this drug really is!!
Allergic Conjunctivitis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/30/2011 9:21:01 AM	Lodrane has worked great for me. My nose seems like it was always stuffed up. The only side effect has been dry mouth which just means I drink more water. I can live with that. :)

Made my heart race, felt like throat was closing up, could't sleep, during the night, thought I was having a heart attack (felt heavy pressure in chest, sore arm, bad indigestion).  And, just made me feel so very drugged up and totally out of it.  Never again!
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/27/2011 9:05:49 AM	My doctor put me on this medication to help with my chronic/daily headaches. WOW! I have seen several neurologists, docs, etc. and nothing ever cured them. I have been on this medication about 2 weeks now and have only had ONE headache. I am VERY pleased, the only side effect I have had is more congestion, but I can deal with that better than daily headaches!!

My nose is till stuffy somewhat and I have yet to see any side side affects other than being slightly sleepy. I also think that Allegra D is far more effective than this medication.

I felt slightly sleepy the first time I took it but nothing since. I'm surprised at some of the horrrible remarks about this med. It was prescribed only for 2 weeks for me but I am going to ask my doc can it be taken everyday.

I was so miserable, unbearable headache for 4 weeks, throbbing in my left cheek, forehead and left side of my head.I had completed 3 weeks of aggressive antibiotic therapy with minimal improvement. After the first dose of this med I noticed great improvement and total relief now,4 days later with no side effects except drowsyness the first day.

Cold Symptoms	Doe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	2/3/2010 11:01:55 AM	I guess I was not as congested as I needed to be for the benefits of this med to outweight the sideeffects. I was anxious, sleepy, but could not stay asleep, had headaches, upset stomach, dizzy, very light headed and unbalanced. There was some relief of congestion, but not enough for me to try and ride out the side effects. Will not try again. 
Cold Symptoms	Ethan57, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	45-54	1/31/2010 9:37:04 PM	This medication made me feel crazy. It did relieve congestion well but there were too many side effects for the benefits. Dizzy, dazed, can't sleep, headache, anxious, chills, trouble breathing. I only took them because my Dr. said they were mild. Maybe I'm sensitive (I never take OTC cold medicine) but I can't imagine ever wanting to take this again. 
Other	Sarah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/28/2010 7:07:18 AM	I went into a walk-in clinic for a sore throat, and was prescribed this.  I had no idea it was an anti-histamine/decongestant.  I took the drug around 8pm and at first, I just fell right to sleep on my couch.  But then, when I got up and went to bed, I was up all night, couldn't sleep, and when I tried, I had weird, scary dreams, and the drug forced me to swallow a lot- not good when you have a sore throat.  Being that I really didn't have much congestion, I can't say how it worked at relieving those symptoms, but even if I did have those symptoms, I would not have taken this drug again.  Being up all night has not been fun and I will not take this drug again.  
Other	NewtoMD, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/25/2010 10:36:30 AM	I have never written a review on a drug, but I had so many side effects that I felt like I needed to submit a review. I have had a headache ever since I started taking Lordane 24 D. I also had trouble sleeping, restlessness, and had bad dreams. I cannot believe my doctor prescribed this to me when there are other good drugs that do not have all these side effects. I have never had side effects like I have when I used this drug and for it to be just a decongestant/antihistamine is crazy. I hope this helps someone in the future!
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	45-54	1/17/2010 11:59:35 AM	I didn't see it in the listed side effects, but I suffered a complete loss of libido while I was taking Lodrane. Although my doctor said to take it for 10 days, I stopped at 7 and sex drive returned in about 36 hours. If I was having serious nasal problems, I guess that wouldn't be a bad trade off, but I think an over the counter decongestant would have been fine.
Cold Symptoms	Nicole11, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	25-34	12/6/2009 11:44:08 AM	This is the worst medication ive ever used in my life!  The side effects were HORRIBLE.  I couldnt walk due to being so dizzy.  I felt like I was going to fall over every time I got up.  The nausea was terrible.  I was only on this medication for 1 day and never thought that I would experience such horrible side effects from just taking this medication once.  It is now 2 days after I took the first pill and I am just now somewhat getting over the dizziness and nausea.

Helped with the sinusitis within hours, in a day it seemed gone, though I also received antibiotics. the ear has been slower- a week later still a little stuffy but improving daily.

By far the most effective antihistamine I've tried.  However, it makes me very spacey, exhausted, and thirsty.  If I take regularly for a week or so, the side effects lessen.
