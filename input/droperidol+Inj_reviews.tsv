Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	3/18/2012 5:29:48 PM	Went to ER last nite, thought was my MS (have had optic neuritis in past) but also have severe reoccurring migraines. Dr said would treat me for migraine when eye exam was normal calling this a migraine variant due to severe eye pain after eye exam to check for damage cornea etc(it was same eye as I usually get bugged with both with my migraines and MS) but felt different this time. So I was given 25mg bendryl as well as this IV push. It seemed to work. It just made me SOOO tired that couldnt even send my hubby a quick text to tell him that I was ok (he took the kid home as he wouldnt handle waiting in the ER waiting room for hours easy). It left me exhausted though but not truly so sure how much was treatment vs pain during day exhaustion or combo). Eye pain coming back now, figures its 24hrs later. I have taken compazine and reglan in past and both caused extreme anxiety attacks. Glad this didnt now that I've read other reviews. I do believe that we should get informed choices whenever possible but not everyone will react to every drug same also.  This med also toned down my tinnitus (which is thought could be migraine related as well) so will go ahead and try another med that my ENT neuro specialist recommended at my last visit also now.  Yeah yeah know I am a neurological mess.
Other	iridaeza, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	2/20/2012 9:31:16 PM	Went to ER for severe headache, night sweats, feverish feelings. Recent trip to remote areas of Mexico, sprung thoughts of possible Malaria. Was given IM Droperidol to relieve headache pain. Within 3 to 5 minutes symptoms of extreme anxiety, crawling out of skin, bright lights, hot flash-extremely horrible feeling of being out of control, wanted to leave, heartrate by monitor was in the high 130's(before shot was in the 80's). Dr. and nurse did not seem alarmed by my reaction to the medication! IV of normal saline was then started and I was given an IV push of 25mg Benadryl. Still felt weird the next day and will NEVER take this medication or anything related to this med ever again!!

Other	Indiana Jones, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	5/15/2011 2:54:06 PM	I was in the ER for heart arrhythmia, pain, and a severe headache. The doctor thought I was anxious, as well, but I am just normally a fast talker and I was in pain. The ER doctor gave me this medication and said it was for pain. Apparently, this is not a pain medication. Within 5 minutes, I was having difficulty breathing and became out of touch with reality. I became very agitated with restless leg, tachycardia, and confusion. I felt I was going to pass out or die. This medication was derived in Hell. My ER doctor was not being honest in why he administered this medication. Patients NEED to ask &quot;why&quot; before medications are administered. We have the right.

I never received the treatment for the headache due to the fact that halfway through the Droperidol, I could no longer breathe, I also felt as though I was losing my mind.My son and daughter in law had to go get the nurse. They insisted she remove the IV. It took me 2 days to feel like I was even alive.
