Sometimes during the day, I would vomit without warning, and had no appetite.  After an endoscopy, colonoscopy, CAT scan and a diagnosis of esophogeal errosion and anorexia, MD switched me to Protonix/Pantoprazole, and although it took a few days to kick in, I'm able to eat everything again, except spicy foods (never could) and was able to keep most of the weight off. Just recently, RX ran out due to a change of insurance and I've gone almost 2 weeks without it - not good, but am drinking lots of milk and nibbling crackers.  I know it works for me and will need to get back on it soon and remain on it for the rest of my life:-) Hope this helps!

Eventually I was switched to the quite-a-bit less expensive generic version when it became available.  The pain &amp; reflux returned!  Finally figured out what changed &amp; got back on the expensive name brand Protonix.  It helped somewhat, (better than nothing), but was still having reflux issues requiring additional antacids.  After doing some research I found that Protonix is on the Best Pills/Worst Pills' &quot;Worst Pills&quot; list.  Finally saw another Dr. who prescribed &quot;Carafate&quot;.  I have to take it 4 times a day, but I'm delighted to say that I was able to wean myself off of Protonix!  You have to do it gradually, going cold turkey doesn't work.  I'm finally off of this horrible, expensive &amp; harmful drug!  It &quot;worked&quot; for several years, but now I too have vision problems (floating things).  Also have stomach polyps now that were caused by the long term use of this PPI.  I still have to avoid spicy foods, but I wanted to share with others out there what is working for me.  I hope this helps others.

Been on it for about two years. Began having extremely high creatin levels &amp; my primary care physician said to drink more water; I was dehydrated. I drank major amounts, still no change. Went online &amp; found out that long term (over a year) use can cause elevated creatin levels. Dr. stopped it &amp; creatin went to normal. But he now says to begin it again because it was just because I was dehydrated. After seeing the post about the positive for THC and it is also on the Best Drug/Worst Drug List as a worst drug, I am going to stop this drug. My doctor can surely come up with something safer than this. Some doctors pooh-pooh that list, but every drug that has been on the worst list has eventually been banned by FDA.

I was fine until all of a sudden I got sick all over, headache, pain from the top of my head to my lower stomach, almost passing out, vomiting, and then my hands started to itch terribly.  It took a good 30-45 minutes for me to ease.  I thought I was having a stroke or a heart attack, it was awful!  NEVER AGAIN WILL I TAKE THIS MEDICATION!!!

Diganosed with Barretts Esophagus, a step up from Gerds and pushing Esophagal Cancer and at 65 I highly recomend this drug, I take the generic because the Brand Protonic runs around 150 bucks for 30 40mg pills and only around 6 bucks with the free TogetherRX card at Walgreens for the generic(I have no insurance). No more tums tums tums, 0 acid in the esophagus since I started this treatment. Talk to your doctor and stop heart burn, the acid that comes up in your esophagitis time after time will erode the  liner. A more sinsitive liner than that of the stomach, after acid reflex(gerd) comes Barrett Esophagitis, without treatment could move onto a very deadly cancer. Good Luck.

Conditions of Excess Stomach Acid Secretion	Sherry, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	8/7/2011 8:15:58 PM	This was one of the last medications for my acid reflux left for me to try to help with my acid reflux.  All other RX either caused itching or neck and shoulder pain.  After taking Protonix for about 5 days I finally connected the side effects.  It caused excessive burning in my left eye which lasted for several hours after taking.  It has also caused long white strands of floaters in my right eye which have not disappeared even after discontinuing the medication.  DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE.  It could cause some scary and maybe even permanent side effects with your eyes.  It did not prove to be effective in helping my acid reflux.  Beware of this drug.  The generic form did not cause the same side effects with my eyes but did cause itching throughout my body.

WARNING... I was tested for a drug screen in the ER &amp; tested POSITIVE for THC (marijuana)!  I was shocked &amp; suprised~ I do not smoke!  I made them retest!!! Tested Postive a 2nd time!   I found out later that Protonix can make you test positive for THC on a drug test.  The bad part was my Dr that I had did not know about this interaction &amp; so I felt like they didn't believe me when I told them that I don't smoke &amp; what info I found out about Protonix!  The medicine WORKS GREAT, but I'm not sure at this point what to do!

It doesnt matter what I eat or how little I eat during the day. It still happens. I am afraid that I may die this way someday.

This is the cheap drug used in hospitals. Prilosec worked great for me. Had to come off it because it might cause a reaction with Plavix. Looks like Protonix is no better.

That stopped working after 2 weeks and I was given Protonix.  I was amazed at how well this worked, BUT I was extremely fatigued, had awful brain fog, and couldn't remember anything. I also gained about 5 pounds. I finished a two week cycle with Protonix and my pain was back within 24 hours, but so was my energy level and ability to think clearly.  I am trying to find a viable replacement as I don't think I can handle the fatigue and brain fog.  That was really awful.
Other	TFPA, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	65-74	2/23/2011 10:37:05 AM	After 3+ years of use (40mg, one a day) Protonix/pantoprazole find this med has controlled my GERD.  Unfortunately my insurer (United Healthcare) suddenly resisted dispensing further renewals of the generic version, while quadrupling the co-payment without forewarning.  Insurer, second-guessing my gastroenterologist, wants to dispense omeprazole (Prilosec), which in past usage I found to be only mildly effective (and with disturbing side effects).  And I thought among reasons to resist healthcare reform was that we didn't want &quot;the government&quot; dictating our medical treatment...

About a week after i started this med (which worked wonders for my IBS symptoms-i could finally eat without having severe stomach pain after!), my infant started unconsolable crying &amp; wouldnt eat at night and early morning. Her ped thinks she has an intestinal bug of some sort, but it is such a coincidence that she came down with that a week after i started this new med. Her ped doesnt think the 2 are related. Anyone have a similar situation? Ive stopped taking the med, and now cant eat again, to see if she improves at all.

It is great, no negative side effects.  Still have to avoid spicy foods.  Once reflux was under control I went to using Protonix every other day as a maintenance dose and have had no problems since.  However, as others have noted, Ins. Companies put this in highest payment tier.  I will not switch to one of their generics as I do not want to chance losing the control of my reflux or experienceing side effects of other meds.

Seems to be Dark chocolate, some coffee's and other things with cocoa or caffeine.  After several days of use the symptoms go away.  This Protonix is a box of gold to me.  But I have to use it consistently, even as I start to feel better.  I tend to stop taking it after a couple weeks of use then a couple months later the symptoms come back.  Protonix and Aciphex both seem to work well.

I have severe GERD and could not sleep for the distress.  Diet changes did not make a noticible difference.  Protonix gave me my life back.  Now I can go out to eat with friends and not wind up in severe pain before getting home.  My uncle died of cancer of the esophagus and he had my symptons for years and did nothing about it until it was too late.  I will not make that mistake.  This medicine has helped so much and I am grateful for it.

One side effect though is that I have gained 7 pounds! I live an active and healthy lifestyle, so I was shocked and then I realized that I took Protonix 40mg also one year ago for the first time and also gained 8 pounds, but didn't connect it with the drug. Now I read that other people have had the same side effect.  All in all I am happy that my symptoms are gone, but the side effect is a reason for me to see if there is another drug next time.

I now sleep with my head at a 15-30 degree angle and I don't suffer with acid reflux any more.  Some nights I can leave the bed flat and it's still fine.

It was gradual over time but within a few months I started having loose stools, sometimes as many as 10-12 times a day causing fatigue and anxiety over whether I was near a bathroom.  The stools were sudden and explosive.  I had to change clothes several times over the course of treatment.  I thought I had something very seriously wrong with my intestines or lower bowels.  I stopped taking the medication to see if this was the problem and suddenly my loose bowels slowed down. It took several days before I was back to normal bowel movement.  I told the doctor I stopped and he got mad at me for stopping.  I had told him about the problem and he said the medication was not the cause but it was.  Eventually I stopped the doctor as well.  This medication was terrible and I will never take it again.

After researching this, I found that acid blockers inhibit calcium and magnesium from being absorbed in the stomach.  Not only this, but that you shouldn't take this drug for more than 2 weeks.  I am now weaning myself off of it by cutting down the dose each month and feel better than I have felt in years.  I have stopped drinking coffee and cut down on red wine and everything seems fine!  I am also using a natural remedy called papaya/chlorophyll tablets.  I hate that I bought into this drug by the doctor and feel it has done a lot of damage to my body over the years.

Concerned about the false positive urine test for THC. Insurance does not cover med. $90 co-pay for generic. Good luck to all.

In handfulls!  After checking WebMD and seeing that hair loss is a &quot;less seveve&quot; side affect, I called my doctor to change my medicine immediately. I am not alone; a hairdresser friend of mine was losing her hair in the same way. When she told me she'd been on Protonix, I shared my experience. She checked with a pharmacist friend who confirmed the hair loss. Would a man have pursued this? Perhaps not, but for me this was neither &quot;less severe&quot; nor was it a &quot;lesser side effect.&quot;

My stomach produces too much acid causing severe heartburn. I was first prescribed Kapidex but it gave me a never ending yeast infection. I have had no side effects from Protonix and I love it. You don't realize how much acid reflux effects your life until you get to experience life without it. Before Protonix, I had heartburn 7-10 times a day. Now I never have it. I would recommend it to anyone!

We tried other stuff (Nexium, Prilosec, Prevacid etc) but they just don't cut it. Protonix works great, takes about three days to two weeks of regiment before you really know the results. As long as I took it I had ZERO heratburn and ZERO acid reflux. Now I can't get it because our new insurance at work refuses to pay for it. Health Alliance can (well we won't get into that).

Once I took protonix, it relieved my symptoms almost completely so i continued to take it for 3-4 years. My doctor recently advised that I stop taking it to see how I react. I am currently not taking any medication and I feel great. Protonix managed my symptoms for 4 years and has not shown any signs of dependency since I stopped it. This is the only medication that has worked for my condition.

Used for over 3 years, no side effects and controlled nightly reflux attacks. Still watched what I ate and when, but Protonix controlled most food problems. Anthem will not pay now, so I am using others, but they are not working. It will take several days to kick in, but one morning you wake up and know something is different. Then you realize, no pain.

Anything I ate would trigger it.  I didn't even want to take my regular meds because everything made my stomach burn and hurt.  I tried many OTC products that had no lasting results. Early August I had some medical proceedures done and it was then that my surgeon discovered that I was suffering from GERD. He perscribed Protonix which I have been taking for 3 weeks now and the results are absolutely wonderful. After a couple years of suffering and taking antacids, thanks to my surgeon I am finally experincing real relief from GERD.  Wish I had known about this medication a long time ago.

Had severe abdominal pain. Ended up in ER. Had to take Percaset to get through the night. Then my doctor doubled the dose. I had shortness of breath, insomnia, anxiety. Second trip to ER for intense esophogeal pressure.(Felt like I couldn't breathe) Finally figured out it was the 80 mg dose of Protonics. Stopped taking the medicine but it still took over 48 hours for the med to leave my system and get relief. Am afraid to try any other drug because the base ingredient is the same.

Suddenly months (and several medicines) later I remembered at one interval feeling much better than I had any other time during that year. After looking back at pharmacy receipts, I realized that it was during the time I had taken Protonix. I immediately contacted my doctor and had a refill called in. This time I gave it the full 6 weeks recommended and felt like a new person. I noticed major results within the first 2 weeks. I believe that my acid reflux is so severe (and I'm not always diligent about staying on a strict diet) that I didn't notice how well Protonix worked the first time because I expected to have absolutely no symtoms what so ever. While I don't know if I'll ever be completely symptom free, I do know that I live really close to it while on the Protonix. My dad started suffering from Gerd a couple years ago and has the exact same testimony now. He tried several of the common medicines and over the counters also, only to realize that Protonix gives the most desirable results. I took this medicine while pregnant with my first child then had to get off while nursing, as recommended, only to notice a huge difference. I am now pregnant with second child and am enjoying the benefits of this medicine again until I must get off to nurse my baby. After that, I plan on getting back on immediately. The medicines that are safe to take during nursing do not work very well!

So far so good, I just hope my insurance will pay for something.

OTC treatment provides only minimal relief but is still less expensive.

Stomach Ulcer	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	5/12/2009 11:17:10 AM	I must agree the generic of Protonix  Pantoprazole, does not work nothing like the original medicine. At the beginning I had headaches and you have to keep in mind this medicine does affect your digestive system so ask your doctor about fiber that you can take. After all that is the purpose of the med to stop producing of your stomach acid  which helps digest the food... Anyway I took Protonix for 30 days ($150 ) it worked great , after that starting taking the generic , now 4 months and I am having some serious acid reflex .  So Protonix original will be better choice in any case vs. Patoprazole.

Usually 2 weeks after bronchitis is gone, I have chest pain/discomfort, mild persistent cough caused by irritation in the throat (at first, thought it's still bronchitis), and a heartburn (though very rare). But after taking Protonix for a week or two, all GERD symptoms are gone. However, this time had some side effects such as weakness/tiredness, dizziness/lightheadedness, sometimes anxiety/jitters. All of these occur only during the daytime. The good thing is that they are pretty mild and not a big deal compare to GERD symptoms.I am taking Protonix 20 once a day in the morning.

I was on Nexium, but it caused stomach pains so bad I couldn't leave the house.  I thought the Protonix worked well the first 6 months, but then I began to get the stomach pains that I did with the Nexium, along with joint pain, insomnia and an elevated blood sugar level.  I stopped Protonix and the pain and other symptoms are going away and I feel I have my life back!  If I have acid indigestion now I just take a low dose of an OTC, like Pepcid, as needed, and I am fine.  Protonix is not for everyone.  We all should be aware of what some drugs may do to us over time. They may heal at first but later cause more problems.

After 4 days of taking the medication, I came down with nausea, chills and severe diarrhea. At first I thought I had an intestinal bug but after 4 days of distress, I put two and two together and figured out that it was the Protonix causing the problems. Taking Protonix caused me to miss time at work. The side effects were much worse than the condition Protonix was to correct. I would not recommend this medication to anyone.

It worked for me, but as a year went by and I was experiencing anxiety/jitters, burning tongue, stomach/abd pain, constipation, headaches, jaw/neck/ear pain, joint pain, fatigue, some insomnia....for this past yr and going to drs, spending time and money, was simply horrible, at times, I thought I had a bad disease. One day, I said to myself, there has to be something going on, since this is the only med I take at 44 yrs old, excellent health, just had to be something to do with this.....I searched more thoroughly and found MANY people who had same symptoms, some more severe, which I couldn't imagine, because most days, I could barely function, I called out sick alot, which is not me, had some depression which is NOT me at all! The other people out there were told it was from protonix, and once stopped taking, was back to normal in about 2wks!  My mouth dropped, I had a sense of relief I thought would NEVER HAPPEN!  (this is how bad I felt).  I am not taking protonix, going back to nexium for my reflux problem.  I hope I can make a difference to many to please read more thoroughly before taking any meds!!  It was a nightmare...and I was about to give up on everything.

Protonix gave me immediate relief in the first two days.  But after 5 days I had significant body and joint aches with a headache and backache, almost like flu symptoms.  I stopped the medication and the symptoms resolved, so I waited until I knew I did not have any virus or illness.  Again, the symptoms/side effects returned.  I tried Protonix 4 different times over a few months, always the same results, so I was not able to tolerate Protonix.

After three months I had gained approx forty pounds so I discontinued using it.  I knew I was not digesting my food when I continually felt bloated and could not eat for several days at a time.  I would belch and often regurjetate some of the contents in my stomach because I was always so full feeling.  Even after three days it would &quot;taste the same as when it originally went down&quot;

Protonix seemed to work ok at first with only a few nights where there was any acid reflux at night.  About two months ago the acid breakthrough at night started getting worse, and pain between my shoulders and lower abdomen.  I started twice a day 40mg and still not much releif.

The medication works wonders...no side effects that I am aware of.  No acid issues unless I go off for more than 2 days.  My big concern is if 5 years from now we find out that long-term use causes other issues.

I am worried because my mom died of stomach cancer. Had A LOT of acid bubbling and stomach cramping, churning, aching, etc. Protonix worked after about 3 days. Have only been on it for about 9 days. Eliminates acid about 85% of the time and I am more comfortable but the side effects are pretty bad, which started recently. Headache, tiredness/weakness, nausea, weight loss, dizziness, feeling overall ill - probably from not eating as much and not being able to absorb as many vitamins. Will see what the specialist says about the EGD. Bad side effects but does its job.

I was feeling really tired,period of dizziness,shortness of breath, and chest pain. Went to the doctor found out I had Iron Deficiency Anemia. Proton pump inhibitors can cause this due to lack of absorption of iron and B12. Doc. put me on iron, B12 and vitamin C. Feeling a lot better.

Drug store gave me the generic form. It's working just ok. Wondering if the name brand might be better. Anyone having numbness and tingling in the extremities, shortness of breath, fatigue, memory loss, white spots on the skin,constipation or diarrhea should have their B12 and Folate checked. These proton pump inhibitors after extended use can cause you to become B12 deficient. Everyone using these drugs should have this checked. Please google B12 deficiency and read symptoms and what this deficiency can lead to if not gotten under control.Some doctors are dumb as dirt and don't suggest this. Especially with older patients.

I had trembling hands.  After four more days in the hospital on this medication and another week at home on it; I decided to go off.  I did go off and all of these symptoms went away.  It was nightmarish. Doctors should tell patients about these symptons.
Conditions of Excess Stomach Acid Secretion	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/23/2008 10:00:23 AM	I was using Nexium for 5 years and still had my GERD act up. No other GERD type of pills worked. I recently switched to generic Protonix and it seems to be working better than Nexium. I have not had a single flare up for the first time in years! I have also noticed a decrease in appitite. Nothing major, however it just seems like my matabolisim is speeding up. I am also not sure if it sometimes counter acts my Zanax. It could be extra stress, however I have noticed more mood swings since I have been taking Protonix.

Don't recommend MEDCO at all.  Thanks to Protonix I can now sleep at night and function during the day without feeling like I'm having a heart attack!

My daily life was suffering terribly. Finally got this drug and was hesitant because of the cost but am relieved that I am able to pay for it because I now have my life back. This isn't a miracle drug. To obtain no acid at all you still have to watch what you eat and don't eat crazy things at night before bed. Watching my health and what I eat this drug is the only one that I feel saved my life. I only give it 4 stars because the expense.

I will be taking this drug for the rest of my life. I firmly belief this drug has contributed to preventing Esophageal Cancer and has helped to save my life. Fortunately my prescription drug plan helps to defray the expensive cost of this drug. However, I'd get a second job if I had to continue to take Protonix.

I noticed some relief right away, and over a short time, my symptoms disappeared completely. Now, if I have a flare-up, its because I consumed too much caffeine and forgot to take my Protonix!

I have reflux and bring up various bits of food from my stomach. Once upon a time, that included acid.  Nothing other than surgery will fix that, but no acid and no side effects is great.  I do wish my insurance hadnt removed it from their formulary.  Nexium/Prilosec works ok but had lots of side effects.  But insurance will pay for that. Go figure.

Only just holding condition in check, no real improvement.  Doctor wanted me to take Nexium, but health insurance would not cover due to cost, so &quot;stuck&quot; with this med.  !@#$!

No noticible side effects.  I take it for approx 10 days until feeling better and then again if/when GERD becomes unmanageable.  This does not work like an antacid giving instant releif.

I tried several others (Nexium, Prilosec, etc)and had to fight with my insurance company to get this more expensive drug approved.  This may work for yo where other treatments have failed
