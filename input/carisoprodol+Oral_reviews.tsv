I am 42 yrs old and have scoliosis,spondiliosis,and spondiliothesis. Ive had it sinse i was diagnosed at 14 yrs old and it has only gotten worse over the years to where i can no longer work. I cant take opiate pain killers due to becoming addicted over the years and I dont want to have to depend on them to get out of bed in the morning. I take the somas only when my back flares up and i must take 2 but i also have to be able to lie down after taking them because i get tired/drowsy but its literally the only thing that helps severe ache. also during the day i take 200mg of celebrex and believe it or not they do help alot!!!! so until they make something better than soma,its definitely my choice.

So far it's not been a whole week on the Soma, but it seems to be quite effective and I do get a much deeper sleep and wake up in the morning feeling quite well, which normally NEVER happens.  I was afraid to use this due to my mother being addicted to it years ago, but with having back problems similar to hers, I realize now why she took them.  I am only taking one pill at bedtime and 1 vicodin 2X a day.  I am hoping my body doesn't get used to it all and then i'll need more to get rid of the pain.

I noticed a couple of commemts about usimg them with narcotics. Use with vicoden/norco/then add a xanax (you might want to start by halfing the pills). This is what they call the three amigos. A very powerful cocktail and not to be taken lightly. But if ur having trouble controlling pain, well it works. But also the reason the FDA has changed the classification of the drug. Lets just say soma is being watched carefilly by tje FDA. Sorry for the typing, phone touchscreen isn't easy for me. Good luck to all with chronic pain. Been there simce 2007. Love and best wishes to all.
Muscle Spasm	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/12/2011 12:17:06 PM	I have been diagnosed with Degenerative Disc Disease.  I have had two Cervical fusions with neither one helping much. I have been fighting chronic pain since 1999 when I had the first fusion.  After the second one the pain increased five fold.  I have tried a myriad of medications and Soma has been a godsend. I take it along side another pain medication and together they work better than anything so far.  I don't think that there is anything that will cure the pain totally and sometimes it is so bad that even the current meds don't help.  But overall it helps around 80% of the time.  I just received a letter from my Ins that Soma will not be covered by them next year and that they want me to try Tizanidine, which I have just been reading about.  Lots of people are saying it causes hallucinations and dry mouth, two things that I am not willing to give a try.  If I have to pay for my Soma myself then I will.

Since my Dr., and I have instituted a work out program, my spasms have gone from 12 a year to one or two annualy.I have found that lying down if I sense the &quot;twinge,&quot; that marks the onset of my ordeal/s, and remaining in bed immobile for 24 hours, allows me to return to &quot;normal&quot; functioning. It used to take four to 7 days.

I also have a ganglion cyst on my right top hand goes into the wrist, very painful an another on left hand which came back. The tendions lock up alot on top on hands which also causes pain. I have no side effects, but helps with the pain and lets me sleep much better as well. It just has somewhat of a bad taste, and eat a snack when you take this med. Non Adicting in my opinion, have had no side effects. I sure hope they do not take this off the market, nothing else has helped. I have tried Flexeral but this med works a whole lot better.

II have no problem with addiction, but i know its stronger.I have been tried on flexril, Norflex and 2 others and none worked. I have had no problem with this other than not able to walk straight feel like i am drunk. Beats being stuck on hydrocodone, oxycodone and so on, cause it helps with pain also. Everybody reacts differently so discuss with your doctor. I take 3 a day learned to do so at bedtime, b/c of drunk feeling and i have 2 young kids at home. I cannot be that way while their awake so beware! Other than that I love it other than the nasty taste from taking them. I hope it works well for who tries it. Thanks! kellysue3278@yahoo.com i will email  and help others if needed! I promise!

This medication is a big help to me, I started when a doctor did a series of ephidurals,that helped very little in 99. 12 years and still on soma. Have taken morphine, vicodin robaxin flexeril to no avail.the doctor I had for 11 years just stopped prescribing this and it was a very horribly painful month .The difference for me was like night and day without it. I've got to make a living and hope to do it as pain free as possible.

I know I should go to a doc, just hard to get over mentality of just dealing with it. And so incredibly effective on horribly painful cramps due to menstrual cycle. Those can be so bad that i can't walk but not every month so it's hard to justify getting script for them. Maybe someday when I quit thinking I have to be tougher than the pain.

I finally suffered an attack that could have been caused by nothing other than this medication.  I looked deeper into the side effects and, sure enough, there it was:Irritation of the Stomach or Intestines	I had to stop taking the medication because it is imperative that I be able to function.

My doctors all seem to want me to take the muscle relaxer even though I have not had any spasms. This medication does nothing for my pain, but it does put me to sleep for 3 hours, which is sometimes desirable. However, if you doc says you should take this during the daytime, as mine have, I doubt you will be very happy with it. There is no way to get any work done, or even to walk further than your bathroom (I hope you don't have stairs between your bed and bath, for that matter) on this med, at least in my case. Not only does it put me directly to sleep, no matter what my pain level is, but I end up sleeping in horrible positions that exacerbate my pain and I wake up feeling almost hung-over- very groggy, headachey, moody and with greater pain. My doctors keep pushing it on me for my pain, so maybe I should just read them this review to get them to understand that I hate this drug. I do want to stress, having said all this, that I don't have muscle spasms, so it may just be my doctors' ignorance that has lead me to take this drug, and not a possibility for benefit.

I usually only take one a day, at night. I've been on it for many years and haven't found it to be habit forming (if I don't need it I don't take it with no withdrawal symptoms) or to cause any side effects. This drug is a miracle for me. Might be helpful for other people suffering with Fibromyalgia because of the muscle relaxing effects.

No doctor could find a pain med that would help, and I got them sometimes for a week straight. After seeing a specialist in Boston he perscribed soma. As long as I take at least 2 and go to bed it usually works. If I take more than 3 in a day it makes me sick. It can be very addicting, so I try to watch how much I rely on it so I dont run into any problems. When I have migranes, these pills take the pain away so I no longer have migranes for days and days and days. Life saver!

Muscle Spasm	MichaelMasters, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	11/10/2008 12:15:46 AM	I have taken Soma (Carisoprodol) for 12 years. According to the medical society, I abuse it as I take up to 10, 350mg tablets a day. They tell me it is addicting, if so, I don't care. Doctors will give me 12 extra strenght Vicodin (narcotic) a day with 4 Soma and think nothing of it. When I tell them I don't want the Vicodin, just give me more Soma, they get spasdic. I don't get it. Soma may kill me, it may not, but it keeps me going without surgery and without narcotics. Therefore, if it is addictive, so be it. I am 60 years old, in pain with severe muscle spasms, doc says I need surgery, I say screw you. Therefore I get Soma from my doctor and from anyplace that has brick walls and calls themselves a pharmacy and has a license to dispense medicine hanging on their wall. Maybe, and only just maybe, those under 40 years old maybe should be careful about taking certain drugs. But for me, Soma works, I can function on it, so I will take it. Preferably the Medical Society, Doctors, etc. will get onboard and stop worrying about it and start worrying more about narcotics. NUFF SAID!

This medication has been a life saver for me. I get these &quot;headaches&quot; in the back of my head and nothing seems to work. ( I have tried it all)  Soma is the ONLY medication that always works.  I can't say enough about this med.  It's great!  I do wish it it didnt'rob me of my energy, but the exchange is well worth it.
Muscle Spasm	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	19-24	3/28/2008 1:18:29 PM	I was prescribed this medication the other day for sever back spasms. My spasms can be so severe like a burning sensation in my back and a sharp pain associated with it. I was on flexiral but that didn't seem to work. So far I have had muscle spasms while on the medication but it hasn't been to the point where I wouldn't walk or lye down. I guess only time will tell if it works. I have noticed that when I take this medicine it leave a very nasty taste in my mouth that will last for at least an hour. I recommend taking it with food.

I have been on this medication for over 3 yrs. Some days if I didn't have it,well....I couldn't be a Mom. The Carisoprodol 350mg3x a day has worked wonders for me!!!

Muscle Spasm	kathyj, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/19/2007 7:17:10 PM	I had major back problems with pain and was told, at age 46, that I needed a hip replacement by age 50. I am now 49. The hip condition is congenital; many females in my family line have needed/had one. However, when I insisted my back be X-rayed, my Orthopaedic Surgeon was surprised at how bad it looked; I had spinal surgery (3-07) with several vertabrae fused. I recovered with Oxycodone, then with Hydrocodone and Carisoporodol and it was very helpful.  I ended up taking just the Carisoprodol, as the Hydrocodone was somewhat irritating to my thought process and stomach/gastrical tract, and I am off altogether with the exception of a few I have left over.&gt;&gt;K.E.

Just be careful using it, it is addictive.
Other	Mercenary1@sbcglobal.net, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	55-64	9/26/2007 6:09:29 AM	Since I have osteporosis throught, including mainly my larger joints such as both hips, knees, ankles (after a fall from a tree in 1995 crushing the RT Calcanius), Both shoulders and wrist, Lower back @ L-4 &amp; L-5 (older fall never corrected herniated disc). All areas effected by sometime rigid,(muscle spasams, 'floation legs' long lasting calf and thigh pain which allows very light rest at night or almost anytime I'm somewhat immobile. Pain usually first begings with a pierce, shooting pain down and along the backside of both buttocks extending down to the heel,an MRI was taken after full showing the herniated disc. casual house work most often is limited, My Sitting or standing too long, Car riding for only a few minutes can be tollerated with assistance getting in or out of car. As of yet I have not re-filled the second prescription Soma|Hydrocodone/7.mm, and now wonder if I should?
