Seasonal Runny Nose	canoe, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	5/18/2011 5:11:50 AM	This drug is ineffective.  The FDA should allow the manufacture of Entex LA which was VERY effective.  I continue to be congested and mucus pours from my nose.  Don't bother using this drug.

This drug caused me to be very jittery and tired all the time. I also experienced loss of appetite and headaches.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	7/14/2008 10:25:02 AM	I started taking this medication because I was constantly losing my voice.  My Doctor said it was most likely due to seasonal allergies, so she perscribed Clarinex-D.  This pill did improve my voice, but the side effects that I experienced were not worth it.  I was jittery, nervous, disoriented, and I could not sleep.  It also gave me very painful headaches.  I went two days with about 3 hours of sleep combined.  That's when I decided to stop the medication.  I would not recommend Clarinex-D to anyone.
Other	mississippimac, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	12/4/2007 7:40:38 PM	This medication worked but was definitely not worth it. It kept me up wide awake for 24+ hours. It was the most awful experience. When you are sick you want plenty of rest, not to be up for hours on end unable to sleep.
