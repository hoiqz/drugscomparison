As of today,,,  I have taken this for 4 days.  There is no pain just a little pressure in my ears. I don't really feel any better since taking this..  The drug store gave me a generic for this drug

Severe vertigo and dizziness, vomiting, hearing loss and severe vision loss,and severe migraines. After 4 days, I quit taking it, however 2 weeks later and I still have vertigo and I never regained my vision back, and have daily migraines.  Have to go to a specialist now for my eyes and the vertigo. I will never take it again and I pray that I get my vision back, with no vertigo and no migraines.  I have been unable to drive or work for 2 months. I am a photographer and I need to see in detail. This drug has stopped my life and I am miserable every waking moment.
Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	9/14/2009 12:47:52 AM	I've been given Biaxin XL numerous times for bronciitis, tonsilitis and sinus infections.  A few times it's been given after a round of amoxicillin didn't work.  Never had any reactions and the drug has always been very effective.  I've always been given sample packs from my doctor's office (thank god for dispensing physicians).  Recently I've been given a Rx for it and got the generic.  I'm on my second day of use and no side effects compared to the name brand so far.
Bacterial Infection with Chronic Bronchitis	New York Patient, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	9/10/2009 10:28:17 AM	I was prescribed this medication numerous times for chronic sinus infections.  Each time, it cleared up my infection within 48 hours, with no serious side effects.  However, after a couple of years using the drug, with no incidents, I had a severe allergic reaction, a rash that cycled over my body for almost three weeks.  It looked like prickly heat, and was incredibly itchy.  I also bruised easily -- whereever I scratched, and not very hard, I looked like someone had beaten me up.  So no more Biaxin for me.Any drug can cause a bad reaction, and I took Biaxin successfully for years, with no difficulties.  If you develop a rash, however, stop taking the drug, and call your doctor immediately.This drug was so effective that I regret that I can no longer take either it, or any other erythro based-antibiotic.

Now I have noticed my cheeks feel hot and are blushed. Terrible taste im my mouth and also have gotten day and night sweats.  Face feels hot all the time and I feel light headed from time to time.  Called my doctor to try something else.  Beware of this stuff.

Catarrhalis Bacteria Infection	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	4/4/2009 8:32:57 PM	I had the generic version, however it was a yellow pill similar to the non-generic, unlike the other descriptions of the generic I have read.  I don't know if the generic has improved, or if it just didn't bother me that much.  The medicine worked well and the only side-effect I experienced was the bad taste in the mouth.  The only time it really affected me significantly was when I woke up.  The taste was strong when I woke up, but I didn't notice it any other time.
Severe Episode of Chronic Bronchitis due to Streptococcus Pneumoniae	Saved by Baixin, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/7/2009 9:24:23 AM	Biaxin XL is the only drug that has cured my condition!!DO NOT TAKE THE GENERIC it causes all the severe reactions. The metallic taste in the mouths is minor with the real thing, always take with food in your stomach and any side effect will be a lot less. I was diagnosed inatially with cancer of the bronchia,which it took a pathologist to determine it was really chronic bronchitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae.(Thank God for a real doctor)and oh yeah He refused to biopsy my lung. Biaxin XL is doing it's job very well and as far as I'm concerned has made my life and breath much better. Dr. Spena Rocks, he is truly my HERO. Once again do not take the Generic for Baixin XL. To your good health.
Acute Maxillary Sinus S. Pneumoniae Bacteria Infection	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/12/2008 2:17:40 PM	Biaxin XL is the most effective med for my sinus/respiratory infections. I have used it about half a dozen times over the course of the past four years. It does produce a bad taste in the mouth, but I've found that citrus cuts the nastiness quite well. I once was given the generic version with negative effect, so I always remind my doc to prescribe the real thing (the higher cost is well worth it for me since the generic was essentially pointless in disappearing my infection and had more side effects).
Acute Maxillary Sinus M. Catarrhalis Bacteria Infection	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	12/2/2008 11:34:41 AM	If I take the pill with a full meal I do not experience any nausea. The heart racing is making it hard to sleep (no coffee or sudafed for me until this is done) and I woke up with red marks/bruises on my forehead right where I was applying pressure to relieve my sinus headache. But all in all, I can tell my sinus infection is getting better right away. The side effects are not enough for me to quit taking it.  I cannot take penicillin or sulfa drugs (and had serious tendonitis from Levaquin) so I am willing to put up with side effects to get rid of this sinus infection. 
Pneumonia caused by Bacteria	FH, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/17/2008 11:20:20 PM	I had pneumonia and started feeling better by the 2nd day I started my medication.  I was taking Biaxin XL Filmtab extended release.  I was very happy with the medicine.  No side effects compared to the hurting I had in my chest.

Influenzae Bacteria Infection	Chris, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	10/15/2008 10:11:14 PM	This medicine is worse than the infection. I took the med at 7:00 PM and woke up around 1:00 AM with nausea and big time cramps. I had no idea what the cramps were from, so I went to the emergency room, and when the doctor found out I was on Biaxin she sent me home. Apparently, this is normal with this stuff... 
Pneumonia caused by Bacteria	hopefull, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/1/2008 6:10:23 PM	She is left hospitalized with psycosis. The possible side effects mention Possible change in mental/mood. This should be a waring in bold type. She could have delt with a bad taste in her mouth. She has been in the hospital for 5 days now. She is not the same. We hope she will be of sound mind again. If you dont know what psycosis is please read up on in before taking this medicine. Its just a possible side effect until it happens to someone you love. Then its more. Then you want to tell everyone to stay away from it... please do reasearch before you take this med.

I too have had painful cramping and diarrhea since starting this medication 4 days ago. I'm nervous about how much worse this might get before it gets better.I am on the generic rx and am wondering if I should have asked for the brand name rx.

It left me with a sore tongue and bad taste in my mouth. It also ruined my sense of smell. All I could smell 24-7 was like vinegar boiling and a little bit of rancid bacon thrown in.

BUT!!!! If your drug store gives you the generic version, you might get the negative side effects discribed by others here.I have been given the generic twice, without being told, and felt like my stomach was being ripped up, both times, and within an hour of taking it, felt as if I had gotten the flu.I have taken Biaxin XL, NOT the generic version, dozens of times for chronic sinus infection, and respitory ailments, and while I still always take it with food, I have never had anything close to the negatives side effects descibed by others here.Maybe it's me, or maybe the other people who left negative reviews got the generic.If they did get the generic, I feel bad for them, because they may have missed out on something that has helped me greatly.Here's how I tell the difference.Biaxin XL is light yellow, and is labeled &quot;Biaxin XL&quot;, the generic versions I got were white, or light brown, and were labeled &quot;Clarithromycin&quot;.The non-generic is expensive.(my insurance doesn't even cover it at all)But it doesn't matter how cheap the generic is if it makes you feel worse than you did before you took it.I hope this helps, both new comers, or anyone who got the generic.
