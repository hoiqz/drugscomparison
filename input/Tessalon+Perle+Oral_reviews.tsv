Cough	grandmar, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	10/1/2012 12:04:54 PM	This medication did not help at all.  My pharmacist said it helps some people and others it doesn't help at all.  My cough was controlled by something the pharmacist gave me that was OTC but behind the counter.
Cough	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	7/21/2012 11:32:48 PM	I had pneumonia with a terrible cough. Every time I fell asleep the coughing would wake me up. This stopped the coughing and wheeziness. Great medication. But, I have a great doctor also. She is the best.

My cough was a dry cough. I saw results in 2 days. I completely stopped coughing after about 4-5 days. Wonderful experience with this medication. Would definitely recommend it to someone with what I had. 
Cough	m0lleybr0wn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/24/2011 1:10:28 AM	I hace COPD along with one bad lung.

Cough	BamaBronchial, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	11/9/2010 2:56:39 PM	Had been aggravated for 3-4 weeks with leftover cough from bronchitis.  Lortab elixir worked v. good.  OTC cough relief medications (eg-theraflu, cough syrups, etc) were only marginally effective and were absolutely vile to take orally.  Went back to Lortab elixir, worked v. good.  Then back to OTC, not great and just plain nasty.  Dr. then prescribed Tessalon as cough was still persisting.  May as well have prescribed sugar pills.  I believe I could have likely taken the whole dang bottle without any ill effects.  Waste of money.  Lortab elixir was less $$ and far more effective.  I'll never let him prescribe this crap for me again.  May work for you, but did absolutely nothing but take my money.  Total waste.
Cough	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	45-54	9/26/2010 5:54:59 PM	Medication did not effectively treat cough. May have caused mild bronchospasm causing increased coughing epidoses.
Cough	RandiZ, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	8/4/2010 12:08:04 AM	I had a persistent cough which was getting worse in severity and the number of coughing fits.  After 2 weeks during which antibiotics and cough syrup with codine didn't help, my dr. prescribed tessalon bedes.  It really helped supress the cough to the point that I could work during the day.  It turned out that I had whooping cough which is starting to clear up four weeks later.  The only warning I would give is that I had some insanely strange dreams, and i normally don't dream at all.

Cough	Ari's Mom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	1/17/2010 10:29:00 AM	It definitely stopped the cough but taking it at night caused me to sleep like the dead and wake up feeling dizzy and queezy.  I also had terrifying nightmares and even a feeling of  smothered. I also had taken Claritin so maybe the two caused the side effects. I did read that it's not to be taken with an antihistamine, I wish I'd been more careful and not self-medicated the additional Claritin.  I should have checked with the pharmicist first.  I've only taken two doses and I think I'll go back to the cough syrup.  I am going to call the pharmacist...a little proactive too late!  Shame on me.

It was about $15.00 for 30.

Since I would not be 65 until 2009, I had to discontinue due to no insurance.  Now my Medicare provider will not approve this Rx.  Does anyone know of another similar drug.  I cannot take otc meds due to reactions to the ingredient used to stop cough.  Please can anyone make a suggestion.

My 19yr. old Grandaughter recently went to the emergecy room with what turned out to be an Upper Respiratory Infection.  While there she was given Tessalon Perle by one of the nurses and told to let it dissolve on her tongue.  After she did this, she complained that her tongue was numb and her throat felt numb too.  Fortunately the numbness went away quickly but we have since found out for several pharmacist and from WebMD that this medication is ONLY to be SWALLEWED and never dissolved in the mouth!  Be very careful folks about what you are given in the ER.

Cough	paneltroll, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/14/2009 11:21:25 PM	I have used this drug 3 times in many years.  The first time I had a cough so bad that I had to go to the ER for treatment and they only gave me cough syrup.  I went to a reg. Dr. the next day and he gave me this med. and I was so relieved and it finally calmed my cough.  The second time I used this for the same cough and it didn't seem to work, only an antibiotic would help me this time.  This last time I thought yeah I would try them again because I had not slept in a week and my sides and back hurt so bad just from coughing, and it worked like a miracle this time.  I don't think the symptoms were different in any of these cases but maybe they were.
Cough	englteach,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		1/2/2009 8:25:40 PM	After three weeks of horrible hacking cough, during which I could barely breathe or sleep, I was diagnosed with whooping cough and was given this to treat the cough that was not being helped by the codine cough syrup.  These calmed the cough and allowed me to sleep for the first time in three weeks.  Now, because of a bad persistant cough, I never want to be without my Perles.

I missed no days of work. But he switched to this med. Like other physicians he seems afraid to use what was working for fear of addiction. Now I hack all day even when I take the med which has me jittery and weird.

The only thing I ever found to really help me is the Hycodan Compound cough syrup.The problem with this is the FDA is overeacting to celebraties that are using this with other illegal drugs and killing themselves...so the rest of us have to suffer. I have also tried the inhalers...but they are ineffective too....Any one else have any suggestions?PS I have never in my life done ANY illegal drugs of been addicted to medications. If I have wanted to kill myself, I would have done it a long time ago!
Cough	iqeverything, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/18/2007 7:01:57 AM	I get frequent upper respiratory infections and when my coughing interupts my sleep this is the only medicine that is effective at stopping the cough and allows me to rest.  It starts working in like 15 minutes and allows for a cough-free night.  I would suggest taking it during the day for the first time so you know how you will react to it.  You MUST take it with at least one full glass of water or you will wake up with an extremely dry throat and nasal passage.  It really does work extremely well.
