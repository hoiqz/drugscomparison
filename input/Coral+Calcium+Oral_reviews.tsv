After a couple of days taking it the pain went away and I could'nt belief it. It DOES work for me.

Coral Pure Calcium seemed to help BUT I also use an insulin pump for treatment of Type 1 diabetes.  My bg's ran out of control within two weeks. Had to stop using the suppliment. Diabetics, be careful using this product.

After using Coral Calcium, my nerve system regenerated which resulted in better blood flow. The benefits of this goes beyond regeneration. I take it now to boost my immune system. I listened to the hype on TV, like most other infomercials, but decided to give this one a try, and I am glad I did.
Other	Nataly,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		9/30/2009 3:46:07 AM	I have been struggling badly with fibromyalgia. More than 3 months i had whole body pain. I spent a lot of money on therapy and prescribed quite expensive drug used for epilepsy treatment. I felt like my whole body is poisoned. Also i did exercise and drunk plenty of water. But my condition was not improved much.My friends doctors gave me to try Coral Calcium in the sachets and advise to put it in my amount drinking water - 2 liters a day. Plus alkaline diet.My condition was improved in 3 days! I was not able to just even sit for few minutes, and after 3 days i was taking a track to the mountain for whole day. I had Coral Water for one month, now the packet is over and it's not available in my country. The pain is slowly getting back... I want to share my experience with some doctors, who think that Coral Calcium unlikely works. Compare to my expenses and time took for the  treatment in the clinic, Coral is win.

I worked for 8 years with the pain, then in a book I read it suggested Coral Calcium for some back pain. Within 3 days the pain went away. I stopped taking and the pain came back. Started taking again and the pain went away. I took for several years faithfully then stopped. No pain for several months. Pain came back, so I started again and overnite the pain is gone again. I have recomended too others, some got the same relief I got, others no affect at all. Try it, you will know with in2 weeks if it is for you.

My knees don't ache like they used to and I've been generally more energetic.
