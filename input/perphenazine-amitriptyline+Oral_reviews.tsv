You will GAIN A SHIT LOAD OF WEIGHT if you use this. This would be great for eating disorders but it did not help me otherwise. From what I have been told, older doctors who hate their patients prescribe this crap because its $50+ generic whereas the more effective pure Amitrip generic is $8! Would not advise taking.

He did not tell me two things...one, it contains an anti-psychotic and two, it would cause me to gain a ton of weight.  I've been weening myself off of it, faster than I probably should, but it does little for the fibro pain and helps with the sleep problem very little.  He was miffed when I said I was going off of it...too bad.  I was on two pills a day..once in the morning and then 12 hours later.  In the last 3 weeks I've taken only 4 which is great because my super blurry vision has greatly subsided, plus I'm starting to drop some weight and I actually feel better than I did when I was taking this poison.  I also discovered there are a lot of medications that you cannot take while being on this because of severe and possibly fatal effects of the drug interactions.  I think doctors owe it to their patients to tell them EVERYTHING about a drug BEFORE throwing a prescription at them...had I known this stuff beforehand, I NEVER would have taken it.

Now taking again with Serequel for major panic disorder. Not working like it did before with the calming effect. It just helps keep the panic attacks to be not so frequent, but does not seem to help with their severity.

She only takes it at night because it makes her so sleepy at first. She goes on and on it. It is an old medicice that has been around for years.
Other	55-64 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	1	1	1		55-64	9/28/2010 10:11:14 PM	I was prescribed this medication under the brand name Trilafon as a teenager in 1970 by a psychiatrist who had never met me, on the basis of one meeting he had with my parents, who were concerned that I was smoking pot and having sex.  The dosage far exceeded what is currently typical for someone suffering from psychosis, which I was not. After about 3 weeks, my vision became so blurred I could not read, and my breasts began producing milk even though I had never been pregnant and was barely sexually active.  Essentially, I was given a temporary chemical lobotomy--I had no emotional affect whatsoever, and my cognitive capacity was significantly reduced. I finally met the prescribing doctor about a week AFTER he had my parents admit me to the psychiatric ward of a hospital. The psychiatrist who did this was on staff at a State Hospital in NYS as a director of pharmacological research and as a clinical psychiatrist at a private Catholic Hospital in Utica NY.  I believe he abused his authority, which resulted in great harm to me and many of his other patients.  He was a Cuban born doctor who had worked for a Cuban government agency and came to the U.S. near the end of WW II, according to a biography I found last year in a psychiatric journal from the 1950s. This was a classic case of bad science and bad medicine.  For me, this medication was poison, and I am lucky I survived this trauma.

It also helped during times of mental stress. I don't esp. care for the drozziness I experience while at work but have not found anything that compares with it for the headaches.
