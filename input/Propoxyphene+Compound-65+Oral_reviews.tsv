Pain	LeeB, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	45-54	11/19/2010 1:03:51 PM	While this prescription has been able to reduce or eliminate my pain, it has also caused something that feels like heart palpitations or flutter. I have felt faint, panicky at times, and seriously out of breath. I became so used to taking it for my constant pain that I tolerated the heart flutter and sleeplessness just to get the pain relief. Then I realized that I was taking it even when there was no pain. Quit taking it and waited for the spinal shots again. Lee

I think people miss understand pain management and it's difrent difficulties.  I think you have to understand that a Narcotic Pain Reliver is maybe better at treating the nerve part of pain but like any med is limmited to what it can do alone.  Like Muscle Spasms are more efectively managed by Muscle Relaxers and Pain associated with Inflamation is better treated with anti-inflamitories.  I suffer mostly from the first two and am so sensitive to Tylonol and I.B.profen that this low tylenol pain reliever is a much better option in keeping, as they say, &quot;the cure better than the desease&quot;.  Where as Vicoden has 500mg Tylonol in it and is not an option for my sensitive stomach and I.B.S.  This leaves me only wishing I had something for inflamation that did'nt make me sick to take it orally.  However, while the Steroid Spinal Injections are becomeing the more accepted practice for treating many of these problems.  I see it quickly becoming it's own problem as many Doctors are turning to it to treat patients with Cronic Pain as though it's a &quot;cure all&quot;.  I can see this already being over used with no real regard for possible long time residual efects.  One of my major concerns being scar tissue build up.

The pain has somewhat subsided . However, it's in no way a miracle worker, that's for sure. I have to take other medication on top of it because alone it's practically nonexistent.
Pain	Lynze, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	1/13/2009 10:00:08 AM	I have a shoulder injury that radiates down to the wrist, and I can not sleep at night because of the pain.  This medication does not do a good job of eliminating the pain.   The pain is not as sever but is still there and not allowing for a pain free nights sleep, therefore I wake often because of the pain.
