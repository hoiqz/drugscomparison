Mestinon 60mg 4x/day had immediate and positive results.  In April 2012,  experienced double vision for the first time.  Dosage was increase to 6x daily, which stopped the double vision, but began to experience severe diarrhea attacks, that came on suddenly.  This stopped temporarily with immodium AD.  However, the attacks are sudden and daily. More frequent urination Have tried yogurt recently and will see if this helps.  Some muscle cramping that is severe at night, but goes away.  Double vision happens sometimes, at night and while under stress of any kind.  Overall, pleased with the drug...it works.  If double vision increases  may go to an wearing an eye patch from time-to-time.

Saw neurologist who diagnosed IIa and began Mestinon with good response.   No serious side-effects.  Salivation is annoying when lecturing or teaching but not disabling.  A handkerchief is now part of my daily wardrobe.  Muscle fasciculations are frequent but not painful.  One episode of mild muscle cramping.  Had only one bout of diarrhea which may have been exacerbated by diet while traveling in Southeast Asia.  One question is that I seem to have nightmares if I take a dose late in the evening while working at my desk.  No problem with alcohol though I limit intake to two drinks, usually beer, in any twenty-four hour period once or twice weekly.  On weekends during which I am planning to do nothing I may take fewer doses without ill effect.  A recent planned weight loss of 25 pounds helped strength and endurance quite a bit.

Myasthenia Gravis		4	4	4			10/4/2011 4:26:58 PM	Although it doesn't get this person back to the energy before MG, it's been very helpful.  A lot of weakness, hoarseness, etc. continues but less of these symptoms than without the medicine.  Diarrhea decreased after having taken the medication for a few months.

Since I have IBS, the drug has triggered really bad gastro problems. So, even if it worked for eyelid pstosis, I can't leave the house.

Optical only according to my Dr, but I have some doubts. I started Mestinon in 1994. but discontinued use due excessive diarrhea and gas. I have been taking Cellept ever since taking a high dosage of 1980 mg per day. In Jan 2010 my Dr prescribed Mestinon again at 60 mg 3x day. Problems the second time around is still excessive diarrhea, gas and severe cramps in the right hand, both legs and insteps on both feet. I will be discussing this medicine with my Dr in Aug 2010. Just a little about double vision.  My corrective action with the double vision was contact paper covering my poorest eye glasses lens,l which was my right eye. After using this method for a couple of years I requested th VA to frost my right lens of my glasses. I been using this method for about 10-12 years and it is very effective and lot better than the black patch.
Other	kitcat,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female		6/3/2010 11:12:54 PM	After having a tumor removed from my throat, I woke up with an eye lid that would not work. Finally my neurologist, three months later--just before my surgeon was ready to send me to have eye surgery, tried this drug. I've only been taking it for two months but within the first week it had made a hudge difference in my eye. I've lost almost 8 pounds and I do mean the way no one wants to lose weight.  The stomach cramps are tremendous and loud. And did I mention often? Sometimes I can eat but most of the time I have no taste for food.  If I didn't have a family this might would work easier. I have the fatigue, runny nose or should I say suprise! If you get your hands full, you better have a tissue really close...there is no warning, just a sudden drip. Each day I think this is the last day I can do this but I try one more day. The dizzy feeling and vision problems make me wonder if it's worth it. But if I stop, I might not know the answer. I take 60 mg 3 times a day.

Had every test in the world for MG some positive some not.  I took mestinon 3 years ago with little improvement.  We decided to do eye surgery instead and now I am right back where I started.  Started mestinon again, eyes are a little better but not sure if the side effects are worth it.  MUSCLE WEAKNESS &amp; CRAMPS, FATIGUE.  DO U HURT AND SEE BETTER OR NOT TAKE IT AND DEAL WITH THE VISION PROBLEMS?

I have Class I, where it's just the eyes, and I have had it for 21 years. The drug was first prescribed recently, after an airtight diagnosis (finally!) ... It works. The side effects are mostly gastric, but tolderable. However, I should point out that I only take 30mg three times a day. So far, so good!Walking seems easier, too.

Dr. checked for MG and results were Pos. Have been on Mestinon about 6-8 mos.  Dr. said only problems of MG should be weakness in large muscles, facial problems and lung probs.  I have been having severe diarrheal, stomach cramps, very tired, pains in legs, etc.  I am so glad I found this site because I have other problems so now I can isolate some of them to this drug.

The first day I took this wonderdrug my nystagmus disappeared and by day two so did the diplopia and ptosis.  I have only been on it for two weeks so I'm sure it will take time for my diaphragm and limb muscles to regain their size and strength.  The only complaint I have is that I have to divide my pills and they crumble on the ends when I do so.  I'm on the generic form and the score on the pills is not very deep.  Also when I stored it with my other medication (in a weekly pill divider) the exterior of the pills turned to pasted and they crumbled when I picked them up.  Thankfully I didn't lose too many before I noticed.  All in all I am very thankful to have Mestinon available for this very troublesome and at times downright scary condition.

I was taking 60 Mg every 4 hours but is was causing too much twitching in the eyes. So my doctor and I reduced the dosage to 30Mg and everything has been stable.  Over the last few weeks I was having issue with my jaw and tongue so I up the dosage to take care of it.  It has caused my stomach to go a little crazy but I am reducing the dosage back to 30 Mg because of that.  My MG symptoms are mostly on my right side. I do get cramps in my right foot and right hand often but hey I can still breath and swallow.  Something I was having problems doing before my surgery.  I think if you self manage the dosage amount that best fits your situation you can minimize most of the side affects.  My doctor told me that if you take too much it can cause the same side affects of not taking any at all.  More is not always better.  Any questions just ask.

Went into remission few months later (6yrs remission!)and stopped all treatment. Symtoms resurfaced 2007 tried mestinon but cramps were so bad had to stop and symptoms did not worsen till 1&amp;1/2 yrs later July 2009. Back on Mestinon and it's working great! I can walk,I breathe normally,my eyelids manage to stay open, I have normal energy, for me that is! I am taking 90 mg 3 times/day &amp; timespan 180mg at night. The severe stomach cramps seem to occur in the early morning hours, I twitch alot(legs,arms and head), I have bad diahrea but I am back at work so I guess all is good! There are worse things than Myasthenia in life. I choose to look on the bright side.

I went into remission for 2.5 years only taking 7.5mg of prednisone, then I quit taking it and all MG symptoms returned April 2008.  I had a good run.. since then, they have not been able to get MG under control again.  I tried mestinon again, and it made me feel worse and I had double vision.  A year later, I'm trying it again out of desperation to see if it helps again.  If anyone wants to email w/me re: MG I would love to hear from you. ljames0195@cox.net

It is very stressful on our family since we have never heard of this disorder before. When she first started taking mestinon (liquid) we saw slight improvemnet but we just thought she was getting better on her own so we decided to take her off of it and it was definetly the wrong choice. She woke up with her eye completely shut! As soon as we started it up again she got better but not healed. She has been able to get better control of her eye movements but her eyelid continues to close and she must wear an eye patch. Not to long ago we switched over to the tablet form. I think the liquid might have been better but, I dont know anymore. Just want it to go away.

If taken on an empty stomach, it can lead to stomach cramps, etc.! (To those experiencing this: ask your MDs! It's right there in the med. literature!)  Mestinon gives me energy...but also MUCH MUCUS! (Ulgh!) This is due to the BROMIDE in it! They once had Mestinon CHLORIDE available--I took it, less mucus! But they discontinued it! So, I take 1 tablet of mestinon a day, and 6 of MYTELASE -- WHICH IS A CHLORIDE-BASED DRUG! Not many people take it...but I think MYTELASE is better than Mestinon, because of all that mucus!Also, I've recently heard that MESTINON can lead to Gulf War Syndrome!  There is NOT total agreement on this...but even a rumour of it gives me pause.  Myasthenia Gravis is hard enough to live with....I sure don't need anything else, especially as a side-effect from an MG drug!TO REPEAT....PLEASE BE SURE TO TAKE MESTINON, MYTELASE, AND ALL OTHER DRUGS THAT CALL FOR IT....W I T H...F O O D, AND NOT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH!  Stomach-aches from this drug, etc. will be eliminated this way!  As a childhood-onset myasthenic, I've taken Mestinon for over 50 years, so I should know!  Also -- to make the drug work faster &amp; better -- take with at least 20 swallows of water or other liquid, (more if possible). They can be 20 or more sips...not a lot...but the more sips, the better the drug dissolves in the bloodstream!  Be sure to also take some solid food with the drug, if your stomach is empty when taking it.Hope this helps!  Hope, too, that Mestinon CHLORIDE makes a comeback, and that MYTELASE may be looked on more favourably by the medical establishment.
