Did not help the tooth, had to have it pulled. That was last Dec (2011). Now 9-10 months later still have stomach/bowel problems. Was tested for C. Diff (negitive). Have to watch my diet. Several foods will result in loose stools. I eat yogurt every day and am taking probiotics to try and get my system back to normal. I agree with eveyone, this drug should be taken of the market. No Doctor will ever prescribe this medicine to me again or to any of my family members.

Then 3 days into it I started having sharp pains in my shoulder blades and around my neck. I am only 34 years old and I ended up going to the ER to get this checked out. My ER Dr. was amazed that I was put on this because of the harmful side effects. Needless to say he told me to stop taking it. I haven't taken it in over 24 hours and I still have the sharp pain like someone is standing on my chest. Painful to move. I will NEVER take this again.

This drug was effective and I have not had any recurrent problems or infections. It's annoying to take 4x day and you have to sit up for 15 minutes after each pill. Also, make sure you don't take on an empty stomach, do eat lots of yogurt/probiotics to avoid the Cdiff. Also made my skin look amazing.

Dosage: 1 pill every 6 hours until pills are gone.  During the last 2 days, I had an allergic reaction to the pill.  I immediately stopped taking the antiobiotic the first instance noticing a rash on my upper legs.  I have seen a rash similar to this when I used to take Penicillin before finding out I was allergic to it.  The rash spread all over the front of my thighs, down the front, sides of my legs, all over my arms and starting to appear on my torso within 1 (24 hr) period.  So, I am taking Benadryl at night, a hydrocortizon to relieve the desire to scratch (even though it's not severly itchy).  I am off to the doctor today to be seen for something else but will discuss my rash in further detail to see if I can be prescribed a stronger antihistamine to rid of the ugly rash marks sooner to prevent scarring.

I usually eat a meal and then drink a yogurt before taking that with two full glasses of water. I don't know if that's what's helped me, but if its any help I would take it as I've described! I also tend to drink chamomile tea with honey...

I followed instructions, taking with food and plenty of water. First day, took as directed 2/pills at 1pm, then normal course 1/pill every 6/hours until gone. First evening I had hard time sleeping due to racing heart, feeling tight inside and cold all over. Continued on medication next day as directed 1/tablet every 6 hours. I have been nothing but agitated, shakey, irritable, eyes dialated, moody, body cold, racing heart, needless to say just not feeling right. I called the pharmacist who asked me if i had flu/cold or anything else going on right now, NO, I said. Pharmacist said what I was describing was not one of the side effects he was aware of and that I should stop taking and call my dentist. I stopped medication, called dentist and will start new antibiotic. Have found that dentists prefer infection gone prior to doing root canal, as the infection can interfere with numbing agent. I did not know that. Hope this helps someone.

Other	Fred, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	1/9/2012 1:50:01 PM	I was given the drug because I had an abscessed tooth. My physician helped me figure out how to manage taking the Clindamycin 3 times a day for 10 days with my past history of reactive gastritis and GERD.  Once I followed his recommendations (daily probiotics, using H-2 blocker at night along with my Dexilant, yogurt with each course of the medicine and plenty of fluid), I have not had any diarrhea or severe heartburn.  I have finished my course of treatment without noted drug side effects.

Other	User, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	19-24	12/20/2011 2:46:57 AM	I just had wisdom tooth surgery and my oral surgeon prescribed me Clindamycin 300mg capsules, 3x per day.  So far so good, although I have been experiencing some nausea and diarrhea (BE CAUTIOUS: this can be a sign of c-diff &amp; is VERY SERIOUS).  Many people have said they are experiencing heartburn when they take the pill; I have found that if I take the pill with 8-14oz of water, and restrict my movement (sit in one place for at least 7-10minutes), I completely avoid the heartburn.  Hope this helps. Good luck to all.

Abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea. I have a ten day dose (on day seven now). As the days go on the side effects get worse and effect your energy. I called my dr and complained of the issues I was having with the drug. He told me to ask my pharmacist for a probiotic. Sold OTC, the pharmacist tod me to take Acidopholis. Within two days, the Acidopholis has countered my side effects and now I can take clindamycin with no problem.

Skin Infection	Cinderella96, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	35-44	10/27/2011 8:45:31 AM	I was misdiagnosed with MRSA 5 months ago and prescribed this drug.  Thanks to other reviews, I was very proactive in preventing further problems from it.  It is definitely a strong drug and I could see the effects on my digestive system during as well as several weeks AFTER I was done with it.  I made sure to take a good probiotic pill from the health food store as well as ate natural probiotic foods such as real yogurt, keifer, pickles and real miso soup (from a paste at the health food store dissolved into boiling water).  Several weeks after I relaxed being so vigilant, I had one scarey and horrible day with severe abdominal cramping and running to the bathroom every 30 minutes with &quot;snotty&quot; poo which others described too. I believe I was on the brink of CDif and ate several bowls of yogurt that day and the next and the problem  went away quickly.  I am unfortunately allergic to penecillans and sulfa drugs so seem to be stuck with this harsh drug as my antibiotic but I have no other side affects other than it wreaking havoc on my digestive system.  I am on it a second time this year for  a dental treatment and am again, being very proactive about preventing the very serious conditions that it can produce when it kills ALL the bacteria (good included) in the body.  I am disappointed with the FDA for not putting on the info sheet some instructions that seem vital to surviving this drug, with how to replace the good bacteria in the digestive system .  I hope that this review will help anyone taking it to protect your health and not succumb to a snowball of antibiotics easily prevented with some careful but simple diet adjustment.

Other	tbrostrom, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	2	Male	35-44	10/21/2011 4:31:48 PM	I posted a review for this antibiotic back in Aug 2011 describing what I did to while taking. I was perscribed by my dentist for an abcessed tooth (2x150mg 4 times a day). Had no problems while taking and it did clear up the infection. I am a perfectly healthy male infact haven't been to a doctor or ER in 20 years. About 4 weeks after finishing I developed a bad case of diarrhea that I have had multiple times daily for 6 weeks, with stomach discomfort, and have lost weight. To say that my life has been miserable for last six weeks would be an understatement especially since I drive truck for a living!! Yesterday I was informed that I tested positive for c-diff. This antibiotic caused my c-diff!! I am not allergic to any medication and my doctor couldn't figure out why I was perscribed this. My recommendation...DO NOT TAKE THIS ANTIBIOTIC!!! What I have been living with the last 6 weeks I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

Other	tbrostrom, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	35-44	8/26/2011 11:27:04 AM	I just recently completed taking a full 7 day perscription and have been done for 4 days. I was perscribed clindamycin for a severely abcessed tooth and half my face was swelled. I was taking 2 x 150 mg 4 times a day. Based on what the pharmicist said and the reviews on here I was terrified of taking this drug, so here is what I did to help limit the side effects with great success so far. 1) I made sure to always eat some food with-in an hour of taking. 2)Prior to each dose I ate 4 oz of Yoplait yogurt - make sure it contains &quot;Live Active Cultures&quot; 3) I drank a full 16 oz bottle of water with each dose and plenty of water throughout the day. 4) I made sure not to lay down for 30 mins after taking 4) I made sure to take at 6 hr intervals. The only issue I had was one time about 10 minutes after taking I did get a pretty good case of heartburn that lasted about an hour but that was it. I strongly recommend to not drink any alcohol while on this antibiotic!! As with any antibiotic I am going to continue eating yogurt on a daily basis to help rebuild the probiotics in my body. Also I'm not a medical professional, but I would never take an antibiotic as a &quot;precaution&quot; against infection because if there is no infection to kill then all there is for the medicine to attack is the good bacteria in you. This antibiotic worked for me and I hope this helps others because I was in a tremendous amount of pain and it worked to clear up the infection!!
Other	Myndi M., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	8/19/2011 9:37:20 PM	I was given clindamycin for an abcessed tooth. My jaw was swollen, cuz I was hit in the area of the tooth. I took 13 pills &amp; stop taking it. The side effects were worse then the toothache. I had diaherra so badly that I couldn't even hardly sleep. I also got burning in the throat that no heartburn meds would work. Headaches. Body aches. After being off of it for 2 wks I found out that I have a yeast infection. U r not allowed to take anything for your diaherra either. But I will say the only thing that I got out of it was that it did break the infection thru the gum, which was gross, but it was better then it staying in there. I wouldn't suggested taking this medicine if u have another option. I am allergic to Pencillin. I did find eating Yogurt to help alot with the diaherra &amp; the burning in the throat. So if u have to take it, stock up on the yogurt!!!

Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	5/16/2011 11:32:26 PM	I take the topical version of this. After reading all these horror show reviews of the oral, I had to share what happened to me a few weeks ago. I had a very similar experience w/the SEVERE Cramping, diarrhea, no appetite, total lethargy &amp; major body shakes. It started out suddenly w/a bad headache (rarely get them), that turned to migrane status. A few hours later, I couldn't leave the bathroom longer than 5 to 10 minutes. I didn't eat for nearly 3 days at all, b/c everything just shot thru me &amp; I had NO desire to eat. I forced fluids to keep hydrated. My doc was on vacation &amp; the walk in clinic was too far to drive to. I couldn't drive anyway! I'm not the type to ask for help &amp; have a high pain/illness tolerance, so only asked a good friend to get me Immodium, Pepto Bismuth, Tums, bananas, rice... All the Tums, Pepto &amp; Immodium, didn't help at all! I had never experienced anything like this, ever! I lost 10 lbs. in a week &amp; was still sick for several days later. I didn't go to the ER, b/c I didn't want to crap all over the ambulance, or any other car I'd be in. After about 12 days, I was able to eat something more than bland &amp; weeks later now, I'm still not 'right'.  Still light headed &amp; weak. I can't imagine the topical doing this!  BUT, I have been on it for a good year now &amp; I guess anythings possible. When I see my doc, I'm going to ask her if it is possible. I stopped it while I was so ill, as I had all I could do to just breathe! I'm using it again now, but as I said, I haven't been 'right' since that horrid bout of 'whatever'! It just sounds like so many others here w/the oral version.I looked at the topical &amp; from the ones I read, no one mentioned anything like what I experienced, but would they connect the 2?  Maybe I should post there, to see if anyone using the topical has had any experiences like me &amp; others on here.  SCARY!  FDA # 1-800-332-1088.  USE IT!  This should NOT be on the market! At least not the pill!
Other	StevieT, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	65-74	5/16/2011 4:16:36 PM	The dentist prescribed it as a pre-treatment for an abscess in my gum which would also require a root canal. I took 500mg three times a day for 10 days.  The side effects were heartburn which I eliminated by taking it with milk, and more than normal bowel movements accompanied by anal itching which I treated with Preparation H.  I also ate yogart every day which seemed to help, and otherwise it was tolerable.  The symptoms lasted for over a week after I stopped taking the medication.  I started my dental treatment last week and am now taking Amoxicllin which has no bad effects so far. I was not in any pain before or after taking either of the medications.

PLEASE don't take this drug. I was prescribed 500 mg Clindamycin to prevent an infection after getting wisdom teeth removed. I felt so horrible and groggy after the surgery, I didn't even research the drug before I took it (which I usually always do). I only took it for 4 days and from the 1st dose, it gave my terrible nausea and diarrhea. And sparing the details, the diarrhea was BAD. I called and the Dr told me to stop taking it, but by then it had already changed my life. The pain and diarrhea lasted for weeks, and my primary finally believed it wasn't just &quot;antibiotic diarrhea&quot; and did a stool sample. Positive for c-diff. I went on 2 rounds of Flagyl but the symptoms continued. Many months, bathroom breaks, and tears later, I was finally diagnosed with Crohns Disease. They say the c-diff doesn't cause it and I must have already had it, but I was completely healthy and normal before the surgery. The c-diff &quot;activated&quot; the Crohns, which I'll now be suffering with for my whole life. I always think about how many more healthy, happy days I would have had left if I hadn't taken the Clindamycin. So, this may not have &quot;caused&quot; my Crohns but it definitely caused the c-diff and many months of pain and suffering. By the way, I'm only 25. It's not worth the risk, please take another antibiotic.

I was prescribed this antibiotic for a tooth infection because I cannot take amoxicillin.  I followed the directions given by my dentist and pharmacist.  Take with 8 oz water, do not lie down for at least ten mins (I did 30 mins, not just 10) and from my dentist - Take with yogurt or a probiotic.  I took 150 mg, two the first dose and then one every 6 hrs for about 8 days.  By the 2nd day my excruciating pain had subsided and swelling had gone down. (I did not take any pain meds) I did not experience any unpleasant side effects other than a weird taste in my mouth and food tasted a little funny occasionally.  I think the key is taking with yogurt. I ate the greek yogurt with 5-6 different live strains of the good bacteria, twice a day (I like Chobani).  I have been off the medicine a little over a week and so far so good.  I do still eat the yogurt daily as I've read that this medicine can stay in your system for a while.

Everytime I go off the vancomycin, I get the symptoms of C-DIFF, cramping in stomach, horrible diarrhea, no appetite, tired &amp; achy all the time. Clyndomycin DESTROYS THE GOOD BACTERIA in the colon and SETS YOU UP FOR C-DIFF which is contagious and can be picked up by a simple handshake, on any surface but particularly in hospitals, public restrooms, door knobs, even the stethoscope in a doctor's office. Because clyndomycin strips the colon of good bacteria, there is nothing there to fight infections.  THE FDA SHOULD TAKE THIS DRUG OFF THE MARKET...PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT UNLESS YOU WANT THE POSSIBILITY OF BECOMING VERY SICK.  BY THE WAY, C-DIFF CAN BE FATAL...

Not much probelm taking this until right at the end of the cycle.  I did notice it made me go to the bathroom more, like 3 to 4 times a day, not diarrhea just had to go more. That being said I did experience sick headaches once or twice while taking this and some of the worst heartburn I have ever had...today is my last day of the cycle and I am really hoping to find some relief from this heartburn soon. Sometimes I think the side effects are worse than the alternative. Not sure if I will take the last 2 pills today or not, contemplating if the heartburn is worth it.

I started noticing stomach cramps the next day.  What was worse was that i started feeling dizzy while i was driving. Now i can add diarrah to the list. I didnt really connect it to the drug until last night when i decided to look up the side effects.  This stuff is harsh.I called the pharmacyst that prepared it for me and explained all of this.  He told me that i should take it with food and replace fluids often.  If it is still causing me issues tomorrow then i should contact my denist.  My dentist isnt open tomorrow so im not sure what im going to do.  So far im not going to recommend this.

I had huge problems taking enough air into my lungs.After stopping this drug, in about 4 more days the hives went away. Also, drug caused burning diarrhea for almost 2 weeks.The back surface of my tongue got black areas. Also caused severe stomach upset and nausea. My urine began smelling very acidiy and after 4 weeks off this drug, is still smelly. After all this, I still had the infected tooth.

I ended up in the hospital for a week and missed 3 months of work. My health will never be the same nor will I. This drug and the Dr. that prescibed it ruined my life. This drug should be taken off of the market and doctors should use more caution with prescribing such a dangerous drug. I hope there will be a class action lawsuit against this drug someday.

My dentist, who I have gone to for years, prescribed Clindamycin HCL (300 MG, 1 time daily for 28 days). After two weeks, I experienced stomach discomfort (which gradually became severe stomach pain),gas and burping.I never had this problem prior to taking this drug. I did not connect the pain to the drug nor did I bother to read any reviews re: this drug.I finally went to my family doctor who after examining me ordered an Endoscopic. Results showed severe gastritus with bleeding of the stomach lining.The only difference in my daily routine was the taking of this drug. My oral discomfort did diminish slightly; nevertheless,I will never take this drug again. As a result of my experience, I will ask my prescribing physician questions re: drug side effects and I will also read about the drus on Web MD!

I have never experienced any side-effects from any of them until clindamycin. I had the most horrible stabbing pains in my upper stomach area, even while standing after taking. The pain was severe and lasted for hours. Didn't matter if I took it with food or not. I tried and tried to follow the regimen, as I know you should take the full amount prescribed, and had paid over $100 for a ten day supply with no insurance. I just can't stand the pain as it feels as if there are razor blades in my stomach. Got from an ER, but will call my regular dr. today.

I recently developed a bacterial infection in my eye lid and on top of that it became abscess. Swelled so bad that after the 3rd day my eye was completely swelleed shut. After 1 day of being on this medicine i saw and felt a dramatic positive difference. I'm kinda a baby about taking pills so talking 2 pills every 6 hours definitely took some getting used to. I also have a weak stomach towards most medication and For me this was another medicine that made me nauseous. Last but not least i also developed a yeast infection.

Other	Lilly, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	1/3/2011 10:35:30 PM	Took for almost 4 days (11 caps).  It did clear up the pain in my tooth but gave me dirrhea (4-5 times semi-watery) i did eat yogurt &amp; took strong probiotics. Next my stools had huge amts of mucus some it pink from blood. Doc said to up the probiotics which took 7 days but it went back to normal but i still will continue this for a least a good month. Next i got the vaginal yeast infection, next came the uti. i will avoid this medication in the future - i have been recovering from this med for over a month now. i also have trouble with erythromycin so i should not have let the dentist talk me into taking this. Clavamox or tetracycline from studies i've read on the web are as effective for dental infection. This med really screwed up the balance of microorganisms in my body.  Erythromycin wreaks me too.

Ate yogurt every time I took the dose, and so far after 6 days no issues.I was supposed to take 4 times a day, started at 3, went down to 2 cos it is harsh stuff if not taken right.Not always convenient to have yogurt available. Stopped today cos I  started getting some heartburn, but other than that no problems. Also, do not drink alcohol with these.  I still cannot beleive that no one who posted knew about yogurt &amp; nothing in the info. So I have officially ended taking these &amp; having a glass of wine.

I got home, looked in the mirror, and my face was swollen, hives everywhere, and itchy everywhere! I was like this for almost 3days.

The doctor at that time told me about eating yogurt while taking the pills &amp; that makes a difference. I had no side effects at all.I since developed an allergy to penicillin &amp; other antibiotics so today I was perscribed this for another issue. I was surprised that no where in the info mentioned taking yogurt with the pills. Something in the yougurt combats the intestinal side effects.  Just took my first dose so I guess have to see how it plays out this go round.
Other	Act Now, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	11/15/2010 1:56:38 PM	The doctor prescribed this for cellulitis.  After the 6th pill started having diarrea &amp; blood in stool.  Checked this website out, thank God for that, after reading others had many problems with this med, I stopped taking and reported it to my doctor, which he prescribed a different med. I am 57, rarely ever sick, not on any meds, &amp; very healthy....until taking this drug.  I was very sick for 2 1/2 months.  I lost 18lbs. too quickly due to the diarrea. Just about everything I ate went right through me. It was very difficult to go out in public because I ALWAYS needed to be close to the bathroom.  The doctor advise me to eat crackers, banannas, rice, etc.  Finally, after 3 months I am eating the healthy foods I used to enjoy on a daily basis. This drug is horrible and I am reporting it to the FDA....call 1-800-332-1088.  I hope more than myself reports this horrible drug, Maybe it will help someone else not to get so violently ill!        
Other	GladToBeAlive, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	55-64	11/12/2010 3:50:35 AM	After being prescribed this by my dentist for an gum infection, I completed the 8 day regimen without issues.  About a week afterwards, I started suffering severe diarrhea, inflamed lower bowel and alien stools that defy description.  This was more than simple diarrhea and severe in every sense of the word.  OTC solutions, including pro-biotics did nothing.  Suffering, I went to a GP and he ended up prescribing Flagyl (Metronidazole) and me leaving a stool sample.  Conditions immediately improved and the test results all came back negative.  I finished the 10 day regimen without incident and movements continued to improve, though still not normal.  About 4 days after finishing, I almost immediately went back to the original symptoms, only worse.  This all culminated in my admitting myself to the ER and spending 3 days in the hospital. I was told I had a clostridium difficile infection as a result of taking the Clindamycin.  It was expained that the Clindamycin had killed off a spectrum of bacteria in my system leaving the previously in-check CDiff bacteria free to flourish.  This bacteria will eat the lining of your colon/bowel and is potentially life threatening.  All I know is, this whole experience has resulted in 9 days off work, +$20k in hospital fees and suffering like I've never experienced before.  Please, please ask for an alternative if your health care provider ever tries to prescribe clindamycin to you.

I have benn on this drug for almost 1 1/2 months. the heartburn is horrible as well as the getting diarehia (sometimes with blood). I have also had difficultly breathing and pain when I breathe. I was sent for a chest x-ray. Now they tell me that I have a &quot;moderatly enlarged heart&quot; and am now going for an echocardiagram. This never showed up on any of my x-rays, including the one I had when I went in the hospital! I don't know for sure, but I really feel this drug caused this. I started on 450 mg 4X a day.

Also have taken this medication for a severe case of strep throat, since I am allergic to Penicillin. THIS MEDICATION SAVED MY LIFE. Literally. Nothing has been more affective in giving me comfort in the least amount of time as this medication has. I took 300 mg 3x daily. Never experienced any side affects. I was advised to eat Activia daily to lessen the chance of stomach pain/cramping/diarrea. I really don't understand why this medication gets a bad reputation for causing massive stomach complications ....it is stated VERY clearly on the packaging that this med can cause collitis, etc. and to proceed with caution IE. drink a FULL glass of water with it and take a probiotic! If you have nausea...ask for something to calm your stomach! I dont remember what it was they gave me in the hospital, they injected it straight into my IV but it helped a ton with nausea and is of course available in pill form. I don't think as many people would have such horrific side affects if you took the medication as directed and heed the warnings! Cover your bases! You cannot simply just take a pill and expect it to be your cure all if you already know you have stomach issues, nausea, diarrea, etc. YOU ALREADY KNOW YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY, USE COMMON SENSE. I have nothing but amazing things to say about Clindamycin. Not only did it clear up a major staph infection on my breast, but it has given me comfort from strep throat and a nasty sinus infection. My skin also felt baby soft and was glowing for months after stopping the medication.  My advice for those looking at reviews before taking this medication....do not let those people scare you! YES we all react different to medications, but follow your doctors orders/advice...and look after yourself! Drink plenty of water, rest, and take a probiotic (which you should anyways!) and you shouldn't have an issue! This stuff is a medical miracle.

Swollen upper lip across mouth and swollen left cheek with pain radiating to left side of face and to lower left jaw with diminishing severity.  Left nostril and lower left eye lid also swollen.  Pain was generally severe, and I took aspirin for some relief.  To my knowlege I have no drug allergies.  Took capsules at 06:00AM, 02:00PM, &amp; 10:00PM +/- 1hr.  No releif on first, second, &amp; third day.  Had a little releif from swelling on fourth day.  Stools became soft on fourth day.  Got significant releif from swelling on fifth day.  Swelling disappeared on sixth day.  Mowed the lawn on seventh day.  Had oral surgeon extract tooth on eight day.  Happy days are here again.

I took med with Probiotics &amp; drank water with each dose.I had little side effects, and good results with this med.I know this is because I took precautions, followed dr instructions &amp; PRAYED! I was extremely sick from this  staph infection in my leg-it got into my allergy injection site while cleaning my son's football equipment. The site had to be opened and drained twice and was packed for 3 weeks. I couldn't risk not getting better or meds making me worse-Paise the Lord-neither of those occured!  I am almost recovered now. I have returned to work.

The doc told me to buy some Activia yogurt and eat that while taking this medication. I've eaten 4 oz every morning before taking the meds (and take two subsequent doses throughout the day) and haven't had any bowel problems. I highly recommend using the Activia with probiotics while taking this medication!

Clindamycin was prescribed for me. The pills were large, but so were the Sulfa pills I had taken before so it wasn't a big deal. However, the near constant diarrhea and the vomiting after 4 days caused me to stop taking it. I went into the doctor the next day and she was concerned I had developed intestinal colitus. After a stool sample and blood work, everything came back negative. Thankfully. On the bright side, it took care of the large boil I had been suffering from. I just wish it hadn't sacrificed my intestinal fortitude for it.

I was fortunate to read the reviews here after five days on the drug so I was able to start probitics twice a day with Activia - lots of it.  I drank two glasses of water with each pill and remained upright for at least 30 min.  300 mg 4 x a day for ten days.  I had a little stomach rumbling and very mild diarrhea one day but that was it.  I won't feel that I'm out of the woods until at least two months go by without complications.  I'm definitely going to question ever taking this again.  I'm not allergic to any medication and I don't know why I wasn't prescribed penicillin which I've taken before for an abscessed tooth - no side effects and effective for me.

I didn't have any symptoms while taking the pill. When I stopped taking the pill, I also stopped eating the yogurt and developed a mild case of diarrhea, so I started eating yogurt again and will continue to do so until the medication has run its course.

Diff colitis two weeks after treatment. I was not warned by my doctor of this severe possible side effect even having asked for drug info. I have seen many doctors and done many tests for over a month, costing much time and money. I was given Flagyl and Codeine for the pain though i still felt the excrutiating pain with the Codeine plus nausea. I'm on a strict diet and am absolutely starving for 'real' food. If you can avoid this drug, do so, as the chance of getting C. diff is not worth it. I was young and very healthy before my Strep throat and Clindamycin. Although my last test was finally negative for C. Diff, I still have symptoms of colitis which may possibly cost me a job.

If you have problems with this med you should let everyone know. If you don't have problems with this med you should also let everyone know. Had I read this site before taking this medication, I probably would have opted out on a drug that works fine for me. I'll post if there's any changes.

I'm taking this for my mastitis, since I'm allergic to several other antibiotics. It's working well without any noticeable side effects whatsoever, but I'm only on day 4 of 10. I'm mixing my pumped milk with formula since I don't really like the idea of all this stuff going into my daughter, so she's consuming a much smaller amount than she would be.

So far I had no severe adverse reactions but had mild ones including itching, hot &amp; cold flashes, sharp pains in the head, occasional chest pain, and sleeplessness since Monday. The facial swelling has gone down just slightly and the pain is still so severe (even on Vicodin 5-500mg TWO tabs every THREE hours!). I don't think the Clindamycin is taking effect for me too well because you would think a drug this strong would have at least made more progress after 7 doses. Today would have been day 3 for me w/20 more doses to go but after reading the reviews, I called my dentist to switch to a different antibiotic.No tooth is worth compromising more vital biological systems like GI! C. Diff is becoming increasingly fatal. See article. http://www.webmd.com/news/20081030/c-diff-epidemi c-likely-to-get-worse

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/8/2010 5:20:07 PM	I do not recommend taking Clindamycin as it has caused me stomach problems a month after I prescribed this medication for the infection in my throat.  I am having diarreha and mucus in stool since Thursday.  It is now Monday and this problem seems to be clearing up.  I do not attribute the stomach problem to bad eating habits as I weigh 116 and am 5' 1&quot;.  Daily, I take a mult-vitamin and Vitamin C, Calcium, &amp; Flex-A-Min. I have chiropractic exercises that I do day and evenings.  I was prescribed Clindamycin for an infection in my throat.  I had had a cold for 3 weeks.  I was better.  Then, overnight on the last Thursday in Feb. 2010, I woke up with a lump in my throat.  I ended up in the hospital hooked up to an IV for 5 days.  I couldn't swallow my own spit nor eat.  The ears, nose, throat specialist was finally able to drain the lump which turned out to be a cist.  Yes, very painful.  It was a horrible infection so I don't know if there was another type of medication that could have been prescribed.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	2/18/2010 4:47:54 PM	I was put on Clindamycin (300mg 4xday for 10 days) to clear up a very nasty case of tonsillitis. I was pretty afraid of the drug after reading all the negative reviews, but it worked very well for me. I ate with every dosage (a meal or at minimum a cup of yogurt), always drank about 2 glasses of water (one before and after) and didn't lie down for 30 minutes after wards as instructed. I did develop a rash on the ninth day and had to stop short of my full course, but it worked and the rash cleared up in a few days. Since I developed a rash, I probably can't go on the medication again, but if I could, I wouldn't hesitate as it was very effective.

Other	Millie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	2/12/2010 11:58:50 AM	I am taking this antibiotic to treat a gum abscess. My dentist suggested I take it along with acidophilus to prevent stomach pain and upset and they work great together. After day 4, I've noticed a significant reduction in the size of the abscess - also, I've not experienced any diarrhea or stomach upset. There was one day where I purposely didn't take the acidophilus to see what would happen and that day, I did experience some pain. The truth is, I don't usually take antibiotics unless they're absolutely necessary and I think that makes a lot of difference in the medicines effectiveness.

I am also Type II Diabetic. The Dr. asked me to take 2 capsules 3 times a day at 300mg. The first day was fine. By the second day I had to go to the bathroom a lot and I mean a lot. So, I decreased the amount I was taking to only twice a day 3 days after I began my full dosage again. The bathroom thing quit thank goodness. Although I did start noticing a difference in my blood sugar and it began to spike up and down. I am controlling my sugar with diet and exercise and everything had been normal until now. The little sore has gone and their is very little pain. Dr. only prescribed this medication as a preventative precaution. I think it has helped but in the mean time it has made me miserable.

My gums were very sensitive and would bleed at the slightest touch.  When I brushed my teeth, I was spitting blood.  This had been going on for years.  After taking the Rx for 3 days, I noticed a huge difference in my gums.  They didn't bleed anymore and they were turning from purple (bad) back to pink (good).  I was so excited.  I just couldn't get over how well this worked for me.  Now when I brush my teeth, there is almost no trace of bleeding.  I was not aware of diarrhea as a possible side effect while taking this Rx.  Now that I think about it, I did have a mild case of diarrhea and some minor stomach cramping while I was taking this Rx.  I just thought it was something I ate.  (I like spicy foods and beer.)

Other	Kayla , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/13/2010 10:34:02 PM	The week before halloween 2009, I had a very bad toothache-which was going to be solved by a root canal.   Before I had the root canal, this toothache turned into a massive dental abcess. I was given 5 different abx, which were ineffective. I wound up being hospitalized for 5 days, and received clindamycin and augmentin around the clock. They worked well together, and got rid of the swelling. HOWEVER- I had major issues with heartburn, diarreah, upset stomach, and just general weakness while taking the medications. I actually stopped taking it because it was too painful. Here I am nearly 3 months later, and the infection is back. I started taking what I had left of the ABX 3 hours ago, and I feel it starting to upset my stomach already. FINISH your abx! I'm paying for it dearly.

I didn't notice any side effects at the time, but six weeks after I finished the treatment, I developed diarrhea which has now been going on for three weeks.  When I told my gastroenterologist that I had taken Clindamycin, she started describing my own symptoms to me.  She said that I probably had C. diff, and it could develop as much as six months after using the drug.  Now I am having tests, and will probably have to start taking Flagyl as well as probiotics.  Another antibiotic to cure the effects of the first antibiotic!  I'll never take it again.  For those who have completed taking it, don't assume that you are home free just because the side effects didn't show up right away.

I tried four courses of less strong antibiotics which did not clear the infection, so my dentist put me on Clindamycin. Since taking the Clindamycin, my infection appears to have cleared up, however, I have had numerous side effects including candida (yeast infection) throughout my system, thrush on my tongue, nausea which continues even a month after I have stopped using the Clindamycin, and my whole system feels severely compromised.  I am eating large amounts of plain yogurt, kefir, probiotic tablets and am on the diet prescribed for candida, but still my symptoms persist. I am happy that the infection appears to have cleared, but would not take this drug again because of the side effects.

I ended up spending all of Thanksgiving in my bathroom vomiting, etc. I made the dentist aware of the reaction I was having, but I was still told to take it. As a result of the vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea, I became dehydrated. I ended up having a seizure because I couldn't keep my Dilantin down. I quit taking this medicine on my own, but it took over a week for the diarrhea and cramps to ease away. I'm still nauseous every now and then. I will never take this again! The root canal was bad enough, but this medication has horrible effects on the body. If your doc can give you anything else, take it.

Ever since (10 years ago) I have had bloating of the stomach, diarrear and became lactade tolerant.I am at high risk to develop colon cancer now and any time I try to replace the good bacteria which was lost in the Colon, ny own immune cells attack and casue me bloating  and pain.DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE!!!

It immediately made me nauseous followed by continuous vomiting. Initially thought it was because of the vicodin I was taking. Finally determined that was not the cause. I am allergic to penicillin so that may have been the problem. This drug did not work for me. Dentist switched me to Keflex which did work.

Today, after just 5 doses I can say I am almost pain free, and the swelling is gone, and without ANY side effects. Did take with 8 oz of water each time and did not lay down for 30 min, as directed by my doctor. I am glad I was one of the lucky ones. It has worked very well for me.

I have had the worst diarrhea ive ever had in my life. The heartburn and headaches are unbearable. I'm using this because i have MRSA and this was my last chance antibiotic. It is very strong with serious side effects. I would recommend trying anything else possible before taking this medicine.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/17/2009 9:26:05 AM	Too often we hear all the negative and not the positive.  I have finished my time with this drug and found it very effective and easy to use.  I followed the directions for use and had absolutely no problems.  I drank 8 oz. of water before taking, with a light snack or my meal, followed by another 8 oz. of water as directed by my dentist.  He also advised not to lay down for at least 30 minutes after taking to prevent heartburn. There are good results - don't give up just because of poor reviews - sometimes folks don't take meds as directed.  Other times, well your body doesn't like it.

While there has not been any nausea or diarrhea, he's had awful heartburn.  He's also been having flu like symptoms (fatigue, muscle/joint aches, headaches) that I did not connect to the antibiotic until I read through other reviews.  It does seem to be killing off his infection, but I will be sure to push for something else next time.  I would rather not risk all the serious GI side effects as he already has diverticulosis.

It cured the ear infection, however approximately 1-month later I started having severe diarrhea and abdominal cramping that lasted 25 days. I went to two separate doctors both of which did not link the diarrhea to the med. It took losing weight, having no appetite, becoming dehydrated and having daily bloody/mucous diarrhea and then going to the ER to finally be diagnosed with C-diff.

I was to take it and then go for a root canal. Into the second day that I was taking it I got heartburn that just kept getting worse. Last night It got to the point that I could not swallow food or drink. I can swallow it but I can feel where it passes thru to my stomach and it hurts so bad. It is a burning sensation and pain each time I swallow even my own spit. I took some anti acids but it does not seem to help going into the next morning. I have stopped taking this med. Oh yes and I had been taking it with plenty of water. I dont know what to do now...go to the hospital or wait. I just started a new job and have no money. I WILL TAKE THIS MED AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!

Controllable diarrhea, gastrointestinal cramping, mild heartburn from day one.  Taking it every six hours--and having to stay upright for at least a half hour afterwards--was very annoying.  Last dose left me with a mild, but persistent heartburn (without reflux, thankfully)--24 hours so far.  But... it was effective.  If prescribed again, I'll ask for viable alternatives.

Other	ferris123, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	55-64	8/24/2009 4:28:06 PM	I was prescribed this drug after dental surgery removing tori mandibularis to prevent any infections of the mouth. Originally I took one pill and a headache developed thereafter.  If one reads all the side effects for this drug from the pharmacy, you will find headache as a side effect.  I stopped the drug.  Switched to amoxicillin which I know doesn't give me problems.  However, went back to this drug to cure a cold and this time did not have headaches.  It is working, but I eat before and drink lots of water with this drug.  Because I am a nurse if this drug does not agree with you, tell your doctor to switch it to something you can use rather than have your infections take a greater hold.  Best of health! FSW

After a culture analysis (MSRA),  we switched to Clindamycin.  Response was almost immediate and improvement was quite evident.  The only noticeable side effect was when I laid down after one dose and had a bad case of heartburn that after an hour eventually cleared.  Being a diabetic, I was really concerned about the infection and am glad the drug responded quickly to the infection.  I did not have any of the other side effects such as diarreha (sp), or thrush so maybe I'm more lucky than others.  Hopefully I will not need it again, but would not be afraid if I had to. 
Other	I Hate Medicine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	7/31/2009 11:07:58 AM	This is a long review, but reading it could save you a hospital stay.  First, I have a lot of allergies, both to medicines and many foods.  I was worried about taking Clindamycin for that reason, especially after reading all the terrible reviews and the strong warning on the label about pseudomembranous colitis and possible c. diff infection.  Im going into my 5th day and the worst side effects Ive had have been a bitter taste in my mouth and some bad, very uncomfortable bloating and gas on day two.  Heres what Ive done to minimize and alleviate the side effects of this powerful antibiotic:1)	First, I follow the instructions and take each pill with a FULL glass of water. 2)	I take each pill with a full meal.3)	I take the pills at the same time EVERY SINGLE DAY.  7:00AM and 7:00PM (Im a two-a-day dosage).4)	I drink A LOT of water between doses.  I also drink Gatorade and herbal tea.  I find peppermint tea with a little powdered ginger works best to alleviate gas &amp; bloating.5)	I nibble every couple of hours.  If I go much longer than this I get abdominal discomfort and a little nausea.  Also, I find the healthier the food, the better I feel.  The most effective meal so far has been seasoned turkey breast patties with plain lettuce and saut&#233;ed leeks, zucchini, and yellow squash.6)	I eat cultured veggies.  I have a Body Ecology center nearby (google Body Ecology for more info) that sells homemade cultured veggies, and the practitioner told me that the probiotics in cultured veggies are antibiotic resistant.  Thats important, because the reason for colitis and c. diff. infection is that the antibiotic has killed off all your bodys good bacteria (probiotics), which is what keeps c. diff. in check and your intestines/colon healthy.7)	Most importantly, I take Dr. Ohhira brand probiotics.  Again, the practitioner told me that these probiotics are antibiotic resistant (not all are).  Also, she said they are the only ones that kill c. diff., which prevents

It does seem to be working on the infection bue I am going to have to stop taking it and hopefully this goes away. Also have to go back to the Dr to spend more money on something better.

Since starting this med, I've had severe diarrhea! I'm sick in the morning when I wake up and sometimes it wakes me up in the middle of the night.

I'm sick of taking antibiotics and so tired of having diarrhea. It doesn't matter what I eat, or IF I eat, I still have it. I tried Activia, however I was told this was for constipation and not to eat it. I tried eating only Dannon yogurt for 24 hours, and I still have diarrhea. My PCP said the clindamycin is such a strong antibiotic that it's normal to come down with a 2nd infection. I've had diarrhea for almost 3 weeks and even with prescription anti-diarrhea medication, it's still happening. It has finally started slowing down to a few times a day, usually in the mornings. I didn't know that MRSA (an abcess staph infection) could cause all these health problems. 
Other	Frances, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	7/14/2009 11:29:13 AM	My dentist subscribed this medication.  He says the infection in my tooth needs to be removed before giving me a root canal.  But this medicine makes me feel funny.  I've seem to have diaherra and sometimes I feel pain on the left side of my chest.  I'm not sure if it works, I can't seem to take for no more than a week.  I will need to consult my dentist again.

Slight upset stomach and increase in bowel movements but I'm going to buy Activia today to help with that.  Frankly upset stomach is a million times better than the abcess, which I was beginning to debate yanking the tooth with pliers at the point I started taking the Clindamycin.  The Rx has helped, minor side effects and totaly worth it!

Everything went well until I started having heartburn then a day later my scalp started itching, followed by my face and neck.   Now my chest, stomach, back, waistline, crotch and butt is covered with a red rash, splotches and itches like the devil. My family doctor told me to take benadryl.  Twenty-four hours later the problem is worse.  This is Saturday I have another call in for the Doctor,hope he calls soon.

A ten day course of amoxicillin did not eradicate the infection. About a week after finishing the amoxicillin, I began a ten day course of clindamycin. During each of those ten days and for a couple of days after, I ate a cup of Activia and took an acidophilus capsule. The infection was killed and, despite the fact the I have GERD and IBS, I had no gastro problems at all.

OK for the first few days then complained of severe headaches, dizziness, back pain, tiredness and nausea. This drug does more harm than good. The bottle did not have a label with any possible side effects. The doctor was also unaware and ordered a catscan. Good thing I did my homework prior to the next hospital visit.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/30/2009 9:15:17 AM	My rating for effectiveness is somewhat misleading,because I didn't/ couldn't take it as prescribed, which may be why the bacterial infection didn't go away.  Although not listed as a side effect, each dosage I took gave me a horrible migraine, which then renendered me pretty much done for the day, whcich is why I missed so many doses.  It took me about a week to make the connection, but surely with each pill, I got a migraine and then couldn't function for the rest of the day; once the medicine was out of my system, I was fine, and then would try again, with the same results.  I suppose there are some for whom this medicine works well- I'm just not one of them.

I drank about 1 gallon a day and yes was going to the bathroom a lot,  but other than some slightly loose stools &amp; being more tired than usual,  I didn't have any side effects.

My baby had an adverse reaction to the amoxicillin the doctor first prescribed.  So, clindamycin was prescribed in the alternative.  After the first day of full use, I noticed my son was breathing much better and it cleared his puffy red eyes.  But, he also began throwing up.  He literally could not hold anything down, including pedialyte.  I had my poor infant hanging over a toilet.  I have discontinued its use.  I caution parents to think twice about agreeing to use this medicine.  While it is extremely effective, the side effects outweigh any benefits.

I am having to eat 4-5 containers of active cultured yogurt (Activa) and, on dr's orders, taking immodium.  Nothing is helping yet.  Hoping it wears off really soon.  Avoid this drug like the plague!  Never accept a script for this CRAP!  Because that's what you'll be doing afterwards... and A LOT of it!
Other	SherryinNJ, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	1/26/2009 7:05:45 PM	I was given Clindamycin for an infection in a tooth requiring root canal.  I took it for 5 days prior to the procedure and was told to finish it up.  I wasn't feeling ill to begin with, but now I am going on my second week of feeling sick as a dog and missing work.  At first I thought I had a bad intestinal flu, and I left work with fever and more than body aches, but body pain in all my joints.  I was shivering under 5 blankets.  I got severe diarrhea that does not let me rest at all, needing to go every 5 minutes at times.  I have no control over my bowels now and must be close to the bathroom. I have stomach pain and worst of all the unrelenting cramps and spasms that make you keep running to the bathroom, whether you have anything to do or not, it just keeps happening.  This is a horrible, horrible medicine.  The side effects are not worth it, nor the risk.  I finally realized that it was this medicine doing this to me.  Tomorrow I have to see the doctor as I have missed so much work, but I am afraid I cannot even make the trip since I need to stay close to the bathroom.  It is exhausting and draining, worse than any flu.  Avoid this medicine at all costs.  You can read here how many people have been through the worst with this medicine.  Few have been lucky.  It's not worth the risk, this can be a very serious or even fatal side effect.  While I was actually taking the medicine, I had one day of diarrhea.  The worst of this did not happen until 2 weeks later... no longer taking the med, but this is what I have now.  I now realize the heartburn, chest pains, face flushing, etc., were all part of it too, but I didn't put it all together at the time.  I wonder how many people have just thought they had a really bad flu after taking this.  I don't know how long this will continue yet, but it's sure messed up my life for no reason.  I can't even finish the root canal yet because I am too sick from the medicine now.

Read up on this drug before you use it, I did not, its kind of a new antibiotic and have serious side effects. I was given it by a dentist after a root canal-because of my better judgment and did not second guess myself I am doing a bit better.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	1/22/2009 10:38:02 AM	I have been reading that this drug is evil, but only a few of the reviews discribed with I was having, I knew it was the drug but noone would believe me, not even my dr who prescribed it to me. I was having very sharp painful chest pains on my right side just below my breast. I now know this drug was the cause. I went against drs advice and stopped taking it, 2 days later the pains were gone.I wish that people would listen to their bodies and if you think you know the cause of your discomfort, believe in yourself. Also just because a side affect is not written on the lable doesn't mean it isn't from the drug. My dr. told me it wasn't the medicine and to continue to take it. That is crap! I am now looking for a new dr.In a few rare cases this drug causes chest pains, and if it was on the left side, i would have rushed myself to the emergency room, they were that bad!Trust your body and remember that drs advice is just that, if you think it is crap, don't listen to them!

I experienced heartburn, soft stools with mucus, ulcers in my mouth and extreme tiredness.  My mouth is so sore I am not able to eat, soft stools occur with no warning and my tooth is still very painful.  I can't understand why this is still on the market.  There was no warnings when I got the prescription. I feel much worse than I did before starting this. Doctors should be required to take this before they prescribe it.  BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU DECIDE TO TAKE THIS AND WATCH FOR SYMPTOMS .

My bowel movement were very painful,constant. Stools contained mucus.After a stool sample was taken, it was determined that I had an infection that was brought on by the use of this medication. The dosage prescribe was 2 150mg capsules every 8 waking hours. I was only able to take 44 of the 60 prescribed. Now I have to take another antibiotic to cure this problem. Sometimes the cure is worse than the problem.

It helps to clear the rash and sores and I show negative for MRSA when tested after finishing the meds. The problem is it's only temporary. The infection returns every time after a few weeks of being off the medication. So overall it isn't worth the stomach problems when it doesn't cure the infection of the skin completely. It works for lots of infections but not for MRSA.

I also suffer from CRPS and due to that am on an array of narcotics. This CAN cause problems with this anti-biotic. I am thankful my Doctor and I took a calculated chance and took this medication. Both times...no stomach or intestinal issues, during or after. I was even instructed to take an extra dose each day on the last real bad infection, still no side effects. One thing I learned for sure is to trust the knowledge of my doctor.  When they want your input that proves they care about curing you more than writing scripts for a certain medicine.

I did not have any side effects and my pain is gone! I only had to take it for 7 days. If you read the reviews, just remember that usually the only time people write reviews is if they are not satisfied with the product or if they get horrible side effects. Side effects dont happen to everyone. There are probably several people who have or who are taking this drug and have not had any side effects at all. Please read mine and don't be afraid to take it like I was. It worked great! I hope that this helps you as much as some of the positive reviews helped me.

I did not have any side effects while i was on this, I finished up the last of it on friday today is sunday and i still feel ok. The only side effect i have noticed was i have a slight burning feeling &quot;down there&quot; so me and my boyfriend can not have sex. After researching it online i did find it is a side effect so hopefully it doesnt get worse and goes away soon. Has anyone else had this problem with this med or any antiobiotic? Remember everyone is different so the meds will effect everyone differently, i guess i was lucky i didnt have any bad side effects like all the ones i have read on here. Hopefully they dont start now that im off the med
Inflammation of the Vagina caused by Bacteria	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	13-18	12/12/2008 12:51:04 PM	Hello, I'm only 18.I was given this medication to treat a vaginal yeast infection about a month ago, while I was taking it the only real inconvenience at first, was that it really upset my stomach and gave me cramping after I had taken each dose. But when I finally finished the medication, of course I was looking forward to not having stomach pains any longer, but then I noticed they only started to get worse and worse, by the next day or so I had uncontrolable dirrhea, cramping, nausea and some vomiting. It has been about two weeks of this, everyday. I eat during the day/evening and every morning I wake up sick. I'm usually sick for 2-4 hours depending on how much I ate the day before. I have been describing it as a &quot;food hangover&quot;. not fun. Also, after the first few days of taking it, I noticed some bumps on the back of my tongue going into the back of my throught, over the last few weeks they have spread to the sides of my tongue, under it and more down my throught, at first they werent painful and I hardly noticed them, but now i can feel it when I swallow or eat. I have been to the e.r and to my doctor 3 times in the last two weeks about all of thease symptoms, they &quot;don't know&quot; what the bumbs are in my mounth, but don't seem to be worried about them being there at all or  them spreading.On top of all these symptoms I have been sick for the past few months trying to find answers, I have/had other symptoms before I started this medication, please if anyone had/has any of thease symptoms after taking or while taking this medication, it would really help me to find out if this is tied in with whats already going on with me or if it was all caused my taking this medication. also, if anyone does have any of thease symptoms, I feel for you, this really sucks. :(

This medication has worked each and every time for me with little to no side effects. I should note that I am one of those people if there is a side effect to a medication, then it will for sure happen to me. With all other antibiotics I have had stomach cramps and diarrhea, but not with Clindamycin. But when speaking with my doctor, he mentioned to me that this is rare and that this antibiotic is the one most people complain about with side effects, however in my opinion, the positives out weigh the negatives with this medication. It knocks out an infection and it wont come back. I hope this post helps some of you out. I dont usually take the time to do this but Clindamycin works so well for me that I wanted to make sure everyone else knew. Good health to you all!

I did not know that these were side effects because the dentist only warned me about diarrhea. Which I didn't have only softer stools.

I am not a person that is prone to UTIs.  I'd had 1 in my entire life before that one.  It did not stop the infection in my tooth, and it gave me a horrible yeast infection on top of the UTI.  From what I've read here, it seems to be the dental field's best friend, and this antibiotic does more harm than good and should be pulled from the market ASAP.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	11/22/2008 2:35:10 PM	I am four days into a taking it to prevent infection after a complicated tooth extraction. Things are going okay so far. I am a nurse, and as I read these reviews I am concerned that so many people simply choose to stop the drug without consulting with the prescriber. One of the most serious problems we have in health care now is that of drug resistant bacteria. Not all antibiotics kill all bacteria, and if there is an improvement in symptoms with unpleasant side effects, there should be another drug prescribed to destroy the bacteria completely. Partial treatment strengthens that bacterias ability to resist being destroyed by that drug and could eventually lead to the inability of antibiotics to cure infections. It's easy to get angry if a drug causes more problems than it cures, but arbitrarily stopping treatment is not advisable.

Other	Staying Positive, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	11/13/2008 1:09:29 PM	I was prescribed this medication for root canal therapy; taken for 10 day @ 3 times per day.  Had not tooth pain or swelling but was told there was an infection.  It is now day 7 and after reading some of the other reviews, I realize that some of the things I have been experiencing may be as a result of this medication.  Have been having headaches, extreme lower backpain, soft stools, dizzy/nervousness, nausea, severe knee pain, and intermittent itchiness w/o rash.  I also forgot one night to wait 30 minutes before laying down and had extreme heartburn that felt like I was having a heart attack!  Because I suffer from fibromyalgia, I always contribute most things to IT, but had not really been having any flair-ups.  So, evidently, these things must be a result of this medication--effects that were not listed on my readout from the pharmacist.  I am use to dealing with the symptoms of fibromyalgia, so I can handle these side effects; but I surely hope they go away after day 10 of treatment.  Many seem to have had prolonged effects after the discontinuation of treatment.  We all know that things work differently with each &quot;individual&quot; person; so, I WISH US ALL THE BEST--DO THE BEST WE CAN, WITH WHAT WE HAVE.  AND TRY TO KEEP SMILING; REMEMBER, IT COULD ALWAYS BE WORSE!!!

About 4 days into the treatment I thought I was dying from rectal or colon cancer when I started going to the bathroom 10 times per day w/ bright red blood!  I am in the medical field and know to take antibiotics w/ food which I did.   I called my internist since I did not immediately make the connection to this antibiotic.   After a stool sample test, it was confirmed I had C-diff.   The Clindamycin is what caused the colitis and bleeding.   He had me stop taking the Clindamycin immediately and within a day felt better, but another week to fully recover.   I will never take that antiobotic again unless it is the last choice drug to save my life!

I too felt a bit of GI discomfort, but tried always eating after the pills, taking a lot of liquids and NEVER sitting down for an hour or so after taking the capsules. That helped a great deal. I am so grateful for this drug. I was in trouble and had a tremendous amount of pain and swelling that finally turned around on Day 6 post root canal. I appreciate that my Dr. didn't jump to prescribe Clindamycin first but took a wait and see approach.

Maybe you should understand exactly what they are before thinking that all medicine is going to make you feel better. I had a serious infection from one of my wisdom teeth and needed to be put on this immediately. I guess I'm one of those people that understand that this is a short time medication 7 days max and unless I have a bad reaction to it I'm going to take what the doctor perscribes! This medication works, there is no doubt about it! Might make the stomach hurt alittle but suck it up your sick your not suppose to feel like superman! Bottom line antibotics aren't fun nor is any drug, but they work like they are suppose to. 
Skin Infection due to Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteria	babygirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/30/2008 12:25:35 AM	I was perscribed this drug for a slight skin infection, but after reading the reviews on here I was to afraid to take it.  So 4 days later the infection turned so bad it started spreading to my bloodstream and I had to go the ER.  The dr. had to perform a very painful and costly procedure to drain the area.  And i was told once again to start the antibiotic.  So I took this drug for the entire 10 days with not one single side effect!  NONE!  I ate yogurt while taking it but just to be on the safe side.  Please don't let these reviews scare you out of the drug your dr. has put you on.  Everyone reacts differently to different drugs.  I found out the hard way.  Had I just took the drug from the beginning I would have saved alot of pain and money!

I took the drug for two weeks.  The staph infection cleared up but I felt awful the whole time I was on the medication.  At first I just felt &quot;crummy', then started getting stomach pains, heartbur, headache and lightheadedness.  On the 14 day I broke out in an &quot;angry&quot;, bumpy red rash on the back of my scalp, all over my back, my chest, abdomen and groin.  It itches like crazy.  I stopped the meds immediately, and after 2 days when the rash did not get any better, I saw my doctor.  He confirmed a severe reaction and prescribed a steroid for 5 days to take care of the rash. I won't be taking this drug again!

I took four doses and noticed a red rash forming down the front of my neck and upper chest. I started developing a mild headache as well. None of the swelling from the abscess had decreased. I called my endodontist, and he took me right off of it. I'm glad I called him when I did.

After two days on this, it was practically gone. I was worried, reading about people's side effects here, so I was very careful about taking it- I'd drink practically a whole liter of water with each pill, made sure I ate at least 6 oz. of yogurt with active cultures each day, and watched what I ate to avoid any foods that could cause stomach upset. I have one day left of treatment and I haven't had the intestinal problems other people have complained of here or the reflux &amp; heartburn. I'm very impressed with how thoroughly it has cleared up this infection that amoxicillin did nothing for.

If I do not have noticable improvment within the next 2 days I will see my doctor. I was given this for a infection on a root canaled tooth that is acting up again.  This medication is not worth it.  There are many others that are far better and will do the job just fine!

My dentist did advise me to stop the med if I had stomach problems.  After reading the previous reviews, I'm glad I followed my instincts and stopped taking it.

After taking 3 pills daily for 14 days I can only say it works for me. I took care to take the pills with either food or milk to ease any stomach problems. I ate a some yogurt daily to keep the colon happy. The only discomfort I have had is a kind of sour stomach at times. Nothing too bad, just annoying. The medicine helped reduce a dental abcess that had bothered me for some time. My Dentist is very pleased with the progress.What else can I say? It worked for me and any minor discomfort was a lot less painful than the abcess was.

If you are prescribed this medicine , please ask your doctor to prescribe you something else. All I was trying to do is get rid of acne scarring, not takea trip to the mourge.

Worked well on the abcess but has resulted in chronic diahrrea since then &amp; also an irritated bladder wall from the diahrrea.  Now, I'm having to spend MORE MONEY on lab fees, more rx's to rid the bacterial infection.  I would not take this again due to the costly outcome. There are OTHER choices of antibiotics for abcessed tooth.:(
Other	Tonya, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/5/2008 7:49:38 PM	I am taking this medication for strep throat. This is my third round of RX.  I first did amox, then augment, now clindamycin. I have to get my tonsils out very soon, so this is my last hope for strep to be gone! So far so good. My throat does not hurt, my side effects are hardly anything. When I have to go, I have to go. But not loose stoles. I don't have headaches, heart racing, etc, as many have described.  So far so good. I will rate it perfect 5 stars if my strep test comes back negative!  Drinking a glass of water with it is not big deal! You should drink a lot of water anyways.  I just wanted to put a positive comment about this medicine, because there is so many.  So far, so good. I would recommend if you have tried. So far better then augmentin (sp?)  I will let you know soon if 5 stars~

I was put on clidamycin 150 and the tooth swelling has reduced in two days so I can't praise this drug enough because it works ...I normally can't take antibiotics because of the side effects but with this I haven't had any of the ones mentioned by others who have had the medication it truly is a God send....

It was effective.  Then a week later, I got very sick.  I developed hives, itching, burning in the vaginal and rectum area.  It was the worst yeast infection ever.  I tried everything to get rid of it and nothing helped.  Then my skin started to peel off everywhere on my body.  I had started a sinusitis and I felt very sick.  Blood and mucus was coming out of my nasal cavities and rectum.  My urine was very dark and it even burned when I had to pee.  My stomach was cramping and very tender.  Everything that was coming out of my body was like acid.  My lips started to chafe, my tongue had swollen up and  I had no taste.  The mouth was very dry.  I felt weak and had fever and chills.  I took this medication for 10 days, then I felt better with the strep throat.  BUT after a week all these side effects hit me like a brick.  I was not expecting this.  It took me a whole month to get over all of these side effects and my skin is still recovering.  I would definately not recommend this medication.  The side effects were too severe.  Please read and ask questions before taking anything.  We all rely on our doctors but in the end, its your health and your decision.  Some side effects are just too severe to be pushed aside!

The tooth didn't hurt and was not bothering me but I had swelling in the gum. I felt fine until I starting taking this drug. My stomach hurt for hours after taking it and I felt almost like I had the flu. I took this for 2 1/2 days and started breaking out with a rash on my stomach, chest and arms. Called my dentist on Saturday and was prescribed Z-pac and told to discontinue this drug. This is Sunday and although I don't have flu like symptons now or a stomach ache I am itching on my chest , stomach, and now my back with some acne like bumps on my neck. I would not recommend taking this drug unless it is a last alternative.

Some reviews I read made me very scared about taking this medicine. I went to my doctor to make sure that this was the right med. She explained to me that this is the correct med and to take it when I turn 14 weeks pregnant. I took this med. and felt nothing. I had no cramping, headaches, diarrhea, no nothing. So for my experience, with this med. is very good and it took care of the bacteria infection I had.

I am only on the second day of treatment (300 mg, 2 capsules, twice daily).  Soreness in my throat is slightly better.  Still very feverish, anxious, and have very bad dry mouth.  I've also experienced a lot of pain in my joints, especially my hips and my neck, as well as having very bad tension headaches.  My heart is racing constantly, but I don't believe that it is due to the med's b/c when they checked my pulse at the doctor's office it was 136.  Said it was due to high fever?  I don't know.  I've never taken this before and I'm a bit concerned after reading all of the other reviews.  I'll update after I'm done with my 10 days of it.

Other	hdvixen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	3/16/2008 10:01:29 AM	I took this as a result of a root canal. It worked but a side effect of it was that I broke out on my neck, back &amp; chest with these pustules (spelled right?) like when you get bit by red ants. They are swollen, red and when you break the whitehead they hurt. I am a week into this side effect with no abating. I even had a few come up on my face. I am allergic to penicillin and am wondering if this has something to do with that? If they are somehow related or if there is a part of the makeup of penicillin in this drug.
Other	terrir, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/15/2008 12:35:07 AM	Prescribed by my dentist after tooth extraction.  I am now on the third day of taking this medication and I have a horrific case of diarrhea/stomach cramps. No warning put on the bottle of pills by the pharmacy, but I was warned by my dentist beforehand to stop if I got diarrhea, so I am calling him and stopping this medication immediately.  By looking at the warning on this site, things can get really serious.  I also just took my pain meds, which I now see can make things worse.  Hope this does not last for weeks or months; if so, looks like I may have real problems.  The pharmacy should definitely post this information right on the bottle of pills with a label.  I might not have even begun taking this stuff if properly warned.

Finally after 2 days of HORROR I went to the emergency room it took them over 8 hours to find out that my intestines blew out an inch below my stomach and started dumping acid into my body, the hole was about the size of a quarter so NOT small... this was the worst med I have ever taken and was told by the doc that there was NO REAL medical reason I should be alive today due to this med.  Its not my dentists fault so I won't blame him its others that dump this on others.  I would recommend that you seek any other help than this pill.  I have now an 8&quot; scar on my stomach to remember these meds by.

With every antibacterial medication I get usually diarreha, but this is like I don`t take anything, it made me feel better, The swelling went down within 2 days, still pain from the swelling though. Great results and no side effects.
Skin Infection	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/7/2007 12:56:34 PM	I took both the IV form as well as the capsule form.  If taken by IV, the only down side is that it you get a metallic taste in your mouth.  Other than that, I was fortunate enough not to have experienced any GI effects from the drug.
Skin Infection	RN1507, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/4/2007 8:25:29 AM	I recently had a blood clot in my right leg, after having surgery I had a wound that was 15cm by 6cm wide on my calf.  I was prescribed 450mg 3 times a day.  From Oct. 29th to now, im still taking the medication @ 450mg 3 times a day.  The first week was hard, I couldnt eat, and was extremly drowsy.  After 2 or 3 weeks, the only side effect I had was trouble swallowing, but after about 15 min. it goes away.  Hope this helps those of you that think ur dosage is high, or uncertain of the risks VS results.

It has helped so much, I was in a lot of pain for quite a while before taking this medication, and it has made me healthy again.  I am now experiencing some loose bowels, but overall this medication really helped.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/30/2007 3:27:58 PM	I have spent the last 7 weeks in pain following a wisdom tooth extraction.  I was finally offered this antibiotic and the massive swelling in my jaw was cut in half after only 24 hours.  I'd had this swelling for 6 of the past 7 weeks!  I was made aware of the possible side effects (GI problems) and will be on the lookout for them, but it is a better alternative than an infected jaw that resisted prior treatment with another antibiotic.
Skin Infection	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	11/28/2007 10:49:55 AM	Failure to take at least 8 oz of water with the pill caused irritation in the esophogus. Not able to lay down for 1/2 hour in the middle of the night after taking the night dosage was an inconvenience.
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Male	35-44	11/27/2007 12:01:56 AM	Was prescribed 300mg of this by a dentist for an infected tooth that I'll be having removed tomorrow.  Did it work  - yes, been on it since Friday and the swelling and inflamation have gone down tremendously and I feel much better.  However - I've noticed increased anxiety, I am drinking water by the gallons, and I seem to be in the bathroom a lot - not diarreah but more frequent movements.  I think they put me on too high a dosage, which is part of the issue, but I also think it's medicinal effects.  I would be very concerned if this were prescribed for someone not aware of the effects or unable to be as aware of their faculties to know if it were a medication issue or a health issue.  I am asking the dentist tomorow evening if the dosage can be somehow lowered or spread further out for the remainder of the time, as it will affect my ability to function on my job eventually.

He immediately told me to stop taking &amp; prescribed erythromycin instead.He warned me to never take clindamycin again as it causes colitis in some people!My bowel troubles immediately ceased the next day &amp; had no problems with other antibiotic. I would NOT recommend this antibiotic to anyone- it is not worth the risks/ side effects!

Diabetic with Foot Infection due to a Specific Bacteria	frustrated, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	2	3	1	Female	65-74	11/4/2007 5:23:13 PM	My 66 year old Diabetic mother was prescribed this medication for a foot infection. Within three days, she noticed loss of bowel control. This continued to worsen. Unfortunately, she was not aware of the side effects and did not realize that this was a potential side effect of this medication. By the fourth night she had severe heartburn with chest pains.  She thought she was having a heart attack and spent the night in the hospital.  The Dr's did not even make the connectiont that this was a possible side effect of this medication. She was released and sent home, not knowing what was going on. The loss of bowel control continued to decline. With no answers but completely frustrated, we went online and decided to figure out what was going on. That is when we saw the other review and realized that all of her recent issues were directly related to this medication!  Absoulutely would NEVER recommend this medication!  The worst! My mother is still having the side effects. This is one drug where I fail to see the &quot;benefits&quot; out weighing the negative side effects!!

Bacterial Infection of Blood or Tissues affecting the Whole Body	harrison311, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	35-44	11/3/2007 10:19:11 AM	This is an update to my original post (below). I've changed my statisfaction rating after reviewing everything I've  suffered through, being treated for what they thought I might have (later learned that Dentist prescribed on poor judgement)I WOULD NEVER TAKE THIS MEDICATION AGAIN. NOR WOULD I RECOMMEND ANYONE TAKING IT UNLESS IT WAS DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR HEALTH TO DO SO. My immune system has been utterly compromised so much so, that I am still dealing with lingering side effects. I was in such poor health after taking this medication, I could barely work. I lost 15 pounds in ten days. My bones feel brittle, my muscles are always sore and fatigued. When my general practitioner learned I'd been on two types of antibiotics prior to this one and a steroid combo he nearly sh*t his pants! I love him, he knows me better than my mother. I was put on a strict diet and treated with only natural and homeopathic medicine. The diareah that lasted three weeks stopped within days. Now i'm rebuilding my immunity and blood health. People, there may not always be natural alternatives for meds or treatments but you owe it to yourself to know for sure.

About a week after she started taking, she had nausea, diarrhea, vomitting (all of which are side effects) and a fever of 100.5 degrees.  It is unlikely this is due to a stomach bug as she has not been out of the house since her surgery.  The doctor told her to stop taking it and I am praing that she gets to feeling better.  She has been through too much already.
