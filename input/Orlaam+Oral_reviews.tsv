Narcotic Addiction	Sarah, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	12/16/2008 8:00:37 AM	I was physically sick every day while on this.  Cold sweats, even my ears and feetwould sweat, cramping, vomiting, just felt like I was honestly dying on a daily basis.No baseline EKG was done before starting this drug.  I suffered a sudden cardiac arrest while driving at highway speed, while on life support was diagnosed with Long QT (went into Torsade in ICU) and now have a defibrillator in my chest as well ashaving to take a heart med with very nasty side effects (mexiletine).
