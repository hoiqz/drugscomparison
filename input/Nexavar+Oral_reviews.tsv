Liver Cell Cancer	Dottie, 65-74 (Patient) 	5	5	5		65-74	1/19/2012 11:03:57 PM	Had a liver resection 7/22/11 where they removed a 2 1/2 lb. Tumor.  Did not fit profile for hepatacellular carcinoma at all.  Drs. Were surprised but, then again, why not me.  Have lost most of hair , eyebrows, etc. But they will come back (I hope.). Rash in the beginning, no appetite, sore feet and constant diarrah.  Have lost 45 lbs. So far.  Could still lose more.  Look good and feeling well.  Everyone is amazed but I have a very positive attitude.  I'm 67 year old female and have been married to my high school sweetheart for 45 years.  I'm hoping to make it to our 50 anniversary, God willing.  We can only do so much and the rest is upmto God.  Keep the faith and pray.

My oncology team adjusted the meds, &amp; I am back at full dose again. Tea Tree Oil Shampoo really helps with the rash side effects. I am coping with the diarrhea by using Metamucil which bulks it up, so much better than taking another pill!

I have multiple blisters on my feet that are very painful. I work at a desk job and can still work. If I had to be on my feet for work, I would not be able to work.

I am still on nexavar for advanced renal cell carcinoma and tumors are still gone. I still have problems with hand and foot syndrome. I forgot to add in my first review that my teeth became loose and my gums hurt and began to bleed. I had top and bottom partials so I had my teeth pulled and that took care of that problem. Also my hair started to fall out but it stopped and went into tight curls-has remained that way for 1 1/2 years. I am still a believer in the power of nexavar. It may not be for everybody but it is working for me.

He took Nexavar for two weeks. On the second week he became very ill, vomited, could not control his bowel movements nor walk. The doctor prescribed this poison after he devoloped end stage liver cancer. After the second week the doctor took him off of Nexavar and gave him a week to live, on his last week he had Dementia, was screaming in agony and had stupors. He finally died from pneumonia and liver failure. I was very close to him.

Other	rockysmom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/23/2008 4:27:49 PM	My husband has been on Nexavar for 2 weeks and is having terrible side effects - hands so raw and sore he cannot touch anything and mouth sores so bad he cannot eat. Its way to early to tell if it is working for us - but I do not know how much longer he will be able to stay on it. They say some of the side effects go away in time but I am not sure he will make it long enough to see if that happens.
Other	fred697, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Male	35-44	10/16/2008 2:36:51 PM	I have angiosarcoma of the head and neck. I have had several tumors removed, been on chemotherapy for 2 years and had 33 treatments of radiation. This year we found 2 tumors on my brain and removed them with the Cyberknife. The chemo I was on was: Doxil, Taxol and Avastin. This year they put me Taxol and Avastin but my legs went numb, so my doctor put me on Nexavar. I have several blisters on feet, my hands hurt, my mouth and scalp hurt, and for the first time, am not able to work because of the pain. I have been putting Bag Balm on my feet as told by my doctor, and this helps as it keeps the skin softened, but still hurts too bad to stand on for 8 hours.

CT 4-11-07 showed multiple tumors in both lungs. After approval from ins. co. started Nexavar on 5-15-2007. Had hand foot syndrome, sore mouth, constipation but tumors shrank in 3 mo and were gone in 6 mo.I was off work for 5 mo then went back to work as side effects backed off. It is 7-27-08 and tumors are still gone. I know nexavar works. It may not be for everyone but I was in good health until tumor was found in right kidney. My diagnosis is advanced renal carcinoma (Clear cell type).
