The only thing or side effect is this dang headache that I get and have to take Advil to relieve the pain.

Strep Throat	Cici Kalnt, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	13-18	2/5/2011 12:39:23 PM	I had a sore thoat for four days now.  It's only been two days and I still have no relief.  My doctor told me I should be feeling the effectiveness within the first night, but I didn't.  The first night was restless dry pain, but if I frequently swallow it does ease the pain.  He gave me 10 pills, but he said by three days i'll be better.  Let's hope it does. Over all, I do think this medication works, but I don't expect any fast results anytime soon.
Other	szq, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	9/3/2010 2:08:17 AM	I'm taking Moxatag long term for Lyme disease.  The first time I took it, I got worse for a week, and then improved dramatically.  However, I developed a new symptom, eye problems, which the doctors are unable to diagnose (a possible exacerbation of the lyme to the nerves in the brain has been suggested but not confirmed).  Went off for 2 months.  Lyme symptoms returned.  I will probably have to try IV antibiotics but in the meantime I'm back on Moxatag so I can have a surgery I need...unfortunately the eye problems seemed to have worsened, one week in, although the other Lyme symptoms, as before, have regressed.  It's a frustrating disease.  Moxatag is much more convenient and safe than oral abx I've been on (no interactions with food or sunlight, and no dietary upset).  I came here looking to see if the eye problems are possibly related to the Moxatag rather than the Lyme.

Strep Throat	Vicloc, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	35-44	3/16/2010 6:59:04 PM	After having a sore throat for four days, I went to my doctor and he prescribed Moxatag 775 for me. After taking the first pill, I went to bed. No relief at first. I got &quot;cotton mouth&quot;. I coughed and my sleep was restless. I awoke feeling &quot;spacey&quot;. Now 24 hours later and after taking the second of ten pills, I feel better. Not coughing too much anymore. Will wait for the tenth day to make my final analysis on this drugs effectiveness.

Doctor told me I would feel relief in a day or 2 and I feel no change. Only thing that seems to help is the Tylenol I take for the pain and fever.
Other	Me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/9/2010 4:00:54 PM	I was prescribed this medication for an ear infection and sinus infection.  After the first dose the clogged feeling in my ear was gone. And the fact that I have to only take it once a day is great.

I am 4 days into a 10 day pill treatment and have unforunately had some stomach issues with diahrea and feelings that I needed to vomit.  Hopefully these side effects will lessen because the pill is great otherwise.  I hope to be rid of a horrible sinus infection soon!

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	12/11/2009 5:28:06 PM	My teenage daughter had a sinus infection and the start of tonsillitis. She took a 10 day treatment. By the second day, symptoms had almost gone completely with some stomach upset. Every time she took the pill, it made her very hyper and unable to concentrate. Luckily she only had to take 1 day and took them in the afternoon and then slept it off before school. Pills were giant and I could not have swallowed them but she did not have a problem. Overall I would recommend it though to knock out a sinus infection really fast.

My awful throat pain disappear after the second dose. However, I had stomach pain almost immediately.  But I was happy to get rid of the throat infection and overall nasty feeling.
Strep Throat	None, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/30/2009 10:26:16 AM	My throat was closed and I could not swallow. I took this and advil and within 24hours I was doing so much better. I wish there was a generic because this was a little pricey @ $50.00 for 7 tablets &amp; that was with my RX plan!
Strep Throat	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/23/2009 5:20:12 PM	I had strep and my doctor prescribed Moxatag because it is so easy to take!  Once a day rather than 3 times a day-AWESOME!  It costs a bit more than generic but was well worth it to take only one pill a day!
