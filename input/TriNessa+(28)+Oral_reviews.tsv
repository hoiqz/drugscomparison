Birth Control	Gilmore1983, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	8/26/2012 8:26:19 PM	While this birth control really helped me regulate my period (always on schedule, no cramps), it had horrible side effects.  It made me so emotionally up and down it was crazy!  I was very moody and sensitive on this pill, and worst of all, this pill made my hair shed like crazy!  Everytime I showered or brushed my hair, my hair would come out. And it was not breakage because it would come out at the root!  Overall, not at all happy with this pill.  It is one thing to be grumpy all the time but another to have your hair fall out!  This is NOT okay!!!! Switching to Necon, recommended by my doctor.  Hopefully I can find a pill that won't cause this horrible side effect.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/22/2012 7:03:54 PM	I started TriNessa 5 months ago and it has been great. Shorter, lighter periods and no cramps. Everyone's body reacts differently so give it time. Hormonal birth control effects everyone differently. In my opinion this is a great form of birth control
Birth Control	katie21, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	8/16/2012 8:22:04 PM	Ive been taking it for 2 weeks and ive been very sick feeling ever since and very tired. After reading everyones reviews im a little worried, but im still going to keep taking it to see how it goes.
Birth Control	TrinessaMess, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	8/14/2012 2:17:06 AM	I wish I had NEVER gone on this birth control because it's now going to take a while to get myself back to normal. I was on Trinessa for almost 2 years to prevent pregnancy...but otherwise I was an extremely healthy 27-year old who doesnt take any prescription drugs and practices natural medicine. Only recently did I finally relate my horrible symptoms to my birth control, so my doctor suggested that I switch brands.The Positive:  My face completely cleared up, my periods eventually became lighter/shorter, and some months I would have almost no cramps.The Negative:  As my body became overloaded with estrogen...my symptoms became worse. I gained 50 lbs. in a little over a year (I'm 5'7 and went from 140 to 190. A size 5 to a size 13). And if that isn't bad enough...my boobs started growing...3 cup sizes and they hurt ALL THE TIME. I could even see blue veins running through them and they looked gross. Then came the hot flashes. I was like a menopausal or preggo woman. The house could be 65 degrees and I'd still be hot. Not to mention the depression and mood swings. My fianc&#233;e started calling me a crazy person and I very nearly ruined my relationship several times. This was completely uncharacteristic for me...I've always been rational, loving, and happy. Not the type of person who screams and throws things across the house.I also started having pain during intercourse, spotting between periods and absolutely NO sex drive. My doctor explained that different birth control pills have different levels of estrogen and Trinessa has one of the highest. 30mcg of estrogen, whereas you can also find options for 15, 20, and 25. All just as effective at preventing pregnancy.

Acne	13-18 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	3	3		13-18	6/20/2012 1:15:07 PM	I started this birth control to get rid of acne on my face and back. I am sexually active and am not pregnant yet thank god although i usually do use condoms but it has done its job when i have not. overall it has been a hellish ride for me on this birth control. ive been on it for almost 2 months now and 2 days ago i all of a sudden got the  worst acne almost boil type acne all over my back. i dont know what to do. i feel like this is a normal side effect so i am going to give this another month to work thinking that maybe this is the horrible hell i need to get over to finally get the results i want. i will post again soon to tell yall if i have any improvement. good luck to everyone! 
Birth Control	!!!!24 , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	6/11/2012 11:45:23 AM	This is my first month of taking this pill. Once I came on my cycle I continued for the whole month of taking this pill. I have experience the cramp,nausea,migrane,sleepiness,not eating, or eating salt, blotting, continuous spotting. My legs are cramping continuously with charlie horses and my breast have went up one size. But in the middle of the night I am grabbing my legs in pain. I feel dizzy when just walking, also feeling like I want to cry just talking or having a normal conversation. I take the pill at the same time everyday which this is not a problem, but my husband find it being a true birth control when I am constantly on my cycle. I was hoping the first couple of weeks all the syptoms would go away but have not yet. I will contact my doctor on today. 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Kelsea, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	6/3/2012 3:10:11 PM	I have used this drug since I was 15 because I would go from having my period every 22 days to every 30 days.  I also had some bad back acne along with some face acne.  Since I was in high school, I didn't want to worry about having my period at school where I don't have extra clothes.  I have now been on this pill for 2, going on 3, years and have had no problems with this at all.  Very easy to take (very small), and this also cleared up my back &amp; face acne within the first month! Very effective and highly recommended.
Birth Control	sandra, 25-34 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1		25-34	5/29/2012 5:13:41 PM	I used Trinessa for five years, it prevented pregnancy but at a major cost. I always felt moody, anxious, emotional and depressed; as well as dizzy spells. I stopped taking it for about two months and noticed a major change in my mental health. I just got back on it and the same side effects came back to haunt me. I just stopped taking this pill.
Birth Control	jjjj, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	1	Female	13-18	5/24/2012 2:39:41 PM	This pill has made me gain weight and break out!

Although it was effective as birth control, the side effects were awful.  Migraine headaches, vision problems, shaky feeling.  Stopped taking this pill.
Birth Control	lily, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	5/18/2012 11:10:46 AM	I took this birth control for a month and i stop because i got scared of how i gained 10lb in 1 month,i just started it again to see how my body is gonna react now,i did go up a cup size and my pants fit way better now ;),I'll give another review after using it this time.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	25-34	5/8/2012 7:16:18 PM	This BC made me so sick to my stomach.  I threw up twice.  I took it for a month, and during that month I was so sensitive to everything.  I would get mad and be ok the next minute. It effected my mood so bad that I just spent my birthday depressed the whole day.  I am not taking these anymore.  
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	5/2/2012 9:08:20 PM	This pill was easy to use and very effective. My periods lightened and are very regular now. I'm very happy (:

I have had a great experience with this pill. I haven't gain weigh or lost weigh, regular menstrual period, light periods. No vaginal irrigation, no breast tender and a great sex life. I will recommend it.
Birth Control	Ecuteacher, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/23/2012 9:38:03 PM	I have used trinessa 28 for 3yrs and have no issues.  My face is much clearer and it regulates my periods and makes them light.  I had minor headaches within the first few months but none since then.  Birth control is different for each women so you wont know the effects until you take it.
Birth Control	wildflower_7, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/18/2012 7:12:42 PM	remember that all bodies are different when taking this medication. i've had some spotting and bleeding in between, but the awful and painful cramps are gone! i was informed by my healthcare provider that it takes 3 months for the body and hormones to adjust to the medication. have not gained weight, no mood swings, and sex-life remains unchanged. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/18/2012 4:34:41 AM	I just finished my first pack of Trinessa and so far I'm satisfied. I did feel nauseous the first week but got over it. I was also having adult acne and its clearing up! I also went up a cup size. So far so good!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	momo, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	3/11/2012 9:54:47 PM	I originally was on lo-estrin24 fe but switched to tri-nessa because of the price difference. I used to have week long, incredibly heavy and painful periods that would make me miss class. Now they're not even five days long and cramps are fine if I take a couple ibuprofen. Definitely a plus!I haven't had any problems with my sex drive and my acne is about the same, if not a little better. Overall, I love it! I don't have any insurance at all and it's only $33 a month, so it's definitely affordable. Don't be afraid to try this!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	3/9/2012 12:53:29 AM	I was on Trinessa for almost a year but went off of it for six months. Now I'm back on and taking Tri-sprintec and have been for almost a year now.Pros - Effective birth control, cleared up my acne amazingly, and made my body more &quot;womanly&quot;Cons - Moodiness, depression, irrational outbursts, menstrual cramps, longer and heavier periods, very decreased sex drive (which kinda defeats the purpose doesn't it?)I would go with something else.. but I have a feeling anything else involving hormones would effect me the same way. It's working how it's supposed to, So.. call me complacent.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/3/2012 4:36:25 PM	I actually really liked this brand of birth control. I've been on it for three years and I have no complaints at all. It completely cleared up my acne and my periods have been SO much better since I have been on it - I really did not have any side effects at all upon starting. I would definitely recommend the brand!

We all have different body types and make up, so you have to find what works for YOU. TriNessa hasn't given me any side effects since my first month. It cleared up my acne and my periods are completely normal. No weight gain or mid cycle bleeding. I get nauseous at night if I haven't eaten but that's it. My cramps aren't nearly the magnitude they were before I was on BC and overall I'm very happy with this brand! 
Birth Control	czimm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	2/25/2012 8:22:05 PM	I am half way through my first month on Trinessa, and it has been awful! I have taken bc before, but these side effects are the worst I have had. I am currently on my period, and like I said.. I am only half way through the first month.. so I should not be. And I never had irregular periods before. My cramps are much worse than before. I have had constant bloating since starting this bc. My energy level has decreased and I have mood swings like crazy. After reading all of these reviews.. I now know for sure that it isn't just me. I am done with this bc, as of now.

I have gained weight, had migraines, been nauseated, depressed/emotional, and have had no sex drive. I'm going to look into other birth controls.

I never thought my birth control would give me such horrible side effects, but it did. I have breakthrough bleeding in between periods all the time, extremely moody &amp; depressed, my sex drive is completely gone &amp; I've gained 20+ pounds! The only good thing about this pill is that it prevented pregnancy. I do not recommend this pill what so ever. &amp; I'm happy to say that I stopped it yesterday!

I thought that was normal ol'me. Before this drug I would end up in the hospital because my cramps were so bad. Now I want to get off of it in order to start trying to have a baby. I'm afraid of what it will do though, has anyone experienced the after effects of stopping bc pills? From what the reviews are saying I'm kind of excited to get off because maybe my headaches will go away and I'll stop taking things so personally. Maybe I'll lose weight faster! That would be great.

No effect on sex drive, weight (that alone is a plus!), or boob size. Skin is clear, but I didn't have major acne before. I experienced some moodiness at first and cramping/spotting first month, but since then it's been great.

I'm worried that I could be pregnant. What should I do wait and see what happens or call my doctor!!
Birth Control	C, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	1/17/2012 9:06:05 PM	I was on trinessa for 3 years. It worked as birth control (never got pregnant) but gave me terrible migraines. They started out at about 1 migraine a month, and in the year before I finally went off Trinessa, I was getting them, on average, 2-3 times a week. I finally realized that the migraines were due to the extra hormones and I went off trinessa. I have been migraine free for over 6 months. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	1/9/2012 10:55:26 AM	I have experienced SIGNIFICANT decrease in libido. Getting myself started up to have sex is more of a mental process than what it used to be, im not sure what the point of birth control is if I don't want to have sex? Currently on the search for a different birth control method.

I had very very heavy periods along with anemia. I would be absolutely miserable during the time of the month, now on the pill it last 4 days and is super light. I would recommend this birth control to anyone who needs it for heavy periods! 
Birth Control	Lalacarly, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	12/23/2011 10:49:59 AM	Within the first few days of taking this birth control I started getting really nauscious all the time. It was like I wanted to throw up, but the feeling was just there in the back of my throat, all day every day. A few days ago I missed a pill and was instructed to just take it with the next days one, but that afternoon I must have thrown up about 5 times. I know one of the side effects were nausea and vomiting, but its just ridiculous and im making an appointment to switch to another medication that wont make me this sick all the time. Also, there was a lot of vaginal sensitivity and discomfort when I peed. Overall, have not had a pleasant experience with this drug.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	12/18/2011 10:02:14 AM	I switched from Ortho Tri cyclen to Trinessa about two months ago. Within the first month my period was super heavy I spotted before and after my period. Now I am on the second month and I have had horrible cramps, extreme headaches, sleep all day, so sick to my stomach. I am sexually active so I thought I was pregnant. After taking two pregnancy tests(both coming out negative) I know that this birth control is just not for me. I consulted with my doctor and he said that I needed to give it another month but Im sure that this birth control is not for me.

I started getting really nauseous after I began taking this pill and lost my appetite. I am already tiny as it is so losing more weight was not healthy for me. Also, I have never suffered from acne but this pill caused me to break out. I'll be switching to something else once this cycle is over.
Other	gwsdoll, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	12/8/2011 11:56:24 PM	I was on this bcp before I had my 3rd child. after having her, i went back on it and i've had some really bad symptoms pop up this time. Previously, i had massive hair loss associated with it, and that's all. NOW i have horrible cramps, even MORE hair loss, longer n heavier periods. I also am on an SSRI, or anitdepressant, and the fluctuating hormone levels don't do me or my family any good. 5 out of 7 days a week i'm a major bitch. i've also lost my sex drive, i've lost the 'natural' lubrication, i'm always tired, and i have regular 'migrane' headaches. my hair and skin have become oily as well. 
Painful Periods	JessicaN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	12/4/2011 8:08:18 PM	I was on this birth control pill for 2 months. I had a pretty bad experience with it. I had terrible lower back pain everyday, I was incredibly irritable and irrational, and I started having terrible acne.  The back pain became too much and interrupted my sleep and my face looked like a 13 years old's going through puberty! I stopped taking this after 2 months.
Birth Control	lillyrose, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	12/4/2011 10:14:32 AM	I started taking TriNessa after it was prescribed by my doctor, but I will be stopping after this first cycle. I'm always tired, nauseous almost 24 hours out of the day. My appetite has increased but I won't eat because as soon as I eat the smallest thing I feel sick to my stomach and get violent abdominal cramps. My boyfriend and I were sure I was pregnant with all the symptoms...but it is just the awful side effects of the medication. Just last night I took 2 sips of ginger ale in an attempt to settle my stomach and it came right back up minutes later. I experienced weight gain and became more emotionally sensitive. I am so glad that I will be seeing my doctor Monday because the experience with this medication has not been a positive one.
Birth Control	burg, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	11/22/2011 4:49:45 PM	I just made an appointment to get OFF this drug. I've realized after looking up the side effects (prompted by my curiosity of my horrible moods) and seeing the reviews on this site that my headaches, heavy heavy periods and fits of screaming out of anger were not normal. I'm switching.

I thought my body would have gotten used to the drug after three months, but it hasnt. I tried dieting but no change what so ever in my weight. My nipples have gotten darker. but my main concern is why am i having such severe anxiety attacks a couple hours after ive taken my daily pill.. its affecting my sleep and my daily life. every month the first weeks active pills are the worst for me. Mood swings, anxiety depression. After this month im switching back to the nuva ring. despite me having to pay about 80 bucks more. But starting 2012 the affordable care act comes in to play and all insurance companies are required to cover the costs of any birth control. making it free.
Birth Control	Birdie, 19-24 Female 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	11/8/2011 4:59:20 PM	Growing up, I've never had any bad reactions to any kind of medication, so when I was put on this birth control (my first BC pill), I thought I wouldn't have any kind of unwanted reaction. Needless to say, I did, and I quickly realized (after 3 different BCs) any medication will most likely result in some kind of unwanted side effect. I am back on TriNessa after being on Necon 35 for 6 months or so. Necon 35 made me so moody and irritable--I was horrible. So, I switched back to TriNessa. It's made my skin clear again, even after a few days of being back on it. Also, my breast got a cup bigger, which isn't bad...it was just a bit uncomfortable at first because my clothes didn't fit as well (I'm a bit top-heavy to begin with, I'm only 5'0 and weighed about 100lbs. But my jeans fit so much better.) and a lot of people assumed I was pregnant. Overall, I've liked TriNessa. Some mood changes still, but it's improved a lot--Necon 35 made me a total bitch.

After taking tri-nessa (I've been on it for 6 months) my periods have been so much better. I have no cramps, and my periods only last 5 days. I have no negative side effects, and the price is great! I would reccommend it to everyone!

The first month i had more cramps than i usually do and developed moderate acne, the 2nd month my skin and scalp became extremely oily (i usually have dry skin) but that went away and my skin is back to normal. other than those first two months while my body was adjusting to the meds, i haven't had any adverse reactions

Been on for 3 weeks, waiting to see if this will clear up my cysts and regulate my period. Kinda inconvenient for the 16 year old life style though.

My acne has gotten worse and I get diarrhea shortly after taking it each day. Nothing to bad. Its had a better effect on me then ortho tri-cyclen lo, That was the worst BC I have ever taken. TriNessas proving to be good to me so far. I hope it stays that way.

Birth Control		2	3	1			10/5/2011 8:41:40 PM	I started taking trinessa for a month and it was the worst month of my life. First, it made me breakout HORRIBLY! I started to have a few breakouts before I started but it made my acne 10x worse. I also gained about 10 pounds from the first month of taking it. I felt extremely depressed, had a low sex drive and was just not myself. I don't recommend this birth control pill at all. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	10/2/2011 11:42:31 PM	I usually have really bad side affects with BC pills, such as break through bleeding all the time.  This pill has been great with hardly any spotting.  I take it at the same time every night before bed with a Vitamin C pill (500mg) because it's supposed to lower the chances of spotting.  I also skip the inactive pills to miss my &quot;period&quot;.  As far as the bad side affects go... at first the pills made me extremely moody, so I now take a B vitamin complex every morning.  I'm also a lot more hungry than I normally am.  I've gone from 103 lbs to 108 lbs in the past 2 months, but it's not a huge deal.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	9/29/2011 10:02:33 AM	I started taking Trinessa as a generic form to my old birth control.  Three months in to it, I realized that this brand was causing cramping at odd times during the month, draining me of energy and making me bloated while i was taking the &quot;active pills.&quot;  I am going to speak to my pharmacist about taking a different brand.

But, I had 3 severe side effects that really effected my quality of life.  I was exhausted all of the time, no energy ever (after I stopped taking it with in 1 week I had energy again), I had intense headaches everyday within an hour of taking Tri-Nessa, and I was very emotional.  One moment nice next moment sad then mean. It has been a month since I took this birth control and I feel like me again!! And I do not want to stay in bed and sleep all day.

First off, the pills themselves are confusing, because the white ones are not the ones for your period week...like every other pill out there. I now have the equivalent to 2 periods a month thanks to extreme spotting. My previous pill gave me shorter, lighter periods, no cramps, and a little spotting, which is why I switched. Now my period is heavy, long and crampy. And I get almost a weeks' worth of pretty heavy spotting mid-cycle. Also, if I take my pill a few hours late, I bleed the whole next day. No thanks.

I have been on this method for a year now, it is DEFINITELY time to consult the doctor.

Birth Control	rockerchick509, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	7/14/2011 7:37:39 AM	I know that everyone reacts to medications differently. I am 31 and have decided it's time to start birth control pills. I started Microgestin on a Saturday. By Tuesday I was cramping worse than my already bad period cramps, was lightly bleeding, my back hurt, nausea, and diarhea. I called the doc and she said it takes 2 to 3 months for your body to get used to, but if it got worse to call back. By Thursday I was in so much pain I couldn't even focus on anything and I missed a day and a half of work. I called the doctor again, she was afraid I was experiencing pregnancy symptoms and did a pregnancy test, and I was not pregnant. She then prescribed a TriNessa, which I was afraid to take until the cramping went away. Which was 5 days. I'm going on my third day and I have felt like I'm going to throw up 2 mornings in a row. Had the dry heaves. No cramps as of yet though. Anyone got any advice? I'm also bipolar and I noticed that I was much more emotionally sensitive on the microgestin, like touching commercials or news stories would get me really choked up, and I would get it in my head that my boyfriend was mad at me or doing something to hurt me. I knew it was time to end that medication. I wish anyone using it the best of luck and hopefully it works better for you than me!

I noticed a considerable decrease in my acne and didn't have any weight gain. My periods were still long (but lighter). When I hit month #4 that all changed. I became really moody (not like me at all) wanted to cry or was mad a lot. I also had some dizziness and seem to be tired more often than not. I never had issues with cramps before but experienced some really bad ones the last couple of months. Like other reviewers I definitely experienced the change in libido and not better. The clincher came this month when my period lasted 2 weeks. If things would have stayed the way they were the first few months than I wouldn't be changing. My dr reccomended I try Natazia so we'll see how that goes. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Cait, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	4/25/2011 1:04:40 PM	The only reason I'm taking BC is to regulate my periods because I've always had an irregular period with heavy bleeding.  This is my first time taking a BC and I'm not too terribly impressed with it so far.  Mostly its the tiredness, nausea and stabbing pains in my abdomen that get to me. I'll wait it out until my re-evaluation with my doctor in a couple of months, so I can give my body a chance to adjust to the hormones.  If things haven't improved by then, I don't think I will be taking thia or any BC pill ...its just not worth it to me, especially since my goal is not to prevent pregnancy.I'll comment again if things have improved.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	2	2	Female	19-24	4/12/2011 12:05:22 AM	I have been taking this for about a year now. it worked good at first, it got rid of my acne. Over time though, I gained 15 pounds and I had severe mood swings, low sex drive, but it did regulate my periods and increase my breast size. I am stopping it and going to see what other birth controls there are out there.
Birth Control	BrittMadeline08, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	4/10/2011 1:58:22 PM	After reading reviews on this Birth Control I was terrified to try it, but I convinced myself to do it, and I am thankful that I did. Everyone will react differently to every medication, so you need to try it out for yourself. Not only does this medication keep me from getting pregnant, it cleared up my acne, and even increased my breast size so that I fill out my bra fully. I only had slight dizziness and nausea within the first couple of days of the first pack, but taking it with food seemed to help. I did not have any bad mood swings or loss of sex drive. I am completely satisfied with the whole product and the cost of it. I would recommend that everyone give it a shot. Everyone will get different effects :)

Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	3/13/2011 9:00:04 PM	I thought I was going crazy, I'm so glad to see I'm not alone here but sorry that any of us has had to experiance this.  I just finished my first month to &quot;regulate my period&quot;. But if I can't control my mood swings, no one is going to want to be near me long enough for that to matter.  Weight gain - at least 10 pounds in one month.  Sometimes I feel like I'm under water.  My breasts are tender and larger than they were last month my pants are not tight at the waist, but too tight in the abdomen.  I'm tired all day.  I can't concentrate on anything.  I have no energy and have lost my desire to do just about anything.  I'm off this pill today IDK when my period is coming.  I want my life back.
Birth Control	pherbe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	3/4/2011 6:24:32 PM	I was on this for about 6 months and noticed that I quickly became a very irritated person. Someone who is quick to give grace became a nitpicker and anoyed all the time. Not great for the relationship. Also any months i had any level of stress my emotional stability basically disappeared and I had wild mood swings. There were a few months where nausea/dizziness/exhaustion made me fear pregnancy, but it wasn't. I do NOT like this brand for me. My doc said it might be that the varying levels of hormones were setting me off. I'm trying Sronx.. though I've ready some bad reviews of that too. We'll see.
Acne	forrestgump, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	2/21/2011 5:03:47 PM	I have been taking this BC for 1.5 years and it's okay.  It cleared up my mild acne and lessened cramping. However, I can now predict, to the day, if I will be mad/sad from PMS.  If I have 4 or 3 pills left, I will get incredibly mad about whatever minor irritation is thrown my way.  If I have 2 or 1 pills left, I know I'll cry even at a sad commercial. I have never had mood swings from PMS so it is a little frustrating but overall the pill does what it's intended to do.
Birth Control	guest25, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/9/2011 6:05:31 AM	I hope no one takes these reviews seriously. Everyone is going to respond differently to this pill. Just because someone has awful side effects does not mean you will. Take me for instance...the only side effects I have had is 1 day of nausea, some mild moodiness, and slight breast tenderness. I am through my first pack of pills...and you have to understand that the side effects you are having will almost always go away after a few months. Your body is responding to the change in hormones. You can look up reviews for any kind of birth control and find all kinds of negative things but you will also find reviews of people who are satisfied. And thats because all of our bodies are different. You can constantly be switching brands and never be satisfied or you can ride it out with one kind for a few months and let your body adjust.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	13-18	1/26/2011 9:34:07 PM	i started taking trinessa when i was 14 and kept taking it for 2 years and never had a problem other then i was  young and didnt always take my pill when i was supposed to but still no side effects.. when i was 16 i decided to switch to the patch, it was easier for me, but when i was about 18 1/2 i had a horriable skin reaction to the adhesive they used, which has left me with scars. after i stopped using those my doctor perscribed me Tri lo Sprintec which i took for a month and picked up the next months to learn that she changed me to Tri-nessa again and im not even through my first week and i already want to stop! my boyfriend and i have been together for 6 months and every little talk we have i cry even when were not fighting.. (mood swings!) I get nausea every morning (i take it at noon) and it lasts all day and night.. and nothing tastes good!i get headachs but never like this.. and they have never made me dizzy before! i havent had a period on tri-nessa this round but i honestly dont wanna wait and find out. im calling my doctor tomorrow and try to get back on tri lo Sprintec it didnt seem to do this to me. i would NOT recomend this for anyone!

To start off the first few months were kind of rough i was nauseated a lot, my mood changed and my acne got worse, but as my body adjusted my acne has cleared im no longer nauseated but im still moody, this pill worked great for me even if i missed one or two or took with antibiotics (should always use a back up method, but i didn't) i still didn't get pregnant and it has also made my periods shorter, lighter, and almost no cramping!!!!!!!!

I was so nausea all the time for the first three months, by August I was experiencing severe dizziness and vertigo that would come in the morning and last all day. After my husband and I got married in June, i thought something was wrong with me because i didn't want to have sex. After seeing many Drs.. and having many expensive tests, I decided to go off the pill. Within a month the dizziness became significantly less. I have become myself again.  It happened so slowly, i hardly realized, but while on the pill I became exceptionally irritable and not myself. In the end I decided it was better to use condoms (and want to be with my husband) than be someone I am not. Hormonal birth control did not work for me and I highly suggest using another non-hormonal birth control. 
Birth Control	haileyaddy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	1/5/2011 7:09:52 PM	I started taking TriNessa a month ago after being off the pill over 3 yrs. This is by far the worst pill I've ever been on. The whole month of Dec I was bleeding-stopped the last few days of the month and started back up again-and hadnt had this much pain since I had my kids. I've been extreamly moody, emotional, breaking out, nauseous, bloated, tired  all the time,no desire to do anything and itchy skin.  People around me have noticed my change in mood-I've stopped taking this pill two days ago-I hope I'll start feeling better soon. I'm glad I came on here and saw that it isnt just me that has had such bad side effect from this BC-I would not recommend this pill to anyone.

Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	3	Female	25-34	12/20/2010 10:27:25 AM	Ok I'm almost done my first pack of TriNessa, I was put on this BC pill because all of a sudden I started getting cystic acne. I was put on Ortho Tri Cycline when I first started getting my period for painful menstration, it did it's job my only side effect was nausea. Now I'm 28 &amp; starting back up on BC pills. I haven't had any cystic breakouts &amp; hope it stays that way, I have noticed small pimples but not a lot. The bad part about this BC pill for me is nausea, chest pain, headaches more frequently, vaginal irritation/yeast infection, and bloating like crazy. All of these side effects off &amp; on since the second day of use. I haven't had my period yet so idk how it will wrk for that yet. I hope &amp; pray it gets better I'm gonna keep using this BC pill so my body can get use to it but idk for how long.

It worked to regulate my periods and I am still on it 6 years later. I tried other brand once or twice but had awful side effects. Trinessa is the only brand that has worked for me.

I have been on Trinessa for 3 years now. Since I started I have gained 50lbs over those three years, lost motivation for nearly everything, am constantly tired, and always craving food. My mom suggested to me that I should stop the pill to see if I will feel better, I took my last pill yesterday and am desperately hoping to get my life (and body) back! I don't think every woman will have problems like mine, but I definitely know that I'm not the only one. I think every woman's body will react to this differently, I was just one of the unlucky ones.
Birth Control	Big Fan,  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5			12/7/2010 10:21:14 PM	I have been taking Trinessa for 6 years.  I have had no bad side effects and no weight gain.  It has been very successful in preventing pregnancy and has made my periods way shorter and lighter! It also did wonders for my skin. I would suggest this to friends.  Obviously everyone's body will react differently but I suggest using it for a few months and giving your body time to adjust &amp; accept it before ruling it out.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	lpat, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/6/2010 9:58:27 PM	I originally started taking TriNessa at 20 years old due to abnormal periods.  Within 3 months, my periods were regulated and my moods were back to normal.  I lost weight while still having an appetite, no longer have crazy PMS mood swings, and my periods are only 4 days long.  Now that I am 22, married, and sexually active, I rely on it for birth control.  I have yet to become pregnant on this pill, and it in no way has decreased my sex drive or ability to produce natural lubricant.  Obviously everyone reacts differently to birth controls, but I would definitely recommend that you give it a shot!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	11/30/2010 4:17:22 PM	I've been on TriNessa for the past 2 months and I am not feeling like myself. I am always tired and sleepy. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. I am glad I am not alone. I thought it was just me. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	11/30/2010 3:29:25 PM	I waa taking Tri-Clyn lo but my insurance didnt cover it anymore so my docter switched me over to trinessa, it has worked as well as my previous birth control and i am satisfied. i gained a little weight but nothing major and i have had very little mood swings.it works really good
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/29/2010 8:35:33 PM	I have been taking this BC since I was 18 after I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis my medications for this, made me have my period every other week and caused horrible acne. I began taking Trinessa and within a couple of weeks my acne was gone, and it regulated my period, also making it much lighter and it will only last three or four days which is great. I am now 22 and this pill has worked great for me. No weight gain, nausea, or really any mood changes. This pill also also done it's job of me not getting pregnant as well.
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		11/26/2010 2:44:08 PM	I was on the patch for 4 years but it got way to expenisve so I switched to trinessa. I've only been on it a week and a half but the only thing I have to complain about is it makes me feel sick after taking it. It has cleared up my acne already. I just take mine at night to try to sleep through the nausea.
Birth Control	koberth, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	11/23/2010 11:34:19 AM	When I recently moved towns, my local pharmacy switched me from Triprevefem to the generic Trinessa. I had been taking Triprevefem for a few years without any problems.Within the first month Trinessa, these very odd pimple/sores showed up all over my legs. They itched in the shower, turned into blisters, and wouldn't go away. I wasn't on any other medication and it didn't seem like a usual rash. I did not miss a pill once, but towards the end of the month my period came three days early. I was concerned that Trinessa may not be a high enough dose, but I decided to take it for a second month to see if my body just needed to adjust.In the second month, I had side effects that I was CERTAIN were pregnancy symptoms. After the first week, I started having unusual menstrual-like and low abdominal cramps, indigestion and bloating, heartburn that did not go away. I felt as if I had gained 10 pounds, and I have a petite build. My breasts went up at least a cup size. I was dizzy and exhausted with intense headaches despite getting plenty of rest. I knew pregnancy was a miniscule possibility because I had been using backup methods without fail, but I was so, so worried. Luckily, my period came a few days late at the end of the month and I immediately switched back to Triprevefem. All of the symptoms went away except enlarged breasts, which I certainly can't complaining about :) After reading similar experiences and the possibility of stroke in young women on Trinessa, the side effects and risk just weren't worth it to me. I would recommend paying more for a brand name for some piece of mind and health.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	redlox, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/20/2010 9:22:55 PM	I am just starting my second pack of this pill and unlike all the other comments, I have had no side effects so far, in fact, I bled through Ortho Tricyclin and when i started trinessa, it finally stopped.  I will continue this pill as long as there are no side effects like others.  So far so good.
Birth Control	Thoughts, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	11/16/2010 6:35:39 PM	Yes, TriNessa works great as birth control, but I became extremely emotionally sensitive (and not just during PMS)/moody while on it.  It did not help my acne, and I think actually made my acne/rosacea worse.  Once I switched to a different pill, I stopped feeling depressed and felt more like a normal person with moderate moods, not the extremes.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	11/16/2010 3:28:05 AM	This is my 2nd attempt trying this pill out because of the cheap price; I lost my insurance.  Each try was approximately 3 months long.  I have been on birth control for 10 years total to give you a history.  This pill has been the only one to cause excessive weight gain (i.e. 9 lbs in less than 3 months) and a disgusting amount of hair loss.  I went off of this pill a month ago and went cold turkey on the birth control and am still experiencing the hair loss daily.  However, I have lost 4 of those 9 lbs that I gained.  While this pill may work for some, I will NEVER take it again.  I also went into a bit of a depressive funk while on it, which I am over now thankfully : )

Birth Control	Kenzie722, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	11/3/2010 1:48:27 AM	All in all the birth control has worked and has been easy to work with my periods. BUT, I now have a low sex drive, weight gain, and am terribly moody. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	not sure , 13-18 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	10/25/2010 4:55:13 PM	ok so i have abnormallt long and very heavy periods.. i jst came back from the pharmacy and so far from what ive heard and read on the web makes me wanna take it back ...

Birth Control	Trinessahater18, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	10/24/2010 10:40:47 PM	I am about half way through my 1st pack of TriNessa and it has been pure hell. I have tingling and numbness in my hands at night. I have extreme mood swings. Other side effects I've been experiencing include nausea, loss in apetite, and loss of sex drive (including the ability to produce natural lubricant). Instead of my acne getting better, it has gotten way worse. The list could go on and on. I haven't felt like myself since I've been on it and my family and friends have noticed as well. I cannot wait to get off of it and back onto a low estrogen pill

I originally was placed on the pill to control my VERY painful pains and cramps during my periods, and to help control acne.  Eventually when I became sexually active when I was 18, the pill was also important as birth control. Never once have I ever had a :&quot;pregnancy scare&quot; while on this pill.  I have not noticed any negative effects, no excessive weight gain, or mood swings. The first few months I was on the pill, I had some spotting but after 3 months or so that stopped.  Come time for my period week, my period was a lot less painful and I had lighter bleeding as well. 
Birth Control	Jenny P, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	10/20/2010 4:05:52 PM	I'm almost mid-way through my first pack of Trinessa and have had no side effects. I'm hoping that I won't have any side effects since this is my 3rd type of birth control (I've used Ortho-Tri Cyclen Lo and Loestrin 24) and never had side effects from any of them!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/12/2010 2:53:17 PM	I've been on this pill for over 5 years now and never have had any major problems, in fact it's made my skin clearer and I haven't had any weight gain like others have mentioned.  
Birth Control	blueminisuz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	10/12/2010 8:30:10 PM	I had a couple of side effects from using Trinessa including pressure/pain in my chest, and problems for about 2 weeks straight with my contacts.  In addition, I've taken myself off Trinessa in the hopes of becoming pregnant soon.  Since taking myself off, I've experienced various instances of serious depression.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	10/8/2010 1:08:49 PM	I took Ortho-Tricyclen Lo about three or four years ago and then stopped after breaking up with my ex. ( I am 21)Now I am sexually active with my new boyfriend( We use condoms) and decided to take this because it was cheaper. It's only been almost a month on this and I have mood swings, bloating, frequent urination or the urge to urinate, vaginal discomfort, breast tenderness( although the seem a bit bigger I guess), fatigued and tired most of the time and pelvic discomfort.( Never been pregnant so I don't know what that feels like) I had no problems on Ortho-Tricyclen Lo but I am assuming because I was off birth control for a whole year and a half my body isn't used to it.( Thinking about getting a pregnancy test just to be on the safe side) So far I would not recommend this medication to anyone.
Birth Control	Pam cakes, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	10/6/2010 11:03:33 AM	I looked up the reviews to see if i was having a bad reaction to trinessa,after reading this I know I am! I am not depressed I have anxiety all of a sudden I use to love my job and now I want to quit everyday! I feel sooo tired all the time, I feel like Im going to stroke out and my body aches all over! I am only 20 years old I should not feel this way( A drowsy foggy mess!)  
Birth Control	aehoke, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	10/2/2010 8:15:16 PM	I have been taking Tri-Nessa for 3 months and have gone from a relatively happy newlywed to an emotional mess.  I am constantly moody and I have experienced horrible depression.  At first I thought it was just me but after reading the reviews of this drug it is comforting to know that I am not alone.  I will be switching to Ortho try cyclin and hope that things start to change.  
Birth Control	mel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/30/2010 2:29:23 PM	I have been taking this medication for 1 month and haven't had any problems. I'm satisfied with this pill and it does it's job...simple enough.
Birth Control	stratton160, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/28/2010 2:36:56 PM	I took this medication for about one and a half months.  I hated it!  I actually stopped taking it mid way through my pack because of all the problems I was having.  I was very moody, emotional mess, my face was breaking out daily, and I could not wear my clothes because of the weight gain.  I called my pharmacist and she told me to stop taking it and she would order my the brand name ortho tri cyclin. I stopped taking it that day and of course started my period and the Sunday after my period I started taking ortho tri cyclin, which was about 2 weeks ago and I feel great.  My face is clear and my clothes fit again. Remember when switching birth control this way you need to have a back up for birth control for a least 4-6 weeks.  It is amazing how much a medication can screw you up.  I do have to pay $25.00 more a month, but i would pay $100.00 more to not feel the way I did.  I hope this helps anyone who is experiencing these problems on this medication.  Don't hesitate to talk to your pharmasist or doctor about problems you have with TriNessa, it saved me.    
Acne	Jenna_lady72205, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	9/26/2010 7:36:10 PM	Today is my third day of taking TriNessa and my fiance and I both noticed a huge mood change on my first day! He says on a scale 1 to 10... I was a 10 and am now a 1. (Completed Bitch to Not a Bitch). He would literally spend all his time in the garage while I am on my period but the last 3 days he has been camping in with me! I started taking it for acne... I think its too soon to see any changes yet but I am hoping for the better. I really dont want to gain any weight but I can deal with a pound or 2 just for the acne and mood controls. I do feel nausous when I take it and last night I did get really bad cramps but its hard to say its from the medicine (I always got cramps with the medicine) The nausous feeling and cramps do not last that long. Info packets say that it will cause nausous/upset stomaches for the first 3 months until your body is used to it. Im hanging in there and will continue to take it unless something drastically changes. I will keep you gals posted. Good Luck!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	8/23/2010 12:00:51 AM	The only thing I dont like is the mood swings!
Birth Control	blah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	1	Female	25-34	8/16/2010 2:22:08 PM	After only 7 days of using this pill, I'm done! I just got done breast feeding and needed a stronger BC. Ever since I've been on it, I've been nauseated everyday and have gained 3 pounds in a week even though I'm eating less. Also I'm very moody. I'm done!
Other	ali, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	13-18	8/11/2010 4:50:46 PM	I have only been on this birth control for about a month now and I honestly dont like It at all! The doctor warned me about mood swings and I thought I wouldn't get this side effect, boy was I wrong! I have been so moody! I honestly am surprised my boyfriend Is still with me. I am generally a very nice person and for me to act like this even bugs me because my mood swings not only affect people around me but also myself but I truly can't control how my emotions are . I have a doctors appointment in two months to see how its going with trinessa. And I am going to get off of it! Another side affect I got was that my ovaries hurt very bad every now and then like for example I will sneeze or do another type of muscle contraction  and I have this Sharp shooting pain that really makes me think something Is wrong but Im going back soon to the doctors and will for sure tell her everything that has been going on. I got on trinessa to regulate my period and It has done that but cramping hasn't got any better and the whole ovaries thing I'm sure is not right. So personally try it but if you ever have any of these sympotms I would get off of It.

The first three months were horrible, I barfed A LOt. My doctor told me it was because I am petite and it was my first birth control. So far I have had no negative side effects. I gained a little bit of breast and my skin cleared up. I have had very light short lived periods since taking it, rarely do I have cramps.

Birth Control	Sunni, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	7/16/2010 7:51:00 PM	I have taken other birth control pills and sometimes had mood problems, but with my doctor we have always found a good fit. I had an IUD for 4 yra and had it removed so I could dictate when I was ready for another child (easier anyway). After 1 pack and 12 days I ended up in the hospital with a pulmonary embolism. I have no other history or risk factors (don't smoke, under 35 etc.) The doctors and I agree it was PROBABLY birth control pills, but I guess we can't prove it. It did it's job, keeping me from getting pregnant, but now I am on blood thinners which keep me from having a successful pregnancy possibly for the rest of my life. I am not trying to accuse just yet, but I'd say based on the other reviews, really consider if it's worth it to take this particular pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	7/10/2010 9:58:27 PM	I absolutely hate taking this. I have been severely moody, and get upset over the most obscure things.  I am breaking out more than usual and have had an extremely hard time losing weight. The excess weight will not come off even though I have altered my diet and exercise much more.  I am only on this because my other birth control is unavailable.
Painful Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	13-18	7/9/2010 5:20:36 PM	I went to my doctor and told her I would like to be put on an oral contraceptive for painful menstrual cramps, and to be protected. She recommended TriNessa for me, and I started over a month ago. I must say the good outweigh the bad, I'm pleasantly surprised. My periods are more regular, my cramps aren't nearly as bad as they were before. My breasts have gotten bigger as well. Not only that, but it's cheap and simple to use. If you're skeptical about this brand because of all the other stories, I say give it a try, because every women reacts differently to different brands of birth control. My only negatives are that when I first started, I was a bit nauseous, but that went away quickly, and my breasts were tender for awhile.

So, my doctor put me on trinessa about a year ago and now I wish I had never started it. I am constantly moody, annoyed, and blow up over nothing. I used to have perfect, clear skin and now i get pimples all the time. I also have irritation with my contacts.

I was on my period for two months with large blood clumps. I was weak and had no sexual drive of anysort. I had mood swings, weight gain, excesive hair growth, depression, an nausia. Nothing is worth the hell this pill put me thrue. I DO NOT recomend this pill. I have been going thrue my period since I was 10 and I am now 17, but my symtoms have never been this bad.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	6/29/2010 10:33:26 PM	A few months ago I had to switch to this pill because the pill I was taking is currently unavailable.  I have never had a single migraine in my life until I started taking this pill.  I have had more migraines and headaches than I can count.  I experience nausea at the beginning of each new pack.  I seem to be more moody and have a decreased sex drive.  I have longer, heavier, more painful periods than I have ever had in my life.  I wake up from painful cramps; something I had never before experienced.  I am planning on checking in with my doctor to see if my old pill is available yet.   
Birth Control	MamaK313, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/22/2010 5:36:51 PM	I switched to Tri-Nessa because I didn't want to have to start paying $55 a month for birth control if I had stayed on Ortho-Tri-Cyclen Lo. I just started my second packet yesterday and so far I'm not very happy with what's going on. My cramps have typically only lasted the first 2-3 days of my period. Today is day five and I am still in pain. Getting kinda old already and making me think I need to find another pill. :-(
Acne		1	1	1			6/17/2010 7:40:16 AM	I really need someones opinion. Ive had the worst acne of my life for about 4 months now. ive been on every acne medication you can think of. I just stopped my first pack or (lo-estrin 24) cause of the side effects. I wanted to go on ortho but they gave me this instead. After reading all the reviews im discouraged to start it. Should i just wait it out for the ortho?
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	6/15/2010 3:06:23 AM	I have been on this BC pill for three weeks now. This is the worst birth control pill I have ever taken. I have PCOS so my doctor prescribed me Trinessa to regulate my period. Three days after I was on the pill I got my period back. That period lasted 15 days. My face is breaking out with acne and I am extremely moody. Thankfully I haven't had any worse side effects. But the 15 day long period was frustrating to say the least and the acne and moodiness are very new to me. When I go back to my doctor next month I will be DEMANDING to switch to a different BC. Based on my experience, I definitely do NOT recommend this pill to anyone. 
Birth Control	busyang3l, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	6/14/2010 7:13:06 PM	I've been on this pill for a week and few days... So far everything was running smoothly... no cramps which is my main concern... no acne outbreaks.. or spotting but the one thing that caught me off guard was my emotional imbalance... i started to over react to things and get so emotional over it that it's resulting to me being a total bitch for the smallest thing!! This happens to me when i'm PMsing but not when a week 1/2 shy of being on my pill!! i want to switch but maybe i should wait it out to see if it's just my body getting used to the new pills.
Acne	Megan, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	5	Female	19-24	6/13/2010 4:55:23 AM	I gave trinessa one star for effectiveness only because I'm just starting (1 mo. 3 weeks) and it hasn't had enough time to work on clearing my acne yet. Most oral treatments for acne generally take a while to work, so I'm not suprised or let down. Trinessa is the first bc pill I've ever taken, and so far I like it. Before I started taking it I had severe moodswings, during which I would stoop to levels of deep depression. The first two times I took the pill, I was very emotional, but ever since, Ive felt better than I have in years! I'm happy again. I am experiencing worse acne at this point, but I'm going to wait a few months and see. It's kind of sad, because I'm getting scars and a few painful cyst pimples, which I had been successfully avoiding while on minocycline for the past 2 years. But with the initial breakouts caused by trinessa, all of the prevention kinda went out the window. Oh well- everyone's got problems- if a few scars are a trade for emotional stability- I'm all for it.  
Birth Control	Newbie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	6/12/2010 2:39:13 AM	This is my first BC and it was recommended to me by my doctor (and seeing how everyone says its cheap, I'm guessing that's why she put me on it). I'm torn between liking it and wanting to switch, but since its my first BC and I'm only on the third month, I want to wait a while to see if I will ever adjust to it. Pros- no pregnancy, breast size increase, no yeast infections, no weight gain and cheap. Cons-VERY low sex drive, depression and mood swings to the point of where I'm crying during sex b/c I can't get aroused, if not taken with food I get nauseous and have fainted twice and needed smelling salts to be revived, and mild acne. As of now, I'm sticking with it because the good does outweigh the bad, but if I faint again I will switch. 
Birth Control	Nicole, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	6/9/2010 12:18:52 AM	I switched insurances and was offered Trinessa. I thought it would be the same as Tri-sprintec. I have never had an issue with a BC before, but after 3 weeks I broke out really bad all over my face. I also noticed irritation with my contacts. I also just started breakthrough bleeding. My skin is so bad that I am stopping today. I will not take another pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	6/2/2010 10:50:49 PM	The first week I started taking it I pretty much turned into a nut case, I started getting horrible mood swings and depression with suicidal thoughts! I would not recommend this to anyone!! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/21/2010 2:28:09 AM	It's effective at preventing pregnancy just like any other pill... but I had such a bad experience with this pill I will never take hormonal birth control ever again. I had insane mood swings, crying all the time, sometimes really bad depression with suicidal thoughts. Not worth it! About a week after I stopped taking it my horrible moodiness symptoms started clearing up and I'm perfectly sane again :) 
Birth Control	marilyn03, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	5/6/2010 1:31:16 AM	I started taking Tri-Nessa about a month ago when my other pill was no longer available. The first few days I didn't notice much of a change, but as the weeks progressed I noticed some mild and severe side effects.First of all I started having mood swings, and not just the &quot;oh I'm on my period&quot; or &quot;I have PMS moodswings&quot; these were different, and definitely not something I enjoy dealing with.Also, I noticed my skin started to break out more than usual (I breakout from time to time, but my breakouts definitely worsened and have been uncontrollable).Furthermore, I have seen a severe drop in my libido. It usually fluctuates throuough my cycle, but the entire month I have been on Tri-Nessa my sex drive has been at almost a zero! Somewhat defeats the purpose of the birth control for me. I have not experienced headaches and the pill has been an effective form of birth control, but I will definitely be seeing my doctor to get a different perscription.

When I first started taking it, years ago, I did gain 5 pounds though.  I myself had less mood swings and cramping while taking it.  Other than that, I had no other bad side effects of it.  I know everyone is different but I had no problems taking it.  I did notice my cup size for my bra did increase, not always a bad thing for me since I'm not big busted anyway.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	4/18/2010 1:23:58 AM	I have been on this for one week and it has made me super nauseous, I would not recommend it.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Happy with tri-sprintec, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	4/13/2010 4:49:04 PM	I began taking Tri-nessa in July, 2007 when I moved to a new city and the pharmacy didnt carry Tri-sprintec.  I really didnt think much of the change because I figured they were both generic forms of ortho tricyclen.  Boy, was I wrong to think it wouldnt make a difference!  After a few months on tri-nessa I began getting very irritable, almost irrational on a regular basis.  The smallest thing would set me off.  I also began experiencing horrible anxiety. To top it off, I lost my sex drive.  I went from having a very healthy sexual appetite to nothing at all.  I began to think that it was just hormonal changes that you go through when growing up.  I had just turned 23 when I switched to trinessa, so I figured this was me growing out of my young-adult stage and into adulthood.  When I went to my annual exam over a year later, the topic of my lack of sex drive and anxiety came up.  The doctor then asked me if I was having mood swings.  She also asked if I was having frequent headaches and I told her I was.  She said that we needed to switch me back to Tri-sprintec.  She wrote me a prescription for Tri-sprintec specifically.  The pharmacy didnt have any initially, but they apparently were willing to order some for me since it was SPECIFICALLY prescribed to me by my doctor.  After just one month on Tri-sprintec my mood stabilized and my sex drive was back in full force.  I never knew a drug could have this big of side effects, but I am here to say that if you have any problems on Tri-Nessa, please speak with your doctor! I spent more than a year of my life thinking I was going to grow into an old crazy lady, and little did I know that all I had to do was stop taking a pill. 
Birth Control	 Ms Lady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	3/31/2010 10:50:59 AM	This is my first time taking a bc pill,I tried the Depo shot, but stopped that after heavy bleeding for longer than normal.  I had my child in December, and started taking the trinessa in March. So far my period lasted the normal 5-days, and as soon as i started the bc, i have had breakthrough bleeding for over 3wks now,and my stomache has been cramping really bad for this whole week, and headaches, after reading some reviews,I realized its time to put this pill back on the shelf, and go see my doctor. I would not recommend this to anyone.
Birth Control	CathyBMiami, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/17/2010 8:23:40 AM	I have been on Ortho Tri Cyclen for about 7 years without a problem. I recently switched insurance carriers and decided to try Trinessa because of the $$ factor. I heard soooo many horror stories that I was terrified but decided to go for it. i am now on my 3rd month and am thrilled to say that it was BETTER for me than Ortho Tri cyclen. Less mood swings, less headaches..the only thing was a heavier flow on my heavy days (2 days out of the cycle). I am not switching back.
Birth Control	clifford, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/13/2010 4:14:53 AM	I've been on trinessa since september and it is now march, so about 6 months and i absolutely love it. I'm surprised reading all of these reviews. I am 19 and I initially wanted to go on birth control because my periods were so irregular and i wanted to start having sex but i didn't want to without birth control. so i went on it and now my periods are more regular and it has prevented pregnancy very well for me!(we usually don't use condoms, but he always pulls out and I haven't had any pregnancy scares). I didn't have much acne before but my skin is more clear now and i didn't gain any weight at all, and its my freshman year of college so you would expect me to have gained weight esp. from birth control, but i didn't. I never had any bleeding in between periods and i didn't experience any mood swings. It also made my boobs bigger so as you can see I have had a very positive experience with Trinessa. Birth control works differently with every persons body so i wouldn't rule out this birth control because of these other reviews because its worked great for me, and its cheap and very effective!
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Girly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	3/8/2010 12:51:13 PM	I decided to get a home delivery and they substituted my Tri Sprintec (generic form of Ortho) with this.  I have gotten a nice little cluster of zits on my chin, and gained about 5lbs in one month.  Needless to say, I am going back to my Tri Sprintec.
Other	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	3/6/2010 2:38:57 AM	I have only been on trinessa for about 3/4 of a month.  i have noticed heavy discharge, weight gain and a huge increase to my sex drive.  overall i would recommend this pill because just about every birth control makes you gain a little weight and it totally boosts your sex drive through the roof!
Birth Control	mercury013, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	3/4/2010 4:50:17 PM	I have been on this BC for the last 3 months and starting having some awful side effects. At the end of the three month I had bad acne, weight gain (about 10 pounds which might just be normal), severe anxiety, panic attacks over really small things, bad nausea to where I wouldn't hardly eat, irritable, etc.. My friends would tell me I was acting depressed and wouldn't give anyone the time of day. I had problems figuring out the bubble pack (well, that may just be me..lol). My periods got reallly weird, the first month I bled for over 2 weeks, then the second month was for 3 days, and I was over a week late on the third month. I just started to feel like I was losing it. I got online on webmd and started to reading some reviews and realized that it might be my BC, and it wasn't just me. I got switched over to Ortho Tri Cyclen right away. It's been two weeks now and I feel so different, I feel back to normal. It's like a 180.

Other	lena, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	2/24/2010 4:50:42 PM	I was on Ortho tricyclin-lo for years until my insurance only wanted to pay for generics. I then swithched to tri-lo sprintec (the insurance then no longer carried it because trinessa was much more inexpensive)  I absolutely hate this medication! I havent had a yeast infection since i had my child....that was 10 years ago.  I have only been on this drug for a little over a month. I have to date had mood swings, yeast infections, and mild weight gain. I do not recomend this birth control to anyone!!!

It didn't help instead i went from a B cup to a D and there still getting bigger, thicker thighs and a huggee sex crave. I do not recommend this birth control.
Birth Control	mel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	2/16/2010 9:02:21 AM	I am very glad I decided to read the reviews and wanted to post my own.  Since starting this birth control 2 months ago I have had unusual mood swings, frequent discharge (which I never had a problem with before), and for the first time in my life had to get medication to deal with a yeast infection.  This medication is effective for preventing pregnancy but based on my experience I would not recommend this pill to anyone.
Birth Control	Jaybomme, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	2/12/2010 3:13:35 AM	I have been on Trinessa for 3 years now. As far as preventing pregnancy, it has been great. As for side effects, I experienced no signifigant weight gain, nor a reduction in sex drive. Trinessa did clear up my moderate acne and increased my breast size by a full cup, but I also started getting frequent migraines. I never had a problem with nausea as a side effect until very recently. Now for the past few months I get nauseous, and dread taking the pill. For this reason alone I may switch to another method of contraception. It was great for two and a half years, but now just the thought of taking this pill makes me gag.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	19-24	2/11/2010 2:04:40 PM	I am not able to eat a single thing without getting sick from it. I have only been on it a week and its been nothing but a nightmare. I really hope my body gets used to it. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/7/2010 10:26:19 PM	I have had a pretty positive experience with Trinessa. In the beginning I had an increase in mild acne but after a while my body got used to the medication and I had only positive side effects such as lighter periods and decreased weight.

I have severe headaches, mood swings, I am depressed alot and I start having bleeding starting the second week. How am I suppose to have a sex life if I am bleeding 3 weeks out of the month. I take the pill the same time every day but I still have issues with cramps and bleeding it is so aggrevating. I get upset because I feel like these doctors don't listen when you go to them with the issue. I have been looking for alternates because everytime I go to my doctor she asks me what I want to be on, is that right, she should know.I am glad I found these comments now I realize I am not the only one. I will be calling her tomorrow to make an appointment, I need to get off of this pill right now.

I was on tri lo sprintec, untill my insurance found out that this was cheaper. Even though it is affordable it doesn't work for me at all. I have always been a little moody, but when I started taking this medicine my moods where all over the place. Severly depressed, nausea, and anger plague me now at random. My boyfriend never know what the next 5 minutes is going to bring. I am not going to continue using this birth control. But I do understand that all birth control works differently for every women's body. But for me TriNessa does not.

I am constantly depressed irritated and anxious. I was beginning to think that something was seriously wrong with me, but now that i read all these reviews I realized that i started feeling this way around the same time I started taking this birth control. Also i have really bad discharge too, and i started getting yeast infections which has never happened to me before. I'm really glad I read these reviews or i wouldn't have realized it was my birth control and not me.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	michelle19, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	12/23/2009 9:42:21 PM	I have ben taking this medication for 2 months. I was having mild side effects but still gave TriNessa a chance, I have been on Ortho Tricyclen for four years. On my second pack I began to get very dizzy, my skin is turning a yellowish tint, and I keep having sharp pains around my heart. I stopped taking my pills today for fear that I could be damaging my liver and I could be putting myself at risk of a stroke ( Iam at a healthy weight and exercise regularly) . I've never had such bad side effects with the pill before. 
Acne	asdfgg, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/20/2009 12:54:36 PM	I've been taking this for almost 2 years. When I started I noticed that I was not having mood swings, my weight stayed the same, and my overall appearance looked better. My period cycle became regular and I feel much more upbeat and happy. Although I use a little topical solution for my acne, trinessa still did a very good job without it. I have not dealt with any side effects this whole time and have continued to be satisfied. I know other friends who use this as well and are satisfied. However, there are still some people that will be in discomfort. But I do recommend this.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	12/14/2009 12:27:12 AM	I switched to TriNessa after taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for monetary reasons. I was on the pill for about 6 months and had severe yeast infections every month right before my period. It was horrible and scary because I never had trouble with yeast infections before. Also, the first month I bled for 10 days really heavy. Needless to say I switched promptly.

Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	11/20/2009 4:10:44 PM	This is the worst BC pill I have ever tried! Never had a problem before taking this Trinessa. I have had horrible headaches, nausea, and bad acne. I have snapped at times the mood swings are so bad. I will never take this again.
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	13-18	11/17/2009 8:12:49 AM	I started taking Trinessa about two or three days ago and every morning I get sick. I'm literally doubled over in pain from it. It is my first time taking the 'pill' but I really don't like it so far.
Painful Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	13-18	11/11/2009 9:15:38 PM	The main reason I'm taking this pill is that I couldn't bare the painful experience of my period. I can't do school or work the first (and sometimes second) day, and am instead as close to the toilet (due to extreme vomitting and diahrea) as possible. So far, this pill has decreased my pain and definately diahrea noticably and I am very happy. Sure, I've gained a couple pounds and my acne seems to be a little worse, but it does the main purpose and seems to control my moods somewhat. 
Birth Control	Eugina30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	11/11/2009 12:13:44 PM	I wanted to start back taking birth control so I asked my Dr to give me Ortho Tricyclen but the pharmacy gave me the generic Trinessa for insurance purposes. i had no side effects with Ortho tricyclen loved it but with Trinessa the worse experience. I had sore breast, and bad mood swings one minute I was happy and then sad. The worst part is I bleed on the pill for 2 1/2 weeks heavy. I switched to Kariva and everything is back to normally. I would not recommend Trinessa to anyone from my experience.
Birth Control	Ash., 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	11/8/2009 7:12:48 PM	With Trinessa, I did not get pregnant, but had horribable mood swings; from SI to being fine (within less than a 24hr period). I started to get blurred vision (and could not drive at night) and migrains (so bad I had to put my hand over my eyes when walking outside).  I hated this medication. It was very affordable but I asked to be put back on Kariva.  I would not recommend this medication to anyone.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	13-18	10/15/2009 2:30:45 PM	ive been trying out different birth controls for the past two years, they all seem to upset my stomach, because i dont eat very heavy, even if i do it still makes me feel nausea. Trinessa has however made my sex drive unbelievably high, like im not even on the pill at all! sometimes too high actually. and it hasnt affected my periods at all, it actually made them lighter. im starting to see maybe it will cause yeast infections, but i hope not. 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	azieli02, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	10/5/2009 4:42:20 AM	After reading all of these reviews I have realized why I HATE this medication. I have been taking it for about 2.5 years now. I originally got on it to level out my periods because I was only having one every 6-9 months. It has helped me have a period every month but it has also made my sex drive almost non-existent. My periods are no lighter than they were before and my cramps are worse. I am bi-polar so I know when something is wrong with my mood and it's been way worse since taking this medicine. I definitely need to speak with my doctor about getting off this medication. I do NOT recommend!

It was very effective in preventing pregnancy, and hey I didn't mind going up a cup size. I never really gained weight either. But honestly I would have rather switched to something else. I'm usually a very laid back happy person but once I started taking this pill I was constantly on edge. Or crying. Or depressed. Or snapping at my boyfriend over stupid things. Did nothing to help make my periods lighter/shorter. I finally ran out recently and I feel like my old self again. I'll enjoy this break before I go back to planned parenthood for something different. (and yes, I still have my man ;) ) 
Birth Control	dixievalkyrie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/22/2009 11:22:05 AM	I started out a couple years ago taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo which I was ok with, except the pills hurt my fingers to push out of the pack the plastic bubbles are way too strong. I was switched to trinessa because I can get it at the grocery store on their generics list without insurance. I have had absolutely no issue with this medicine-it does the job, never got pregnant on it, and in fact I like it more because my periods are hugely lighter and less messy and are shorter than when I was on previous birth control by 2 days (now it's only from Wednesday to Saturday). So in summary, it's effective, convenient and cheap to obtain-I recommend this to anyone.
Acne		5	4	4			9/18/2009 1:30:44 AM	i have been on this BC for about 2 years. i tried lots of other things before that made my face break out HORRIBLY. this one is great and i have found out i NEVER break out when i combine this BC and put the walgreens brand acne cream on my face (a small tube that is generic for a 10% salicylic acid made by clean &amp; clear) i noticed i gained about 10 pounds over the last 2 years but cant really attribute it to the BC, but my breast have gotten bigger which is  a plus. It is effective, no preg scares. and i always know which day of the month i am getting my period, it is the same every time which is soo helpful! i also do not take the inactive pills, i would recommend this Bc but its definately different for everyone!

I cannot complain!! I would recommend it to my friends. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/14/2009 11:41:14 PM	This has been the most awful experience of my life.  About 5 days after I started taking this pill I started experiencing severe nausea.  So much to the point I would vomit and cry because the nausea is so bad.  I would never recommend this pill to anyone and am so grateful for the reviews posted thus far.  Now I know that this is why I'm feeling bad.  
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	8/28/2009 9:45:38 PM	This pill made my 14 year old daughter vomit again and again, we thought she had a stomach bug. Very severe nausea and vommiting. I do not recommend it!
Birth Control	boymama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	9/11/2009 8:45:41 AM	Worst birth control experience ever!  When I took it at night I woke up in the morning with a pounding headache.  Taken in the morning would result in nausea and vomiting!  I switched back to ortho-tricyclen and won't look back!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/9/2009 3:45:34 PM	I started taking this pill 3 months ago. I took the Depo shot for 2 years.  Overall I have been pleased with this pill.  I have experienced some nausea about three times a week but not too bad, I have noticed an increase in my appetite and my breasts have gotten bigger (which is a bonus). My sex drive has actually sky rocketed.  Not sure if that is because I finally hit my peak (27) or what, but I have never had a sex drive before.  I would recommend this pill as the side effects are not too bad.  You will have side effects with any pill but these are managable.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	8/20/2009 4:36:57 PM	I'm still on the first pack and im already done with this! I was on yaz for a year and a half and switched to this because it was cheaper. The first week i felt like i had food posioning. Very sick. I still get nauseous at night especially if i dont eat ALOT during the day. Gained about 5 lbs so far, bad acne on face/chest. And today ive started to get chest pain. Definatly switching back to yaz, worth the extra money!!
Birth Control	angel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	8/12/2009 12:05:16 PM	I was switched to Trinessa for about 2 years now. Its effective in preventing pregnancy and it also shortened my period. but due to some side effects, I had quit taking it which I feel much better. I know that every woman have different reaction to this bc pills but personally, I won't recommend this to anyone. I had experience headaches, mood swings, acne and being short tempered. My vaginal white discharge became stronger that I need to use pantyliners all the time.  I'm still young and active but my sex drive became low. I've never had experience yeast infection before but when I started taking Trinessa, I started having it. It also afffected my eyes, at first I didn't realize that this bc pills is causing my eyes to feel like its irritated but now that I quit taking it, my eyes are lot better than it was.  I don't want to take this anymore because it affects my body.  This are the main reason why I stop this. I just wanted to live a healthy life. 
Acne	tinydancer68, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	13-18	8/5/2009 6:22:00 PM	I started on TriNessa a month ago today on the first day of my period.  I started taking it for my acne.  This is the first time I've ever been on the pill, but I had the worst side effects. The second day of taking the pill, I woke up around 8 in the morning feeling extremely nauseous and I eventually vomited. Even though they say once u vomit u feel better but that wasn't the case.  I was constantly nauseous for about a week and 1/2 straight, but didn't vomit again.  Finally that subsided but then I got severe cramps and my breasts were Extremely tender.  I also kept bleeding as if I was still on, and that finally subsided after my period stopped 3 days ago. Now I'm having constant headaches, fatigue, and craving food like crazy (mostly sweets) and it won't go away.  I've had mood swings here and there, but it hasn't been so bad. Though, my acne has actually gotten a little worse than before. I'm going to start the second pack here tomorrow, and if the same side effects happen again, I'm switching.  Everyone is different but so far this pill has been quite hellish for me.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	7/19/2009 10:11:58 AM	I switched to trinessa nearly 4 months ago.  I've had nothing but problems  since the switch.  Severe breast tenderness, and reoccurring yeast infections, vaginal irritation, and dryness. This pill has completely interfered with my sex life.  I have no sex drive what so ever. I have stopped taking this pill, and already notice the irritations subsiding.  I would not recommend this pill.
Painful Periods	beav1279, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	7/10/2009 6:49:53 PM	I have been on BC pills for 15 years and have never had problems like I do with TriNessa. Of course, I find a pill that I love and the pharmacy doesn't carry it anymore (TriSprintec). I have nausea when I take the pill at night, I spot all the time, have random cramps, and have heavy discharge - and this is only the 2nd month I've been on it. Stay away from this pill!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	7/9/2009 10:04:13 PM	I was on Tri-Nessa. I got switched a while back to this awful generic drug. I noticed over the years I went from 150lbs &quot;and I'm 5'11&quot; to 197lbs. I'm now 21 years old. I thought it was possibly in my head. But the cravings were so bad. I would always be hungry all the time. And I would constantly feel angry, depressed, and fatigued. My anxiety was at an all time high. I would get my period twice in one month. I would be 3 days late every time. My acne, did not improve at all. I also experienced white discharge from both breasts. I had a horrible sex drive. I had trouble getting an orgasm. And I also experienced oddly fluctuating high blood pressure. Now, I'm off of the pill completely. I am just using condoms. I feel a lot better so far. My hunger is gone. I don't have painful food cravings at all hours of the day anymore. And my sex drive is good. My acne is mild like before though, so I will have to go to the dermatologist. I'm just waiting to see how my next menstrual cycle will be. I do not recommend this birth control pill to anyone. 
Birth Control	lepidium, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/9/2009 2:55:30 PM	Since starting on TriNessa 4 months ago, I have gradually started experiencing several side effects.  I immediately started having severe breast tenderness and moodiness, and over time I have developed absolutely no sex drive, I'm irritable and don't ever want to be touched, my contacts irritate my eyes (I never imagined this could be a side effect of a birth control pill), I've started having serious cramps, and I have felt very depressed and short-tempered.  I would not recommend this pill.  I used to take Tri-Sprintec and found that to be a much better generic version of OTC...will be demanding to switch back ASAP.
Birth Control	thatstighhht, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	13-18	7/6/2009 8:51:50 PM	- given me terrible sunspots- vomited the first month of taking it- feel ill at the first of every new pack
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	6/30/2009 3:11:07 PM	I have been on some form of birth control for over 10 years. Ive been using trinessa for probably 6 of those years. I thought I didnt have any problems with it until I read this! I have terrible mood swings, lots of discharge, so much that I have to wear a panty liner everyday, and horrible migraines. Im not sure of weight gain because I workout everyday, but I know I havent lost any weight despite my workouts. I have absolutely NO sex drive what so ever. I mean none. The thought of sex is a turn off to me. I just went to the doctor today and she prescribed me OrthoTricyclen Lo for now to see if that helps with the migraines. After reading all these reviews Im glad to be going off Trinessa! 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	6/22/2009 3:43:25 PM	It's my third day on Trinessa, and I just called my Dr.'s office to change my perscription.  I have been moody, had dark splotches show up on my face (and hadn't been in the sun), and had lost my appetite.  I dismissed these, but really couldn't take it when I had severe cramping and stomach pain.  It was accompanied by nausea, headache, and pelvic pain. I have been on Ortho-Tri before and don't remember it being  anything like this. The nurse told me their main concern is the pelvic pain, so if you are experiencing something similar, I'd tell you to call the doctor asap.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	13-18	6/21/2009 6:58:57 AM	When my menstrual cycle basically stopped happening, I was put on Trinessa in the attempt to regulate and restart my cycles.  Trinessa is cheap and not difficult to use.  The color-coded pills helped me to remember when I needed to go pick my refill up. In the first month, I did indeed have a period -- for 27 days.  This was likely a personal problem, a consequence of having not had a period for a year.  Taking these pills too close together caused nausea and discomfort.  But, it improved my acne hundredfold and I found it easier to lose weight.  I experienced some breast tenderness, but the most alarming side effect was depression after two months on this pill.  I started sleeping every extra minute of the day (very bad for a university student approaching finals), feeling isolated, decreased satisfaction from social interactions, and thoughts of suicide.  I switched to Ocella (generic form of Yasmin) and have not yet had any depression issues.Trinessa worked for its prescribed purpose, and my doctor thinks that I'm more sensitive to progesterone than the average woman, but definitely talk to your gyno if you experience depression.All in all, birth control in general has terrible side effects and as soon as my doctor allows, I'm done and never taking any oral contraceptive ever again.  I'll seek a different form of birth control when I need it...like NFP.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	adorableitalian9, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	13-18	6/8/2009 9:28:38 PM	breakthrough bleeding
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	6/6/2009 1:39:37 AM	I went on TriNessa about a year and a half ago and was relatively happy with it.  At the beginning I did notice that I was nauseous a lot of the time and felt that I was having an &quot;out of body experience.&quot;  After a few months that stopped but recently I have noticed an increase in depression.  I suffered from depression before being prescribed TriNessa - my doctor never said anything - but in the past 5 months or so it has gotten a lot worse and I have been having extreme mood changes and the WORST PMS of my life.  I never had bad mood swings or PMS before going on the pill but now it's terrible.  I am going to switch.
Birth Control	amyrose, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	6/1/2009 6:49:51 PM	While I do believe Trinessa is an effective medicine, I've been really sick to my stomach while taking it this last cycle. A bit of background on me, I've taken Ortho Tricyclen since I was 12, started for acne at the time. I've stayed on the brand since then until about 5 years ago. I've recently switched to the Trinessa from Trisprintec, due to my pharmacy changing generics here in the Houston area. The really crazy thing is, I changed TO Trisprintec from Trinessa about 3 years ago, when the pharmacy made it's first change! Thanks alot guys - why can't you carry both? Anyway, my first use of Trinessa I didn't have many side effects but I was younger then and I think this time Trinessa really did me in. I noticed extreme tenderness in my breasts and I have felt like I had the flu the entire month. I've managed to avoid vomiting by sheer willpower and herbal anti-nausea medications. My plan is now to get health insurance (got laid off in January) and moving forward I am going to try the name brand again and no longer accept generics. I think that it really varies for every individual woman and if you feel like something isn't right you should stop taking them because there is no point in being ill from it. Also I experienced less overwhelming side effects from the Tri Sprintec but it also sometimes made me mildly sick to my stomach. I hope to be able to even everything out with the Ortho brand but we will see. I also think it varies slightly batch to batch.
Birth Control	Redrom, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3		25-34	6/1/2009 1:06:45 PM	
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	4		19-24	6/1/2009 10:13:09 AM	I was completely satisfied with this drug until changes were made to it by the manufacturer earlier this year. I noticed the change in the size of the pills and a new NDC number in March. Without any change in my diet, I am now gaining weight steadily, not that weight gain is a bad thing because when I started taking the pill two years ago after giving birth, I lost down to 122, which being 5'9&quot; makes me look malnourished. Other than the new weight gain, the pill has been perfect for me.
Birth Control	Carinna82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/23/2009 4:03:44 AM	I'll give this review as if I were giving it to a friend:I went back on the pill when my normally &quot;like-clockwork&quot; cycle started going haywire on me.I told my new gyno I had previously used  TryCyclen, but she opted to prescribe TriNessa (which was fine by me). Now, I am about to start my 3rd pack, and I will admit that the first month was a little hectic for me. I had an odd rash that I had simply ruled down to allergies (since those have been crazy too) but after reading other reviews and seeing the time line, I now realize it was from the pills. Again, that was in the first month, and anytime you take something hormonal - you should at least brace yourself for the possibility of effect. Yes -- even those of us who &quot;don't have reactions&quot; (cause that was me until now). I did gain like 5 pounds. Again, at first I thought it was period/water weight, but it never dipped back down after my cycle ended. Slightly frustrating, but its only 5lbs.I spotted slightly the first month - which was frustrating to me since I was going back on the pill to STOP spotting all the time. But I haven't had the spotting issue since the initial pack.Also, the boobies are slightly sore. my BIGGEST dislike of these pills - they are total sex drive killer =( Not even just suppressed, but like: totally dead. LOL! I'm not only un-enthused, but sometimes even turned OFF by the thought of sex..... my poor fiance! He's been such a trooper, and he's going to let me &quot;level out&quot; a while longer, but he's already requested I try a different brand.Bottom line: This has had one too many weird effects for my own liking. I WILL be changing, but that will happen at my next appointment, which won't be bumped up to urgent or anything.
Birth Control	cworld017, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/20/2009 2:15:25 PM	I have been taking Tri-nessa for 10 years. I've only had spot bleeding like once a year while using this drug. My periods have been on time each month. I've experienced no weight gain while using Tri-nessa. The only thing I wish is that my perionds were lighter.
Birth Control	angelmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	5/19/2009 8:45:57 PM	I have taken Trinessa for 2years now, 3 months ago I began to have spot bleeding and have constant migraine problems. I have gained 15 lbs, become very irritable and have a very low sex drive. It wasn't until I started reading these reviews that I began to realize that the migraines,weight gain, irritability and sex drive could be attributed to this pill! I agree with the last review, this pill really prevent pregnancies(it kills you sex drive= no sex=no pregnancy) Dont get this pill if you can avoid it.
Birth Control	fitzysfaery, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	13-18	5/19/2009 3:49:24 PM	I was put on trinessa. I had been taking it for three months before I found out that it has been recalled for three years due to ineffectiveness. I am 18. I was on the patch and had to switch because the adhesive was breaking me out. My acne not horribly worse while on the pill. I gained weight like crazy. I lost interest in sex. I guess that's how they can call it birth control, if you're not having sex, you can't get pregnant. I also lost interest in food. I love food. I didn't want anything to eat, ever. I couldn't help it. I just didn't want food. I had one period on the pill. The doctors told me to skip the placebos every other month due to a six week cycle. The pills were making me sick. I would wake up puking. I do NOT recommend this pill for anyone! When they did the trial, the people who were being monitored, weren't having sex!
Birth Control	SICKANDTIRED, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	5/11/2009 1:44:51 AM	I had a baby in Dec. and was prescribed Ortho but because of ins. the pharmacy gave me the generic, Trinessa. Since taking this I have seen an overall decline in my health. Weakness, tiredness, no sex drive, dizziness, headaches, constant backaches. I feel horrible! I am almost at the end of this pack, then I quit. No one should ever feel this bad from a medication!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	5/10/2009 7:12:07 PM	Awful!The pill pack itself is confusing u don't know where to start.I was on Othro tricy for years and they just switched me to the Trinessa. I've gained 7lbs and have very bad breakouts with under the skin pimples 1 every other day! Lots of extra water weight, extreme tiredness and mood swings. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	5/8/2009 5:16:47 PM	I was prescribed generic Ortho TriCyclen about a year ago and began taking TriSprintec, another generic.  My pharmacy decided to switch me to TriNessa because they no longer wished to carry TriSprintec.  I have had the worst experience the last two months since I was switched.  I have put on 5 pounds of water, I am moodier than I have ever been, alternating between aggravated by EVERYTHING to crying for no reason at all.  It's been like having PMS for two months straight.  Needless to say, I am changing pharmacies and switching back to my original generic.

Painful Periods	Misty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/7/2009 8:56:31 AM	I have only been taking TriNessa for a month. I was a little concerned about starting this pill because I had read so many negative comments regarding the pills side effects. So far the only side effect I've noticed was minor breast swelling. I have not experienced any breakthrough bleeding...my period was right on time and has been much better. I had some cramping the first day, but it was minor and I didn't have to take anything for it. This is a major improvement as I usually get very ill and lay around the first couple days of my period drugged on muscle relaxers. I have also noticed that my skin is clearer. I have not experienced any decrease in sex drive or mood swings. Overall I am very pleased with this pill and don't have plans on switching any time soon. 
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	4/25/2009 5:57:08 PM	I used to have pain in my lower back and unbearable cramps to the point where I would cry. I decided to start bcp's and Trinessa was the first I was prescribed. It is a very effect birth control and significantly helped with my back pain and cramps. However, after about a year and a half of using Trinessa, my cramps and back pain started to come back at the beginning of my period. Advil helps to treat the pain from time to time, but I've decided to try a new bcp (Necon 1/35) to see if there's a difference. I haven't started it yet, so I can't compare the two as of yet.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/22/2009 10:53:06 PM	I haven't had any problems with TriNessa, and I've been taking it for 8 months. I originally switched from Yaz because it was way too expensive, and I didn't notice any differences at all! Overall I'm happy with it.

Anyway I decided to try a pill they gave me the generic 4 orthro tricyclen which is Trinessa this pill SUCKS!!!! The 1st mo I went thru a box of tampons b/c of breakthrough bleed 3mos in &amp; I'm still having breakthrough bleeding 4 3wks b4 my period. I'm extremely tired, sleepless nights, weight gain, weight gain in the &quot;baby area&quot; moody, short and cranky wk before period, no appetite at times, breast tenderness/pains, acne, Just a basket full of problems. I do not reccomend this pill to anyone! I must say the price was rather nice! The only good thing!
Painful Periods	abooch33, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/26/2009 5:51:33 PM	Maybe it is because this is my first week, but I was just switched from Yaz to this and my mood swings are the worst! If this doesn't change fast, I will def. get off of these. I don't think I've cried this much in my life!
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	3/19/2009 9:58:17 PM	I've been taking this pill for almost 2 years now. Within the past year, I've noticed an increase in weight, acne, and vaginal discharge. I've noticed a decrease in sex drive and cramping. I was on ortho-tri-cyclen low and I can't remember the reason why I made the switch to TriNessa but I am going to switch back because I don't think it had as many negatives as this pill does. I have been on other pills as well but I think this one was the worst, it just took a year to show me. 
Birth Control	nadi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/13/2009 4:30:04 PM	I started taking TriNessa for Birth Control about nine months ago, but it has done great things for my periods as well.  I used to have horrible cramps and vomiting with every period and I no longer have any vomiting or serious cramping.  No weight gain, no excessive hunger.  I do have headaches during my period after starting this drug, but they are treatable with Tylenol, so not very serious.  I had some mood swings and breast tenderness the first few months but these are now gone.  I'll be sad if I go off of it to try and get pregnant because it has made my life so much easier!  My friend, however, did not have a very good experience with TriNessa; she became very depressed, so I don't think this medicine is for everyone.  Definitely worth a try, though!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	3/4/2009 4:15:19 PM	This medication made my periods horrible, bad mood swings and I am beginning to believe this has caused me a lump in my arm pit-not sure if thats what it is from but never had a problem with such before. Seeing the dr. tomorrow about this. Also bad acne and I have never had acne before. I have stopped it completely and will never take it again. 
Birth Control	Mina80, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/5/2009 1:33:41 PM	I've been on this BCP for 6 mos now and I will say that its effectiveness has worked fine. I had one episode of break through bleeding. When I do miss, I do double up and never had a missed period. When I first started them I did experience horrible mood swings, and do think from time to time I do get them. I never gained any weight, or experienced increased hunger. I did notice some facial breakout the first few months and then that stopped. Unfortunately, this pill did not stop my cramps. I still get them, but it did keep my periods to 3-4 days and not as heavy as before. All in all I do recommend this pill.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	1/27/2009 11:28:17 AM	Ok I've been on TriNessa for about 2 years.  I really like it, I had horrible cramps and would miss work and lay on the bathroom floor so I could be close to the toilet. I know now I'm going to start tuesday night so I take an alive before I go to bed and one sometime during wednesday and I'm good. It also took my periods down to about 3 days of light bleeding. I start Tuesday night Wednesday morning and end Friday night or Saturday morning. I went from having to use supers and a pantiliner to just regulars. However now I'm noticing lots of discharge, mood swings, and I can't sleep. I do not know if this is because of the pill but I do plan to talk to my dr about it.
Birth Control	Love Life, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	13-18	1/24/2009 1:07:23 AM	I've been on tri-nessa for four years now and I haven't had ANY problems. I didn't gain weight, no acne, no sensitivity with my breasts. My periods are light and shortened with NO cramping and I have a tendency to get awful migranes from hormones and those have vanished. The worst part about this pill is taking it everyday and I have missed pills and I don't take it at the EXACT time each night but I still haven't gotten pregnant. Im not saying to take the chances I have but I think that it has been effective. I have never tried any other birth control methods before but I don't plan on switching. 
Birth Control	baby blue, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	1/23/2009 8:01:00 AM	I had never taken Birth Control pills untill late last year, I was on Depo Provera for 10 years before this.TriNessa is the second bc prescription I have tried, I am on my second pack and I hate it already! I eat like there's no tomorrow and my peroids are heavy from the first day of the pack up till I take my first active pill of the new pack. I never had a peroid in 10 years and after taking this bc I am starting to realize why I never missed having my peroid!! I have not had depression or mood swings on this pill but the heavy periods are more than I can bare at this point, so my doctor put me on something else and I hope to god it works better than this!!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/11/2009 9:15:56 PM	Since starting this pill, my problem with ovarian cysts has greatly decreased.  My skin has cleared up, I have no spotting, and my periods are incredibly regular.  I can predict when it will start down to a 1-hour window.  I've had zero negative side effects.  I switched to this pill from a different pill because of persistent spotting.  I wouldn't change to any other pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	12/23/2008 9:21:53 PM	Don't take it, don't take it, I repeat, DO NOT TAKE IT.  I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen generic for a few years and had hardly any side effects...but I switched to this, and it makes me moody, depressed, tired, makes my breasts tender, acne gets worse all over my body...and I'm having constant yeast infections.  Does what it's supposed to, but the side effects aren't worth it.  Find something else.

This is the first time I have tried Tri-Nessa Tablets.  I normally would take Ortho.  Since being on this medication (5 months) I have experienced very severe brest pain and acne.  This occurs when I am off of my cycle.  So 3 weeks of pain, I have an appt. to see my OB to swith my medication.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	12/14/2008 3:53:59 PM	I have been taking this b/c for a little over a year now.  At first it worked without side effects but recently I have been experience a severe drop in sex drive, a severe rise in mood swings and vaginal discharge.  I have never experienced these problems before.  At first I thought it was stress causing these things, until I started doing some research.  I have a doctor's appointment this week where I will be asking for a different birth control.
Birth Control	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		12/10/2008 1:38:11 AM	I started TriNessa to deal with an acne problem. On the first try, I became depressed and my periods had more cramping. After about three months, I switched to a different pill, but I started having break-through bleeding. I am back on TriNessa and have been for over a year. I no longer have mood/swings, and my cramping is controllable. It works just fine now.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	12/6/2008 7:28:09 AM	I had been taking Orthotricylcen LO for 4 years, and I was very satisfied.  However it started making me bleed during my ovulating periods.  My doctor informed me that I could be coming immune to the pill. So they switched me to the Tri-nessa. Horrible cramps and head aches, the whole time I have my period (never experienced that with Ortho).  I want to switch back but not if I'm immune to it!
Birth Control	Kcjayhawk, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	12/5/2008 3:38:16 PM	I have been more or less on the Pill for 16 years -- starting at age 18 and now at 34. And, for pretty much the entire time I was on some form of Ortho Tri-cyclin. During that time, I had no problems. I love the Ortho Tri. In fact, I had great skin, no break-through bleeding, no pregnancy scares and very regular. I was like clock-work. During my week, I would start my period by 9am on Wednesday and be done by Sunday afternoon. Like many on this form, I switched to Trinessa because of insurance. I've been on it for 2 months and the results are horrible. I have heavier periods, spotting 2-3 days before, frequent headaches, hot flashes and inconsistent start and end times for period. Last month I started on Thursday night and ended the following Tuesday. Additionally, my sex drive is down and I am very dry in lady land. I would not recommend this product. Thankfully, I am in a position to switch back even through Ortho will cost me $50/month versus $7 for Trinessa. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	12/4/2008 10:32:49 PM	Shortly after switching from Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo to TriNessa, I noticed a decrease in sex drive and an increase in mood swings.  In short, I was really irritated and the lack of sex was not helping.  Uppon further review of the active ingredients (ethinyl estradiol &amp; norgestimate) if found that the TriNessa which I was prescribed had an increase of .010mg norgestimate.  Although that may not seem like much, Ortho Tri Cyclen had .025mg of norgestimate.  That is a 40% increase in one of the active ingredients.  I am not sure if this is an error on my doctors part, the pharmacy, or due to patenting issues.  Regardless of the reason, I am switching to back to Ortho or to something else.
Birth Control	Gemini, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	12/2/2008 10:31:03 PM	I have been on this b/c for over 6 yrs after the birth of my daughter.  I've had to wear a panty liner due to discharge since the birth of my daughter b/c I thought it was due to having a child but now I realize it could be this b/c pill.  I have discharge daily that requires me to wear the panty liner, mood swings, NO sex drive and difficulty having an orgasm during sex.  I don't know if it is my body or the b/c pill.  I have short periods with no cramping.  The first pill after my period sometimes makes me nauseated as well.  If anyone has had recommendations to my daily vaginal discharge (no smell, no STD's) I would appreciate help.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	11/19/2008 7:38:43 PM	I initially took this purely as birth control. I now continue because it has made my periods significantly shorter and less painful, which has always been a problem I just dealt with in the past. I haven't had any of the side effects others have mentioned, most of which seem to be the same side effects complained of with any form of birth control. Birth control pills, by their nature, are forcing your body to do something it was never meant to do. Naturally, this can cause problems. Personally, I have maintained the same weight I always have, and I haven't had any acne problems either. I can't really comment on the mood swings/depression aspect because I am clinically depressed and on medications for that as well.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	11/9/2008 9:52:31 PM	I would not reccommend this birth control to anyone.  I am 21 and have been the same weight since the beginning of high school. Within a week of taking it, I had gained 10 pounds. My cramps were even worse when I was on it, and I was extremely moody.  I also know why they call it birth control- I HAVE NO SEX DRIVE!  (funny but not really)  this generic brand is terrible.  
Birth Control	pbz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/9/2008 2:06:44 PM	In the past I've used OTC and tri-sprintec, and this is the first time I've used Trinessa. I am stopping using it because after some research online I've figured out it's probably the cause of my recent mood swings (which seem to change week by week). My moods have been a source of tension in my relationship with my boyfriend, so I'm not the only one affected.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	11/7/2008 4:56:35 PM	This pill was horrible for me. i had no appetite and was totally miserable on it. I stopped taking it after a week and started feeling better. but now my periods back with a vengance and I've been doing nothing but haveing severe cramps. It totally messed up my hormones.I've been to my doctor and the hospital and I dont seem to be getting anywhere when it comes to my severe cramping.My doc and the hospital were in no way helpful to me. now im stuck with these horrible cramps till I can get some real help somehow.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	11/1/2008 4:01:29 PM	I have only been on Trinessa for one month, but have seen great improvement in my skin! My period is lighter, I dont seem to be as mean, and my period is shorter. It's great! And a cheaper alternative to Ortho Tri-Cyclen! I definitely recommend this!
Excessive Hairiness	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	10/26/2008 1:52:17 PM	I have found that being on Trinessa has made me moody, have headaches, and  made me tired.  My headaches would be everyday.  Most of the time, I felt these strong, short aches in the brain.  I got really worried and asked my doctor for a new brand.  I will be starting Yaz soon.  Hopefully Yaz will deliver better results.  I'm only taking the pill to control my Polycystic ovarian syndrome.
Painful Periods	stealnkissesfrmu, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	10/17/2008 2:49:08 PM	Usually I have had very clear skin besides the times when I get my period. I have been on Trinessa for about 8 months now and my skin is horrible. Most of the acne is the bumps under the skin, but sometimes I get really painful and big pimples that I use to never get. I also gained a lot of weight on this pill. I tried to put up with it for as long as I could, but I want my clear skin back! I also had some random break through bleedings so that was another reason for me wanting to switch. I did have some weird mood swings during the first few months, but I believe most of it went away. 
Birth Control	djp68, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	10/4/2008 11:48:44 PM	I have been on this medication for about a week. In that time I've had constant nausea, mood swings, no appetite and I'm constantly tire. I was on ortho tri cyclen lo before this and had no side effects at all, I switched to Trinessa because of my insurance. I'm am going to continue to take it to see if my body adjusts to the bc but at this time I am miserable on it.
Birth Control	memphisgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	9/23/2008 4:27:46 PM	I was taking yaz but my periods got heavy so I switched to this. Ive only been taking it for 2 weeks and Im losing some hair and I have red bumps on my scalp....Is this normal?
Birth Control	Sara K, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	9/23/2008 12:38:47 PM	I took this as an alternative to Ortho Tri Cyclen and the cost associated with. The price was the only good thing about this. I HATED this pill. I've been on a few different brands in my day and this was the absolute worst. I was constantly moody, emotional and just felt crappy like I was depressed all the time. I hated it. As soon as I quit taking it and it was out of my system, I felt 500 times better. I do not recommend this to anyone. 
Birth Control	woops_y_daisy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	9/21/2008 12:54:52 AM	I've never been on birth control before and after this I don't think I want to be. The side effects for this drug are aweful! I've never had acne until taking trinessa. My breasts have increased at least a cup size and are constantly tender (I found it interesting that the size went down the one week I wasn't taking the pill. The worst part is I am constantly depressed, weepy and generally irritable. This birth control isn't worth the side effects they cause.
Acne	marbear7389, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/20/2008 12:49:27 PM	I'm on my third pack, and I love it!  Before taking birth control, I would have such bad cramps from my period that I would throw up every month.  My face would also break out from the hormonal acne.  When I first started taking this pill my face, back and chest did break out badly, since my body was getting used to the pill.  Now everything has cleared up though!!!  I still get dull cramps, but nothing like before.  I think my body is still just getting used to the hormone.
Birth Control	TRInessa user, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/6/2008 3:44:34 PM	Just started taking this pill. I have noticed bizarre cramps that ARE really painful and light headaches that have the potential to be bad, but my body still has to get used to it, plus I took it on day 1 start of my period so its possibly just my period causing the issues. I think people are hypocondriacs seriously. yours minds play tricks on you after reading the &quot;side effect&quot; insert. So whiney. I could never be as fat as I was when pregnant, so who cares! LOL.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	8/28/2008 2:47:58 PM	It works perfectly. I've been on it for two months so far. The only thing that would be wrong with it is that my acne got worse and the vaginal discharge is crazy. Plus I get vaginal odor too. But besides this, I haven't had any of the crazy reactions (mood swings, weight gain, etc.) that everyone else has. If anything I've lost some weight. I'm sticking with it for now, just because it is the cheapest.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/21/2008 3:55:59 PM	Trinessa has turned my life into a complete horror show.  I have been taking OrthoTriCyclen for 15 years with NO problems whatsoever.  None.  Recently, my insurance sent me this generic from my mail order pharmacy.  No big deal- I have taken several different generic versions of this over the years with no side effects at all.  It took me several months to realize it was my birth control, as it didn't even cross my mind, but this medicine has caused the worst migraines.  I am actually out of work on medical leave as a result, as I was falling and disoriented at work.  I literally had migraines every day for 2 months.  My period was early, up to 6 days.  You used to be able to set your watch my my cycle.  I have been living a nightmare for the past several months.  If you are experiencing migraines and have recently switched to Trinessa, talk to your doc- it gets worse FAST.  
Birth Control	dixievalkyrie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/18/2008 10:05:33 PM	This birth control works great! I was taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo but generics are cheaper on my plan so Dr. switched me to this. I didn't experience any of the horror-story side effects I keep hearing about with this drug-in fact, my periods are much shorter with this (by 2 days!!) and the cute pastel yellow compact doesn't hurt either. It's basically the same as ortho tri cylclen lo for me, and I had no complaint then.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	7/10/2008 1:40:40 PM	I have been satified with this drug for the simple fact that it is keeping me from becoming pregnant, but I have been having some serious side effects.  Anxiety attacks, heart issues, and I am so moody.  I am going to stop taking this drug asap!  I have been on it for a year and the symptoms didn't start showing up until 9 months after starting it.  I am just up and down with my emotions all the time. This cannot be good for you.  I will just find a safer way to prevent pregnancy.  
Birth Control	Sacred Moonfire, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/24/2008 9:10:20 AM	I had been on Ortho-Tricyclen for almost ten years before I switched to this about a year and a half ago. Trinessa is just as effective and I don't have any side effects. My cycle was kinda weird when I made the transition but after a month, it was fine again. I would highly recommend this, plus it is much cheaper at the pharmacy.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	6/6/2008 10:52:34 PM	I'm relieved that other people are having the same effects I have been: depression and mood swings. I thought maybe it was me but I feel much better now that it could be the pill. Also I have alot of discharge, all the time which is really wierd. 
Endometriosis		3	1	1			6/5/2008 11:36:24 AM	Trinessa has caused me so much grief.  It did help regulate my period, but I have had so many crazy side effects it isn't worth it. Some of these side effects include rapid heart rate, depression, loss of sex drive, anxiety, bloating, and loss of sleep.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	5/15/2008 12:53:08 PM	I started this a week ago today for not having my period in 6 mos. I've never had trouble with birth control until I've started taking this. Within this week, I have had increased cramping, severe abdominal pain, headaches, tiredness, depression (to the point I can barely function or want to be around my family and friends), and horrible nausea throughout the day. I'm sticking with it just to see if I will get my period but it is a complete nightmare. 
Birth Control		4	4	1			4/19/2008 6:05:38 PM	i have been on Trinessa (generic for Ortho Tri-cyclen) for about 3 years now.  at first it worked great...but this past year i have been noticing that i throughout the month i have been depressed and weepy, sad all the time.  then about a week before my period i get really short and cranky, along with the sadness and crying.  my fiance thought i was crazy!  i ended up looking online and found that Trinessa is a higher dose estrogen pill compared to one like Yaz.  i believe what i read was that Trinessa is 35 mcg's of estrogen while Yaz is 25 or 30 mcg's.  i don't remember exactly, but it is definitely lower.  Lower estrogen dose = not so crazy!  so i have switched to Yaz.  it is a lot more expensive than Trinessa, but i hope that it takes these crazy moods away!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/2/2008 1:53:25 PM	I've been very moody and weepy and depressed since starting this pill 2 weeks ago. Also very lethargic. I've been on other birth control pills without any problems before, so I think I need to switch.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	3/24/2008 1:24:40 AM	I have been using TriNessa for almost 5 years now and it has worked great.  It helped to stop my acne and the only weight I gained was in my breasts and it wasn't a huge difference. It completely regulated my period is starts on tues. night or wed. morning and is done by sunday which is great.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	19-24	3/10/2008 8:55:09 AM	I have been 0n Trinessa for over 3 years had absolutly no side effects. It worked for me. Due to severe hair loss (which is not proved to be from the pill but eliminated factors) I recently went off it and put on yaz, which seems to be working fine.
Birth Control	iHaveSum12Love, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	3/3/2008 1:26:26 AM	I will be going in to my seventh month of using this drug one week from today. Overall, I've been pretty satisfied- its done its job and is easy to use. My only complaint is that i get severe menstrual cramps whenever i start the last week of the pack. Aside from that i have none of the other side effects.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/28/2008 11:20:49 AM	I have been on trinessa for 3 years now, and i have not had ANY side effects. My period is totally predicatable now- wednesday it starts and sunday it stops -so 5 days. (I have never tried any other B/C)
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	2/26/2008 1:59:41 AM	I have been on TriNessa for 6 months as prescribed by my doctor to regulate my period and to balance out my hormones. It so far has regulated my period; however, it has made me more hormonal than I've ever been. I experience severe highs and lows of anxiety and depression. I have also gained a considerable amount of weight (mostly in my breats and stomach) which I know was from the birth control because I have the same eating and exercise habits as I did before taking the pill. I'm getting off of it as soon as I get the okay from my doctor.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	2/20/2008 12:02:11 PM	I have been on this for about 6 months now and I hate it!  I have gained weight in what would be my &quot;baby area.&quot;  I look like I am having a baby even though I'm not.  My periods have gone from 3 days to 7 days on this and I have cramps for about 5 to 7 days before that.  I have my &quot;period&quot; for almost 2 weeks then.  I'm calling my doctor today to see if I can get on something else after seeing that I'm not the only person with these problems.  
Painful Periods	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female		2/12/2008 12:44:26 AM	I used to have very bad cramps with my periods, to the point of being unable to function (passing out, throwing up, etc.) Trinessa has alleviated my cramps, but hasn't completely gotten rid of them. However, what's left can be taken care of with Aleve and I'm thrilled I can actually function during my period. It does make the first couple days of my period very heavy, but it's worth it. It's also been successful at preventing pregnancy, of course. 
Birth Control		4	4	3			2/10/2008 7:31:03 PM	I've been on TriNessa for almost 2 years and the only complaint I have with it is that it made my periods lasat 7 days instead of 5.  It reduced (though didn't completely alleviate) my cramps, which is my worst symptom, and I haven't experienced ANY of the side effects they warn you of, such as moodiness, &quot;morning sickness,&quot; etc.  The only reason I would switch Pills would be if they had one that could guarantee no cramps!
Painful Periods		2	3	1			2/7/2008 12:35:07 PM	Depression, severe mood swings, crying, lethargy
Birth Control	adrianrose2007, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/6/2008 8:30:07 PM	I have been on TriNessa for almost a full month. I recently switched from the depro shot because I bled so much. Since being on TriNessa I have experienced mood swings, a little weight gain, symptoms of morning sickness, and breast tenderness. I feel like I am pregnant, but I took a pregnancy test and it was negative. So far I can deal with the side effects as long as it's effective, I just don't think my boyfriend likes it so much. please let me know if anyone else is having all these symptoms.

I was taking yazmin for about 2 yrs. and started getting pains so i needed to change, my doctor gave me a rx for Trinessa. Trinessa works better for me now. I do not use this for birth control, I use it for ovarian cysts, I have my tubes tied.
