I have had a time with hard, impossible to pass stools. Suppositories and saline enema's have been necessary frequently in addition to laxatives like mineral oil and milk of magnesia which take 2-3 days to work for me.  Never had any success at all with Colace until someone told me to take it with each of 3 meals.  Hooray, this works great!  The gas has been horrid but at least I'm not agonizing while on the toilet.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	10/18/2011 10:27:41 AM	I saw a GI specialist because I have issues with my intestines. Not sure if it's IBS or some sort of malabsorption or intolerance to food. She recommended this to me suggesting that I should be having 2 bowel movements a day (at the weight I am) and that emptying my bowels in addition to the changes I was already making in my diet would provide me relief. She assured me it wouldn't make me have to go, it would just make the stools easier to pass and a little bigger in length. Well, she was wrong. I never had a problem with bowel movements. Never been constipated. However, not only did this medication give me worse gas and cramping than I've ever felt, it also gives me incomplete bowel movements. I never feel &quot;finished&quot; and it causes more gas and bloating. It's been more uncomfortable and embarassing than any of my other symptoms had previously which caused me to see a doctor in the first place. I have stopped taking this medication and am going back to just regulating my diet and trying to lose weight. I was going okay with that. Stay away from drugs unless it's a life-threatening issue. They cause more problems than anything else.

Was cramping and having to go several times to empty. This has helped me to have to only have one bowel movement to complete. Less irritation for me too.

Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	2/15/2010 1:17:43 PM	I am constipated from medications for another condition. One oral colace works but it does give me cramps during the day. Also I've been having really weird and unplesant dreams since I started taking it and I'm wondering if the colace is the reason. I always dream a lot but these have been particularly tense.

I hadn't had a bowl movement in about 2 weeks or so and I felt like I couldn't move. I took the overnight version of this and felt like a new person the next morning. other laxatives and stool softeners have done nothing for me or were very painful. This is great! 
Other	webmedi, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/10/2009 1:48:50 AM	I used this medication in liquid form one time while in the hospital.  It burned my throat and roof of my mouth.  I followed it with water and then with liquid Vicodin and some more water.  The Burning was severe and I was concerned that it would cause damage to my recent esophageal and stomach surgery the reason for my being in the hospital for almost two weeks. I followed The burning dose with water, couple of ice-creams and some pudding. It was a frightening experience. Be aware of this possible side effect.  I will use something less irritating to achieve the desired effect.

It started very effective then became less effective so I increased the dose up to 8 caps per day.  At first I noticed a particular odor in my stool from this medication. With increased dosage I now note that my skin and clothing have taken on this same smell.Supposedly, Colace is not absorbed by the body, but, I have detected this odor and observed it to increase with dosage.

Could this be from taking on an empty stomach, or on a full stomach?  Or is nausea a normal side effect?

I take 2 capsules a day.  I still have a lot of periods where I go 2 to 4 days without a bowel movement and when I do go I have to strain to get it to pass.  It has gotten to the point where the stool has blood on the outside and on the toilet paper.  I wish there was something that worked better than this.  I don't want to start taking laxatives as I had grandparents who were dependent on them to go.

Other	19-24 Male  (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	5/14/2008 4:09:46 PM	Believe it or not, this medication has a secondary use.  I do not recommend using it personally without medical guidance, but I am a medic in the US Army, and we also use colace for ear impactions.  It softens the wax buildup and helps the impaction come out with ease.  I have used peroxide and the ear drops, but nothing I have used comes close to this medication. 
Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements		2	4	1			4/27/2008 5:43:30 PM	My doctor told me to take 2 daily.  Nothing happened, so over a week I increased to taking actually 6 daily.  It's been 2 weeks now and still no movement :(  My stomach is extremely bloated as I'm sure you can imagine.  Going to go straight to laxitives tomorrow even though I know you aren't supposed to get dependant on those.
