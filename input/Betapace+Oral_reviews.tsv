Heart Ventricle Rhythm Problem	JohnJohndavid, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	35-44	2/17/2012 11:03:17 PM	had some kind of heart problem when I was 34, A doctor decided I had Tachy Brady Syndrom.Was placed on sotalol at first to help slow my heart rate, My heart rate got so slow that it nearly killed me, So they decided to place a pacemaker in me. Now I take sotalol 80 2day But I now have A-Fib So they say.  My problem is I GAINED allot of weight and I have really hard heart beats and palpatations from the med. It also makes me very hot and even causes irruglar Heart rate for about two hours after taking the med. But I am told I can not stop the med.I am 44 now and still deal with the side affects of sotalol HCL    Sotalol can cause sudden death and that really bothers me. But my heart doctor keeps pushing it. Even tho the pill puts me in the hospital at least once a month.I dont think this pill is one of the safest meds for A-Fib but like crestor (Which is another very scarey drug) it is pushed by the pharmc companies. Some times I think these doctors get big kick backs from the med companys to push these meds. I know this isnt much help. But just wanted people to know that sotalol hcl is a dangerous drug

Works great. A Drugest tried to give me the &quot;BETAPACE AF! Instead of my regualur BETAPACE and OMG! They only thought and told me there is NO difference. YES there IS! And lifetherating! You can look both up on Medplus! I now before I leave drugstore, check meds, it's happened before. 
Other	dmbw2010, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	4	4	Female	65-74	7/2/2010 3:51:38 PM	I had an ablation back in 2000 for tachacardia. Did the trick. Had palpitations for 3 months, quit for a month and started up again in June 2010. Went into hospital for 3 days June 20, on sotalol for palpitations. No problems. Still have a flutter now and then but nothing like it was.  Don't know about weight gain, haven't gained since the hospital, in fact came down 5 pounds I think from eating the right foods. No snacking.  Only once a week, whatever I want.

I am a student at Appalachian State so walking to class can be a pain in the neck.  I started sotalol and my rhythm is more normal...I am on 80mg 2X a day but i take 160 in the morning and if i need it, ill take a pill at night...I have grown out of the fatigue and moodiness.  Sotalol is my wonder drug.

The Betapace seemed to help following the ablation as my heart healed from the procedure. I am now off betepace... however, my sitting heat rate is over 80. I have always workout all of my life -- but now find that my heart rate during excercise is higher than ever. It has only been a week since I have been off of the meds. The Doctor suggested that it might be a few weeks for my heart rate to return to normal.Although Betapace seemed to help -- it did make me tired and at times somewhat depressed. By depressed I only mean a little down... nothing too serious.Bottomline -- if it works for you... great! However, you will need to be a motivated person at times to get &quot;moving&quot; during the day.

I take 80mg twice a day.  Prior to Betapace, Toprol was ineffective.  If I have a cold or the flu, sometimes a third dosage in the afternoon is helpful.

Heart Ventricle Rhythm Problem	VT Guy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Male	45-54	9/1/2009 11:34:56 PM	I am 53 years old and I am taking Sotalol 120 Mg twice daily to control Ventricular Tachacardia. I had an ICD implanted 6 months ago and when I tried to reduce dosage to limit side effects of poor libido, my ICD shocked me as I went into VT. I had two unsuccesfull ablations due to those 6 shocks in 16 days. So aside from about 20 pounds weight gain in 6 months and lack of libido(ED), I need this med to keep me alive. Anyone know of any alternative meds that may control VT without those side effects? I am too young for long term use of amiadarone and Mexiletine did not work either.

She was weak before but even more so now.  I'm trying to pin down which of her mass of medications may be causing the problem.  I think from all your comments, this may be a contributing factor.
Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	trying again, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	5/15/2009 7:50:59 PM	I recently started taking 80mg 2X a day and have ben increased to 160mg 2x a day.  I previously was taking 50mg toprol but went back into A-fib.  I feel the sotalol is more efective then the toprol was for me.  I had my third cardioversion 2 days ago.  I haven't had time for weight gain yet and don't notice mood changes.  I find it odd that noone mentoned the dosages they take.  I'm 44 yrs old.
