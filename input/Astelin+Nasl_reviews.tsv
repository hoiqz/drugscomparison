Very expensive and does NOT help at all. Eyes itchy and watery, sneezing, etc. Am counting down the days until I can get another shot!

Vasomotor Rhinitis	HaleyK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/6/2012 9:58:05 PM	Astelin has truly been a Godsend for me.  Like many others, I have suffered with VR since childhood...now over 15 years.  I would have sneezing &quot;fits&quot; for hours that would completely drain me &amp; I would be in bed for the next day or two.  It was really debilitating at times...I know, just sneezing but it took everything out of me.  Finally my doctor diagnosed the condition as VR which explained why Antihistamines were ineffective...my body was not producing any histamines for medication to block!  Astelin has been 100% effective for me.  I sometimes worry about the day they take it off the market!  For about 6 years now, Astelin has kept my VR under control and I can function normally.  I still avoid triggers like scents, smoke, etc.  A note about the bad taste - my doctor taught me to look down at my toes when spraying so it does not drain straight into my throat.  It works like a charm :)
Vasomotor Rhinitis	Bwarren3, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	4/18/2012 2:59:19 PM	After a bad case of fluid buildup, lost over 50 lbs but my sinuses went out of control. Have had sinus problems my entire life and always found something otc that worked until this time. Specialist Dr. recommended Astelin. Has worked since the 2nd spray. Now back to almost normal, when warm weather comes don't need it but cold weather works better every night without skipping nights. Great stuff. Other sprays never worked at all. No side effects.
Other	jungleinferno, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/5/2012 1:17:47 AM	I've had a long history of sinus infections, and had 3 in 4 months recently. Have tried Claritin, Sudafed, and other nasal sprays. Claritin and Sudafed stopped working after some time and other nasal sprays had an unacceptably long-lasting bitter taste. Astelin has changed everything. I take it only at night (makes me tired) and I sleep better, have not had a single sinus infection since starting it, and I can go days without blowing my nose. Astelin's going to put Kleenex out of business. Basically, this is a great product and I highly recommend that others with sinus issues give it a try.

Other	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		9/27/2011 1:17:49 AM	A weekend urgent care doctor got me on this when I had a severe sinus affection that I had gotten fed up with. The doctor the week before wouldn't give me amoxicillan to help, so I went to the urgent care the weekend instead and this woman gave me a strong dose of amoxicillan and prescribed azelastine for   future head colds. She figured out (after years of suffering) that I do not handle colds very well due to my makeup in that region and as a result, I'm more susceptible to getting a sinus infection afterwards. That's why she gave me azelastine to boot. I cannot begin to describe what a difference it has made. For years doctors have told me to take basic saline solution, which has never worked. Right now I have a cold, and I am surviving. Trust me, that is saying a lot if you are referring to me. 
Vasomotor Rhinitis	Jim Carr, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	8/3/2011 10:10:11 PM	I have suffered from vasomotor rhinitis for many years, with no relief.  Finally, I was prescribed Astelin for the condition.  The results were nothing short of miraclulous.  I am finally free of the coughing fits caused by the post-nasal drip brought on by this condition.  I coughed after eating, after exertion, smelling certain odors, upon going to bed, upon getting up in the morning, going outside from inside, coming inside from outside, heat, cold and humidity.  One day after starting Astelin, I was almost completely symptom free.  I highly recommend this treatment for anyone who suffers like I did.  I am finally free of this debilitating condition..Slight drowsiness is the only side effect I have experienced.
Other	TheRyanGuy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	4/20/2011 3:46:57 AM	I am a Male, 28 years old fighting issues with Urticaria. (Burning, itchy, rash that comes and goes with the histamine levels in my body). When I can feel a flare up begining to happen, I would take a dose of this and within minutes everything starts to calm down before it has a chance to really escallate. The only real side effect was that it would cause stuffyness in my sinuses, which actually helped when my alergies were realy bad. It also made me drowsey at times, but that was no issue if I took the medicine before going to bed. Once a day is all I need so far.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	3/8/2010 5:27:13 PM	I have terrible, terrible allergies.  I have been on everything, but Astelin really is effective.  I'm fairly apprehensive to continue using for the rest of my life though, because I hate squirting something into my nose everyday.  Not sure how long I will stay on it, but truthfully this has catapulted my quality of life.   It is absolutely the best medicine for treating both indoor, and outdoor allergies.  My primary triggers are pollen, grass, cat hair, and dust.  This helps me deal with these relatively easy.  The after taste is very bad.  It almost always drips into the back of my throat, and taste terrible.  But it is worth the help it gives me.

I have to take it at night because it gives me horrible halitosis that does not go away for hours.  On the bright side, this certainly helps with nasal allergies as well as asthma.

In eighteen months of treatment, it made a minor impact if any on my rhinitis, but destroyed my sense of smell and created a progressively worse arrhythmia which resolved somewhat within 24 hours of quitting drug, but still requires medication to manage to this day, four years later.

Vasomotor Rhinitis	Shelby, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	4/12/2009 7:25:52 PM	I've spent most of the last 40 years feeling generally &quot;ill&quot; due to nasal allergy symptoms and chronic sinus infections. I've tried everything. My opinion of Astelin:Very effective, but not unless you commit yourself to using it EVERY DAY. There is the bad taste, which lingers awhile. Chase it with a tasty drink. It causes a tickling sensation in your nose that can trigger a sneezing fit within a couple of minutes after using it. Sometimes I worry that I'm sneezing most of it out before it can even absorb. This stuff ain't cheap, but if you add up the cost of all those OTC pills it is tolerable. The dry mouth side effect is not as bad as with other antihistamines I've taken. My nose still runs a little, but I haven't had a sinus infection since I started Astelin. That's saying a lot!

I have not had the constant Sinus infections in the winter and spring. I have been on it for about three years now. I have now developed a rash, and servre itching. Been to sevearl doctors to include a Dermotologist and they have not been able to diagnois the rash and get rid of it. I did not remember reading in the possible side effects of a rash when I first was prescribed this drug. But have told all the different doctors I have seen that I am on Astelin and none of them has suggested that I may now be having an allergic reaction to the drug that has helped me greatly. Will visit with the pharmacist and the doctor about this being the case. over $800 dollars spent to treat the rash and may be a reaction to the drug. But I will say it worked wonders for me before I started to have this rash.

The eye specialist informed me that there was nothing wrong with my eye and I should continue to use this drug.  After one week, I needed to use the drug, it is an amazing product if not allergic to it, so I did and now I have a black floater and halos around my eye.  The halo has subsided but the floater causes me to jump every now and then because I think it is a bee or spider.  This is really quite funny, if not so serious.  I am off again to the doctor.  My only concern is that this drug may cause severe reactions in the aging eye.  If someone has had a similar allergic reaction, please post your comments.  Thank you.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/29/2008 10:41:31 PM	I've been suffering with allergies my entire life. Usually the sneezing, congestion and &quot;cloudy&quot; feeling happen so quickly. Unfortunately nasal steroids would never give me the fast relief I NEEDED. Astelin works within minutes and lasts, which gives me the confidence to use it when I need it! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for fast and effective relief

Other	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female		3/9/2008 1:22:53 PM	This was just ok...The price is crazy higheven with a $10. rebate the co. offer.Astelin gives temporary immediate relief, also causesnose bleeds on occassion &amp; has a very bitter taste causing nausea. I am only using it on occassion for my flusymptoms and allergies combined. I hope tofind something as good and lower priced.It is difficult to have it enter my nose   in spray form as opposed to the stronger flow.Will try more natural types of nasal spraysfrom Whole Foods, etc.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Denchamber, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	2/15/2008 12:01:26 AM	As was the case with one of the other users in this list, I get sneezing fits every time I try it.  The sneezing starts a minute or two after application, and lasts for another minute or two. By the time I'm done sneezing I'm sure there's none if it left in my nose, so it's no big surprise that it didn't help me be able to breathe.

I've had almost immediate relief with no side effects. Relief at last!

Now, it does make me drowsy and I only use it at night before I go to bed. But I have been able to sleep throughout the night with out waking up with a stuffy nose. It's fast and effective. I have found that when I spray it in my nose and lean over to let the med to into my nasal cavity, I don't get the drainage into my throat.

This medication works great for my allergies. Since the first day I tried it, all my allergy symptoms were cleared up. The taste of the spray is gross, but it only lasts a few minutes. It didn't cause the drowsy effect of some antihistamines.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy		5	5	5			12/18/2007 10:20:22 AM	I have used this drug for almost 4 years now.  It has helped me tremendously.  I was getting sick with sinus infections it seemed like every couple of months.  But using Astelin, along with replacing some carpeting in my home with wood floors, has helped me significantly.  I think I've only had one sinus infection in the last year.  Great product!

My right nostril was clogged and was discharging copious, clear, serious fluid. Astelin (taken with Clarinex-D) gave me immediate relief.  My constant post-nasal drip seems to be much better as well.

Clears the nasal passages very effectively.  The key to this is the administration, if not done properly, one will get a taste from the medication dripping down in the back of your throat so read the administration &quot;how tos&quot; thoroughly before spraying.  It helps.

Basically pointless because it made all the mucus in my nose want to drip out so i had to blow my nose. I had spotty nose bleed too. This is junk. Veramyst works alot better.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	vw9729, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/25/2007 12:31:50 PM	Caused me to have sneezing fits!  I thought this would be better than oral antihistamine and hopefully less drowsy - but immediately upon use, I began having a sneezing fit until all medicine was gone.  I kept taking it, thinking maybe I had to &quot;get used to it&quot;, but it kept happening every time I took it.  Pharmacist nor doctor knew what caused this, so I had to call the pharmaceutical company themselves to finally get someone to tell me I was having an allergic reaction to it.  
Other	gamboarn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	10/19/2007 7:22:46 PM	I was bright and chipper today, expecting to get quite a few things done...After my doctors visit, I took the first dose when I got home, sat down to read some  allergy preventation literature and could not stay awake.  When I got up I was hungry although I had had lunch only 2 hours prior and eating only made my hungrier.  I notice these are expected side effects;  I just took off 12 pounds in the last 10 months and I am not about to gain them back!  I thought a nasal antihistamine would be milder but I guess not!  Not for me.  I will cancel this prespriction and seek some more natural treatments.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	10/8/2007 10:06:38 AM	I have had unusually high ragweed allergy this season.  My head has been stopped up, sore throat, fever, etc. and I also developed bronchitis.  I went to the doctor and she prescribed this med for my head congestion.  This med has not helped much with stuffiness and has done nothing to alleviate any allergy symptoms and has made my sore throat worse due to all the drainage.  But it's better than nothing.  Trying not to blow my nose or sniff after using this medication is difficult.
