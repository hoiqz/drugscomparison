Other	Radar O'Reilly , 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	2/5/2012 11:27:51 AM	I was a 19 year old soldier in Vietnam. I grew up in the dry desert southwest, and when I was exposed to a humid jungle environment, and diesel fumes and road filth/dust (I was in convoys on an open air gun jeep) I developed allergies due to long-term exposure to some nasty stuff (Agent Orange included)...When I got back to the United States, I was diagnosed by the VA having &quot;chronic allergic rhinitus&quot;. As a result, here I am 40 years later with constant post nasal drip which goes into my throat, causing me to constantly clear my throat. I get the worst tickling and gagging sensation in my throat unless I clear it. And when I do so, I get the rudest looks from people when I am out in public (as if I am trying to draw attention to myself...)At the DFW airport late last year while on a brief layover, a woman approached me and asked me if I had ever tried Allegra D. At first I was embarrassed (and a little put-off) but when I got home, I purchased Allegra D and I have found it helps a lot with my ailment (the V.A. has been worthless in helping me, but this over-the-counter drug has been great...) Where Ilive, we have a very nasty tree called the Texas Mountain Cedar, the pollen is nearly toxic! Allegra D helps with this problem, but it isn't perfect for this particular pollen.

Seasonal Runny Nose	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/5/2011 3:10:20 PM	My doctor prescribed Allegra D for my seasonal allergies years ago. I am a type 2 diabeteic who takes Glucotrol xl to controll my blood sugars. Taking Allegra D with Glucotrol caused my blood sugars to drop below 40 for 2 days. I was hospitalized for 3 days put on IV glucose for 3 days and nearly died. There has been no warnings not to take Allegra D if you are on Glucotrol so I want to warn diabetic patients who take oral meds to control thier blood sugars that there could be serious drug interactions. I would have died if I had not been under that hospital care round the clock, I nearly died in the hospital. They had to give me IV boluses og every hour and I was continuously eating and drinking things loaded with glucose and they could not elevate my blood sugars above 50 for 2 days. It took 2 days to completely rid my body of the Allegra D and Glucotrol. I will never take Allegra D again. I have been able to take Zyrtec with no trouble. Today I use a generic for Zyrtec to control my allergies.

I don't get drowsy like I do with Zirtec, others. Claritin doesn't work on me. decongestant is best around. I need antihistamine/decongestant for seasonal allergies and occasional bug bite reactions (facial swelling).  Allegra-D keeps me normal, but is expensive.  Generic not on my insurance formulary accepted list.  Why the heck not?  I am not made of $ money.  Otherwise, so far, so good for 5 years now.

I have severe allergies and was at times unable to function because of stuffy nose, fuzzy head, sneezing, itchy eyes, etc. My only issue with Allegra D 12 hour is that I could only take 1 a day instead of the recommended 2 (12 hours apart of course). Since it is non-drowsy, if I took a dose after about 3pm, I was unable to sleep at night. I did just fine on one dose and my doctor said it was fine as long as I kept taking it and it was working. I recently started a new job and hen my health insurance becomes effective, I hope to get back on Allegra. It is the only allergy medicine that works for me!

However, it has been somewhat ineffective with allergies which effect the swelling and itchy eye problems.

I could do it in the morning but the later one is harder.....and if I take it close to bedtime, I am awake and restless like crazy.  I never have insomnia...I can fall asleep w/in 5 mins any given night but w/ this med, I am all &quot;nervous&quot; feeling....my legs don't want to be still, I feel a slight increase in heart rate and anxiety....and everytime it happens, I swear I will never take the medicine again!  (until my allergies get really bad, then I cave.)  I was fine on the 24 hr pill (once daily) but this one drives me nuts because I am taking it before bed (well, 2 hrs after dinner).  I am going to ask my Dr for a different Rx.

It does raise my heartbeat a bit, but when my doctor switched me to a generic of regular Allegra, it made me so sleepy that I couldn't work.  It works very well and I've tried other medications such as Claritin, which gave me absolutely no relief.

It worked great for several days and then I had a sinus headache on the 7th day.  On the 8th day my heart rate really started racing.  On the 9th and last day, heart rate up again and extreme dry mouth and throat.  I can deal with the dry mouth but the racing heart rate just disturbs me too much.

I am able to go to sleep after taking the medication; however, I did wake up a couple of times during the night. I hope that my doctor can suggest a solution to the sleep problem, so that I can continue to take this medication.

I started using it every other day with the regular Allegra for about a month, then I was just using 1/2 the dosage everyday of Allegra D.  There were a lot of colds going around and it kept me from getting sick.  However, I started having a gagging sensation in my throat, Review #21 said it best-it felt like there was a ball inside stuck in my throat.  When I would swallow it felt like something large was actually going down the esphogus.  I was having so much discomfort I was taking aspirin to lessen that feeling of pressure, gagging.  This was with drinking a lot of water and only half the dosage.  I decided to stop using it to see if the syptoms decreased.  Maybe a little by the 3rd day.  Went to the doctor, I couldn't take it any more.  She suggested I stop the medication-which I had-and use a vaporizer, and gargle with salt water, she saw my throat was very red.  It helped a little.  After a couple of days I tried the regular Allegra due to the sneezing, etc.  This feeling came right back again.  I never experienced this with just regular Allegra.  It dried up my whole body, so be careful in using this drug.  I took it with apple juice, and it didn't dimenish the effects at all. No nausea.

I have trouble taking anything on an empty stomach.  If I eat something little like toast before I take it in the morning the side effects are not as bad.  I was having headache, dry mouth, dizziness, and nausea.  The product does work well you just have to get past the side effects.   I take allergy medication year round,  so I knew I would have to try and figure out how to control the side affects.

My itchy, runny nose, scratchy throat, itchy eyes, are all gone. if i miss a day, believe me, i notice it. it does indeed give you dry mouth, like most decongestants, but drinking lots of water is good for you anyway. i've also learned to take it in the morning instead of at night as it would keep me awake.
