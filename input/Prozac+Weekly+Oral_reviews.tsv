Depression	Prairie Mom, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	10/7/2010 7:12:03 PM	My 14 yr old daughter was on daily Prozac and then switched to weekly--I thought remembering to take it would improve, and that was easier, I only had to tell her once a week.  But after about four weeks, it was like she was taking nothing; she became depressed, suicidal and cut on her arms.  It took another couple of weeks to figure out it was the weekly Prozac causing this change.  I got her switched back to daily Prozac and all was good again. A nightmare.  I imagine the weekly version works well for many, but it was a disaster for my daughter.

I got screaming mad without it. I'm not particularly satisfied with the medicine though. Nothing seems funny anymore and I have no sex drive. I have constant continual headaches, though I don't know if it is from the Fluoxtine or not. Always tired.

Depression	Laura, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	2/20/2009 11:27:49 AM	8 years ago I was diagnosed with manic depression, my doctor put me on prosac, but he didnt organise any phyciatric treatment, after two weeks of taking this drug, I had the feeling of wanting to die, and I thougt no one would miss me, I took one months dosage in one night, to commit suicide.  I had never tried to kill myself previose to this, I had self harmed only.  I survived stopped taking this drug, changed doctors, and saw a thearapist, it took a few but I finally found the right person that I felt comfortable talking to (be patient with therapy) you have to like your therapist or you wont open up.  I am good now, but I still have the occasional low times, I say dont take the drugs dont become addicted to medicines, speak to someone about it, and try herbal remedies, you'll feel great soon, and remember youre not alone, x

Depression		4	4	3			12/20/2008 3:45:37 PM	My doctor prescribed 40 ml of Prozac for my husband and he has been on it for over a year and because he doesn't like medications and wants to be off his Prozac I am wondering if it is a good idea to be taken off them cold turkey. Should he be weined off slowly or just stop taking them?Are there some side effects to doing it this way? Seems like there might be.

Other	Grace, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	11/14/2008 4:45:44 PM	In my experience with co-morbid depression, social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder, this medication did very little for me.  At first I improved a little, but then I hit a plateau and was back to feeling awful.  I've noticed significant insomnia, fatigue, and nausea as prominent side effects.  I've been taking this drug since age thirteen, and now at nineteen, I feel that it's lost its effectiveness completely.  This drug did not help my severe anxiety in the long run.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	9/27/2008 9:01:26 PM	I started taking prozac to help decrease my migranes. I never experienced extreme anxiety problems, and after I started on the 20 mg I felt like I wanted to explode everywhere I went. My anxiety went through the roof! I was lowered to 10 mg and now I feel extremely depressed. Sometimes I dont even want to get out of bed. My legs cramp all the time, I have gained 10 pounds in 3 months. I am planning on getting off of it soon.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/6/2008 12:29:20 PM	I have been taking this drug for approximately 6 years.  It works well for me, it allows me to not worry about things that I can do nothing about.  It also allows me to concentrate better, and to make decisions quickly.  Major side effects for me are low sex drive and difficulty sleeping.  I have to take Benadryl every night to sleep through the night.  Complete arousal takes longer but when aroused, sex is satisfying.
