I stopped and my BP elevated but returned to normal after startin again.  I was told that this medication in addition to controlling my BP was to help in limiting the number of times I need to urinate in the evening.

I only take it at night once daily (because it drops your blood pressure quickly) and I wake up feeling fine!  I used to have to get up 5-6 times per night with the terazosin, but I'm going to stick with Cardura for a very long time!
Other	justfeathers, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male		10/14/2010 12:05:04 AM	I am not sure that it was this drug that has caused his problem's today, but I am not giving him this drug tomorrow until I consult with his doctor. Within an hour after taking his first pill he became sweaty, confused, pale, low BP, labored resporations and low pulse. He has other conditions that could contribute to this, such as diabetes, but his blood surgar was 121, so that was ruled out as a contributing factor. These symptoms has continued throughout the day in a lesser degree. Putting into mind his medical condition, and the fact that the only new medication he has taken in this drug, I feel confident in questioning this drug until I speek to his Primary Care, and his Cardiologist, before continuing treatment.

I was prescribed 1mg doxazosin to use with the candesartan. I suffer from epilepsy which is controlled. I took one tablet only and had a seizure that same evening. I read all the drug information in the leaflet and searched the internet before taking doxazosin, but no mention was made regarding epilepsy. I have spoken to my usual pharmacist and understand that this will be reported.

Medication works well to ease urination.  Any time I have gone off it, symptoms of weak, intermittent urine stream and not empty bladder sensation returns.

After only 1 month it has affected my sexual desire, ability to maintain an erection, caused a dry mouth, sleepiness, fatigue, and heart palpitations. After about 2 weeks, I have also developed a persistent dry cough.

High Blood Pressure	Gaudium, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	65-74	9/6/2009 2:36:41 PM	Doctors tried many drugs to lower by BP without success. I was placed on a 2 mg dose of Cardura.  After my first dose of Cardura my pressure dropped from 190/94 to 116/60.  I was weak and tired for about a week then life returned to normal.  The Daily 2 mg dose of Cardura maintained my BP for almost two years, pressure increased to 180/88 and again doctors attempted to lower it with many other drugs without success.  My Cardura was increased to 4 mg each day and my pressure lowered to 136/76.  I have some of the side effects listed by others including edema of the lower legs but would rather have the side effects than be deceased.  Just a note to the record I am also taking a combination of drugs for the control of my blood pressure this combination fails the minute Cardura is withdrawn.   
High Blood Pressure	EMERSON2D, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	8/21/2009 1:21:15 AM	I have been on 4 other HBP medications prior to the Cardura.  Not working to lower, so doc added Cardura.  This is probably the worst med I've been put on-----Side effects are horrendous, ie.  Extreme dizziness, nausea, insomnia, and extreme lethargy and overall bad feeling.  And no lowering of HBP.
Enlarged Prostate	noscreenname, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	55-64	8/2/2009 12:38:17 PM	Did not notice advertised dizziness, etc.Ramped at 1MG to 2MG to 4MG. 2MG seemed OK short term, 4MG had issues. 4MG completely negated and reversed Androgel treatment for low testosterone, also getting up 2-3 times during the night to urinate. Backed off to 2MG per Dr. At 2MG long term noticed I wake up with &quot;long lasting&quot; hard erection. I also usually sleep through the night w/2MG. All dosages, noticed drowsy-groggy when waking up, slow to wake. Will consult Dr and probably stop treatment. Possibly back to Flomax.
