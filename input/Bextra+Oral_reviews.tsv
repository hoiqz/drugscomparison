Had to lie down, and the bed was spinning, making me nauseous.  Never had such a reaction to anything before.  Scary.

She suffers very badly with rheumatoid arthritis and this was the only thing she could take with her other health problems. It is a shame a few people with other issues that could cause the problems have to screw this up for everyone else.
Other	MAD AS HELL, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/30/2009 8:28:41 AM	I was able to get straight out of bed every morning! It was my miracle pill! I hate you for pulling it off the shelf! If it truly works you take it away from us!! BRING IT BACK! I could function! I took 20mg every day, and for over 4 months I was taking 30 mg every other day no improvements, just that my DR was trying to help with something else (that didnt work) Now I am back to slowly trying to ache my way out of the bed and trying to make my way to the bathroom (I am 39 and look like a 90 yr old!) It takes me a good hour to 2 hours to get my joints moving to halfway function for the day! Thanks for pulling it off the shelf you JERKS! BRING IT BACK !!!!!!! BRING IT BACK !!!!!!!

I was using it for almost 2year's before it was discontinued. Just to say it was effective and I didn't experience any problem's. Sincerely, Miss Darlene
