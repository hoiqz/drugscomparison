It is very dangerous.I was on Lithium at the time of my Haldol injection.  I was upset but not violent.I only weight 140 lbs.  Why did they have to give me injection of Haldol. I've heard it is very dangerous to do so while on Lithium.

Delirium	Haldol deaths, 45-54 Male  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	12/6/2011 8:58:42 AM	This medication is extremely dangerous and I am sure it has been causing deaths all around the country/world.  Pt's have respiratory depression and Haldol cannot be reversed with Narcan.  They need to be placed on a ventilator.  Read the list of all the horrible side effects of this drug.  The packaging is terrible and I am sure that wrong doses are given.  The Haldol kits are extremely dangerous!!!  If you love your patient do not give this medication.  Several patients aspirate!   Aspiration pneumonia is a terrible way to die.  Many patients pick at the air, are combative with smaller doses, larger doses they drool and cannot talk or swallow.

I am still looking for a Lawyer as this Hospital did  nothing for me and only gave me fear of other Hospital settings if I need one in the future

So far it has helped him not become manic. I pray it keeps working. Its been about a year now.

It has been given to my Mom because of her aggressive behavior and surprise all it did was make her even worse. No one will listen to me at the physical rehabilitation facility she's at. I'm very angry!
