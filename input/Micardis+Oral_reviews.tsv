They raise your bp just to get the pill outFinally a b.p. drug without the hacking cough associated with Lisinopril and other generic ace drugs. I have not had any of the side effects mentioned in alot of these reviews. My doctor and I are quite satisfied with the resulting lowered bp.  
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/3/2012 8:46:41 AM	I was put on this drug before minor surgery, I suffered 6mos. of diarrhea, my Dr. thought it was from the hospital stay, after 6mos. my face swelled up, all are possible side effects which stopped after the drug was stopped. The bowl problem continues because of the of loss of muscle tone.  
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	7/31/2012 8:00:16 PM	This drug worked well in lowering and controlling my high blood pressure.  However, it caused my hair to thin and fall out terribly. I had to stop taking it for that reason.

High Blood Pressure	JMS, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	35-44	6/26/2012 3:30:32 PM	First of all, this medication causes me to lose all my energy at top of lower back pains, and what's worst and it might sound gross but since I was started on it about a month ago, It has increased my stools from once(1) every day to numerous(5-7) times per day. Secondly, I don't know about every where else but here in Texas, it is above $100 for a thirty(30) day supply which for me is a little too steep in price.

It has brought my BP down from 180/112 to 118/68.  But, my hair is thinning, I am always tired, any exertion causes me to feel like my chest will explode, and it causes excessive sweating (not great for a woman in menopause) and the blister pack is a pain to get into!  This is the only BP med I am on at 40mg once a day but I am starting to &quot;get tired&quot; of the side effects.  For me, cost is nominal since we have very good insurance but I was told by my doctor that there will be a generic version coming out in 2013.  I am going to file my side effects with the FDA just in case.

This is a definite - and NOT rare - side effect if the forums of hundreds (possibly thousands) of women including me are to be believed.  Being told we should be grateful by an idiot male doctor who has no idea how devastating this is for women is the final insult.

Effectiveness is diminished if taken with any juices, many side effects, such as dry skin, headaches, dizziness and muscle cramps can be eliminated by drinking LOTS of water.  Have to use scisors to get into the blister pack.

Took this and it is back down to normal (120/80).  I had a few side effects in the beginning...first week I just felt WIERD.  LIKE REALLY WIERD.  Hard to explain but it was like I couldn't settle down and just felt very strange.  After that - it went away.  I've been on it for about 3 weeks and although my b/p is great, I am still quite tired from the medication.  Staying on it and hoping that it passes.

I black out from not being able to catch my breath from the coughing spells.  I used to be a singer, but due to the dry tickle that never ceases, i hardly get to sing at all anymore. I've also noticed some edema around ankles, but it is not enough to be worrisome.  The cough is bad enough that I will request to be given another med asap.  It is truly debilitating...

High Blood Pressure	concerned, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Male	55-64	8/14/2010 2:52:46 PM	I have had skipping heart beats, rashes and skin problems and believe this drug may have contributed to my being scheduled for a heart catheter procedure to determine why my stress test produced abnormal results. Not to scare anyone I do have an athletic heart (normal low heart beat)that I understand can cause false positives. However, the other side effects, dry skin, anxiety, weakness, fatigue etc, in addition to those mentioned above and by other authors is very troubling. I have heard about the cancer issue and suggest follow up with physicians. I asked my cardiologists and he had heard about it and plans to research and discuss the issue with me further. In addition, the medicine has no generic and can therefore, be expensive. I hope to be taken off it soon and hopefully find an alternative effective generic combination that works. The problem is in combination with norvasc and hctz, micardis has been very effective. I run a lot and other drugs were causing me problems in working out. I had to be taken off of those and the above combination was found effective. The thing to remember (as I thing most of us that have been dealing with high blood pressure for a while) is that there are many different blood pressure medications available. Don't be afraid to work with your doctor and pharmacist in order to find the best combination for you. We must be our own patient advocates. I plan to get off of micardis if I can find a cost effective alternative.

It's usually 140/90 or higher. I have a real bad problem with side effects but so far the least problems with the 40 mg. Headache, sometimes trouble sleeping, itching and loose stools. The worst problem is shortness of breath because I'm asthmatic. Another worry is weight gain. Am I gaining weight directly from use of the drug or from being too tired to exercise like I use to??? My dr gives me samples because of my problem with side effects and the lack of effectiveness to lower my bp with other drugs. This is my 7th rx in 5 months.

Dropped my BP from 193/120 to 120/70 within a day or two. Recently my Dr. tried me on Lisonopril due to it's lower cost and it was a disaster, BP plummetted, started passing out and heart beat irregular.  Went back on Micardis and all problems disappeared.  My only problem with it is the high cost, but I will work it out somehow to stay on this medication.

My blood pressure had gone into the prehypertensive stage and stayed there for several months (and made me uncomfortable, face was flushed, skin in my hands felt tight, etc.). My doctor put me on Micardis and my BP has stayed in the normal range since. I haven't noticed any side effects. I exercise regularly (primarily swimming), which, I have done for many years.

Micardis got my blood pressure down to 105/65. I do seem to have a fast heartbeat on occassion and ringing in ears. Also seem to get out of breath for some reason. Compared to other medications, these side effects seem to be minor. I hope I will not develop any other side effects with continued use.

My moods got out of control and felt like I had no reason for living. I stopped taking the drug after 3 weeks and have been back to normal emotionally and have been able to handle stress like I use to do.I would never take the drug again. Also due to the inability to handle sress my b/p went up instead of down.Better now on no drugs!

However, have noticed weakness at times as others have indicated. Light-headed,  on occasion. The thing that I am concerned with is the tinusitis (ringing in the ears). I read one reviewer who had experienced the same. I am convinced this medication has something to do with it. I was on other BP meds with no such symptoms until I started micardis. Went to ear specialists who did not agree. I wonder has anyone else experienced this ringing in the ears. It is very annoying and would cause me to search for alternative if it is causing the symptoms. BTW, agree blister packs are ridiculous. Surely, they can design something better!   
High Blood Pressure	Sarmajor, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	5	Male	55-64	2/9/2009 3:35:52 PM	This works well for use once per day.  There is no sudden decrease or elevations in BP once you are on a regular schedule.  I have suffered no side effects and my doctor seems quite satisfied with my past few readings.

Don't think I would have noticed this if I took my meds in morning. Well now Ive been put on bystolic a beta blocker just took my first dose tonight. I can't help but think that Micardis has played some part in my aortic artery problem since it was not keeping my pressure down all the time.I would recommend for everyone to check their pressure a couple of hours before your next dose just to be safe. and also after a stressful day your med if working properly should hold your pressure to normal regardless of stress level. wish they would package it to be alittle easier to get out of blister pack.

Vasotec left me feeling tired, fatigued &amp; unwilling to execise as I normally did, despite a low 5 mg dose.    No side effects with Micardis after almost 3 years, maybe a slight increase in itchiness, but am not really sure.    Best thing is HBP is under control !

However, I have had horrible muscle cramps, including feeling like I &quot;threw my back out&quot; after NOT having injured it. I didn't realize that these symptoms were potential side effects of this medicine until recently. I will likely not discontinue use of it as I have had otherwise positive results.

I was &quot;back to normal&quot; so to speak 120/80 in about 4 weeks upon my revisit to the doctor.  I haven't experienced any side effects thus far and believe that this drug works for HBP for those that can take it depending on case by case basis.

Even when I applied a bandage or pressure  it did not stop the bleeding immediately but took abotu 15 to 20 min. This drung really worked to control my blood pressure and I had no side effects other than this bleeding problem which really worried me.  The only other problem was the difficulty I had getting this drug out of the blister packets because of my arthiritis in my hands.

Before Micardis, it ran around 110-115/50-60.  Now it isn't unusual for it to run 130-140/60-100.
