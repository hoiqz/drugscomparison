All problems increasing in intensity. Stopped the medication. Everything back to normal within 3 days. Was then put on Norvasc. See review on 4/3/09.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/22/2009 1:46:14 AM	Have been on Diovan HCT for over 5 years with no side effects. Had previously used Lisinopril with a resulting nagging cough that kept my wife and myself up all night.I see there were a few complaints about too low BP on this drug, but with high dosages. You should tell your Dr about this and try a lower dose. I am a 49 year old male 6'2&quot; 275 lb and only take an 80/12.5 dose.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	9/16/2008 2:59:13 PM	This medication lowered my BP to 106/64 within 1 week of starting it at 160 mg. I was weak and unable to perform my normal walking and Jazzercise activities and I am now trying Benicar 10 mg. I had previously switched from Benazapril 10 mg which actually worked better for me but caused a severe cough.  I'm hoping Benicar is the answer.  I was not happy with the majority of comments on Benicar but there were a few very happy users so I'm hopeful.
