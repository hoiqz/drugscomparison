Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/7/2011 5:36:10 PM	I have been using this for 2 months now. The first time I used it, my face was a little red and itchy. The next day, back to normal and I haven't had that reaction again. My skin is clear, oil-free and radiant.
Acne	purple123, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	10/15/2011 1:47:15 AM	This does work, but lately I have been having stomach issues and I am hoping it is not from this yet it seems very much so like it is(if you have read the more serious side effects) I would be careful and do not use to much. 
Acne	birdy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	6/14/2010 6:46:10 AM	I only put somewhat, because I have some questions. Can you put this all over your face, just not in spots, because thats what my dr. prescribed, but I think I need it all over. Also, I use finacea (a rosacea cream) on my face at night and cant use both at once, so is this stuff visible? can you put makeup over it? I used to use benzamycin which was very noticable- just wondering- and does it have antibiotics in it?

Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	13-18	11/28/2009 11:42:21 PM	I have used benzaclin for about 5 months. It started out really well but lately hasn't been working as well.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	11/17/2009 3:01:13 PM	I have been using the generic form of Benzaclin on my face and back. It was extremely difficult to find the generic form. I've been using it for almost a month and have seen no difference in my acne and have ruined several shirts and sheets despite allowing it to dry before putting on a shirt.
Acne	Plastic, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/13/2009 9:44:40 AM	I am using the generic version of Benzaclin. I do have the side effects listed on this site of the itching, burning! It hurts and is quite annoying but I am sure it is going to be well worth it, I am using this along with my Retin-A gel and hopefully things will progress to get rid of these under the skin pimples I have had since highschool. Plus the new breakouts now and then..
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/28/2009 12:02:54 AM	This product has been amazing at treating my adult acne.  I started getting acne as an adult about a year ago and could not find anything that would effectively treat it.  It also became painful so I decided to go to the dermatologist.  He prescribed Benzaclin and I found relief within two days (my acne was almost completely gone).  I have been using it for three months and my skin is now clear.
Acne	luanlegacy, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	13-18	8/27/2009 10:41:50 PM	I've been using Benzaclin for just about a week now, and I haven't really noticed a spefific difference. but during the 5 days I've used it, I've developed 3 HUGE/painful cysts on my face. like absolutely terrible, and goign to highschool, thats not something you want. i want to give it a good review, but i just don't see results, I might write again after I've used it longer, but right now. its preety mediocre
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/23/2009 10:34:02 AM	I am 24 years old and really started breaking out when I was about 20. I have tried everything to help get rid of the acne, and this has been the only thing that has really ever helped me. When not using the medication, I get all types of breakouts (whiteheads, blackheads, under the skin etc.) and once I get my rx refilled and start using this again, I see an almost immediate improvement. The only downside that I have found is that there is no generic of the medication, which would be more cost effective for me. But this works great for me!
Acne	2hot4ewe,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/21/2009 7:42:39 PM	I am 33 years old and started developing acne for the first time when I turned 30. Ive been using this for 2 years and my skin has never looked better. Only downside is its drying so I be sure to use a light moisturizer during the day which relieves the dryness. 
Acne	sweetnis600, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/27/2009 1:37:42 AM	I have been using benzalin for about two months, and its's worked pretty well...I can't say that i have bad acne but i did have small &quot;under the skin&quot; pipples always lurking(it has totally helped reduce those).I generally got bad zits around my period it has definitly helped calm those breakouts also.I still get a red bad boy here or there but it does shorten the life span. I hope this helps anyone in need i have tried close to everything and have had no where near these results.I say try it GOOD LUCK!!! 
Acne	mimosa_1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/6/2009 3:47:48 PM	I've been using benzaclin for 2 weeks now, and in combination with minocycline, so far it's the only thing that has worked for my adult acne. Great product!!
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/16/2009 5:49:48 PM	I used a lot of OTC stuff and didn't get much results. Finally I found something that helped but didn't completely take all the acne away which was the Philosophy treatment OTC. However, now I switch to this acne medicine and am now seeing better results faster. It's only been 3 days and we'll see how it goes. I only use it at night because I'm afraid of the over drying and I'm still seeing the results. I also use a moisturizer. 
Acne	Acne-phobia female, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/28/2009 3:17:58 PM	I have had acne since I was 18yrs, have tried everything: Obagi, retin A, proactive, clarisonic brush, department store creams...you name it, I never looked at the price tag since all I wanted was the acne to be OUT OF MY FACE. Nothing worked for me, I have been using Benzaclin along w/cetaphil face wash and cetaphil moisturizer for about 1 week and already see the difference, nothing is completely gone but I can tell the medication is working since my acne has gone down dramatically. Thank God for Benzaclin, trust me, I have spend good $$$ and nothing worked before. The side effects are not bad at all for me, I'm a Latino female 33 yrs old and my face is not red, a little dry than usual, but that should be somethin good, right? Good luck to you all 
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/25/2009 12:23:19 PM	I am 33 yrs. old and started to get acne all over my face but mainly on my cheeks.  I've had acne in the past but it was controllable. It became so bad I thought I might get scars.  I tried proactive and every other otc med I could find.  I finally went to a dermatologist who gave me antibiotics and three different types of cream, one of which was benzaclin.  Benzclin was the only thing that worked.  It has been three months now and my skin is the clearest it has ever been.  I highly recommend that anyone who has problem acne try this product.  Initially I used it twice a day, now I use it just once at night.  It does not dry out my skin or make it red and sensitive.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/8/2009 11:30:49 AM	I'm now 24 and I've suffered from acne since I was 12.  I've use Proactive and also a combination prescription pill/cream and Benzaclin is the ONLY thing that has worked for me.  I'm really not sure if people are slathering it on or what but I just do a thin layer in the morning and wait five minutes and it's never stained or bleached my clothes.  I use Cetaphil daily facial moisturizer with SPF 15 and have never had any skin dryness or sunburn while using Benzaclin.  It's just amazing.  The only thing I would say is don't quit if your skin gets better!  It will get worse again and it takes some time for Benzaclin to start working.  Great product, life saver, and cheaper than the combined costs of the hundreds of OTC remedies I've tried.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/1/2009 11:12:06 PM	I've struggled with acne since I was a preteen. My doctors have tried a mulitude of meds, but my new dermatologist put me a daily routine that includes benzaclin. I was my face day and night with a prescription medicated wash and use benzaclin in the morning and retin-a micro at night. While I have experienced the typical peeling, redness and burning, the combination of the three have kept my blackheads, pimples and cysts at bay. 
Acne	Elle707, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	12/26/2008 10:39:54 AM	I have only been using Benzaclin for a few days now, but I already see a difference. It shrank two cysts dramatically already. I have been using it twice a day and it is drying and leaves your skin pink, but it doesn't look bad. Be sure to use a non comedogenic moisturizer. My skin is also much smoother all over.
Acne	freebird, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	10/5/2008 12:17:11 PM	I'm a 35yr old female w/ cystic acne, I've tried everything you can buy over the counter and nothing helped. I finally went to my doctor, he put me on Benzaclin and it has helped alot more than any of the stuff I've tried before. He also put me on Bactroban Cream which is really good, if not better than the Benzaclin. I hope this info will help someone else. :)

Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/29/2008 10:08:12 PM	I am a 24 yr old female with sudden awful cystic acne on my neck and chin.  My doctor put me on benzaclin along with a tetracycline antibiotic 6 days ago and all the acne has already dissapeared!!  The red scars are still there but diminishing by the day.  This is some GREAT stuff!!  It didn't dry my face out either...which is great!  I'd definately recommend it!
Acne	katiepaw2000@comcast.net, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	5	3	Male	19-24	5/5/2008 9:35:33 PM	this seemed to clear up my acne more than anything i have tried in the past. i have been on numerous other treatments.
Acne		1	5	1			5/2/2008 11:20:37 AM	I used this for over eight months - the only thing it did was bleach my clothes and dry my skin.  After eights months I ended up having the same bad acne but with dry skin.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	19-24	3/24/2008 1:02:20 AM	I also used ProActive and it was ineffective for me. I have only been using this for a few days, but my skin feels cleaner and reduces redness almost instantly! I recommend it if you're thinking about topical things to try!
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	1/22/2008 11:54:56 PM	I think it works very well, I just forget to use it frewuently. But overall it works very well.
Acne	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	13-18	1/4/2008 11:26:32 PM	It worked, and once my prescription ran out, it started to get worse, but not that much; the drug cleared up a lot but it took a while.
Acne		5	5	5			11/5/2007 4:40:52 PM	Nothing else worked for me...this is a great acne medication. I recommend it highly.

Acne	rhock1213, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	3	4	Female	25-34	10/11/2007 12:10:48 PM	I have been using benzaclin since may and i have not had any breakouts, my skin is very smooth now. i have used proactive in the past and it did not work. The only problem with benzaclin is that it will bleach your clothes. I have switched to wearing it at night instead of the morning for that reason. It says to use it twice a day but i find once is enough for me. I am very happy that my doc perscribed it for me, it is a great acne med.
Acne	BGriggers1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	9/26/2007 11:13:16 PM	I have used this along with a Bezoil Peroxide Wash and the results have beenthe best I have experienced. I am 48 yearold female who did not begin having acne problems until my late 30's.  It has beenvery severe at times.
