Chronic Pain	lkj1002, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	8/1/2012 7:09:11 PM	Easy to use but a bit to take effect.  Dr had me try 15 then 30 then 60 then 100 mgs twice a day.  The 100mg worked okay but I experienced a lot of breakthrough pain (cannot even stand for 5 minutes without excruciating pain in mid and low back).  By itself it took my pain level from a 10 to a 8 at best.  When my dr changed me from 100mg 2x daily to 60mg 3x daily it helped more. Took pain down to 6. But I still need other meds for breakthrough pain.  Combined I'm at least able to have a better quality of life though I warn others that suffer as I do and are on strong meds to not overdo it. It's hard to not be able to do all the things I did 15 years ago but I had to learn the hard way if I push myself too hard with house work or playing with my son, I end up spending a couple of days in bed due to aggravating my symptoms, which are many. Pay attention to your body and listen to it when it's telling you to slow down.

Chronic Pain	chaz, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	7/20/2012 6:23:18 PM	I was on oxycontin for 3 years . Insurance did not want to cover it so I asked the Dr. for a generic , there are none for oxycontin . He suggested ms contin , have been on it for 6 months and it is 80% cheaper than oxycontin and actually works better . I take it 3 x a day 20 mg . provides continuous pain relief for me

My L3 to S2 vert. blew out, and they are now fused, with a titanium cage. For the last 7 years, I have been taking 40mg of Oxycontin x3 a day, and x5 10/325 Perc.Workers Comp. decided the Oxycontin was too expensive after all these uears, so as of last week, I now take this Mscontin. It helps, not as well as the others, but its OK. Only thing is I have had TERRIBLE acid reflux since the start of taking this med. 
Chronic Pain	im in pain, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/17/2012 4:46:03 PM	Im a 40 year old female and suffer with many illness's. First being Fybro. and chronic lower back pain due to a narrowing of my lover spine. I have 3 ruptured disks and several pertruding as well. I have had over 10 surgerys on my abdomin because of a hernia repair more than six years ago. and Im currently on an atobiotic for another staff infection iside that wound that is closed. The doctors have opened my stomach up so many times trying to figure out why I keep getting abssess inside my abdomin,but no luck, Ive worn a wound vac for a year strieght, and Ive been in the hospital more times than you can ever imagine. Johns Hopkins had me on 12 10/325 perks + 2 60mg MS contins. + 4-6 Hydrocodone 10mg A DAY !! on top of all my other meds like zoloft, levsin{for IBS }. Gabapentin 1600 mg a day, Diazapam for muscle spasms.and 2 different blood presure medications.....I couldnt keep up! I missed several doses of alot of the medications,and wasnt really taking all of the medicine like I was supposed to be. I thought of myself as a &quot;pill head&quot;I was taking 30 to 40 pills a day. well, my insurance changed and they stopped paying for a few of my medications one being the perks.... my doctor wouldnt listen to me whenI told him that all that acedameniphine is not good for me anyway,so I went to another doctor that my friend recomended, He has been GOD SENT! He Understands my pain,and feelings, and If I take an extra Pill or two during the month and come up a few days short,he never says a word. He is Heaven sent,Im not taking all those pills anylonger, I take 1 60mg Ms contin and 4-6 30 mg oxys a day, THank You DR. PMG........LE
Chronic Pain	missg, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	5/18/2012 4:20:07 PM	I've taken just about everything - and currently have a Med-tronic stimulator.  I have also had three internal pain pumps - with everything from morphine to delaudid (sp) in them. I have 5 ruptured disks, DDD, fibro, and sciatica pain.  I also have considerable arthritis.  I was on Norco 10/325 -4txs prn  and having pain levels of 7-9. I had been through 10+ years of Pain management and was fed up with it.  Shots, pokes, nerve burnings.. and a doctor that would barely give medication.  However, I ran into the wonderful world we live in now where everyone is a drug addict, and everyone is seeking pills to gulp, or sell.  This is a huge problem that needs an answer... especially for people like us, the silent sufferers.  Even with proof, we are being discriminated against.  I have been unable to obtain a &quot;regular physician&quot;.  It may reach a point where we need lawyers to procure doctors.  At any rate... Went back to Pain Management and a wonderful doctor heard me, and prescribed ms contin.  It is working well, but I itch so badly.  I am also so groggy.  I don't want to stop taking it because for the first time in over a year my pain level is down from a 7-8 to about a 3-4.  I don't like the decrease in energy level however.. Hope it gets better soon.  But this stuff works.  Thank God for understanding physicians, and folks that write in comments - so that we know we aren't alone... God Bless.

Hipman, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	35-44	5/5/2012 1:40:27 PM	I have had back surgery due to a cyste on my spinal cord that was found after I had a MRI due to back pain. After my Surgery the Dr. Informed me that I was unfortunate due to having discovered that I have Arachnoiditis. throughout my entire thorasic region of my spine. I take 30 mg. of ms. contin twice a day. and they are really not helping anymore at all. From all the abuse by people now in the world. I know my dr. is afraid to give any more of a dose. I tell him they dont help anymore and he gave me lyrica, and cymbalta along with the 30 mg twice a day for the pain. all three have been working good for a while but back in the same boat again now with the sever pain. It is ashame that people like myself that require pain manage ment have to suffer becouse of the abouse by the drug dealers and addicts. I know people that take 3 times as much of this drug for a problem that is 10 times less sever then my problem. well just want to say this medicine works but the tolerance level is tough. thanks for your timeg. hipman !!!
Other	feelin better finally, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/3/2012 10:29:15 PM	I am a caregiver of a man that has a lot of painful issues and he has taken about four differant types of morphine over the yrs. and I have seen that the 100mg 3x's per day with oxycodone for breakthrough pain has absolutely changed his life and although it is not for everyone, it really helps him , but he does get VERY CONSTAPATED**like one bm per week if he is lucky, and he can not handle the heat at all, he has hot flashes too, but they are all worth it because his pain went from a 10plus to a 7 and that is fantastic!!! He is pleased with the medication and as long as it isn't too hot outside, he can go places unlike prior to being put on this drug. It does work and it works well but it is not for all , it can cause a lot of side effects and don't EVER TAKE MORE THAN YOU ARE TOLD BY YOUR DOCTOR!!!This drug can and will kill you if you take even a half of a pill more than you are supposed to, if you miss a dose, talk to your dr. asap so he can tell you how you personally should approach that,if not, call your pharmacist right away, he knows a lot and you can really depend on the pharmacy because they spend more time with us than the doctors, lol. No , but they really do get to know you better than your doctor becuase you can call them and actually spend time speaking with him or her when you have any questions. Good Luck and Take as perscribed at all times, this is a very serious medication and keep it cool, and not in the bathroom . It will mess up the quality of the medication by getting moist.
Severe Pain	kittylilly3, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/3/2012 9:58:46 PM	I have been taking 100mg ms contin for nearly two years and it is a wonderful help to me and although I am in a powerchair all of the time,I am able to do a lot more than I was prior to being put on this medication and I do have to take a breakthrough medication somedays , the real bad days but this is such a helpful medication for me and for my personal situation. I do not want anyone to read this and think that it is a 'cure all' , but it has changed my life for the best and for as long as I have been taking it, it still works just as well as it did the day I started taking it. To all, this is a very serious medication and if you can avoid taking such a strong medication, please  do, this will end up changing so much in your life if you take it before you need something so strong. Be very careful and try to take drug holiday's, meaning take a little less for one month at a time, I take one pill a day less every three months so that I can keep my body from drowning in the pain relief. It is good to have a little pain sometimes and do try to take as low a dose as you can for as long as you can and try to switch from this to another medication , talk to your dr. about changing this medication every few months so that you don't become too used to it. Good Luck and Be Smart

Severe Pain	luvsdoxies , 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/15/2012 7:34:27 AM	I was diagnosed w/autoimmune dx 45 yrs ago, I am now 58. Taken nearly every potent med, Imuran, Plaquenil, Decadron, Cytoxan, Cellcept, Prednisone. Was taking Norco 10/325, but needed to take 2 tabs every 4-6 hrs to control my pain.. I cannot take pain meds like ibuprofen, NSAIDs due to stage 4 kidney disease. Finally saw a pain specialist, she tried me on Duragesic Patches which I didn't even get the script filled because I didn't want to be a zombie. Tried Lyrica, hated it, daytime sleepiness, wt.  gain. Finally started me on MS Contin  15 mg three times a day w/Norco for breakthrough pain. I've had no drowsiness, some upset stomach which, if I take the pain med while eating, no problem. This new med regime has greatly helped me! The difficult part is to take the MS Contin  3 times a day when there is no pain! I now understand the MS Contin needs to stay in my system so the pain doesn't get out of control.I am concerned about addiction but I can't function when in pain. I am trusting that God will continue to take care of me as He always has. I probably will never be off pain meds. I am so thankful this wonderful pain doctor took the time to work w/me to find a combination of meds that help me enjoy life again. I hope each of you are able to give this med a chance and I pray that you find some relief as I have.
Chronic Pain	D, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	2/2/2012 3:50:13 AM	I have multiple spinal issues resulting from chronic osteomylitus (due to infection after surgery)I have tried alot of pain meds since 2007!I was put on Ms contin 30 mg 3 times a day in addition to Hydromorphone 2 mg 6 a day.Since being on this med ( 1/2 months) i have had pretty good pain control. I however asked the dr to ween me off this drug due to side effects.I having issues with:  not being able to urinate, mental alertness (remembering) stomach problems...nausea and stomach pain and also dizziness due to it lowering blood pressure. I also have sleep apnea and have a C-PAP machine and i do not sleep well due to not breathing well at night, this med makes it worse and i wake up alot at night.I see people on much more dose than i was on, and seem not to have issues. For me personally the side effects are too dangerous for.. my health, and it is not worth taking all the risks. i will be in pain the rest of my life...swimming and stretching and trying to get stronger is th RX i am going with!  I am keeping the hydromorphone still for some pain control...i will go with stretching and swimming and meditation and try to deal with the pain. I just had dr change orders today..so not sure how it will go!   But this drug had too many side effects for  me to continue taking it.

This comes after years of trying so many differant combos and about 5 years to get to the level I am currently taking.It may seem like alot but if I listed everything wrong with me you would understand. Anyway my thing is this: Why so much difference in effectivness between brands? Name brand not withstanding (no ins. co. will pay) Anyway I find in this order BEST to WORST: Endo,ABG (watson),M squared (mallincrodt). The endos and abg are good the mallies suck. can anyone explain this?

Chronic Pain	Jimmy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	11/29/2011 1:58:32 PM	I have degenerative disc disease complicated by failed back surgery syndrome (I am fused from L1-S1 with instrumentation) and have been a chronic pain sufferer for nearly 15 years.  I had 13 neck/back surgeries, and have been on varying pain meds (including and intrathecal morphine pump) over the years, and on varying doses, from as low as 30mg 4X daily to 130mg 4X daily.  I have been on the same dose of MS Contin for over 5 years - 60mg 4X daily.  I receive 'adequate' pain relief, but it could be better.  The most effective med I've had is Oxycontin - but it is very difficult to get doctors to prescribe this due to the abuse/sales potential.  It's a shame that us folks having well-documented conditions cannot receive just what we need to releive pain as much as possible.  But, the dose I now take allows me to walk and be fairly 'normal.'  The multiple back/neck surgeries, coupled with the DDD left me with pretty limited abilities.  I also take meds for 'breakthrough' pain, but really don't like taking the short duration meds.

I have been on pain med's for 10-15 years for injury's due to no fault of my own. There has been times that I think that the doctors have been reluctant to prescribe enough med's for what ever reasons. I went to my disability hearing and came home feeling the worst I ever have, because the pain, injurys, doctors, all and everything involved in this has cost me everything in life I love, was ready to die, prayed daily to die in any way. I recieved a call in the evening of the same day saying that I had a appointment with this doctor whom I had never heard of. I was broke, lost everything, no insurance, nothing. It was GODS calling, I went to this doctor and as soon as he walked in I knew god had sent him. I'm at month (3) and my life is slowing changing for the better, my pain is relieved 100%, and I'm not high and depressed like I was. I'm able to sit down and write and cumunicate and feel better than I have in years. I can see light at the end of the tunnel, there is hope I know for sure.  Thank you GOD and Dr._______ because I had givin up, and that is the truth. Morphine (MS Contin) has changed everything and given me hope to go on and I have lost everything and I'm in my late 40's.

MS Conting 15 mg 2x per day, percocet for b/t pain.This medication does work for me for consistent pain relief. One problem is that when I take Oxycodone (5mg/325mg) for breakthrough pain, it makes me extremely tired. The sedation effect is relatively short though. Also, I do experience some fluid retention. Concerned about tolerance--curious about how long it will be before I need to adjust the dose/meds.

I have 2 herniated discs in cervical, 7 bulging in thoracic and 2 herniated in lumbar area. I was on a different med. but went up and down and made me crazy. This med. has been the best for long time chronic pain. I do not go up and down anymore. I do have meds. for break thru pain and do use them but using MS-Contin twice a day has made my life more fulfilled and I am not always trapped in the house, in bed. I have been on this med. for a long time and have had to adjust. Changing the break-thru med. over the years also has helped. For long term even pain relief this med. does help more than other meds. and with no cravings or up and down feelings.
Chronic Pain	gratefullypainfree, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/4/2011 8:46:02 AM	I am taking this medication because I suffer from osteoarthritis in my spine and also have a bulging disc in my lumbar region. My pain management doctor started me on a regiment of ten mgs of oxycodone three times a day and then increased me to a 15 mgs of oxycodone fou times a day. The 15mgs of oxy took care of my pain to a point where I cold actually be fully functional again but the medication was wearing off too quickly. At my last appointmen he added MS Contin 15mg twice a day to help reduce my breakthrough pain. It works great! Now I don't have to worry about my oxycodone wearing off and being in pain while waiting to take my next dose. I have a four month old son (I rarely used any opiate pain medication while pregnant only about once a week when in SEVERE pain) and being on this medication allows me to be able to take care of my son in a way that I would not be able to if I had to stay in bed all day because of chronic pain. I am so grateful that I found a doctor who believes me and does not think that I am just a drug seeker wanting to get high. If I did not have this medication I would not be able to even pick my son up without pain never mind walk around with him while he is crying or push his stroller, I am very happy to have my life back. The only side effect that slightly bothers me is I do get very itchy from this medication but I have been taking Benedryl with my dose twice a day and that helps a lot.

I have herinated discs in my back and neck. I have neorpathy pain in my feet. I am insulin dependent diabetic. I have taken vicodin, perocets, dermoral, neurotins since 1996. I have gotten little relief from any of those medications. So i started seeing a pain management dr yesterday and he suggested that I try 15mg of morphine twice a day along with my 900mg of neurotin a day and see if this helps me. I  also got to have the injections done and physical therapy...not sure if any of these will help me as I am in constant pain all the time. have trouble sleeping at night, if i am lucky i sometimes get to sleep for 2 hours and then i am back up again. So hopefully these will help me, keeping my fingers crossed.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	superchargedzombie, 25-34 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	8/2/2011 3:56:49 AM	For the first time in 8 years I am finally mostly pain free.  I can tell that I have an existing injury but it no longer makes me want to break down and cry.  
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	FibroPatient, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	55-64	7/29/2011 8:43:06 PM	I take this medication for the chronic, and often acute, pain of fibromyalgia. I also take oxycodone for breakthrough pain. The worst side effect of the MSContin has been constipation, until I hit upon a mixture of Mira-Lax twice a day (over the counter powder) and eating a combination of Fiber One Original cereal daily, large doses of carrots and less often, celery. Taking the narcotics and other meds, along with the successful treatment of constipation, make many days tolerable, although rarely joyous. I still have enough pain to think of suicide but have never moved to act upon these thoughts. I also suffer from pain-induced nausea, for which I take rectal suppositories of compazine, as needed. They often work. I sleep O.K. some nights and poorly others. I also now exercise, with a combination of walking, hiking and yoga. There are days I'm happy that I can just get out of bed and watch T.V., and other days when I can exercise, grocery shop, socialize a bit and read books and newspapers. Without the MSContin, I would live one day of hell after another. My initial diagnosis in the 1990s lead to a series of physical therapies and low-dose narcotics. However, the pain always returned, quickly and severly. I had to give up my career. I stopped exercising, going out with friends, staying in touch with the world. Some drugs induced weight gain; I went from slim to obese before battling back. I sunk into dark depression. Since treatment with mild narcotics failed, I was switched three separate times to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory prescription meds. However, all 3 times, I had to stop because of severe gastric problems. I returned to gradually greater and stronger doses of opiods. It wasn't until some years after starting MsContin that I began to retake parts of my life. However, I still suffer bouts of depression, am largely reclusive and now have undiagnosed foot pain from hiking. Still, I thank God for the caring doctors who have trusted me with narcotics.

Rarely do I have to use my msir. There doesn't seem to be the peaks and valleys that you can sometimes get when having to take a medicine such as this for a chronic condition. I have been lucky and have had NONE of the g.i. side effects.    *****

Spinal Cyst pressing on my spinal cord and less than 5 disks remain that haven't herniated or severely bulging. Up to Ms cotton 100mg 3/d and Dilaudid (HYDROmorphone HCI) 8mg for break through pain. After about 5-6 months I can tell that I have more movement and stability than I did. However my body is starting to adjust to this. Right now working with pain management to &quot;get me comfortable&quot; so instead of adding another dose or stronger dose we addressed the lack of sleep issue due to pain which is now controlled with Nuerontin (sp). It's still too early to tell if the extra rest my body gets will have any impact on the continued strength of the narcotics.Until I became used to this medication I found that as long as you follow the dosing correctly you will get some relief.

This surgery failed which of course left me with failed back syndrome. This being the most painful experience of my life. The subsequent four &quot;fix&quot; surgeries were a living hell. There wasn't enough pain medication on the planet to control my pain. Finally making it through this horrible experience began my ride on the opiate roller coaster. Norco, Vicoden, Percodan, Fentanyl Patches, Oxycontin, Dilauded and finally MS Contin 200mg twice a day with Oxycodone 30mg 4-6 day. This regime has allowed me to live my life with some kind of normalcie with my pain under control.

Have graduated to the 60 mil twice a day now and it works great.Im able to do the Perks less. Problem, my new pain man. guy wants to get me off the MS and start with Gabapentin. That has lots of side effects, its also addictive and I dont know why bother? I do well now with MS &amp; Perk's, its like trading one evil for another right that may or may not work? Gabapentin is a nerve blocker, non narcotic, but as bad probably worse side effects, people die on it, serious side effects, and people die on it ?? dunndeal57@aol.com, Gary

I bent over one day and all I felt was a pop and that was that. Needless to say after 9-years of doctors telling me there is nothing wrong with me, I finally found one that sent me in for an MRI. Where they found out I had at one time fractured my spine. (it was an abusive relationship where he bounced me off a wall. back then I didn't think anything other than I bruised my back) I had my stomach stapled and developed osteoporosis. The bone got so thin it could not support anymore and T-9 thoough T-12 caved in. They will not do surgery until I can no longer control bladder.

I've been to a millions drs to no avail. Finally got to the Headache Clinic and found a dr that honestly works with you to control pain. Before starting this med, I had a headache 24/7 with SEVERE migraines at least 3 times a week. Upon starting this med, I actally had a short period of time when my head didn't hurt. Had never experienced that and it was amazing! My tolerance has built up and am currently taking 120mg/day, 60 in the morning and 60 in the evening. Have Toradol and Phenergan injectable for breakthu pain.  Have had little bad reactions to the med. Initially I had some itching, but it went away with benedryl and eventually, I was able to stop the benedryl.   I would definitely recommend asking your dr. about the MS Contin if you have had years of severe chronic pain and have built a tolerance to narcotics.

After trying many, many combos we found that what worked best was MS Contin (now at 100) 3 times a day with up to 3 a day of 30mg oxycodone. Worked well for first few months, not getting much relief with it anymore.

I have had three surgries in the past two yrs. lt shoulder rcoustructed and both hips replaced. it took over 5 yrs to get these done because of no insunerance. But I have a great family Dr. who has and is still helping me on my pain meds. I have not been able to work since 07 and the pratice lets me pay on a payment plan. they are also trying to help me get disabilty. I have been on all the pain meds you can think of MS Cotin was one of the better ones and the oxycotin but it was way to expensive with no income. I was foolish and scared of morphine so I asked to be put back on percs. For 3 mons. it was 10/325 every6 hrs the last three months it has been 10/325 every 4 hrs. with hardly no relife. I see my doctor on the 6th of this month and i am going to beg him to put me back on this drug 30 mg 3x daily or twice with one or two break through pills a day. I was crazy for ever thinking about trying to so called cut back to be taking so many pills for 3 times the money with no relife. My advice is if you are ever put on this one for cronic pain and it works alittle you may just need a stronger dose but stay no it it will help for the long haul when others peter out.

As needed for lumbar/cervical pain, (numerous tests,MRI's,disograms,nerve blocks,ect.)until work became impossible in Aug.2000. More MRI's/tests &amp; 1st. operation/laminectomy L4/5&amp;5/S1.Unsuccessful/MRI WORSE, than before. Meds so far taken:demerol,dilaudid,oxycontin,percodan,all forms of hydrocodone,darvon&amp;(darvocet-n100),emp.&amp;a cet.#3&amp;4codeine,talwin ect..all used orally, as needed basis, exceptions on certain procedures.Referred to p.mng.in 03 began40mg.methadone daily(chronic by now).By late 03-04,two more surgeries: Anterior&amp;posterior Level-2 Fusion,Lumbar(aforementioned discs)60mg. daily for appx.6yrs. Methadone worked very well for me until March09. Worsening situation in cervical area led eventually to Level#3 Fusion. Needed #4,but no O.Surgeon would touch trying to take 4 herniated discs(spinal stenosis,clusters of bonespurs,ect.)&amp; so for now,I've been on MS Contin 100mg., one every 12hrs. The main reason that I've been so thorough is to let the folks know, who truly are coping with chronic pain(includes ALL of the OTHER PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IT)that there is hope for a functional,fufilling lifestyle. I know that this particular drug will not work for every thing OR for everyone....but when all is  taken into consideration,IF TAKEN AS PRESCRIBED,MS Contin SR IS BY FAR the most effective medication available. (MY OPINION)

This and oxycodone, I beleive, is the major culprit for my loss of the above. I do take other meds w/them and I need evidence of this side effect for disability.

Chronic Pain	Garrbo_sr, 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4		45-54	8/27/2010 5:43:06 PM	2 years on MS Contin 30 mg 2c daily with a 3rd if needed,and 4 10/325 percocet pr day for breakthrough pain. but it worked great for about 2 years. Its effectiveness is waring down. I have DDD and an Arthritic spine, Im a General Contractor and lil hope of changing my career. Ive have done 40 mg of Opana er before this and it was great too, for about 2 years. Now Im looking to go to Oxycodone 30 mg er as Ive tried that from a fellow cronic pain persons and it worked quite well so thats what Ill try. It seams that all of these work for a duration and then the effectiveness where's off. So changing every couple of years seems to be the answer.To all you pain peoples out here I wish you well, take as directed as with all of these opiates cause if you dont, your in a heap a trouble.God bless u all

At this point, I'm not sure as to what I should do.If this is not helping,along with taking ibuprofen &amp; heat, It's extremely frustrating, in effect why take it at all?
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	8/18/2010 11:03:39 PM	I have been taking narcotic pain relievers for 35 years. When I was young I had a horrible experience with morphine shots (10 mg/4 hours) for acute post operation pain. They would provide effective pain relief for 15 minutes - and then I would feel like I had no painkiller in me. The doctors had to mix something else into the morphine to get me effective relief, which they did not manage to do until my third shot post op, so I spent 8 hours in screaming pain and I woke up post op in extreme pain. I got more relief from oral codeine than injected morphine. So I was unsure of the support I would get from oral morphine.I have done two holidays during my treatment - where I detox at home and then take nothing but tylenol (useless) for pain for 30 days. This leaves me unable to sleep because of the pain level, unable to think, etc. I can't call it a 10 - the experience above was a 10, a kidney stone would be a 9, and the worst pain in detox an 8. The pain does not lessen over 30 days with no narcotics (7-8) but it allows me to start at a lower dose, but then the doses increase very fast.I was treated with 100ug/hr Fentanyl patches, and had topped out at 2 patches per day, worn for 3-4 days. That was supplemented with 15 oxycodone 30 mg/day for breakthrough and I was taking all of it and running out before the month was up.That was effective as a dose for about 4 months. Then it started to lose effectiveness and my doctor rotated me to 2x200 mg mscontin/6 hours plus about 15 30 mg plain morphine per day. This has provided me excellent relief. I will probably ask to go back to the fentanyl/oxycodone mix in a month or two, past experience tells me that a new medication falls off in effect after three weeks.I should say that I have been seeing this doc for some years and I saw my previous doc for many years.  When I started, 10 mg of oxy knocked me for a loop like it does everyone, but over the years, the pain drugs become less effective. Hope this helps someone.

It's working but is also making me very nauseated. Woke up with a pounding migraine this AM, not sure if it's due to med or not. Overall it's really helping the pain.

Neuropathic Pain	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	65-74	7/7/2010 5:14:57 AM	I have suffered from neuropathy for the past 9 years and had been on Percocet 10/325 mg. for the past several years. After having more and more breakthrough pain, my pain management specialist changed me to MS Contin 15 mg. two times per day (every 12 hours).  I feel like I have gotten my life back.  There is minimal breakthrough pain and I have noticed NO SIDE EFFECTs; no drowsiness, sleepiness, feeling spaced out, etc.  It has really made a difference is my pain levels.  I was hesitant to take it to begin with as I imagined being all doped up like you see a patient in the hospital who is on morphine IV's.  This is totally not the case.  I am now able to go about all of daily routines once again and feel pain-free most all the time.

I take 1 in morning an 1 at bedtime. It is time release so it works longer during the day an night.
Chronic Pain	Rene13, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	6/29/2010 7:21:18 PM	I was put on MS Contin for chronic pain for 10 years. Last spring I became very ill and couldn't get out of bed. I started to vomit every 15 minutes and had diarrhea almost at the same time. I lost over 50 pounds. I was admitted to the hospital and my kidney's, adrenal glands and heart failed. I found out later that because I never had any blood work done to check the opium levels in my system I had opium(heroin) deposits in my organs. I am now on the mend; after a lengthly hospital stay and hospice care. I was in a coma for four days in hospice while my body was fighting to get off the MS Contin addiction. BEWARE- this drug could kill you; it almost did me.

Chronic Pain	dlkeh, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	6/11/2010 11:31:48 PM	I take 45mg every 8 hrs and percocet for break through pain. This drug takes the rough edges off. I have arthritis in both knees, hips, wrists, and back. Plus a few other pain areas. I have a lot of break through pain. This medication works pretty good for me. I do sleep a lot and it gives me a feeling of being hungry a lot. I feel that a raise of medication would help but I believe that would make me sleep way too much. I would recommend ms contin for people to try it does help with very little side effects. It is a problem when it's time for refills. I can only pickup the perscription on the day it is due and that is a problem if my pharmacy is out of it, I have to look around for a place that has it and I am out of it and in pain so as it is.

Chronic Pain	JINX, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/1/2010 1:53:01 PM	I have been on MS CONTIN for almost 6 months for FYBROMYALGIA and it never gets rid of all my pain. My pain level goes from a 5 all the way to a 9. The MS CONTIN is supposed to last for 8hrs, but it never lasts that long, it wears off around the 5th hour. My doctor wont give my anything for breakthrough pain, which leads to at least 2 to 3 ER visits per MONTH!!! It is hard for me to resist taking an extra pill to help relieve my pain, but so far i have managed to stay on my written dosage ( MS CONTIN 30 MG, 3X DAY). It was hard to find a doctor that would treat my pain seriously. I have a 3yr old daughter and she doesn't understand why I can't play with her because I am in too much pain. A little help is better than no help from a doctor for pain management !!!

I have had 25 surguries for kidney problems &amp; 16 orthopedic surguries. MS CONTIN seems to be working great for me ; 30 MG THREE times daily and NORCO 10/325 for breakthru pain. I have not noticed any significant side effects. Much better than taking 40-50 vicodin weekly.

I too, ran the gauntlet for more than 25 to 30 years.  Went through numerous doctor's.  Thank god there are some real doctor's out there that still care about people and not just money.  I used to fill going to the doctor was like a fast food store(get you in then out) many of the other drugs made me feel stupid and cost way more.  Finally I just talked to my caring Pharmasist.  sorry about my spelling and such..But I would highly recommend this treatment, but with all,,make sure and use stool softeners..before I found a good doctor, my life was awfull, I did anything I could for relief,,street drugs, drink, felt pychotic, afterwards everything just kept getting better and now I feel normal again.. while I still here of other people getting lost and on the same old track I was on, lost.good luck to all, hope your pain is getting controled,,thank god for the real doctor's.  Hope everyone finds one..
Chronic Pain	dogfaceboy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/27/2010 2:59:15 PM	I have been using MS Contin this time for about eight years, as much as 270 mg per day.  I have cut down the amount on my own due to concerns it is affecting my breathing.  This is a problem for me since I also have MS and COPD, both of which can cause breathing difficulty and I use two different puffers for breathing.  It seems that when I cut the use of the MS Contin a lot, my breathing gets better and I have little or no congestion, and I dont need the puffers.  When I raise it again, my congestion and breathing get worse.  I havent experimented enough to be sure that it is the MS Contin causing the breathing problems and I always think my doctors would say so if it was the MS Contin.  My Neurologist for MS insists the MS is not causing the breathing difficulties but other doctors insist it is.  As for pain relief, it is the best thing I have ever found, I have used all kinds of different drugs, acupuncture, which works but not continuously, T.E.N.S., everything imaginable.  Even if it turns out to be the MS Contin causing the breathing difficulties I still have to wonder which is more important, quality of life as in pain free, or easy breathing without puffers.  Has anyone else had any experience with breathing difficulties after using MS Contin for extended periods of time?  The first time I used MS Contin was for about one year and only 30 mg twice daily.  I should also mention when I am not using MS Contin regularly, I am confined to a motorized wheelchair, and have to drive with hand controls.  When I use high dose MS Contin I can walk and ride a bicycle; although not far.  Further, when I use the MS Contin I feel good, I feel healthy, and as I said I can walk, ride a bike, even exercise with weights.  This is a really tough decision and my doctors have pretty much left it up to me, as one of them said, Quality of life is often more important then any other concerns.
Severe Pain	impatient, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	65-74	2/26/2010 10:58:45 AM	I was taken off of oxycodone immediate release, which worked well for me, and changed to this ms contin. I still have pain, and the dosage will have to be increased to be effective. So, I have to take more of this drug to get relief. This makes no sense at all to me. Am I just a guinea pig here?

I started out taking percocet, loritab,etc..and after a few years went by the pain continued getting worse. My doctor suggested I take MS Contin (100mg) twice a day and 3 30mg oxycodone for intermedate pain control. It worked for a while but then had to increase the dose to 200mg twicw a day and still the oxycodone and it finally seems to cut the edge off the pain where I can finally have some quality of life again. Without this drug I would be in a wheel chair.

Chronic Pain	Kyllein, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	2/5/2010 5:26:50 PM	When I began having problems with pain management with Oxycontin, my doctor moved me to MScontin (100mg,every 8 hours).  The MScontin works well for general management, along with Celebrex (200mg once a day).  My level of comfort is more stable now, and there is less of a &quot;counting the minutes till the next dose&quot; situation than previously experienced with the Oxycontin.Be aware that you will probably need a mild stimulant laxative from time to time, and drink plenty of water.Remember, this is a strong opiate and has all the dangers of addiction as well as mental impairment that you read about in the patient's information card you got with your prescription.  Be well aware that you probably won't notice any of it if it happens!All in all, the control of the pain from a damaged and arthritic spine and spinal cord are worth the risks and dangers.It allows me to live a relatively normal life; and that is priceless.

Neck Herns are c2,3,4, and low back is buldged. I am 35, on meds for over 5 yrs, recently started 30 mg MSCONTIN generic/watson (ENDO's formula SUCKS) After 3-5 yrs on vicodin slowly upped to 10mg x6 day, and then percocet, 10mgs4-6x's. Sometimes I will take a valium for spasms, I am well informed about how to take my meds and mixing with caution. MSContin is a god send for the 4-6 hrs of relief- again, I use generic watson formulation, my DOC insists that the BRAND Oramorph will last 8-12 hrs. To me, I'd rather save hundreds of $ on generic as BRAND is only a 2hr peak absorption rate difference for the same relief. I did try AVINZA- 60mg's for 2 months, it gave me &quot;rolls&quot; and &quot;sweats&quot;. Too bad, I had hope. Pain does not mean life is over, give this morphine formula a try, now there are hundreds of othjer formulas, and please don't allow anyone to make you feel like a bad human for taking your medicine, I suffered from anxiety over &quot;med guilt&quot; due to uneducated pharmacies. Finding a PM MD and pharmacy that shows passion changed my world and I hope to give back the love a million times over now that I am under pain control and can get into the sack and go for it (kids, that is).

I have young children to take care of and cannot afford these pills on my own when work comp fails to let the scripts to be authorized sometimes for 5-7 days after ive ran out of pills. i cannot live like this and need something that doesnt turn me into pain and comatose reactions when i cant get my meds.

I got very little to no releife. I have three in lower back and neck bulging disc, as well as facet desease in lower back.  I also have nerve damage pain.  I started taking MS Cotin three yeasr ago and have increased the level.  I find it works great to a full potetial for sometime then starts to weaken and works for less time.  I am now at 130 mg three times a day as well as 15 mg ir 3 xday for breack through.  I get a lower back shot each two months and find it saves me from being in bed mostly and a 50 to 70 percent decrease in pain.  The MS Cotin is nice and serves it purpose but is a very dangerous drug with addiction qualities.  I find after geting the back shot I can back off and as the shot wears off i take more then i should, however if one has a terrible quality of life because of chronic pain i highly recomend giving this medication a try.  As for the radiating pains in to my limbs, it will not help at all, not even a bit.  No medication will help i have tried all that claim they will.  Stay well and have a great quality of life

It works great even better than Oxycotin ever did, the two yrs I was on it.I take this pain from the bad disks in my neck and back. I wished I'd have gotten to try this med first.
Chronic Pain	Anne7769, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/16/2009 3:36:12 PM	I was taking tylenol#3 for a while and could function until I was rear ended about a week ago. Now my dr prescribed the mscontin 30mg 2x a day because he was worried that I had to take them more frequently and the amount of tylenol in the other medicine could harm my liver. I've only been taking these for a few days but the relief is much longer lasting and I take them with a benadryl to prevent the nausea form happening. I can actuallly function now. I also suffer from CRPS/RSD so I was trying to control the pain with the tylenol#3 and it only took a slight edge off but now I can actually get out and function again for the first time in months. I hate to say it but maybe the car accident was a blessing in disguise as my dr probably would not have switched me to this medicine and I would not have known what true releif really is. I still get break thru pain but I can deal with that as he still gives me a limited supply of tylenol#3 to help with that.

Chronic Pain	gilycomo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	12/9/2009 2:54:10 AM	After suffering with chronic pain due to CFS and Fibromyalgia for several years and seeing multiple doctors who each had a remedy and prescription of their own which usually did little if anything to relieve my pain. I finally found a doctor who understood the impact the pain had on my life and prescribed MS CONTIN 60mg BID. It has been 5 years now and although my pain is not completely gone, it is to a manageable level which allows me to function better than I ever could before going on this drug. I have never experienced any of the woozy feelings that accompany many of the other narcotic pain killers or ever feel &quot;out of it&quot; or drugged. This allows me to interact socially without feeling that I am not coming of as &quot;not sharp&quot; as I did with other drugs. It has truly given me back my life and self confidence. Occasional constipation is the only side effect that I suffer and Mirilax is the best solution for that problem. (tasteless, and does not change the consistency of whatever liquid you chose to mix it in and not gritty. Taken at the first sign of constipation and repeated 2x a day until you get results and then every 2-3 days for maintenance.) I occasionally have breakthrough pain which I keep Percocet 10mg on hand for, but rarely take it. The only other undesirable side effect is occasional rebound headaches which are rare but can be quite intense but usually only last a couple hours. MS CONTIN is the best thing that has happened to me since I became ill. I have no problem admitting it as it has truly improved my quality of life by leaps and bounds!

First of all I had to find a Doctor who actually believed that I had pain and wasn't just looking for pain meds. I do understand how Doctors these days need to be careful especially with a medication this strong plus I am a recovering alcoholic/drug addict.  I did question myself if I did have real pain or was I just pretending but when I found my WONDERFUL doctor who actually listened and ran some test like an MRI low and behold right where I pointed to on my lower back and right where my pain was it showed up on the MRI at L5 S1 that the disk was actually kinda jagged and so my sciatic nerve gets caught on it. Now I didn't start out on MS Contin I had to go through all the other meds first. I started out with Vicodin 5's, then went up to 7.5's then we switched to Percocet 5's when they stopped working we went up to the 7.5's and when they stopped working we started out on the MS Contin and I 've been on the same dosage and amount for the last 8 years.  I take 100mgs 3x a time and for breakthrough pain I have morphine immediate release 30 mgs 1 3x a day or as needed.  I haven't had to change anything since.  The side effects that I had in the beginning were some tiredness but that is totally gone now it actually gives me energy which really I hate.  But I'd rather suffer from to much energy then be in pain.  I do suffer from constipation so I use activa and it works AWESOME I just eat 1 a day and it keeps me regular which is great. SO I hope that this information has helped someone.

I developed this after a fall which caused a broken arm.  After 2 surgeries latter the pain got worse.  After lots of test it was concluded that I have RSD (CRPS).  I have been on MS Contin for a year now. It seems to be helping, but I do have breakthru pain which I take Norco 10/325. I can tell that I will have to go up on my medicine in a few months,but for now it is the best I have tried in several years.

It is a long lasting pain reliever and I haven't had any side effects at all, I have only grown tolerant to my dosage and need to have my mg increased. Probably will be soon as I am having cervical spine surgery and pain will intensify afterwards. It has worked great for me!

The bullet impacted my pelvis right below my spine. They suspect that it caused the disc to start rupturing. I have 3 ruptured disk and 1 bulging. S1, T3,T4 and T5. Since taking MS Contin I have been basically pain free 80 to 90% of the day. They have moved up the dosage 4 times now. I started at two thirty mg a day, every 12 hours. Then up to 3 times a day. Then to 60 mg twice a day and now 60mg 3 times a day. We have been using MS Contin while trying to find the right procedure to REPLACE 3 disc and the right surgeon. Thank GOD for MS CONTIN. It never makes me feel altered and really keeps life abtainalbe for me. Steven Cornette in Calhoun, GA

Also, gives me the shakes horribly but it does help with pain for the last 18  months during which time I lived with incorrectly diagnosed back pain.

Chronic Pain	Sallytoo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	9/20/2009 12:53:33 AM	I had a 3 level neck fusion in '94. Continued chronic pain weeks &amp; months after I should've been pain free. PCP sent me to specialists, pain clinics, pain phsycotherapy, P.T., etc. and nothing worked until we found; fiorinal 3xday (for awful headaches), hydrochodone 7.5 1-2 every 4-6 hrs (pain) and Soma 350 one 3xday (muscle relaxer)managed to keep the pain at low roar or 4-4.5 on pain chart.Quit work in 07/2000 when car bumped me from behind. After qualifying for disability I moved from Dallas to small town,OK. I hesitated changing doc's as my Dallas doc had been with me before I had the neck fusion. I didn't start looking for a new doc until I'd been in Ok for 2.5 yrs. Large rant here...I called every dr. office within a 25 m. radius of home &amp; when I answered truthfully-I had chronic pain, I was treated like an addict looking for a fix. I'd explain I'd provide proof from my Dallas PCP that he'd treated me before I had the fusion but no one here cared. Snippy,snappingly,downright rudely I was told &quot;We don't handle chronic pain patients.&quot; It took 6 wks to find a PA who'd see me. I was already her patient as she'd given me a tetanus shot 5 months earlier. When I called her office the 1st time to see about transferring records,they also rudely told me they wouldn't accept me as a patient...as if I never get bronchitis, a sore throat or need flu shot,etc. What was so stupid the whole ordeal they could've taken me as a patient and referred me to pain specialist I now have./rant  NSAID's and aspirin created duodenal ulcer perforation 08/04. Underwent emergency surgery the night I was told to go to the ER. I was taken off all aspirin &amp; NSAIDs for life so switched to PanlorSS and fioricet.(both have tylenol)Turkey day I lost control of my left arm and dropped turkey, platter and all. Went to ER, liver shutting down due to damage from tylenol. Now I take MSContin30 2x day.Not only helps the pain, it made side effects from stomach surgery more tolerable.

Chronic Pain	freedomrings, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	9/3/2009 7:17:54 PM	After going from doctor to doctor (because almost 98% are afraid to prescribe anything strong for more than a couple of months), I finally found a doctor in Tennessee who was not afraid to prescribe this medication. I suffer from chronic pain in lower back, knees and neck (as well as hands) due to osteoarthritis. She started me out at 30mg and then moved me up to 60mg. I stayed there for a couple of years before she moved me up to 100mg. I stayed on it for a few years and finally got he to up it from twice a day to 3 times a day. I also take hydrocodone three times a day (as needed, 10mg/650). I still have pain but thank God for my doctor and this medication. I could not work without it, or even halfway enjoy life. Yes, you develop a tolerance but by being able to move up your dosage every few years you can adjust. You do have to take stool softners though due to constipation issues. It is a good medication IF you can find a doctor brave enough to give it to you...

I suffered to the point I went through every treatment, blocks, trigger shots, etc only to have a bad reaction to all. Federal W/C sent me to a RSD Neurologist. I told him the hell I went through to the point I was paralized by the block. He started me on Ms Contin and MSIR. As time went on he continue to increase the dose of Ms Contin and 30 mg of msir. I felt like a new person. I no longer had the burning pain. I could deal with the air touching my skin. Suddenly in 2008 he had a heart attack and cut his patient load back. I need guidance on finding a doctor who will continue to treat me with the medication that has help me so much. So many have turned me away. They want to do blocks after telling them I was parlazed. I have never abused my medication. I live in Upper NE Philadelphia Pa. and need help. Sincerely,Linda Calhoun rsdlin@verizon.net Federal W/C does cover all my medication and RSDS doctors.

I asked her to increase it &amp; was told if it didn't work she'd just stop it and I'd have to do without pain meds.Asked why I couldn't go back to oxy now that it's cheap enough generic &amp; was told she NEVER prescribes it for ANYONE.(She wrote my Rx for it for 3 years before this mess started)So I am stuck with ineffective pain relief-she won't increase the breakthru med either-and nowhere to turn.

Chronic Pain	Tim, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	7/31/2009 8:29:10 AM	I have chronic leg pain, and fibromyalgia. Currently taking 500 mg of M S Contin a day.Started with a much lower dose, but I have built up a tolerance over the years.  Also I take immediate release morphine for breakthrough pain, because the MS only holds for me about 8 hours.  This has worked well for about 7 years.  The biggest drawback to this type of treatment is that all the health care providers that I come into contact with immediately assume that you are some kind of drug seeking, abusing addict.  The prejudice is just unbelievable.The drug works, and has made my life bearable.  I don't concern myself with the prejudice.  Best of luck if you are in pain.  This medication can help you.

The spine is the for me the worst pain I have ever had. it's worse than given child birth every day. I just wish I didn't have to take it however, without it I probably would hav done my self in because the pain is too too much for me to handle day in and day out. I have already had one spinal surgury and now I need another one. As I said before, I wish that my back did not need to depend on narcotics. That's why I'm doing spinal surgury again. I wish I didn't have to however, I WILL NOT HAVE ANY NARCOTICS RUN MY LIFE ANY LONGER!! GOD BLESS TO ALL OF YOU THAT ARE IN MY POSITION.

I give it a good rating over all .

The Percocet was doing absolutely nothing to ease the pain I have from a leg/knee problem. It is working, somewhat, I believe I need a dose adjustment, but I would recommend this to people who have severe pain &amp; haven't had any luck with other opiate pain relievers.

A doctor had me on Vicodin, which caused me to be addicted.  I am now on MS Contin (Morphone ER - extended release).  This drug is excellent because it is not short-acting like Vicodin, which means that you do not feel addicted and want to rush to take a pill every 4 hours.  I wasn't able to work on Vicodin.  I now have a job and am able to work.  Vicodin should NOT be used long term.  It will cause you to be addicted and make you need to take higher and higher doses.  I recommend this for ANYONE going through the hell of Vicodin addiction.  Because MS CONTIN is extended release, if you run out of the drug, the withdrawl pain is not as severe.  My doc has me on 30MG 2x a day.  My only concern is that I need 3 to do my job (which is physical).  Seriously, do not use Vicodin for long term pain.  MS CONTIN will allow you to work and not feel concerned about having to take a pill every 4 hours!

On the first refill though, I think I got a different prescription, as the med seems much stronger than the first 30mg script.  It leaves me unable to think most of the day.  Pain source is a failed knee replacement, 3 years old.

A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO SHE HAD A HEART PROBLEM, AND THE DOC PUT HER ON MORPHINE. THE 5 DAYS SHE WAS IN THE HOSP. SHE TOOK NO PAIN MEDS OR SOMA. AND DID GREAT. OUR FAMILY DOC REFUSED TO PUT HER ON MORPHINE UNTIL IT WAS AUTHORIZED BY ANOTHER DOCTOR. WE FINALLY FOUND A DOC THAT WOULD. AND SO FAR SHE HAS NO PAIN, THOUGH SHE HAS A SLIGHT ACHE. MS CONTIN 30MG/2 DAY WORKS GREAT. SHE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH THE PAIN. IT HAS COST US ALMOST 20 YEARS OF NEEDLESS MISERY. WE HAVE ALMOST SPLIT UP OVER HER PAIN. I ALMOST COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE HER IN THAT MUCH PAIN ALL THE TIME. WE THANK THE LORD FOR THE HELP WE HAVE RECIEVED.

Ms contin is easy on my stomache and i am one who does'nt prefer to eat and it actually relieves me from the pain for an extended amount of hours for the most part this drug has worked for me assisted by others so I can't complain after four years of suffering the doctors have found somewhat of a relief for me.

Started MS-Contin in 2004 due to Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma pain.  Worked fairly well.  NHL in remission now, but suffer severe chronic spinal pain and peripheral neuropathy in both legs.  I still take it 30mg 3x a day.  I have oxycontin 5mg on hand for breakthrough, but hardly ever need it.  The MS-Contin seems to work well and is well tolerated.  No side effects. Nasty withdrawl when I ran out recently - suffered for 3 days!  Please remember to have your refills on hand... withdrawl is NO fun.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	Visitor, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	25-34	2/1/2009 10:20:55 AM	I have been taking MS Contin for three months due to three herniated disks in the lumbar area of my back.  The doctors first started me on Vicodin ES 7.5/750, but that never really helped with all the pain.  They then proceeded to give me Percocet 5/325, but it didn't ever seem to last the 6 hours it claims.  I would get about 2-3 hours of pain relief before having to take another.  The doctor was concerned about my acetaminophen intake so they put me on Norco 10/325.  These were much stronger than the previous medications and they lasted the 4-6 hours that they stated.  Although helping more, they never really worked completely for my chronic pain.  When the doctor told me he was prescribing morphine, my wife and I were a little worried about the physical dependence that surrounds this drug.  I was also worried I would be a vegetable and lose all of my drive to do anything. This was hardly the case. Within the first week of taking this medication, I felt no pain for most of the day.  I was still able to take the Norco for breakthrough pain, but that has been cut down dramatically.  But now I can do things again.  I take 15mgs q 8 hours.  Having been someone who has never really been on a dosing schedule for medication, it is a little difficult to remember to dose.  In the past the pain would always tell me when I needed to dose.  It took me a little while to get it through my head that I need to take this med even if I am not in acute pain, but I made it work.  This pain med does not really last the 8 hours stated.  In my opinion, maybe 6-7.  I am definitely not regular in the bowel department, but I take Colace and Dulcolax almost everyday to help with the annoying constipation that this strong narcotic brings with it.  It  does make me sleepy for the first hour or two after taking it, but my body adjusts and everything is great afterwards.  The cost was a definite plus for me.  With my insurance, I paid for generic morphine sulfate ER 15mg 270 tabs for $20 US.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	19-24	1/24/2009 10:34:08 PM	I've been on alot of pain meds over the last 3 years. It started out as oxycodone for Degenerative Disk Disease for about a year. Then I started Developing recurent infection in the sack around my heart. So they put me on Lortab for about 3 months then it wasen't working. So come to find out the infection won't go away but they won't do the surgery cause of risk of death is to high for me. So they started me on Fentanyl patch until the Begining of the year when I was involved in a MVC and Brused my spinal cord and hairline fx in my neck. So they started me on MS Contin 30mg 3 times a day with Valium for Muscle tightness in my neck and I also have anxiety. I am still having break thru pain but not often. Regards to Side effects I haven't had really any except mild tiredness.

I have been taking MS-CONTIN now for about 6 months, first started with 15 mg twice a day but have quickly progressed up to 60 mg 3 times a day and that is very much doing the trick.  For those of you suffering from constipation, my Doc recommended that I take a fiber supplement - I chose Fiber Choice and it works like a charm  I also take 7.5 mg oxycodone for breakthrough.  Every is going very very well.  Good Luck!!

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	1/6/2009 2:10:01 AM	I am only 28 years old and have been suffering with chronic pain for about 5-6 years. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and spondyloarthrpathy about two years ago. It seems that being young keeps many doctors from believing a person of my age can hurt as bad as I do. I ran the gamut of pain meds with earlier doctors starting with tramodol, darvocet,and lortab. When I explained to them that I was not getting the relief that I needed, they did'nt seem to want to try anything different. I finally found a doctor willing to accept and believe my condition. I now take 60mg 3x's a day, plus 10mg percocet every 6 hrs. for breakthrough pain.  The only side effect is a rather nasty headache that will last about 2-3 hrs. after the MS kicks in, and general constipation. I am growing tolerant to the MS, but the doc told me that he could increase my dosage if needed. Thank God for understanding and caring doctors who don't dwell on the thought that everyone who takes pain meds is or will become a junkie. If the med works don't be ashamed to use it, and don't worry about what other people think about you. To all of those suffering out there, may God ease your pain and brighten your days!

I have severe lower back pain and nerve pain down my right leg.  I have been through multiple pain meds (Norco, Lortab, Methadone, and Vicodin) for the past 8 years.  My doctor recently put me on 30mg's 4 times per day of MS Contin.  This medication has substantially reduced my back and leg pain.  I suffer from constipation and dry mouth.  I would highly recommend this medication as opposed to taking 10-12 Norco pills daily.

And like all medications there is some break through pain. But overall I am a huge supporter of MS Contin

Chronic Pain	JackNolan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	9/28/2008 10:42:05 AM	I began taking 30mg twice a day as a replacement for the Fentanyl patch (which I hated due to uneven release of medication).  I had to increase to 3 times daily which seems to help.  I still take Oxycodone for breakthrough pain up to 3 times per day.  I sleep fairly well now and have no nausia or drowsiness.  Constipation has always been an issue with pain meds, but fiber pills and an occasional stool softener helps.

The main secret to relief is to follow the instructions from the doc and to not miss the next scheduled dose.

I think the drug would be okay, if I took ALOT more of it. Im just so tolerent to narcotics I think. But really I do believe its a good drug choice for mild pain (the 15mg at least)
Severe Pain	Wisor, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/29/2008 10:34:23 PM	I loved the way this drug worked for me, I had tried several other pain medications and did not get near the results as MS Contin. One doctor gave me 30MG and another gave me 60MG I broke the 60MG's in half because 30MG's worked great for me. I could not believe the relief and energy I had after one 30MG MS Contin and I did not find them addicting at all. I was having severe pain in my left hip and my hands and wrist from arthritus. The only problem I had was not being aware of the constipation caused by pain medications and my doctor had tried me on 3 different types without informing me of this. I tried taking Correctol and then tried Ducalax before going to see my doctor about the problem. When I went to hime to treat the constipation he gave me 2 different laxitives to try and they did not work, he never said anything about stopping the pain medication so I ended up in the hosptital with a severe blockage in my colon.

Chronic Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	3/29/2008 2:07:27 AM	I live with DDD, failed surgery syndm,L4-L5 fusion, lamenectomy, arthritis,stinosis,and siatica and have an ANS spinal stimulator.  I was on 220mg of Oxycontin a day.  It was great for pain, but I had terrible side effects.  Severe sweating, constipation, irritable and itchy.  I work in sales and my career was suffering.  I weened off for a month taking only norco for pain. Now I take 30mg fo MScontin twice a day with norco for breakthrough pain and it has given me my life back.  The only side effect I have is a slight nausea.  Pain is under control. 8 down to 3.  I am very happy without all the side effects. Career is back on track and my family is happy to see me function as normal as possible.

Chronic Pain	maxmax, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	3/6/2008 8:23:46 PM	MS Contin has been the most effective treatment of chronic pain for me. Previously i've used Stadol and Fentanyl patch with only so-so results. i've kept the same dose for over 5 years without the constant need to increase i had with the other medications - a very important consideration when living with chronic pain. i do supplement with the immediate release form of the medication some days, but my baseline pain score has stayed pretty much stable for a long time now.

I take 30mg 2 times a day and have been pain free. Amazing Drug it does work. My Side effects are constipation but I control that with Diet. I have been on the same dose for 1 year and I feel that I Do not need any higher dose and the dose is working just fine. This is a HABITUAL forming drug and you do become dependent however, I used to get Epidurals in my spine at 1500.00 dollars each.... and it wasn't as effective as the MS Contin has been. Please use caution when taking this drug. Only take the prescribed amount that your Doctor starts you out on. If you want to get off this drug I highly recommend (metering) your dose down slowly and it is a slow process.  Did I mention that I jog 3 miles a day because the pain is not there????? My life has been given back to me because of MS Contin.  I only recommend this drug if nothing else has worked.

Chronic Pain	Mish, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/16/2008 1:47:10 AM	I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia at 30 yrs old. And it destroyed every aspect of life: my career as a 1st grade teacher, the quality of life in marriage, motherhood, family, and friendships. Pain robbed my emotional strength; life consisted of surviving the day and praying for sleep to escape the pain.Doctor after doctor attempted to dismiss my symptoms, my pain and my anguish; hope faded and compassion was far and few between from those in the medical field.  And then I found &quot;The Center for Pain&quot; in Montgomery, Alabama; the doctors believed that my pain was real, respected my needs and extended compassion while creating a treatment plan.I've remained on the same treatment plan/dosage for over five years; my pain is controlled, and with minimal side effects.  I actually have more energy with this med; there seems to be a direct correlation between energy and the level of pain.  I've never experienced that &quot;loopy, woozy&quot; feeling that's found in short-acting pain medication; allowing me to function in any situation.  This medication literally gave me my life back; I highly recommend MS Contin to anyone dealing with chronic pain, regardless of the initial cause.

I have multiple back/neck problems, and sciatic nerve damage.  After having almost no pain for seven years and having to take very little oral pain meds, WOW, what an ordeal.  Side affects of this medication really diminish its effect for me.  The headaches are almost unbearable, especially being that I have constant neck/shoulder pain anyway and migraines.  Nausea and total lack of desire for food is difficult, especially when food is needed for nutrients to heal!  I'm hanging in there, but it has been one hell of a ride.

I had a lumbar discetom and interbody fusion w/instrumentation at L5/S1. I was diagnosed with Degenerative Disk Disorder &amp; Failed Back Surgery Syndrome with bi-lateral compression on the nerve root. Recently I was prescribed MS Contin 100mg after being on Oycontin for 2 years. Within a week, I was able to increase activities such as walking at the mall. The medication is definitely effective, but there are side effects (every drug does). Acclimating to the medication took approximately 2 weeks, but overall it was worth it. I would definitely recommend this medication to those who have chronic pain.
