It pinches the nerve down my legs and the pain is huge. The Meperitab eases the pain a million times better than Percocets. It's a wonderful pain killer without that druggy feeling

It is short acting (1 - 2 hrs) but for those times I need help beyond my regular dosage of Mobic it is a blessing. I have 75 available for the month &amp; I use about 70. I do experience dry mouth &amp; sweats.

My doctor also told me to take my prometheazine to help the upset stomach . I think this drug is overrated it takes longer to work and I think the promethezine just put me to sleep . When I woke up my headache would be gone but I felt loopy .

This med.did pretty good controling my pain if i took it every 4-6 hrs. If i waited until the pain was at its peak then it didnt help me .So for me it has to remain in my system in order to work.
Pain	mstwhite71, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	6/27/2009 2:24:27 PM	I had oral surgery preformed, and since I cant take Codeine, I was given meperitab. I took the first dose on an empty stomach and didn't get sick @ all, but after my 3rd dose I felt real nauseous. Overall this pill worked well @ taking and keeping my pain to a minimum. Take the med before @ the first sight of any pain for best results
Pain	42420jo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/19/2009 12:31:13 PM	I was prescribed this medication for pain relief after having a Hysterectomy (LAVH BS+O- w/posterior repair). The effectiveness of this medication was great with only one noted exception. Its effectiveness seemed to be reduced when taken with food. I did not experience any problems with nausea so I was able to take this medicine on an empty stomach. Because Meperitab is a narcotic(addictive), it was important to me to try to get the full effectivemess from one single dose as to lessen the durstion of my treatment for pain after surgery.
