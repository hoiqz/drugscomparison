Additional Medication for Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	Bre, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	8/10/2012 11:01:00 PM	Levetiracetam has been really good to me. At first I was only taking half a pill twice a day but now I take 1 whole pill twice a day. It has really stopped my seizures. I have only had two. I had two in one day it was the 1st time it ever happened to me. I was at school and the second time was once I got discharged from the hospital the same day.        Keppra still does sometimes make me a little dizzy, sleeping and I dont know if this is a side effect but sometimes moody. But overall it helps a lot.
Simple Partial Seizures	Reedy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	3	Female	65-74	7/28/2012 10:43:32 AM	I have just started taking this med for light seizures caused from having a brain tumor removed in 2004.  It is my third med and so I'm being very careful to watch for side effects.  The first med caused me to be up all night contemplating suicide.  I've only began this med so can't say much about it right now.  I have been feeling very down and not sure if it is the med or some other reason.  The waves in my head have stopped but I am concerned that being on seizure meds could cause full blown seizures for me.  I also worry about taking it with my BP meds.  No one wants to say it is okay to take 6 different meds during a day.  I feel very tired all the time.

I was prescribed two 250mg and have a hard time remembering to take second med at night. I have also had a lot of trouble with loss of appetite and bouts of nausea. I have also had a seizure recently. I am going to follow up with Dr. to see if I should be on this type of medication or if there is something else that may be of more help to my medical experiences.
Convulsive Seizures	Sylvax, 0-2 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Male	0-2	5/24/2012 9:25:07 PM	My son was diagnosed just shy of his second birthday with New Onset Seizures.  He was having Tonic-Clonic seizures(Formally known as Grand Mal). He was placed on Keppra, and I've been using the generic for it.  He has yet to have another seizure(After 8 in 3 days).  He has a little crankiness, but that could be from being two.  Otherwise, he's back to the same old self at almost 2 months, and still seizure free.

Other	LEVI, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		9/30/2011 1:50:08 AM	On 500mg 2x per day since 7/6/11 due to seizure caused by swelling of area of brain due to brain cancer.  Was put on steroid for the swelling and Levetiracetam for seizure. I have been hallucinating, not able to sleep, not able to stay in one place, suicidal thoughts, loss of appetite, change in taste of food, lethargic, confusion, dizziness, and weakness. Drs. thought this was from steroid. I was taken off steroid and these same effects are getting worse. Neuro said there were no side effects with this drug, but apparently there are. (I'm writing this for my husband at 1:35 am because he is in such a state.  Don't want hospital because they will add more drugs which may cause more complications. Oncologist had previously suggested (2 wks ago) asking Neuro if he could stop drug but Neuro had said she did not recommend stopping. We will call Neuro in AM and find out how to get off the drug. Petscan shows lesions in brain are gone since radiation finished. Just scar tissue left. Presently on chemotherapy also. Stopping drug seems to be the best choice in his case.)

Since I don't know when I have them, I have to depend on the Dr to tell me if the medication is effective.  I started on Keppra XR, but due to the cost, have changed to this medication.

Ive been on the generic now for about 1mth at 3000mg p/day. I take it alongside lamictal, epilim, and frisium.  The seizures are getting worse and I'm already suffering major depression.  I had a psychotic episode (which I have since found is a poss side effect) which I am now in court for.  As well as destroying half my house I then went to the nearest service station and tried to pour the last of the petrol out of the pump lines and tried to light it. Don't remember much about it but all I was demanding was the police because I wanted to be sectioned (mental health). Extremely suidical.  Last night I lost all balance and put my head through the glass panel in door as I was falling. Docs and neurologist didn't tell me not to take it with food and no doc I have been to here takes regular blood tests to check the med levels.While the Keppra I found satisfactory, I would NOT recommend anyone take this drug with first doing their homework. I am already reducing the dose to get off the stuff.  If it wks for you good - but the side effects for me are not worth the hassle.  I rather tolerate epilepsy!

For about the last two months I have been experiencing the &quot;never-ending&quot; headache with no change in my medications.  I also take Propanolol and Topamax for migraine prevention and have taken these two meds longer than Keppra.  I will add that I have been under an additional amount of stress lately which I am certain has added to the additional migraines.  I have had to go to the emergency room for pain relief 3 times in the last 2 months and had not had to go to the ER since last March for a migraine.  I am going to my neurologist the end of this month and will see what his diagnosis is and where we will go from here.  I am just looking for relief!!

After about 5 years started have problems with gum growth and switched to generic Keppra (Levetiracetam, manufactured by Greenstone). Daily dosage is 3000 mg. Happy with effectiveness, but having a different problem with my gums. They are fragile and sloughing. Both my dentist and now my oral surgeon are puzzled. Taking Prednisone to treat problem with gums. My neurologist insists the problem with my gums are not a side effect of Keppra or Levetiracetam. Very puzzling...

After that the dosage was increased to 1500 mg and I was filling OK almost seizures free. I was using it combined with Depakote and Valium.My doctor decided to take away Valium and increase Depakote and I continued filling OK. Moving to another state I was forced to change doctor and the new one change regular Depakote to Depakote ER and also increased Keppra to 6000 mg a day because he said that the dosage was too low. This was after a blood work. He asked me if the price between brand name and generic was significant and I said yes. He then prescribed generic and himself ordered it from my supplier. Today I have more seizures than never and the control over it is almost nothing. I don't know if this is because of generic or if the condition is going worst for some other reason. I visited another neurologist to get a second opinion and he said: We should continue as you was before if that was working better to you. We don't fix what is not broken, he continued. I am going tomorrow to a new visit to my actual doctor and I will bring comments from this page to him because it was helpful.

In February of 2009, she was switched to the generic Keppra (Levetiracetam). Giant Pharmacist had switch without asking us first. We didn't realize this until July 3, 2009. Within  February and July she seizes three times, the first two we were able to control it with Ativan but the last one we couldn't, we gave extra doses of Levetiracetam and Ativan and still couldn't controlled her seizures, within three days she seizes 50 times, this happened, while we were on vacation. We took her the to the emergency room and the doctor took blood sample and found out that her platelet counts was 12000 (normal is 150,000) she was airlifted to Children Hospital. They check for the Levetiracetam level in her blood and there are none, there was discussions that Levetiracetam was the culprit of the low platelet counts but can not confirmed, so the doctors slowly takes her off the Levetiracetam but she was still seizing, in the mean time another neurologist decided to put her back on Keppra and gave her an extra dose of Keppra and within hours she stop seizing. We realized at that time, that the generic have no effects on controlling my daughter's seizures. Please do not substitute name brand Keppra for generic, the neurologist that we spoke to, said that for anti convulsion drugs best to stay with name brand.

Like others, on my last refill CVS was pleased to tell me that I can save $50 per refill by trying this new generic - I was ecstatic!  Two months later, I am still seizure-free however my personality has changed from cheerful and positive to completely depressed and zombie-like.  I am lethargic and have no desire to participate in any daily activites.  I am practically causing a divorce in my marriage.  10 minutes ago I called my pharmacy and asked that they never give me this generic again - I am back to Keppra and will be happy to pay the extra dollars to get my personality back.  (Well, not happy to pay, but I will pay  ;)

She put me on Keppra but CVS gave me the generic (Levetiracetam). Its been a couple of months and I gradually came of carbatrol and increased Levetiracetam. I am on 1000 mg twice a day and the doctor asked me to increase it to 1500 mg twice a day. last night I had my first siezure in over 24 years. I am not sure if it is because of the new medication or because CVS gave me the Levetiracetam and not keppra. I will call the doctor on Monday.

I was born with CP and gained seizures due to Ceebral Palsy.  I was JUST GIVEN Levetiracetam tablets by my pharmacy.  I took the first 1 around 7:30 am and SLEPT until 3:00 PM.  I ALWAYS HAD been given Keppra and NEVER SLEPT like that with Keppra!!  LUCKILY my husband was home when I took the Generic!!  AFTER I woke up, I had a headache - which helped after I ate something a little.  But I still am tired through the day with not much energy, unlike with Keppra.  I am a stay at home mom with 2 toddlers and DO NOT NEED TO BE ASLEEP FOR THE WHOLE DAY AS MY HUSBAND IS AT WORK!  I just CAN NOT do that!!  With Keppra and my other medication for mood swings, I would only feel tired and maybe doze off for a half an hour right after I take the meds in the morning.  I am going to go to my pharmacy in the morning and DEMAND I get &quot;KEPPRA&quot; - THE REAL DRUG!!!

I am having trouble with the correct dose. Dr.started me on 500 mg two twice a day. I was a zombie, now take 3 a day and still have little energy. Seizures are less but then again I do not get warning of seizures until I have them. I am not satisfied with this medication at this time.

On Keppra, I have been seizure free for many years.  I am scared about the effectiveness of this generic.  I may be over-reacting, but I feel drowzier on this drug than on Keppra.

I had a normal pregnancy while on it. My son was healthy and was able to breastfeed with him having side affects.

Very effective, I did experience Mood Swings at the very beginning, they washed away as my body became immune to the Med. and I've never felt safer.

Convulsive Seizures		4	5	3			5/5/2008 1:17:27 AM	keppra has been effective thus far in preventing any further episodes with my seizure disorder, however after taking only half a pill i experienced severe depressive mood swings, it went away as quickly as it came and to be honest i was quite shocked.
