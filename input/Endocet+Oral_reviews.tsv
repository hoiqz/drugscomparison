He was barely 50 years old.  Do as you like but no one I care about will EVER take this crap again, no one, no way, no how!!!

I was given this med after taking lorcet 10/650 for a couple years for degenerative disk disease, herniated disks, and severe knee pain from arthritis. I would much rather have the lorcet. my dr.wanted to try me out on these a couple weeks to see if they would help better with the chronic pain. I am going go back to my old meds, work much better without all the side effects

It manages the pain from my surgery quite well as long as I pay close attention to my body and take it before the pain gets bad. Once I feel a certain level ( I rate my pain) then I take it. By doing this, I do not use anywhere near what is actually prescribed.

(Using 7.5/325, 4x daily) A bit slow to initially take effect, relief peaks at about the 2-hr. mark, but still MUCH-better than &quot;standard&quot;-NSAID's, by-far.I myself have had NO-problem with addiction, although admittedly I prefer it 10-to-1 over &quot;just&quot;-acetaminophen, to manage severe-chronic arthritis.A shame this drug has such a negative-public &quot;stigma&quot; to overcome, because it's effective, simple to take, and safe, when used as directed...

The 5/325 is okay for pain that is from a fall or cramps and you will not be taking it for more than a few days. However, for Fibro, chronic nerve pain, andpain that is caused by diseased discs, the 10/650 is better, much better at relieving chronic.

I Thank God that I have a wonderful doctor that sits down with me &amp; hears what I am telling her, I have been to other drs. that aren`t listening to what I am telling them &amp; it seems like they are just hurrying me out the door but my dr. is very understanding &amp; helps me, I could not function each day without this medicine. I hurt 24/7 everywhere on me &amp; I cannot say enough about how this medicine lets me have a life. The pain never goes away completely but the medicine works well enough that I can function &amp; get through the day. Everybodys system is different &amp; it works differently for everyone. It took a few tries with other medicine before my dr. found the one that works gooder for me &amp; I am thankful she worked with me until we did find the right one.

It seems that now I take it just to keep from having withdrawl, rather than to take away the pain. I guess I've just gotten used to being in pain.....for every waking second of every day ( 6272 days &amp; counting )If you need painkillers....take them, but only for short term, if you can.

Pain	Shark45, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/8/2010 12:17:44 PM	I've been taking 10/325mg 8x/day for about a year now. I've had over 13 major surgerie, need a left shoulder replacement, right knee replacement and have had numerous other procedures to my back.  I have major lower back issues and continue to have them.  I've had L4/L5, L5/S1 fused and they put a transition segment at L3/L4 to help support it with rods and pins.  I'm on the path to having L2/L3 fused possibly, but we're trying different options.  I'm also on Embeda(80mg) but now switching over to Exalgo(16mg) for my long acting pain meds along with taking Lyrica and Valium, a stool softner and testoterone shots.  I have to say, for the breakthrough pain, Percocet(Endocet) works the best for me, but is hard to find.  They are using Oxycodone w/ Acetametaphine, but I specifically order Endocet as the Oxycodone for some reason does not work for me.  I would highly recommend this for those that need severe breakthrough pain meds, but be careful, it has different effects on everyone.  I can funtion almost normally with no side effects, but other people get drowsy and have issues.  This med coupled with my other meds seems to help to a point, but only get my pain level down to a 4 (1-10, 10 being the worse) at best, but usually averages around a 6 and goes up to a 7-8.  I'm also looking into getting the new oxycontin when it comes out at the end of this year.  I have a great pain management doctor here in NJ that really knows his stuff.  Good luck to everyone with pain issues...it's tough to go through.

Pain	becareful, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	25-34	4/25/2010 5:49:28 PM	PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS!!!  BE CAREFUL with the drug (and other oxycodone drugs).  I started taking oxycodon 2.5/325 a year ago because I had a car accident as needed.  I was very good at following my doc's orders with physical therapy, stretching, etc.  Never missed an appointment and only took medication as needed. I'm well educated in science/medicine.  I have a PhD and I've always been a health nut, at the gym 4 days a week, ate well(mostly organic foods). I now take 6-8 10/325 endocet a day!  I called out sick from work for the past week and have had terrible depression and anxiety trying to stop taking it.  I've seen both my doctor and a psychiatrist about this.  It all stems from my gradual overuse of this medication for legitimate pain.  I no longer work out.  I have lost my girlfriend of 5 years.  I have wasted my savings and barely go to work anymore.  This is a very dangerous drug and it's addictiveness sneaks up on you.  Please, please don't ruin your life by taking this medication like I have.  Take vicodin.  It works just as well but is less addictive.

I have to start moving around after taking the medication. As laying down is the worst thing that I can do. Stretching and a good hot shower helps but I would get much better relief from walking and gental stretching.

Pain	greatfulforendocet, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/6/2010 6:53:08 PM	I have had severe back pain for years and have tried everything from epidural injections to therapy but without surgery I was beginning to get frustrated with vicodin or lortab, celebrex, tramadol or other pain relivers. The first dose that I took relived the pain instantly and kept it at bay for hours. There is a risk of chemical dependency due to the opioid in the medication, but used in moderation and never more than reccomended it was fine. Also don't take it for more than a few months and try alternate meds to prevent building a tolerance. Overall I am pleased with this medication and finally feel relief from the daily agony that was just about to send me into the emergency room for in-patient help.
Pain	chaoscat,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female		1/5/2010 7:18:13 PM	I have had lower back pain due to arthiritis and stenosis for five years.  I struggled with tylenol (useless!!) and Darvocet (somewhat effective) until I was on maximum dose of darvocet and couldl not take anymore.  I lost weight, vomited, and was in constant pain, restricting working out, walking, working and school.  The pain doctor prescribed this 4 times per day and I have almost had 75% relief.  If you are over sixty years old you don't deserve to have to live a long life of constant pain.  Good for endocet

I take 1/2 of the pill every 4hrs. I havent had any pain or problems with the Crohns since. Also I do advise taking a stool softener as it does clog up the system. I have been on almost every pain medication there is including Dilaudid. That is onegreat drug for pain but very leathal and addictive so we went to Endocet. I have been on Ultracet, Tylanol III, Celebrex, Demerol and Vicoden of which none had helped.

My doctor placed me on this medication and it provided relief. Recently, I have been placed on a second, long-acting opioid along with Percocet to keep the pain away for longer periods of time and I have become somewhat tolerant to Percocet. I would recommend it for people needing a pain reliever for shorter periods of time, i.e. dental surgery, surgery, broken bones, etc. as I have found that many people I have talked to that also take this medication have become tolerant to it, but it is a very good pain reliever.  
Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	6/30/2009 3:06:34 PM	I am disappointed with Endocet . I take oxycodone for migraine pain and usually get the generic 10/325's.  The last time I went to a new pharmacy which only carries Endocet.  He assured me that Endocet was manufactured by the company which makes the brand name Percocet, so I assumed it would work the same as the other generics.  I was wrong.  It does nothing for my pain.  I may as well just take aspirin.  I told the pharmacist it did not work and he said politely that it was my imagination.  I know pain when I feel it and Endocet provides no relief.  The next time my doctor prescribes oxycodone I'll make sure the pharmacy which fills it does not use this product.

Since there has been a nationwide shortage due to the shortage of the oxy 5's, which was substituted with these, the pharmacy and my insurance company approved the Endocet 10's. for some reason they really do seem to work better than the ones I usually take.. I've only had to take half as much and I have done twice the usual work..

In my opinion, if you use it the way it's Rx'ed you probably won't become addicted. It does make me itch, though, but a benedryl between doses clears that up.

It works well at taking away the pain but makes you feel very good at the sametime, and this can be a thing that makes it hard to stop taking them when you no longer need the med!

I have been to pain management and ciroprators and that didn't work also I have tried everything from vicodin to morphine. Endocet 10/325 has worked best. There is enough oxycodone to control my pain, and I only take 2 tabs four times a day per doctor's order. Plus there is less acetmetaphen. I would highly recommend anyone with chronic pain to give it a try it.
Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	45-54	11/9/2008 6:40:02 PM	The medication was very effective when I first started taking it however after just two weeks my body had developed a tolerance to the medication and it's effectiveness waned rapidly. My doctor increased y dosage from two pills a day to four pills a day then to six pills per day. Finally finding no further effectiveness for this drug I weaned my self down as far as I comfortably could but still suffered severe, long lasting agonizing withdrawl syptoms. I offer an extreme caution to anyone thinking about taking this medication that it is rapidly habit forming and when you discontinue using this medication prepare to suffer severe withdrawl symptoms. In summary, while this medication can be effective in relieving pain on a short term basis, any lng term use (30-60 days) will result in unwanted side effects which may out weigh the pain killing benefit received from the medication.

This med. helps. A draw back is the pill is not coated and I have a hard time taking pills so the pill sometimes gets stuck in my throat. The pill has a sandy like feeling and when my saliva contacts it this also tends to cause the pill to stick in throat. Once its down it works along with other pain meds.

Pain	Scuuby, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	35-44	3/10/2008 3:41:39 PM	Chronic lower back pain, lower L-4,5 &amp; S-1,  as a result of on-the-job injury. this medicine works well, it has been used by me for over a seven-year period with very decent results. The only thing to try to avoid is the need to use a slowly controlled need for more of the medicine over a prolonged time. FIVE STARS!!! Endocet 10/325mg tablets.

I took generic percocet before and it stopped doing the job. I am taking this for severe pain due to lung surgery, and the pain is in my back and lower ribs.

I have been on a lot of pain medications. This by far has helped the most. Please don't take more OR longer than your DR says. This is highly addictive. I am a RN also so please take your DR's advice in taking this medication. It does make some people itch. Ask your DR. what to do in that case he or she will help in any way possible. I have to say that my Pain Management DR is the best in the world. E-mail me if you would like his name and number hobbs8989@yahoo.com. Thak you very much for all of your advice. Elizabeth
Pain	badbackbill, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/18/2007 9:45:05 PM	i have been on percocet for 3yrs now, and is the most effective for my lower back, I have had spinal fussion(2 disc onevertebra removed) only problem is it is highly addictive, but works very well. My dose is 10/650 6-8 times a day, in conj with soma(4x/day), robaxin(3x/day) and motrin 800(4x/day) I still feel the pain though, it is not nearly as bad with the use of percocet.

I was on Endocet for a few months and this has been the best pain killer with the least side effects compared to other pain killers. Only thing to keep in mind is giving your body a break from this med if needed for long term as it is HIGHLY addictive.

Pain	brycat06, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	9/21/2007 12:07:27 PM	very strong. Use with precaution. Also this drug is very addictive. Please don't take more than your doctor has perscribed. I started taking it about a month ago. I moved from a hydrocodone 7.5/500 to this drug. It is very effective. Do not abuse this drug. It is extremely strong and does help with pain.
