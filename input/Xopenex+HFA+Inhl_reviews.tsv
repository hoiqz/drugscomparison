Bronchospasm	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/6/2011 8:18:01 PM	Love this stuff, I use to use Albuterol and I use to get jittery, and had to take 4-6 puffs of it to feel relief where with the Xopenex HFA I only need to take on or two puffs. 
Asthma Attack	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/28/2010 8:17:14 PM	My physician prescribed Xopenex to replace Proventil. I have found that with Proventil I needed to take 2 - 3 puffs to receive full relief; however, with Xopenex HFA I need only 1 puff. The only side effect that I have experienced is a jittery feeling.
Bronchospasm	mother , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/27/2010 6:03:42 PM	Finding the right medication for my 15 year old son was difficult when he was first diagnosed with asthma because of negative side effects of medications used. Advair for example was not well tolerated at all. For many people it works. It was through trial and error that the right medication for him was found. He now uses Pulmicort and Xopenex successfully, but many of the others made him sicker than the asthma symptoms he had. From reading the other reviews it seems that finding the right medication(s) for asthma is also a process that one goes through. We had a very difficult time, but we eventually found the medications that he could tolerate, no side effects. Finding the right medication can be a difficult process and watching your child suffer from trying a medication that should make him feel better, but it doesn't, is a trying scenario. What works for one individual does not always work for another. Through trial and error and good medical support we found the right scenario for our son.

Other	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	11/15/2009 4:04:50 PM	I couldn't use this medication as treatment because it is to expensive and medicare part B won't even cover a 1/3 of the cost and the pharmacy that I use isn't willing to loose $277.00 to provide me with the medication I need to get better.  I feel that the drug company and the pharmacy are putting a price tag on my health.
Asthma Attack	rainyday, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	10/26/2009 3:48:33 PM	After I had my encounter with and old long forgotten friend(Asthma), I was prescribed this medicine. My experience with this drug is good, I was prescribed both the inhaler in case I had an asthma attack or felt one coming on, and the nebulizer one. I did have the shaking all over, but that has since gone away and my asthma is pretty much under control unless I run...
Asthma Attack	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	9/24/2009 11:10:28 AM	I like it, it doesn't make me jittery or nauseous.
Other	payne2, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	4/17/2009 7:27:11 PM	I have been on it about 2 weeks now and it is working well for me. I take 2 puffs twice a day and I am using my fast-acting inhaler a whole lot less. I can even use it before exercising and it works as well as my fast acting inhaler. No problems with it so far.
Asthma Attack	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	35-44	3/30/2009 7:50:30 AM	Since my Allergist switched me from Albuterol to Xopenex HFA, I've noticed that when I have attacks that recovery has taken longer and has become less effective.

Asthma Attack	Golfman, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	65-74	3/20/2009 6:09:22 AM	I used it at 4:00 PM (one puff only)and sleeped only 2 hours that night. My heart pounded, I trembled, I was dizzy, I had muscle spasms and I had a head ache. However, I can say that I was breathing well soon after use. Perhaps, I forgot to shake it well and didn't get the proper mixture. I am new to these inhalers and all this is a new experience. Can anybody tell me what you get when you don't shakd it? It was my first use of this inhaler, so it probably sat for some time. I don't plan on using this ever again. Too bad! I'd like to get my moneys worth out of it.
Other	Jan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/16/2009 1:51:56 PM	Compared to Seravent which made my heart super race. This has not caused it to race at all. Also no jittery feeling which allowed me to continue working. I have even used it with a bad cold and it helped.

Made me dizzy and lightheaded. I had a horrible time with severe trembles and shakes. Will never use this again. I cannot use anything with HFA. I have severe asthma. Please read side effects before using this medication.
Asthma Attack	Allergic asthma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/21/2008 5:44:20 PM	Very effective for wheezing and coughing of asthma. It does give me nausea and a sore throat, trouble sleeping and dizziness, however it's better than not being able to breathe. It doesn't make me agitated and belligerent like Albuterol did. Rinse your mouth after using to get rid of the taste.

Other	OpalSparks, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	4/6/2008 2:57:41 AM	I occasionally have the funny taste in my mouth, but I was more concerned with the tightness I felt in my chest after each use, using as directed.  It only lasted a few minutes each time I used it.  The satisfaction of use varied as sometimes it appeared to help and other times it didn't seem like it did a thing for me.
