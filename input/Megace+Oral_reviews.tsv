Then on day 24 I started having cramps and started heavy bleeding again. I see my doctor in a couple days and I am just so frustrated, I am hoping that something can be figured out!

The problem was I was in so much for a while I would not eat just waste away in bed.  It is my understanding that must cancer patients expire from malnutrition.  Well this stuff works for loss of appitite, I eat everything left over in the refreigator and I am gaining my weight back.

Other	Heatherrrrr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	1/10/2012 11:31:09 PM	My oncologist gave this to me for complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia (detected early), however, they could not rule out cancer when they first found it. When I had my D&amp;C I was taking this for about 2 weeks. I am on a low dose, 80mg/day. My pathology results after my D&amp;C WAS VASTLY IMPROVED (and no cancer!) and I feel the Megace has something to do with that. As for side effects I haven't had a pimple for almost 2 months now, my hair doesn't get greasy anymore (that's strange maybe but it's true), I get a cramp every few days, and sex is totally NOT interesting. Appetite is still normal, though. I strongly suggest taking this medicine despite the side effects!!!

Other	lous, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	7/6/2011 4:51:46 PM	I was on this medication for 21 months for endometrial stromal sarcoma.  I have two tumors growing in the recto-vaginal wall.  The medicine was supposed to shrink them however all it did was slow their growth.  I had terrible side effects: gained 25-30 pounds, crazy mood swings, serious depression, and high blood pressure.  I have to have a partial hysterectomy now anyway so I wish I would have never started on this medicine.  I have been off it for almost two months and still don't feel back to normal.  
Other	Phyl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/2/2011 10:41:51 AM	I am 47 and always maintained a weight of 105. When I had an appetite loss and dropped to 98lb I was devastated. My doctor put me on megace so I could gain some weight and it worked. I am so pleased to now weigh 125. I am a diabetic for 31 yrs. My side affects have been hair lose, vaginal itch, increased blood pressure and high blood sugar. Overall I am so satisfied with the weight gain that I deal with the side affects. I only take 1 to 2 dose a week to cut down on the side affects and that is enough to still give me an appetite to eat. Without it I have no appetite and have to force myself to eat just to compensate my insulin intake
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	3/27/2011 1:45:28 PM	I have only been on this medication for a few days.  I have been having a period for over five months, and was repeatedly told it was a reaction to my deprovara (which I have been taking for sometime, and have NEVER had this reaction with before). Shrugged off and sent on my merry little way, a month ago went to the ER due to extremely heavy bleeding and put on Reclipsen to regulate my hormones, diagnosed with dysfunctional uterine bleeding and once again patted on the head and sent on my merry little way.  Last week when on the placebo's for the reclipsen, I finally stopped bleeding for two whole days then started again.  I was admitted on wednesday to the hospital for a blood transfusion, and given the two choices of ablation and a hysterectomy, to solve my issues.  Until then I was given a D&amp;C and was told by my doctor that it was to stop my bleeding during the two weeks before the hysterectomy.  I started bleeding once again yesterday morning, after less than 24 hours after the D&amp;C, went back to the ER about it.  The doctor I saw there prescribed the Megace/Megestrol 40 mg tablets.  Since then I've had extreme diarrhea, lighted headedness, what feels like pressure on my chest, and between my weigh in yesterday and today somehow gained 7 lbs.  I would have to say, be VERY LEERY about taking this medication.  The side effects, aren't worth any potential benefits, as I've been doing this medication for two days and still bleeding. I am going to be refusing to take this medication after today again. Until I can speak to my own doctor, or a different on call doctor for my doctor's office.

My OBGYN was not very helpful.I had to do alot of research and become proactive on my pwn from being there little puppet with prescribed drugs but no answers on why?? I was bleeding. I became the puppet experiement.Go here for more info on the Drug megestrol acetate , http://www.answers.com/topic/megestrol-acetate-1 It talks about cancer and weight but also gives information on hormone drug what it does-side effects etc.. Pretty scary. I am currently back on this drug for 14 days.Although I have been bleeding myself heavily over 3 months without prognoses I finally had enough last week at Partner for Womens Health in Exeter NH &amp; demanded answers &amp; a fix. Then only was I finally going to get Lab work done. The only options I was given to stop the bleeding was Ablation or IUD..I dont think so !!! You havent even done my bloodwork to determine any factors of the reason for the bleeding. But so eager to give these options..WOW now thats scary! Being pretty much forced to go forth with a DNC I did schedule but only if necessary after the findings of Bloodwork &amp; Ultrasound to determine if really needed for me to go through a DNC. I am sick of Dr.s treating us like puppets.Soooo I went home scheduled an appointment with my Primary care dr. for a 2nd opinion &amp; then changed my OBGYN Dr

Other	Adaljisa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	35-44	8/5/2009 4:25:50 PM	The reason for taking this medication was to simply &quot;gain weight&quot;.  All my life I have been very thin and have tried many products but this actually worked in such a short time frame.  However, the draw back is that I have been off this medication for some time now and unable to get pregnant.  I have discussed this with my gyn and this was one of the causes to the situation.  So, if there is anyone outthere who simply wants to put weight on, ask questions.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	6/15/2009 8:22:18 PM	Gained a lot of weight , which dint' bother me but i think i ate so much i put my body into shock.

Loss of Appetite with HIV	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	3/15/2009 2:56:42 AM	I started taking this because I lost a signficant amount of weight being HIV.  I gained 25 lbs in 4 months.  It definitely puts fat and weight on you, which is fantastic.  POS - made my face look fuller (no more sunken in cheeks), gained overall weight to entire bodyNEG - i gained alot of weight in my stomach area, which was not appealing.  I had now developed a gut, which a problem for me. If you aren't body conscience or care about having a stomach/big gut, its a great product.  I have to get rid of the stomach that it gave me.  Before I was 127 and now I am 154.  That part has made me elated.  Now that I have gained the weight I needed, I am going off the product.  I am taking a weight gain product and start exercising.  My appetite is stimulated now, so I feel confident I can stop taking this product and with a strong work out program and the weight gain products, I will be able to maintain.  The good news now is that I won't have this stomach.  But overrall, if you have lost a signficant or alot of weight, your cheeks look sunken in, or overrall you just look frail due to HIV, I would highly recomment this product.  
Other	tjonesey66,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female		7/9/2008 12:47:34 AM	The only bad thing I can say about Megace is the side effects for me were not great. It caused weight gain, but I was told it should go away after my surgery to correct my condition. But it did stop my problem of having extreme bleeding with my endometriosis.

Other	dbat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	1	5	1	Female	45-54	1/20/2008 3:01:34 PM	I was given this drug because of heavy bleeding w/periods because of fibroids.  I had recent heart attack and was placed on ASA/Plavix. Am 48yrs old had only had bleeding/anemia as a symptom.  Uterus was 10 wk size, put on Megace daily about 5 weeks after my last period and didn't have a period until 3 wks later. It was a lighter period that lasted 4 wks.  I had a week off and started with bleeding small amounts daily.  Normal endo Bx and Fibroids have grown 2cm which I now feel abdominal pressure/bloating.  Which is new for me.  I am sure it is related to Megace.  My Gyno now recomends a hysterectomy because of the continued bleeding. I just went off it hoping that my periods will return regularly however the more I read the more I'm really uncertain.  I absolutely would not have gone on the Megace knowing what I know now.  I would have dealt with the incovnience of a heavy bleeding for 1-2 days versus the hormonal stuff.
