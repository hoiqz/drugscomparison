Started at 100mg daily, now at 200mg daily. I also take Azor, although I have recently learned you shouldn't mix a beta blocker with a calcium channel blocker. I recently had to have two stents placed in heart artery because of 90 percent blockage in two locations in same artery. I have a slow heart rate, a little shortness of breath and periodic mild dizziness. Super blood pressure, consistantly in the 115-120 over 60-70 range. Resting heart rate is in upper 50s to lower 60s. The only real complaint I have is that when I exercise, it's difficult if not impossible to get my heart rate up, which of course, creates an oxygenation problem. Tire easily. Will be talking to cardiologist today about this problem.

I'm on the lowest dose (25 mg, 2x daily). I was looking for reviews of it to see if anyone else is experiencing being very thirsty, and also having some muscle twitching at night. I'm experiencing both, but it seems like a small price to pay for lowered BP.

It can't be a once a day dosage.  If you don't take it precisely it can be ineffective.  The sexual side effects are what scares me.  But doesn't seem to be a problem at this time.

I have asked several Dr.s if that is ok for one drug and they have told me yes if it works why change it. But I sometimes wonder what damage it has done I do know that I can't go off of it without my heart rate going crazy. But it has kept my blood pressure down ok.
Heart Attack	Wholistic, 55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	2		55-64	7/24/2009 9:50:17 PM	I have always had very low blood pressure, but high cholesterol.  Had stent inserted in RCA due to blockage.  Given 12.5 mg. of Metropolol per day to &quot;help my heart work less hard.&quot;  I experience dizziness with nausea shortly after ingesting.  I also experience tiredness, some insomnia and strange dreams, restless leg syndrome in the evening.  Due to being tired, I feel crabby as well.  My BP typically is 90/60.  I do not think I need this drug but MD's say I should continue.  What to do???

I have been one this med for about a year. My doc increased the dose from 25mg to 50mg. It helped with my BP and heart rate, but the side effects is awful! Alot of weight gain, dizzy spells, fatigue, depression, and mild confusion. I am worry that it will only get worse. I don't want to take something that will bring about another medical condition due to weight gain and the other side effects. I am hoping there is a drug out there that will help with both BP and Tachcardia that will not bring about awful side effects.

Abnormal Heart Rhythm	LAM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	4/25/2009 1:18:11 PM	I developed irregular heart beats and hypertension. My doctor prescribed this and I started developing edema in my ankles and arms.  It is not slight, so I contacted the doctor.  I already reduced my salt / processed food intake and exercise regularly.  He suggested compression stockings which hasn't helped.  I suggested a diuretic but he didn't think that was a good idea. My legs really bother me and my arms look like I'm really fat but I'm not.  My doctor doesn't think this is an issue but I do. I tried a natural diuretic suggested by my acupuncturist/nutritionist but my blood pressure went nuts.  I can't enjoy outside because the heat makes it worse. I think I'm going to try another doctor.

Have been on metoprolol 25mg every 12 hours since my first atrial fibrillation episode in 6/2004.  While it seemed to work well in the beginning (1 episode the first year, a couple the next year, about 4 the year after, etc), the A-fib episodes have increased to about 7 this last year.  The most pronounced symptom appears to be tiredness - can only stay awake for about 12 hours before I get really tired.  It still works well to keep my elevated blood pressure and heart rate at a normal level, sometimes a little low, but acceptable.

Abnormal Heart Rhythm	sillyrabbit, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	55-64	12/29/2008 3:01:42 PM	I have been on Lopressor for about 2 months and it seems that the side effects are worse than the slow heart rate.  I'm only on 25 mg a day, but I have gained weight, feel a little dizzy, a little tired, spacey, and experience swelling on the ankles.  Prior to taking this drug, I did not feel dizzy, was actually beginning to loose weight, tired, but within normal range and some swelling, but not much.  This all began when I went on Lexapro, now off it due to side effects.  (No anxiety or depression).  I was the one who had to tell the doctor to get me off that.  Now Lopressor for slow heart rate and I feel far worse now than before I started.  I feel that my antidepressent helped, but I knew when it was time to get off.  I feel tha same about Lopressor.  I have always been a hig energy person and now this stuff has slowed me down.

I am Type II Diabetic and this drug is the best High Blood Pressure medicine for Diabetics because it doesn't raise the blood sugar levels.I am like the girl with the super high BP and my normal was around 190/140 or higher.I was first on 50mg twice daily. That got me down to 140/90 for a low. Then recently the doctor increased me to 100mg twice daily. Bingo!I am now in the normal range and have seen 111/63. But my Heart Rate is still in the mid to high 80's.Added to this problem is that I have to take huge doses of Potassium to combat the potassium stripping the Lasix does.And I am on high dose of Lasix, 160mg once a day and 18,000mg Potassium (18k is not a miss-print) Plus that isn't enough to get rid of the fluid, so have to take Zaroxolyn too. I have Meniere's disease, both ears. The Glands that control the fluid in the body is dead on me. So, I have zero fluid control. So, reducing the edema (fluids) wasn't enough, and Lopressor works well for me. As for Sex drive, Oh I have no problem there! I have all the want and desire!  :-)
