Chronic Hepatitis C	Robert, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	45-54	5/24/2009 11:11:30 AM	I have takeing peginterferon alfa-2a for 56 weeks and it has worked. I now have no viral load. But side affects for me was fever after weekly injection leg pain/joint pain. I also had mild depression. If i had to choose to take this again i would knowing what i know. What extra time it may give me on this planet with my wife and children is worth all the side affects and then some.So if you need this treatment give it a try you can always stop. But i beleive the benifits out weight the side effects. GOOD LUCK   Robert

And have no detectable C in my body! But one thing I believe is a direct result of taking these Hep C meds, is that I have terriable leg pain in both of my legs. Upper and lower parts. I do have some bulging on my 3rd and 4th disks in my back, which the DR. says is normal for my age. And was wondering if anyone else has this problem AFTER there regime of taking Peg &amp; Ribo? Thank You

I kept working the entire 52 weeks, lost 70 lbs. lost a lot of hair. Anyone that says they didn`t feel like s*** is lieing ! Its like the worst flu you have ever had 4x over.
Chronic Hepatitis C	Danny, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	25-34	8/2/2008 1:52:13 AM	I had good day's and bad I had more bad than good it seemed like.Your back aches so bad I'm bipolar so pegasys really messes with you psycologically with that people around you are affected as well.Aside from the bad side affects peginterferon alfa 2a with ribasphere 52 weeks of treatment and the HEP C 1a really agressive strain is undetectable I'll be back in 4 months to tell you if the HEP C came back or not hope not!

I have 20 more weeks of treatment and feel like it has worked for me. I was genotype 1a grade 2 stage 2. Doctor told me I was middle of the road for doing the treatments. I take a shot of peg and a shot of neupogen once a week and 1000mg of ribivarin every day. It's been rough at times but well worth it.
