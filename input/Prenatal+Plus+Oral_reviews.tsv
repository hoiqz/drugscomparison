Pregnancy	SunShyne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/1/2011 11:01:31 AM	I find this Pill very helpful to my health and the fetus inside of me. I am very happy with it. My nails, hair and Physical look, are very healthy. My nails and hair seem to have grown very rapidly. I only take once a day, with food, normally at breakfast or lunch. I help me better than taking in the evening. When I took it the evening, I seemed to have become more constipated. So the daytime works very well for me. I'm sure it's doing wonders for my fetus also.

I don't take pills when I don't know what's in them! Finally I found this list AND a scan of the actual label from the manufacturer. Here's a link to the list and scan.http://www.drugs.com/pro/prenatal-plus.html

This happened two days in a row. Started taking this in March 2009 before the birth of my daughter. I was switched to another manufacturer in November and then back to this just last week. I don't know if they changed the formulary, but it doesn't fit well with my chemistry anymore.

Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	25-34	4/12/2010 12:27:45 AM	My Doctor prescribed me to take 1 tablet per day, however, I have read elsewhere (including the list of ingredients from my pharmacy) that 4 tablets per day is the serving size. Now I'm not sure if I'm getting enough folic acid, calcium, etc. 
Pregnancy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	3/27/2010 11:39:21 PM	I have been taking this specific prenatal mutivitamin for a month now and it is by far my least favorite of the four I have tried. My iron is still I little bit low even with a balanced diet and I have had much more trouble with bowel movements ever since. Unfortunalty my insurance doesn't cover any other brands and I have only 12 weeks until birth so I have choosen to just stick with this along with some of my own additives such as a low dosage iron pill, stool softener, and a omega-3 fatty acid fish oil pill. If you are not already in a routine and close to your pregnancy exit I would suggest taking Flinstones Complete with Choline for adults with some additives of your own if needed. It cheaper than most prescibed prenatal multivitamins and actually recommended by obstetritions for those with lower income.

My baby is now 3 months old and I still take it. I used to be the type of person to get sick all the time. Since I have begun taking this, I never get sick and my baby has been healthy as well. I will be staying on this as long as I can. I no longer have insurance but recently found the exact same thing at walgreens much cheaper than the normal 1 month supply I used to get from my doctor.

I googled the name and found the chemical make up and I am satisfied with that. It doesn't make me feel sick.

I have acid reflux and am on medication for my reflux but if I am having a bad day with it, adding the Prenatal Plus can worsens those effects. So I usually skip the Prenatal Plus that day. Other than that, the medicine has been great. I had MRSA and I was getting sick repeatedly and was put on this over a year ago for a temporary basis to help build my immune system and have stayed on it at my own request for my own well being. I don't get a lot of dairy intake, am fair skinned, had skin cancer five years ago (basil cell carcinoma), and don't spend very much time outdoors, so I have also added a vitamin D 1,000U supplement to it. So with these two together and my normal diet I have never felt better.
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/13/2008 6:07:34 PM	I could not take most OTC brands for stomach problems. This one is gentle on the digestive tract, so my Dr. prescribed it, even though I am a guy and not pregnant.   So expecting or not, this is a vitamin that is suitable for my reflux problems (not to treat it, just a vitamin I can take with my moderate-severe reflux), so I would believe that other could ask your Dr. about this if you feel it may be right for you, it is more pricey than other OTC vitamins, but worth it. And for sie effects, I have noted a much faster pace of growth of facial hair (remember I am a guy, I am not saying it will give a female facial hair), faster growth of hair on top of head (great if you are into heavy metal and hair band look), and finger and toe nail growth is faster and have stronger nails, so my wife now take it for mostly this reason, longer stronger nails! At least for her.  Give it a try, my 18 yr old neighbor is also taking it, she is pregnant, and her medicaid pays for it also, so if you can't afford it, your insurance may cover it, regretfully, not mine.
