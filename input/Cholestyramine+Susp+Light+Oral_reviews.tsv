Chronic Diarrhea	billjh3, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	55-64	4/17/2012 1:27:54 PM	After starting this medication I noticed a rash on both arms and some on the top part of my legs.  To make sure that it was the drug causing it I stopped taking it.  Within a few days the rash began to go away.  I restarted the cholestyramine and the rash came back.  I have stopped the medication upon the advice of my Doctor.

They said I had IBS too. Finally took gallbladder out but diarrhea didnt stop. Started this medicine and I have no more diarrhea after only 2 days on this stuff. I'm taking it twice a day, WOW  Its so great not having to worry about having a bathroom close by anymore. It was terrible. This stuff is great. I mix it in a small plastic soda bottle which makes it easier to mix up, start with a little water and shake then add more water and shake again, this has been the best way to mix up for me.      I've lost so much weight over the past 2 years, has anyone else had this problem? If so any suggestions on how to gain weight? Nothing is working, Im eating a lot all day long.

Chronic Diarrhea	ladylee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/21/2009 6:29:51 PM	I have dealt with chronic diahrea since I was a child. I also have had my gallbladder removed. I could never go out to eat and not have to run to the bathroom and I kept from eating during the day for fear of what might happen. With this medication I have seen a dramatic difference. I also take bentyl which combined with this medicaton has made me think that just maybe some day I will feel secure enough to be able to do the things that I have kept from doing for fear of having to use the bathroom. 
Chronic Diarrhea	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/5/2009 10:16:35 AM	I had my gallbladder removed 10 years ago and I have been very limited in dining out due to the diarrhea after eating. This medication worked immediately and I wish I had known about it sooner.
Chronic Diarrhea	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/20/2009 2:25:24 PM	while i found it difficult to dissolve the powder even after quite a lot of mixing, the taste isn't terrible... the texture is my biggest hurdle. as far as effectiveness goes, i could not be more pleased. i had my gall bladder removed and had chronic diarrhea several times a day for more than 7 months. after the first dose, it was a miracle. recently i have found that even missing one dose can be severe. if i have to be on this medication every day for the rest of my life, it is SO much better than not being able to eat in public or needing to be near a bathroom within minutes of eating.
High Cholesterol	breakwater, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	2/7/2009 1:00:22 AM	I started taking this twice a day.  I woke up after 2 days with very swollen hands and fingers.  I actually injured one of my fingers because it felt numb.  Now I'm down to once a day.  Still feel bloated at times. Need more time to see if it helps my cholesterol and triglycerides. Does affect other meds. Make sure you take it hour before or 4 to 6 hours after your other meds.

But,find it to be nausating if mixed with water. The only way it is palaple is with v-8 -spicy onlyjuice,or applesauce. Due to taste and the mixing process I've notice I avoid compliantancy.It sticts to the glass-if you forget to rinse it, you can forget it and just through them away.  It's next to impossible to get clean. I would suggest you insert something like wood popsycle sticks in the box for stirring and inform your patients to use disposable 4oz paper cups..

It is not easy for me to mix with something to drink as I am disabled.  Overall I am not satisfied with my experience, and do not really know why I am taking it. Dr thought I had kidney stones, test negative.  I do have heart disease and a mytro-valve also a history of strokes, high blood pressure etc.

I have had diarrhea for 4 days out of the pass 7 days.  it is very watery, I am taking sips of gatorade through out the day, most days I am eating food.  It is really depressing me to continue to have diarrhea like this.  I don't take the medication when I have diarrhea.  Should I continue taking the medication while I am having diarrhea.  I was taking the medication once a day, now I am taking it twice a day per my doctor.
