It works extremely well. I have used it on a couple of occasions to assist with sleep. I take 2 and sleep 6-8 hours of very restful sleep. You do not wake up groggy as with some sleep aids. 
Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	Jan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/14/2012 12:46:14 PM	I, as well as other members of my family, have used Doan's for more than 40 years for back, neck and joint pain (osteoarthritis). We have all recommended it to others during the years, then received back positive comments from those to whom we suggested the drug. I personally suffer from severe low back pain, and Doan's relieves the pain within an hour so I can move and walk freely again. I try to limit intake to no more than 2 pills within a 12-hour period. I have taken safely, during pain flareups, for 40 years - no side effects.
Pain	sm0kinmama, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/10/2011 5:57:28 AM	My 56 year old husband died within 6 hours of taking one of these pills! Unfortunately, diabetics sometimes have poor eyesight.  He only took one of these pills as evidenced by the package contents and it was his first time using the product. The warning on the label is so small that it is criminal in my opinion. I urge Doan's to make the warning sings larger.  We have suffered greatly from his loss and he has missed seeing any grandchildren etc. MAKE THE WARNINGS LARGER!!!!!
Pain	Ssadibug, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/7/2011 2:34:10 PM	I have fibromyalgia and a chronic low back condition where my vertebre itself swells if irritated.  (yeah - not fun)  The pills suprised the heck out of me.I want something to treat the swelling not just the pain.  I can't be on steroids all the time.  Naproxen is limited.  So I tried these back pills.  I was extremely pleased with the result.  I did not expect as much relief as I got.  I had to remember to take it easy because I felt so good.  I only took them once a day.  I kept them seperated from the time I took anything else.  I read the warning pack and followed directions.  I will be asking my doctor about her concerns and ask her why we haven't gone this route already.  In the mean time, this is fantastic help to get me to the next day and week.  :D

Even prescribed muscle relaxants don't help like Doans!
Pain	Jeff, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	10/24/2009 10:27:53 PM	I found out about Doan's while Googling and trying to find an OTC muscle relaxant. Unfortunately there are no OTC muscle relaxants in the US, but Doan's kept coming up on message boards as an &quot;alternative&quot; to the standard pain meds on the shelves (Aspirin, Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Naproxen). So I went to the store and bought a 24ct box of Doan's. Come to find out, the Magnesium compound that makes up Doan's is technically a unique NSAID/anti-inflammatory. I thought it was something &quot;different&quot;. So anyway, you can't/shouldn't take it if you've already taken Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Aspirin, or any other NSAID. So I took 2 of the Doan's with 2 Tylenol and the edge was definitely taken off my back pain. Not sure how superior it necessarily is to using Ibuprofen/Naproxen/Aspirin in place of the Doan's, but oh well.
