I had no side effects. I made sure I took a dose every six hours.  Very expensive if you do not have good health coverage. Insurance paid $3,000 for 15 day treatment.

Had to be taken off and wound up in hospital. Within a few days of being on Vancocin, I feel like a whole new person!

It cleared up but 5 days of being off the medication the problem returned. At a cost of $1,000 for the two week supply I was disappointed to say the least. My doctor switched to Metronidazol along with Rifampin which seems to be working and covered by insurance.

Other	I'm a believer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/25/2009 8:20:32 AM	I was hospitalized for diverticulitis since it wasn't clearing up.  I developed colitis as a result of being on antibiotics for over 3 weeks.Nothing was clearing up and I was still having loose stools multiple times a day and pain.My doctor started Vancocin (liquid was the only way my hospital administered it)and within 3 days, felt immensely better.Expensive, very!  Fortunately, my insurance covered it.  I am on pills at home.  I had never heard of this antibiotic before but am a believer in it now.  Especially since my diverticulitis flares up occasionally.  I now know what differences to look for in my symptoms to indicate the colitis caused by the anitbiotics.

Started Vancocin and within 3 days was feeling like a new person. I know it is very expensive, but I was lucky that my ins. covered this drug. had great results.

Severe Bloody Diarrhea from Antibiotics		3	5	3			9/8/2008 12:40:55 PM	I use it to treat CDiff in elderly relative. the drug does not kill CDiff spores, only the hatched bacteria. Many people relapse because spores can hatch long after the Vanco treatment completed. Very Expensive.A 3 week supply cost $1,600 .Better then Flagyl. If you are hospitilized with Cdiff,  don't let some penny pinching doctor order the liquid form, it is very salty and disgusting, you must DEMAND the capsule form. Many doctors are too stupid to teat CDiff. If you relapse, find a good GI specialist who knows about &quot;pulse dosing&quot; and probiotics (florastor, Culurelle, Flora Q). There is no cure for Cdiff, so victims must try alternate approaches to battle it in combination with antibiotics. If you relapse after Vanco treatment, you have a tough battle ahead to prevent more relapses.Always have a good digital thermometer at home to check for fever during a relapse, and get medical help right away. Even the relapses can cause damage to your colon.

I was placed on flagyl for 14 days without improvement. After just 48 hours of vancocin I felt 100% better.
