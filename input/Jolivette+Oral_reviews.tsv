Birth Control	Now happy momma of 2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	3	1	Female	25-34	7/25/2012 3:36:38 PM	I started taking this 6 wks after having my daughter. At first I didn't notice any of the effects or didn't think it was from the pill. But now that have daughter is 7months i see now its this BC. I have experienced... Extreme hair loss, decreased breast size, depression, loss of appeal to do things, dizziness, tired, moody, low libido, rashes on my daughter when she nurses!!! I'm 26 and healthy! It's too the point where I would much rather get pregnant again than feel this way! I have not had a period yet, but am nursing full time (besides introducing solids) and took a pregnancy test (neg). I almost went into the mental health clinic to talk to someone about depression.. Then it hit me! IT'S THIS PILL!!!! Our bodies werent made to have fake hormones interrupting its natural balance. Sounds like there is a good chance of getting pregnant again on it anyways... Today is my last day on it! Goodbye depression and hair loss-Hello my happy life!!! 
Birth Control	Jp, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/15/2012 2:11:55 PM	Well first of all I've been taking this since my 6 week check up post pregnancy or for about 7 1/2 months now because I'm nursing so this is bc prescribed.  I didn't take bc prior to getting pregnant so I wasn't used to side effects since taking this I thought all the symptoms I've been having were all my post postpartum hormone changes but just in the last few months probably lost 2/3 of all my hair, period started it was very heavy and my face has broke out and the worst was this horrible fatigue similar to feeling dehydrated.  People keep asking are you depressed and I keep saying no I have a lot of great things happening to me right now but have no physical or mental energy its weird.  My mind has been playing games I'm thinking maybe I have cancer or leukimia or something horrible then my insurance lapsed and couldn't afford my rx anymore so I'm not taking it and suddenly things are clearer literally I can focus now and my face is starting to clear up.  My hair is starting to hang in there better too.  I won't take this ever again! Wish I would have talked to OB a long time ago instead of waiting for my new insurance to start to get some answers.  Looks like I figured it out on my own even if by accident.
Birth Control	misinformed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	7/7/2012 5:36:12 PM	What is most disturbing side effect for me was the immediate leg and back pain that became severely excruciating making it difficult for me to stand up and walk. I also experienced hair loss and weight gain. I had swelling in the feet and hands. I feel that I have retained more water in my body. I am a pretty happy person but since I took it, I rarely smile or laugh. I am getting rid of this pill right away. I have been taking it for a month but cannot wait to get rid of the pain, hair loss, weight gain, swelling, and migraines. 
Birth Control	Laura, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	6/27/2012 2:16:57 PM	I'm 19 years old and I've been on this pill for 3 months now. I used to be on the generic form of Yaz but since it worsened my migraines, another doctor prescribed me Jolivette. I have not had any more migraines since being on this pill but my periods are longer, my cramps are way more intense, my breasts and nipples are incredibly tender a week before my period comes, and I have been feeling extremely depressed at random times for no real reason at all. I am considering changing birth control methods.
Birth Control	wrndy123, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	6/21/2012 2:15:22 PM	I am extremely active and have had  a lot of trouble losing weight, whereas on Estrostep, I did not have this difficulty. I have also noticed a drop in libido. I used to have a very healthy sexual appetite, but after 6 months on Jolivette and a new relationship which is wonderful, I am very disappointed.  It is very difficult to take this pill at the EXACT same time every day. It kind of rules my life and is always on my mind.  I am abandoning Jolivette in favor of an IUD.  
Birth Control	chrissyinatl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	6/19/2012 4:23:34 PM	I can't take estrogen and my husband and I are planning to try for a family in 6 months or so, so my OB/GYN prescribed this for me (I used to be on depo provera).  My skin looks HORRIBLE, I'm tired and I am losing hair.  Not a fan, but at least this is short term.
Birth Control	Hraup, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	5/31/2012 4:19:05 PM	I have been on it for over 2 years now. I have to take a low form of BC b/c I have a hole in my heart and can't risk blood clots. Since taking it. I have gained 25 pounds. My face, back , and chest are clustered with pimples (i've never been this bad) my periods are very regular/predictable. I do take pregnancy tests often b/c I feel I have the symptoms. Negative. I seem to always have a feeling of UN-easiness/panic. The packet says there is a greater chance of becoming pregnant while on it compared to other pills. but because of it's low dose, I have to .
Birth Control	blondie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	5/19/2012 10:24:14 AM	I started use this pill 4 months ago and its terrible I started it because I m nursing, since I have started it my hair falls out in clumps, I have really bad acne I use to have clear fine skin, I have gained about 8 lbs. I feel like all I want to do is eat. I have spotting non stop it goes from spotting to heaving bleeding. I feel weird and have bad mood swings, I should feel happy because of my new baby and I love my family. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I have really thin hair and now I have no hair I have bald spots. I get really upset easliy and want to cry.. 
Birth Control	heath511, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/15/2012 1:58:17 PM	I was looking to go back on the pill after a long break. I was prescribed this because I have a history of migraines and panic attacks, and can not take BC pills containing estrogen. After the first month I noticed a 2 lb weight gain that subsided after finishing my first full pack of pills. Other than that, I do experience low blood sugar more often than when I was not on the pill, but I just make sure I have some fruit handy &amp; don't go more than a few hours without eating. I have been on this pill for 4 months and have noticed that while the PMS has not gone away totally, it is limited to just a few days before I get my period, rather than a full week before. Also, my bleeding is much lighter, although I am still getting my period every month. I do have some concerns about the long term effectiveness of the pill based on some of the stories I have read on various websites, but my dr. seems to think this is the best option for me at this time.  Not having a real problem remembering to take it. I think it is a great option for women that can not take the combo pills and do not want to go to Mirena or Paraguard.   
Birth Control	Christinamarie84, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/2/2012 9:21:18 AM	This medicine is awful! Made me a angry mess!! 
Birth Control	haqjgraham, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	4/25/2012 1:46:47 AM	I just want to say thanks to the people that reviwed it. I just got prescribed it because I am nursing, but after reading these reviews there  is no way in hell I am taking it. It sounds to me that the only way it works as a birth control is that it would make no guy want to do it with you because you are a hairless, acne infested, angry woman who is always on her period.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	4/20/2012 3:10:30 PM	This BC is horrible for me, I can't believe how much I have changed as a person since I started taking it. It's has almost caused me to want to get a divorce and leave my family. I am by nature a happy person and this has made me so enraged I am affraid of my self sometimes, needless to say I am getting off of it before I end up in jail. I have blury vision, headaches, acne, hair loss and crazy feelings. Most wanted to associate this with post pregnancy feeling but there is no way after 6 months of not being pregnant that I could not feel normal again. Plus the fact that I am always late on my period and I don't want any more kids. With this not being a sure thing to BC I must get on something different becuase I want no surprises!
Birth Control	chi123, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	4/14/2012 9:22:01 PM	Despite taking the pill as prescribed (precisely at the same time everyday) I became pregnant for the first time while on Jolivette.  Not realizing I was pregnant, I continued to take Jolivette, and I had light bleeding that with consistent with my cycle.  The fact that I might be pregnant never occurred to me.  After being sick with nausea and vomiting for nearly a month I went to my internist because I thought I had an ulcer or some other GI issue.  My doctor insisted on giving me pregnancy test to rule pregnancy out and it turned out that I was pregnant.  I was 11 weeks along.  If you take this pill as your method for birth control, from my own experience, a back up method is also needed.  I did not have any side effects commonly complained of (weight gain, hair loss, mood swings). 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	1	Female	19-24	4/3/2012 3:42:15 PM	So I read the reviews online for this medicationa and came across some stories straight out of a horror film, but I figured that it would affect each person differently and gave it a try. I'm not breastfeeding, but I am taking other medications so my obgyn suggested this pill. Right away, I started experiencing mood swings. Sometimes I felt depressed, and other times I felt enraged for no apparent reasons, or minor reasons. I feel crabby all the time and have turned into a major bitch. No good. Next, I started bleeding but didn't worry about it too much since I knew spotting was normal for birth control. Well I've been bleeding for the past 3 weeks with no end in sight. The bleeding started off as spotting and then fluctuated from heavy (wearing a pad or tampon) to light (wearing a pantiliner). This is ridiculous since one of the main reasons for birth control pills is the ability to have sex without a condom. Well I haven't been able to have sex AT ALL. (Probably a contributing factor to my bad moods)Also, I've heard of many becoming pregnant on this pill, which scares me. I haven't experienced any weight gain or hair loss like many have said. Maybe that's because I haven't been on the pill for long (and don't plan to be). I wouldn't recommentd this pill at all.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	3/28/2012 10:29:58 AM	I have been taking this Bc for six months. Dr prescribed it because I am breastfeeding. I have always had side effects from my Bc but this is the worst. Horrible acne, weight gain, low milk supply and really terrible moodiness, hair loss as well. My house looks like we have ten long haired dogs. Glad I came on here and read these other reviews because it seems I'm not alone. My Dr wont prescribe anything else while I'm nursing so I'm just going to give up on this pill and use other forms of Bc until I am through nursing. Hopefully the effects will go away because they are really messing with me!
Birth Control	ddmccabe121187, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	3/7/2012 4:44:40 PM	Alright so my doctor switched me to this when I told him I was having really bad headaches from my other bc. I started taking it about a year ago and everything was great for the first couple months. Then I noticed hair loss, acne, breast tenderness before and during my period. Then slowly but surly I started missing a period here and there. I just thought that it was normal and the dr said it was well now I am 40 days late and have every symptom known to man for pregnancy and the hpt keep coming up negative. I have a daughter that will be 2 in June so if I am pregnant then I'm not to worried about it but daddy might not be happy. I just hate spending money on hpt and the dr wont do anything honestly I have stopped taking it now for 2 weeks and still haven't started. my boyfriend and I have not had sex in over 3 weeks so if i am pregnant i got pregnant while on it but 7 test have come up negative. I am waiting to see if I miss a 3rd period if so I will take another test if negative I am going to tell my dr I want a blood test and ultra sound because I have ALL the symptoms   
Birth Control	woman, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	2/15/2012 2:13:02 PM	Works as advertised, however, I had massive hair loss and had to switch.
Other	Horrible mini pill, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	2/3/2012 9:32:24 PM	My doctor recommended this pill b/c I was having 2 periods a mth. So I just needed something to regulate me. And I took this pill for just 10 days and I was miserable! Breast tenderness, I broke out with acne all over my face, back &amp; arms. I had vaginal dryness, and weight gain! I threw that junk in the trash!! 
Birth Control		3	3	5			2/3/2012 9:27:20 PM	haven't had any problems so far and have been taking it for over a yr. but my only concern would be the high risk of pregnancy... heard about many becoming pregnant while there taking it
Birth Control	dsmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	1/21/2012 10:39:47 PM	I started this pill because I was nursing my son and needed a birth control option.  I have been taking this for about a year and have been having a period every two weeks, my last period with excruciating cramps, which I have never had in my 12 years on other birth controls and before when not taking birth control.  I am moody and grumpy all the time, feeling incredible rage sometimes.  I am normally a very even tempered person.  Recently, about three months now, I have had horrible, painful acne on my chin and neck.  Not a fan of this birth control.
Birth Control	kayW811, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	1/16/2012 3:35:14 PM	I am taking this medication because I am breastfeeding. For 3 months I have not had a period. After the first 2months on this medication I started experiencing HAIR LOSS. My hair was healthy and thick thin suddenly I noticed when I would brush my hair the comb would be full of hair. After stopping this medication my hair stopped falling out.
Birth Control	bookworm, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	11/17/2011 2:41:30 PM	Was prescribed this pill because combo pills caused undesirable emotional side effects.  At first I was very happy because this pill did not effect my moods, however it didn't take very long before I started to have annoying physical side effects such as periods every two weeks,constant spotting, vaginal itching and dryness, big horrible cystic acne all over my chin, etc.  I stopped taking it today, and I'm hoping things will start to go back to normal! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	11/6/2011 12:40:00 AM	I have been using this BC for 2 years now, and it has been 100% effective, without backup birth control, for that I am extremely happy. When I first started, I would have periods once every 3 months (light and short), but now (2 yrs later) I have spotting CONSTANTLY. It is almost like having a slow, light period for two weeks at at time(but sometimes are heavy and painful like a normal period). My doctor said to keep taking it, regardless, however I am thinking of switching since this is a huge inconvenience. If you miss even ONE pill or take one a few hours late, you will start bleeding one to two days later, guaranteed (which could last up to two weeks even if you take all the other pills on time).Also, ever since I have been on ANY type of hormone BC (patch, yaz, norab, seasonale..) my hair falls out constantly. I cannot vacuum my house enough. It is so bad that it is noticeable by others, and honestly quite embarrassing. I have had no acne problems with this medication.
Other	Kathryn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	11/4/2011 10:22:46 PM	I had to go on this pill because I was breastfeeding and had endometrioma in the past (and don't want it back).  The whole time I have been on this pill, I have felt swelling, joint pain, weight gain, itchy and flaky scalp, acne, etc.  Within the past month, I have gotten my period 3 times.  I also took a pregnancy test because I seemed to have all the symptoms, but it was negative.  My son is almost 9 months old and  I can't wait until I hit the year mark and can get off of this pill.  If you have any other options, I would go with something else!
Birth Control	New mom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	10/7/2011 12:54:53 AM	I have been taking this BC for 3 months now.  I can't take any BC with estrogen as I'm still a nursing mom, so this is the pill my Dr perscribed.  My son is 10months old.  Anyways, ever since starting this pill I have felt crampy and lower back pain more than usual.  I also have been getting 3 periods a month and they come with excruciating cramps.  Before starting this pill I had already starting having regular periods again and they were nothing like how they are now that I'm on this BC.  I'm tempted to call my Dr and reasses if there are any other options.  I also notice I feel extra moody.  I'm a grump when normally I'm bubbly and happy.  So far no pregnancy scare though because my husband and I don't rely on it 100% and use condoms for backup.
Birth Control	sarahjane, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	7/23/2011 3:40:52 PM	Well. Three months into switching to it, I got pregnant. I'd call that a fail.
Birth Control	missgmc88, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	6/1/2011 4:00:41 AM	I've been taking Jolivette for three months. I am 23 years old and do not have any children. My doctor recommended this pill to me because I was experiencing constant debilitating migraines on my last pill. Since I started this pill I have not had any migraines which is a major plus- but since the second month of being on this pill I have had very irregular bleeding which is not normal for me. My periods have always been relatively short normally 3-4 days and now they have been 7-9 days. I take my pill at the exact same time every day and have had three periods within the last month. I have not had any hair loss or acne. I haven't gained any weight, but I have gone up an entire cup size. I have noticed an increase in breast tenderness before and during periods, which can be very uncomfortable. If it weren't for the multiple periods each month I would love this pill since my migraines have stopped. I am hoping that my body is still regulating and it is too soon to tell. If the multiple periods continue I will have to consider other preventive methods because 3 periods a month is killing my sex life.

Three weeks apart, 2 weeks apart, and then no period for the past 8 weeks. After it had been 5 weeks late, I took a pregnancy test just to rule out pregnancy... it was negative. Then a couple weeks after this, I noticed I was extremely tired a lot, lost my appetite, and was feeling a little sick. I honestly thought something else was going on but decided to take another hpt just to be sure. So today... I had 2 positive pregnancy tests! I do not recommend using this &quot;birth control&quot;!

I thought my hair looked better and I had no ill side effects. I thought everything was great till I found out yesterday I'm pregnant. Totally epic fail!
Other	nick@40, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	5/13/2011 4:24:58 PM	Been on this pill for a month b/c I have 7 fibroids and lots of pain monthly but never a lot of bleeding. Started my period at the end of pack one and it was very heavy bleeding. I have been using super absorbency tampon and a pad and never b4 did I bleed like this. I have had swollen breast but not terribly painful - I can deal with that. I had an increased appetite, naseau and acne. My period came 6 days later than it was supposed to. I DO NOT have the pain that I had b4 taking this pill and for me that is relief. I have only been bleeding for 3 days now and I hope it stops really soon. I haven't lost any hair. If my period last for more than my normal 5 days and my hair starts to fall out then I will stop this pill.

I am very upset that my doctor recommended this drug..I will not be taking any birth control when I'm nursing my baby.

Since being on Jolivette, i had went 3 mos without my period. and i wasn't pregnant. Then from Aug 10 through Jan 2011 i would get my period then few days later i would be spotting. Then few days from that i'd be spotting. I was spotting every week for like 3 days. Went to doc and they did SIS to c if i have fibroids, i do but they are not causing my problem. Doc believes tat it is the bc...really dont want to change bc cuz there is not much out that i can take cause estrogen is my enemy.

I've tolerated this pill pretty well but I'm switching back to my old pill, loestrin. I've gained 10lbs ( and i have been the same weight for 9 years prior) my hail falls out like crazy and i have horrible acne. Not happy :( 
Birth Control	MissB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	3/14/2011 1:12:15 PM	I have tired almost all types of bc with both less and strong hormones in them. I finally let them go and my NP started me on Jolivette because the other bc gave me hot flashes and crazy mood swings with aniexty, big appeitte. I started jolivette everything that i had experience was gone! I can control my appeitte now and I'm aniexty free. I definitely have to say I workout for many years now and now I see more results of belly fat gone with the same workout that i have done before. I know most people hate taking pills daily but for me it's just another thing to add to my daiy routine and just take your pill on time and you won't have any problems. I know i take my pills on time and i haven't spotted. I say I would recommend this bc  but i know its not for everyone. Good luck everyone

My milk supply has always been just barely enough (now supplemented with formula), and I don't know whether or not that can be attributed to this pill. I do like that it's the same pill every single day and my only real complaint is that I'm surprised I can't find it cheaper than $30/month considering it's a generic.

I was exclusively breastfeeding my daughter for 15 months and took this pill everyday. I lost all my baby weight and more than i wamted. No matter how much i ate i could not gain weight. I dont think this had anything to do with the pill bc i read the opposite on alot of reviews. I actually had no problems with this pill at all. It was very effective and Im glad i used it. I will be switching to orthotricyclen only bc i have stopped breastfeeding. I recommend this to any nursing mother.

I have not had a single period, no spotting, no acne problems, but losing the baby weight has been difficult. I have recently stopped breast feeding and quit the pill. Believe it or not I want my menstrual cycle back. It has been about 4 weeks now, with condoms, and I am still waiting for a period. I have also been watching my calorie, fat, and sugar intake closely, and I have not lost a single pound.

I like taking the same pill everyday, all month. Having to switch to a different color when I'm on my period is a hassle. I have my hands full with working full time and having 3 kids so I need something easy to take and easy to remember to take. I havent experienced any negative side effects. My period is actually lighter and 2 days shorter! I am very happy with Jolivette and will continue to take it! 
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	9/24/2010 1:32:25 PM	I'm 10 days into pack 2 and stopped today. I just couldn't take the side effects anymore.  This is my second attempt at POP pills, several months ago I tried Camila, after 3 months on that I stopped due to extended periods.  I can't say that the Jolivette has been much better.  I have taken these pills at exactly the same time every day.  Not an easy thing to do but I set my cell phone alarm so it reminded me.   Since I started my breasts have been extremely sore, to the point that the slightest touch HURTS and it is effecting my daily life &amp; work outs!  I have also had bloating (clothes don't fit), mood swings, constant hunger, increase in breast size (not happy about that since I am petite) &amp; thining hair.  The worse has been the 10 day period.  I would rather have 3 days of heavy bleeding than deal with this for over a week.  These pills are not for me.  I was on combination pills for 20 years, the only reason I am off them is my age and my choice not the ob/gyn's.  I never had any side effects while taking combo pills so I am finding all the side effects with the POPS unappealing. I need to find something new that won't make me feel awful, act crazy and is safe!

However, recently i have stopped having my periods and my doctors believe it is normal but this is a side effect i do not like. 
Birth Control	laursilver, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	9/17/2010 4:42:23 PM	I have been on several types of bc (Yasmin, Estrostep, ortho, orthlo, loestrin) with major side effects including serious migraines and bloating/weight gain. My dr. suggested I try a mini pill as it seems my body was responded negatively to the estrgen. I have been on Jolivette for 2 months and my major complaint is the acne. I have had very few breakouts since college, and now 8 years later, I am experiencing acne on my face and neck. I have had some weight gain (less than 5lbs), bloating and diarrhea, but nothing serious. However, the acne is becoming a problem, does anyone have any recommendations for how to avoid the acne? I am taking the pill around the same time daily (no later than 30 mins) and my diet is regular. thank you!

Birth Control	Mom of Two, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/29/2010 4:35:17 AM	I took this pill after each of my boys were born. I had no side effects and was quite satisfied with it. However, I have never really reacted to any birth control pill, so that might just be me.  If you're taking because you are breastfeeding, as you produce less milk, I would definitely suggest a back-up. 
Other	ellenmarie10, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	7/29/2010 1:01:52 AM	At first everything was great with this bc. Then I started bleeding. At first it was just break though bleeding but then it got heavier. The only reason I'm taking this bc is because I'm breastfeeding my son.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	6/21/2010 4:12:55 PM	I used to take Ortho Tri Low before the birth of my son in 2007. After that, I switched to Jolivette because of my high blood pressure.  My period use to be every 28 days like clockwork.  Then I started having them anywhere from 28-35 days apart.  Had my last regular period March 2010 and haven't had one since.  I talked to my Dr. office and she said that a lot of people who take this for a long time will end up not having a period, but not to worry as long as you are taking it properly and not coming out with a positive preg. test.  She also said that this pill is REALLY only about 80% effective, that it is best used with a backup.  I am not using a backup, nor am I pregnant.  She said just to wait and see what happens that it's no big deal.
Birth Control	PWhitty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	6/21/2010 1:04:00 PM	I switched to this bc because I was having sever migranes w/ Yaz &amp; my dr thinks I might be sensitive to estrogin.I'm in the middle of my 3rd pack and I hate this bc with a passion!! I don't have the migranes anymore but I'm almost always on my period. I've gained about 5-7 lbs and my boobs hurt all the time. I'm still in search of the right bc because my husband and I do not want kids, it's pretty imperative I find something that doesn't make me crazy. Any suggestions would be welcome. 
Birth Control	mommyof3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/15/2010 3:57:05 AM	I have been on Jolivette for 11 months now. It is a great pill just had my first period a month ago, but that could also be because of breastfeeding my baby. I haven't had any mood swings that I can tell, always been a little moody since I was a child. No acne, no oily skin, or any other bad side effect. However I have had to take a pregnancy test a couple of times because of having symptoms like I might have been. Forgot my pills on time a couple of times (seems to happen when you are running around after a baby), but used back up method. Over all this is the best BC that I have ever been on. 
Birth Control	520, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/15/2010 4:33:27 PM	I loved this pill. I was 23 when I started it. I started taking it 6 weeks after giving birth to my son, it was prescribed by my Dr. since I breastfed for the first 20 months.I took it for two years and only switched as my insurance moved it to a higher tier which caused it to become more expensive. No side affects that I ever noticed. Although I did have break-through bleeding every 3 months which was like a normal period. You don't get a real period on this pill as they are all active pills. I wish the price hadn't increased as I would still be on it, even without breastfeeding anymore. This pill must be taken on time, which I had no problem with due to the automatic alarm on my cell phone. If forgotten, you cannot double-up on pills the next day.   
Birth Control	nikkid, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	4/24/2010 12:52:34 PM	I used this drug after having my son in 07 and it worked fine. While using correctly got pregnant with my daughter on 09. I am using it agin because I have high bp and can't use anything else. I will use for the next 3 mnths as I have an Essure placement. I had no other recourse because I bleed all the time for 5/7 days at a time - I don't know when I will have a period. And this is now triggering the most horid migraines I have ever had. Can't wait to stop using this product.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/7/2010 6:04:42 PM	im going to stop taking this. i now have a colicky baby and weight gain. started taking this when my baby was 7 weeks old, and thats when he got the colic.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	3/15/2010 5:05:50 PM	I started taking this pill 3 months ago.  The first month I experienced the worst symptoms like diarrhea, back pain, migraines, irregular periods, and lower stomach pains. I really want to change my birth control method because the stomach pain is still occurring and I cannot tell when my period will come. In fact, my period went from 25days to 26days to no period at all over the 3 months.     
Birth Control	 Female  (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female		3/1/2010 8:17:40 PM	I started taking this pill after my 6 wk check up from when I had my son.  Within 2-3 weeks, I got the most excruciating migraine that I thought I was going to have to go to the emergency room. Nothing would alleviate the pain.  I continued taking the pill for about 2 weeks which was when the intense migraine occured again.  I decided that was enough for me!  I have been off of the pill for about 4 weeks and have yet to get my period. ( I was regular up until I started taking these stupid pills.)
Birth Control	aserehtcannon, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	2/9/2010 8:58:04 AM	I had taken three other birth control pills over my adult life and had no problems.  This brand is the worst I have ever taken; took this pill while breast feeding second child.  I have bloating to the point joints feel inflamed; my arches feel like they are falling.  My hair is thinning more on the right side than left side; it is that noticeable. The bleeding is sporadic.  I will have three days of heavy, a break of two days, three days of spotting, a break of three days, and a few more days of medium to light spotting.  I have extremely dry eyes and skin.  I got off of this after three months; it was too unbearable.  I only used it this long because I was breastfeeding and this was supposedly the &quot;least harmful&quot; pill.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	1/21/2010 2:20:44 PM	Was on this for 8 years had no problems other than slight (&lt;5 lbs) weight gain, had no period and didn't worry that I was pregnant.  Do take the pilles correctly.  Now however had to switch to Loestrin as I started having heavy breakthrough bleeding, wish I could have stayed on this - was so easy.

Birth Control	Young 46, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/17/2010 10:55:51 PM	I am 46 years old.  Started taking pill at 45 years old 6/09.  I bleed what seems the entire month of June, spotted almost all of July.  Normal periods in Aug, Sept, Oct &amp; Nov.  It is not Jan 2010 haven't had period since 11/2/09.  I luv that part.  I have pregnancy test on hand, not pregnant.  My hair is thinning but not sure if it is my age or the pill.  My fingernails are healthy &amp; long and very pretty.  Overall, I am satisfied with this pill.  I love the fact that I am not having a monthly cycle often;however, I do feel like I am going to have my perod but it doesn't come.   I hope it doesn't come back super full force.  I will wait and see.  Overall, I like.
Birth Control	Wanny, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	1/3/2010 2:24:41 AM	I have been on this pill for 2 years (I started after the birth of my daughter because I was breastfeeding).  Honestly, I had no side effects with this pill. The reason I've stayed on it this long is because the regular pills (with estrogen) often made me nauseous and also I knew I'd get really depressed for the first month and just couldn't bear the thought of being like that with a newborn.  This pill causes my periods to be shorter and lighter (about 4 days).  I also experience very little cramping; not even enough to take a pain reliever.  My only concern is that it's not as effective as the regular pills and my hubby and I are not at all ready for another child. I know the odds of getting pregnant are still slim with perfect use but taking this pill more than 3 hours late requires a back-up method for two days!  So you REALLY have to be perfect on this pill.

My periods are every 18 days. Out of three beach vacations this year it was on for two of them. My breast hurt all the time, sometimes to the point I need to use a heating pad or sleep in a sports bra. I am also nervous because I'm always experiencing  pregnancy symptoms. (lightheaded, morning sickness, food craving, etc.) I'm begged my gyn and primary care doctor to put me back on Depo, but do to me being osteopenial (begining phase of osteoporosis) they refused. I'm looking into getting an IUD.  
Birth Control	TX Maria, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/8/2009 3:33:32 PM	I was put on this BC 3 months ago because of my high blood pressure.  At first I didnt notice anything different.  Then I started breaking out horribly on my face and chest.  Its insane how much.  And even though I went to the gym faithfully and ate right, I gained inches.  I honestly wracked my brain trying to figure out why I had so much acne all of a sudden.  Im 34 not 13.  Then I came here and read all these reviews and BINGO.  As soon as I finish this review, I am calling my gynecologist and going back to my old BC.

Blood Pressure was getting high and my doc was worried I would get a blood clot or have a stroke due to tother risk factors.  I have been happy on this pill...I have had no periods or break through bleeding at all (I do have to keep taking pregnancy test though) No moodiness, no headaches, And I finally have a sex drive again after 7 years!  I am hoping this will continue to be a good experience!
Birth Control	jam40, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/30/2009 2:10:16 PM	Unlike many of the other commenters, I am not a new mom.  I began having peri-menopausal symptoms and was prescribed Yaz. My blood pressure got too high to continue and I switched to Jolivette. Since starting it more than a year ago, I have fewer mood swings and more regular periods. They are not regular--just more regular than they were due to perimenopause! I have noticed an increase in break-outs before my period, but it is nothing different than what I used to get before the pill. Overall, I am very satisfied: I haven't killed anyone in a fit of rage, I have not gotten pregnant at age 40, and I haven't had a stroke due to high bood pressure! It's all good ; )
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/21/2009 11:17:04 PM	I have been on this pill for 3 months. I have had extremly heavy periods (bleeding through a tampon and pad with in 2 hours) I have never in my life had so much blood, extrem headaches, no ambition to do anything, always tired, and angry a lot. I noticed when I stoped taking it my mood started to lighten right away with in a few days and my energy is comming back. Very hard to keep track of pills when you move to the inner circle it is easy to miss a pill. Birthcontrol is a pill that needs to intermix with your body this is not a good pill for me. I am going to be starting my necon again

The first 6 months was great, but after that things started going downhill. I have horrible acne on my face and neck, very oily skin, have gained at least 10lbs (I work out 5 days a week and eat healthy), have A LOT of breast pain and will go a few months without having my period and then all of a sudden have it 2-3 times in one month! And the period is not normal, very heavy and black/tar like. I am definitely not satisfied and will be discontinuing use after this pack is done.

Besides the headache and periodic backache I've adjusted well. I've also been getting my periiod every month since I started the pill. I like this pill since there are much less serious side effects.

Since I've begun this pill my hair falls out all the time, I've gained over 10lbs, more than I was at 8 mths pregnant. My cycle is way off, comes and goes whenever and has nasty cramps I never had before. I'll be stopping as soon as my husband recovers from his BC surgery.

I get cravings for food in the middle of the night and about half an hour after eating, when I'm used to never feeling hungry. Not the pill for me even though I'm taking it due to a blood condition. No, thank you.

I'm losing weight well, no depression, my sex drive is much better.  I breastfeed my little ones, so have to be careful what I take.  A little more acne, but not anymore than w/ my cycle.

I've been having migrane, I gained 15 lbs, ache, swollen stomach and constipation. I had surgery for ovarian cyst and said this will help not to have cyst again? I am going to stop but what should I take now?
Birth Control	christina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/4/2009 5:09:20 PM	I have been taking this pill since my 6 week apt and my daughter is now 8 months. I have had no problems...I also have not had periods. I take it the same time everyday and if for some reason I cant take it (forget it out of town..etc) I am very careful about using other forms of birth control for two days. I have not had any side effects, other than losing weight. I have been off the pill now for one week and am very emotional and depressed, also gaining weight
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	7/30/2009 3:22:40 PM	My hair started off out after 6 weeks on this. Huge amounts of hair, it clogged my shower drain. I took this pill everyday right on time, I set my cell phone alarm to remind me, even doing that I still had a period every 2 WEEKS!!!! I put up with this for 6 months hoping it would adjust to my body, but it never did.
Birth Control	Amber, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	7/2/2009 1:56:22 PM	I have been on this pill for a month and the only concerns I have found are mild headaches on average of once a week and just today (day 28) I noticed a soft spot in my skull. The exact thing happened when I was on Depo,with which I didn't have a period either. I don't know if there's any correlation. I also did not know there were no placebo pills as even the pamphlet does not tell you this. I have not started my period yet nor do I feel any stymptoms of pregnancy (I have always known before any test could tell me) But after reading some of these posts I see that many of these women were prescribed it because they were breastfeeding (which I have not)and that its rumored to be less effective if you're not breastfeeding.I have not experienced any moodiness as I did with OrthoTriCyclen nor do I notice any weight gain. Overall, I really dig this pill, but it may be a little too early to tell.
Birth Control	Sandrea, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	6/21/2009 8:24:05 AM	I've been on a few different types of birth control, starting with Yasmin.  I found they all made me get three week long periods about every 17 days. Yuck! But the most intolerable thing was they made me a different, intolerant, b*tchy person with no interest in intimacy. Jolivette, seems to be the most mild in terms of mood changes, and my libido is just fine! However, I can't judge it's effectiveness until I take a pregnancy test as I'm only now starting my third pack and have just...shall we see...done the deed to test it's effectiveness. Now I'm nervous after reading these reviews!
Birth Control	cookiepussjones, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1		25-34	6/9/2009 9:45:14 AM	I have been on this pill since my 6 week visit. My son is now 4 months. I don't like this pill. Since taking it, I have become dizzy and extremely emotional. I normally do not cry often, but since taking Jolivette, I cry at the drop of a hat. It is ruining my relationship. I feel so depressed and I am normally a bubbly, happy person. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. The pill was the only thing that I could think of. I haven't taken it in a week and I feel better. I am also  breastfeeding, but haven't noticed a change in my supply or anything such as acne or hair loss like some other women. My nails are growing out of control though. don't know if this is from the pill, but it's nice! It's such trail and error trying to find the right B/C. GEEZE! 
Birth Control	nurse1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	5/23/2009 5:51:09 AM	After only a week of taking this medication I would cry at the drop of a hat.  I felt depressed and very emotional.  Friends and family kept asking if I was okay.  Stopped taking it and wa-la I feel normal again. 
Birth Control	missy, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1		25-34	5/11/2009 11:57:18 PM	I had a baby 6 months ago and needed a birth control while breastfeeding just so I'm sure I wouldn't get pregnant.....BUT my periods have never been on time they always came two weeks early even though I took the pill everyday faithfully. Now I'm pregnant again was not expecting this.  Good luck to anyone that's taking this pill make sure your using another way to prevent having a baby.
Birth Control	Elisha, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	4/29/2009 10:06:06 PM	It decreased my milk supply and had strange affects on my infant. She started getting acne and her appetite increased beyond my nursing means. She takes both breasts and is hungry an hour later. She is also gaining weight too fast for her age.

This month has been my worst so far. I've been on bleeding for the past 9 days and it does not seem to be stopping anytime soon. I was put on this to alleviate the pain of endometriosis. I'm not sure what i'm going to do. My doctors only other option was a hysterectomy and i know i don't want that. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/17/2009 12:07:30 PM	I started taking Jolivette when my baby girl was 3 months old.  She is now 14 months old. I had a slight period about a month ago, but absolutely no other bleeding at any time.  It hasn't affected my mood at all.  The only issue that I have is that I haven't been able to lose all the baby weight that I gained with this pregnancy.  I guess I can blame that last 10 lbs. on Jolivette.  I also never experienced any hair loss.  I prefer this pill rather than something with estrogen in it.  My little girl doesn't need any more hormones entering her through my breastmilk. Now that I had one period, I will probably take a pregnancy test monthly just to make sure the pill is doing its job. But, the pill is so easy to take and it's 3 minutes out of a month to do a preg. test. That's easy.  Trust me...I used the diaphragm after my second pregnancy...and that's when I got pregnant with my little girl.

For the first year, I could not remember to take, so whenever I bled that the was the result of not takig my pills.  I more lubricated when I am intimate.  I break out once in a while, so I cleanse my face with 70% rubbing alcohol (I have Oily skin).  I have gained a little weight, that I am trying to work off.  I for the past 6 months I have been taking Jolivette FAITHFULLY.  I have not seen my period since!!  I take a pregnancy test every two weeks because of this.  I have headaches once in a while and I have been VERY MOODY!!!  Overall, I think that it is a hassle to keep having to take a pregnancy test because I have not seen my period.  
Birth Control	abailey, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/5/2009 10:47:35 PM	I've only been on this drug for a few weeks and I'm happy with it. Last night I had some slight cramping, but no bleeding. Since taking the pill at the same time everyday is crucial to its effectiveness, I simply set my alarm on my phone. Also, for women experiencing hair loss its completely normal to shed excessive amounts of hair 3 to 7 months after giving birth. I had a baby girl 8 months ago and I shed so much hair I had bald spots. It has nothing to do with bc pills because I wasn't using any. It eventually stops and your hair will be back to normal in a month or two. Research it if you don't believe me.

I've only been on it a short time, but I am happy to report that I haven't woken up with a night sweat in about a week and have not had a single hot flash at work. I hope this continues because I'm much happier now.

I have alot of body hair growth, Depression, Horrible Headaches, Loss of breath, etc. I don't care for this at all. I can't take BC with estrogen in it because it makes me ill. I'm not sure what to use now.

I have noticed that if i forget to take it (which i dont often do) or take it even an hour late, a few days later i will have my period.  I haven't gotten my period on schedule (during the sugar pills) with this yet, but i'm sure if i can make it through a month taking it at the same time on the dot i will be fine.  My advice is to take it at the exact same time everyday or else it wont work right.

It hasn't caused me and mood swings,weight gain,anything . The second month i took it i got a light period that i used light tampons for. The first month and all the rest i haven't had a period. the only thing that i dont like is if i miss my pills a couple days at the end then i start bleeding heavy and have to wait a week for the pills to kick back in.

Other	Laurel, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	10/28/2008 5:24:25 PM	I started taking this medication to help control my periods. I had been getting two a month, or one a month, sometimes two weeks long, sometimes 3 days long; it was a mess! Endometriosis runs in my family and I have all the symptoms. Taking an oral progestin was the last resort before getting a laparoscopy. I started taking it, no big deal, everything was fine. I started having some mood swings but nothing too big. After a while my fiance started noticing I was acting a bit different: moody, and quiet. I started breaking out like I was in high school again and I gained about 10-15 pounds! I thought &quot;My gosh! What is going on here?&quot; I didn't think all of this could be caused by Jolivette until I got online and started looking up some reviews. Sure enough, my unwanted symptoms were exactly like the ones pointed out in the reviews here. I had been losing some substantial amounts of hair in the shower as well and just didn't know if it was stress or heat flashes causing me to shed. I got on here and saw that hair loss was also a common side effect -_-I'd rather just cough up the co-pay and 75% of the surgical bills and have a laparoscopy than go through this hell anymore. I don't feel like myself. I feel uncomfortable and unsatisfied with the performance of this prescription. I wouldn't recommend Jolivette to anyone unless they have a condition in which they cannot take any form of synthetic estrogen. Don't take it if you don't have to!

After reading all 23 reviews I am terrified to take it, excessive bleeding, moodiness, weight gain and hair falling out?  Who needs that?!  They wonder why women choose to risk it and not take the pill..  With pills like this I can almost understand!
Other	sickofperiods, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	10/15/2008 2:16:17 PM	After 3 months of nearly non-stop bleeding, I took myself off this medication. Sure enough, within 3 days my bleeding stopped. I actually went 20 days without bleeding and then had a &quot;semi-normal&quot; period. I have multiple fibroids and am on anticoagulation therapy so my periods will never be totally normal, but at least I'm not bleeding constantly from taking Jolivette, and the slight weight gain/bloated feeling has disappeared. Another added bonus is my mood has greatly improved! Don't take this if you don't have to! Even the doctors I have spoken to don't recommend this!
Birth Control	not a happy camper, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	9/14/2008 1:11:43 AM	I absolutely hate this medicine. During the first month I had light breakthrough bleeding and shorter periods, but the frequency, duration, and amount of bleeding has steadily increased. I am also more emotional, always have a low-grade fever, and have stomach cramping. I am looking into getting another form of bc. 
Other	sickofperiods, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	9/5/2008 2:34:09 PM	I cannot take birth control pills that contain estrogen so this is my only option to help control my heavy periods due to fibroids. I started taking this in June and have done nothing but bleed. &quot;Periods&quot; would last up to 9 days. I'd go for a few days without bleeding and then start bleeding again. So far I've bled more than I haven't. In addition, I feel bloated and depressed (most likely from bleeding all the time!). This medication is ineffective and truly bothersome. I will be researching other options including a partial hysterectomy if I have to!

My doctor put me on it because I couldn't take a combined pill due to my high blood pressure.  I got off of this pill a couple days ago because it worsened the acne on my face, and for the first time in my life I got acne on my chest and back.  It also caused my hair to thin out.  I gained around 5-10 pounds, but my breast size DECREASED (worst side effect ever!).  Other than that, this pill was fine.  I set my alarm on my cell phone and that helped me to remember to take it at the same time each day.  Periods were pretty normal, just a little irregular.  I didn't notice any loss of sex drive.  I just wonder now that I'm off this pill if my breasts will return to their normal size...???
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/26/2008 10:11:29 AM	I started taking this at age 40 to control heavy bleeding.  This was my last resort before hysterctomy. I had only slight bleeding most months.  Worked wonderfully for me!
Birth Control	groovin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	7/23/2008 9:53:51 AM	First month on this pill and all I have done is bleed, feel very ill and very emotional.  Experiencing headaches as well.  I also have noticed my 2 month old daughter has been more fussy since I have been using this pill - I breastfeed without supplimenting with formula.  Not sure if her fussiness increase is due to me using this pill.  With the constant bleeding it seems stupid to even take this pill.  I am going to seek out another form of BC.
Birth Control		4	2	4			7/9/2008 1:43:45 PM	I've been taking this for at least 4 months. I still have yet to have any period. My son ia 7 months old. I like it, no side effects the only thing is it is hard to take it the same time each day. I miss using the ring, which I can't use while breastfeeding. But all in all it is a good drug.
Birth Control	mzkeishia, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	6/29/2008 2:20:28 PM	Well so far I have been bleeding off and on. I stopped taking the pill to see if this was the cause of the bleeding. It was. I started the pill again. I began to bleed. It's quite depressing that I cannot use any other type of BC while I am breastfeeding. I think i am better off not taking the pill so I won't deal with the bleeding. I started the pill 6 weeks after delivery. My daughter is Three months now.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	6/27/2008 11:32:03 AM	I've been taking this pill since my 6 week check up. My baby is now 3 mos. and my hair is shedding excessively (leaving thin patches), I've gained around 5lbs, I've broken out terribly and I notice my baby has broken out slightly on his face.  I understand his breakout could be a result of my hormones transferred in breast milk. Also, my physician or pharmacist never explained that there are no placebo pills.  I'm now looking for another birth control option because I do not want to become pregnant and I cannot handle these side effects. 
Birth Control	Terri, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	6/23/2008 1:16:57 PM	I'm 45 yrs old, if the directions say take it the same time every day I do just that. No problems or side effects at all. It makes me angry that women &quot;forget&quot; their birth control pills. Getting pregnant and raising a baby is something to give much thought to. If we want to be in control of our bodies then we must also be in control of taking our birth control.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/2/2008 6:50:13 PM	been taking this for 2 years with no periods at all, now I get a period.&#160; Is the mg (.03) not strong enough now. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	5/17/2008 11:28:41 PM	I have been on Jolivette since my six week check up after my daughter was born (5 months). I have not had a period. I have started become somewhat depressed and my hair is shedding alot more. I don't know if that has anything to do with the pill though. because I am breastfeeding, I am concerned about the effects that it could have on my child. I read that it could transfer through breastmilk and have &quot;undesirable effects&quot; on nursing children.-(Patient handout from WebMD) But all-in-all, I feel alot safer using this pill as opposed to using nothing.
Birth Control	irene, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	5/13/2008 10:35:20 AM	I started taking the errin  oral pill about a month and  a half ago, due to heavy bleeding and severe cramping. My period came after two weeks of use, I had some slight discomfort and minimal bleeding for about 4 days, I also had just had my normal period two weeks prior.  I was switched to Jolivette oral. After 28 days I had another period, it has been very heavy like before and I have been bleeding a lot. My Doctor told me that this pill will help with the cramping and the heavy bleeding I have experienced over the past 20 years. But I feel worse. The bleeding  and cramping gets worse each day and I have been bleeding for 5 days.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	5/4/2008 7:52:29 PM	I have only been on this pill for a month. in 2005 I got a blood clot and was told i could no longer use the normal pill with estrogen . So i am trying the one with progestron (Jolivette) The only side effects i have noticed is I am more emotional. But that could just be me. My period came like clock work and I did not bleed as heavy and it has lasted 4 days. This is much better then with out the pill. So for now it has been very good for me but i will monitor it and get back in a month or to. Oh and I have NOT gained any extra weight either which is common with pills. 
Birth Control	Busy mom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	4/19/2008 2:09:20 PM	I had been using the Errin tablets mini pill. About a month and a half ago the generic change to Jolivette. With the previous Erin tablets (which is what I took for two years while nursing my first child) I had no periods at all.  loved that pill.  since taking Jolviette I have had 4 periods in about a 7 week time period.  i absolutely hate it.  Not only do I feel Im seeing red every other week but I am now bleeding like I did right after I gave birth along with cramping that I also never experienced with the other mini pill.  Needless to say I am sick of this and am going to get the Mirena IUD in a couple of weeks.  I heard bleeding is pretty irregular at first but gets much better after a few months and in some women stops all together.  I hope I like it.  It sounds so convenient.

I was told that this pill was ok to take while breastfeeding. My daughter is now 12 months old.  For the last 10 months i spotted here and there, which my doctor told me was normal.  I just got my first period which is a little heavy and has lasted about 5 days.  I am still nursinf my daughter at least 4 times per day.  My doctor told me that when i start to wean my daughter that i need to stop taking the pill because it will not be as effective in preventing preganacy and i will need a new form of contriception.  Overall, i was satisfied with this pill.

My beautiful daughter was born with a rare birth defect, effecting her mid line of her face, it's called Frontonasal Dysplasia and abnomalities in her brain. I also lost her twin with in the first 12 weeks of gestation. I am not positive if this pill has any relations to my daughters condition, but i am starting to investigate it!
