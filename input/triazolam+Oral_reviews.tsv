Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	5/1/2012 2:22:05 PM	have been taking this med for close to 5 years now, and has helped improve my sleep. have also recently been diagnosed with sciatica and have found that a much lower dose taken daily has also helped ease the back pain and leg pain that come with it. however on occasion i have had trouble falling asleep, but not very often.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	lagalh, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/26/2012 9:54:43 AM	My P-Dr immediately switched me to this in place of 5mg of valium at night. Love this med! First time in many years that I have slept 7-8 hours a night. I also do not wake up feeling hung-over and sluggish! It is like the a.m. fog has been lifted from my brain. Finally, one med that actually works with no side effects. 
Other	Arlene, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	65-74	4/12/2012 2:27:07 AM	I was given oral triazolam in Jan-Feb 2012 for conscious sedation fro dental work, which included three separate appointments of at least 3 1/2 hours each. On Easter Sunday, I was taken to the ER with memory loss - able to speak clearly, no motor loss, but unable to remember speech or events that happened minutes earlier.Salem Hospital was unable to diagnose it as CT scan showed normal, and all blood work showed normal, with the exception of slightly low potassium. The only thing we can think is the triazolam, even though it has been a while since taking it. I think they gave me too much (.25 mg) for a 125 lb. woman. but I am also older (age 66) and take narcotic pain meds for chronic pain after ten surgeries at the Mayo Clinic (a wonderful, lifesaving place). Obviouly, it cannot be proved that the triazolam was the cause of the memory loss, but there has been nothing else that could do it. I am a non-drinker, non-smoker, and have normal blood sugar levels, and nice healthy cholesterol levels.
Other	zette, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/20/2011 3:30:40 PM	Was prescribed this medicine by my Dentist when I had 13 teeth pulled and dentures put in. I was awake throught out the whole procedure but only remember the first numbing shot and my doctor talking sweetly to me to turn my head. It was amazing and would certainly recommend this drug but make sure you have someone to drive you home.

Went to see a new PCP about tension headaches and he was not happy about me being on this medicine.  I had no idea it was for sleeping.  It worked great for anxiety but no wander I was sleeping all the time. I have been off of it for 2 days and am not feeling well at all.

I am a chicken when it comes to the dentist I hate the shots, I even took the needle out of the dentists hand because I was so scared. This worked so well. I took it one hour before my appt. and by the time I got there I did not have a care in the world of course you need someone to drive you to the appt.to top it off I got the most sleep I have had in a long time. When I got home I was just going to lay down and next thing you knew it was time to get up for work!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	7/7/2011 2:04:58 PM	I have been using this drug for at least 15 years. It takes about an hour to work but will give you a whole night sleep and does not leave me with any side effects. I wish I could take it every night but if I use it 2-3 nights in a row, it is hard to fall asleep the first night after taking it. This drug makes my mind very sharp the next day. Do not take with alcohol.

Due to an auto-immune disease I have to regularly have somewhat painful and stressful proceedures.  Last month with a treatment they tried IV Verset (spelling?) and it did NOTHING.  This time they gave me .50 mg of Triazolam and again NOTHING!  I am so discouraged that there isn't anything they can safely give me that will work making dental experiences even worse.  I have dental work to continually have and am dreading every minute of it.

Take it and about 45 min later, your asleep for a good seven hours.  Just turn off your T.V. and try.  Don't take with alcohol.  Just drank a 6-Pack watching the final four and don't remember anything.  Be very CAREFUL!

I have been on many medications for sleep.  This specific med worked for TWO nights and then no more.  I'm at my wits end going without sleep for days at a time.  This med just did not work for me as I hoped it would.

I am in the process of coming down off of this drug.  Even taking this medicine only lets me sleep about 3-4 hrs. of sleep at night and I drag the next day.  I have sleep apnea also and thought this would help me relax and rest better between the medicine and the CPAP machine.  I feel like a zombie the next day after not taking the pill. The sleep Dr. I see is helping me come down off of this.

Other	gourmetcook, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/1/2009 12:53:36 PM	I'm a bigg chicken when it comes to oral surgery. So my dentist prescribed this to be taken the morning of my surgical work and believe me I had no care in the world. I was still coherent enough to respond to the dentist when asking me to open my mouth, bite down, etc.  But the overall procedure was so much easier to endure.  I suffer from a chronic autoimmune disease called polymyositis.  I share this with you so that others will know that it was safe for me to take.  Also, my doctor called me in the evening to check up on me to see how I was doing from the procedure as well as the medication.

This product helps me to get a full 8 hours sleep when I feel run down and sleep deprived.  I only take it when needed - maybe once a month or so.  It works very well, leaves no groggy feeling, and I feel refreshed when I awaken.  I love it!
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	genenick, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/9/2009 10:31:04 PM	I have been taking this drug since 1982.  There have been varing levels of usage from .5 mg to 3 mg.  Of course 3 MG was way too much and have been taking 0.75 MG for last 3 years.  My insurance company is being a real jerk about this med right now.  They think I should be off of it and my doctor says if it works leave it alone.  SO their response has been to limit me to 21 days and charge me a $50 co-pay.  I went to Wal-Mart and checked on the cash price and for 270 0.25 MG tabs the cost is $88.  I have tried to fight Blue Cross Blue Sheild of LA on this and they won't budge.  Overall this med works great for me; however I have met people that have real problems with it.  We are all different and what works for one may not work for another.  Insurance Companies have no right to dictate and steal money from me because they think I should be off of it.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/9/2008 11:26:00 PM	Was prescribed this when I used to live in Canada for severe insomnia.  I would typically use it for about a week at a time 2-3 times a year.  Worked very quickly to knock me out and then wore off quickly so that I could get up in the morning when the alarm went off.  My problem is getting asleep, not staying asleep so this was very effective.  Sadly, no one in the US will prescibe this miracle drug and I've gone through every other prescription and OTC sleep aid with no relief whatsoever.  Man I wish I could get a little sleep.  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/1/2008 7:29:26 PM	I used it before going to the dentist because I was terribly scared. I was very calm going in although I did need a driver.
