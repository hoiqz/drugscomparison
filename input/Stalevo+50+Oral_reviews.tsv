The other symptons have not disappeared but are not as bad as before taking the medication.  Knowing others in a support group I find this is a great medication for my body.

I tried both of these drugs separately and did not have much relief with either of them, but together they work well.

In both cases I found little positive and some negative reaction.  I've had joint pain, which is new.  I'm also on Azilect, and have tried ReQuip and Meripex, neither of which caused much change.

She has gone to the dr repeatedly and told her it is not helping her and she will not change her medication to something else. I do not understand why but I do know my mother is very frustrated and even wants to quit going to the Dr because of this.

Otherwise it is a great treatment for tremors.
