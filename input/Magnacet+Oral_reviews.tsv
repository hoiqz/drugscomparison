The itching drives me crazy.  It's worth it i guess to get rid of the pain but OMG the itching......
Pain	lennongirl80, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/2/2008 2:53:30 PM	I have osteoaritis in my back from a prolonged injury as well as degenerative disk disease. I have tried several narcotic pain relievers and this one worked the best. I did experience dizziness and nausea at first but, after I began taking it on a regular basis, those sypmtoms seem to disapate. I find that eating a small meal or snack wipes out all chances of the nausea. I am satisfied with this drug.
