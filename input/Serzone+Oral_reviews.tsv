I AM WELL AND HAPPY.  NOW THERE IS A SHORTAGE.  I AM WORRIED. I CANNOT TAKE ANY SSRI.  WILL THE DRUG MANUFACTURER OF THE GENERIC (tEVA)  GET IT GOING AGAIN
Depression	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	3/17/2012 7:39:28 AM	The only antidepressant I could use without sexual side effects or diarrhea (Viibrid). Since beginning it 2 months ago, I have severe hot flashes. Not sure yet if it is the med or coincidence that I started the med at the same time menopausal symptoms appeared.

Depression	bill, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	55-64	8/26/2011 6:41:16 PM	Serzone is the only medication that has relieved my depression and made my life bearable. I've had depression since childhood and i'm lucky to have lived long enough to encounter serzone,and only by chance i believe,when i was thrown into a psyc. ward and was started on this drug in 1996. Either my doctors analysis was excellant, or it just dumb luck that i started this drug no longer matters, because i've been able to live a relatively productive and somewhat happy life since.
Depression	happy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/19/2011 1:00:43 PM	been on 400mg for over 10 years, get routine liver tests every 6 months.  Tried others and didn't like side effects (sexual dysfunction).  Just got lab results back with elevated liver enzymes - could be nefazadone related - I hope not because I don't want to go through trying new meds and jeopardize my mental well being. Knowing this medicine could cause liver damage has been a risk, but I have also been depressed-free for over 10 years.  
Depression	murray, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	1/14/2011 4:00:19 AM	This is the one antidepressant that has worked for me with NO side effects.  I was unable to tolerate the side effects of many other drugs over the years, and my doc prescribed this as a last resort.  Even with this drug I can tolerate only a very small dose, 50 mg once a day, but for me it is effective.  Tried a couple of times to increase the dose, but that only increased my anxiety (for which I am being treated with clonazepam).  I also take this in the morning because I found taking it at bedtime or in the evening made it difficult for me to sleep.  NOTE: For those who think this drug is no longer on the market, please know that while the brand Serzone is no longer available, the generic nefazadone is available and is quite inexpensive. 
Depression	Yasmina, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	10/4/2010 10:59:46 AM	I was on this in 1997 and immediately began experiencing severe nausea. I reported this to my clinician, but was told that this was a very &quot;clean&quot; drug, with practically no side effects. When I continued to complain, the doctor checked the literature and assured me that (at that time, anyway) nausea was not a reported side effect. The attacks of nausea were so debilitating that I had to stop whatever I was doing, and at one point I was at DMV, and wanted to ask a security guard to call an ambulance, but I couldn't move. So I laid down on the benches until the severity passed. These attacks always occurred within an hour or so of taking the dose. I simply could not continue taking them, even though the doctor kept insisting it couldn't be the Serzone. I've successfully used SSRI's since stopping Serzone. I'd forgotten this drug's name, only remembering that it was horrible, until the reports that it was pulled off the market years later. At least now, patients who continue to use this and DO experience nausea, will be taken seriously.

Major Depressive Disorder	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	9/24/2010 1:43:16 AM	Serzone (Nefazadone) has worked pretty well for me for 10 years off and on. Best part: No bad side effects! It leaves me feeling a little high and mellowed, which is good because I can be a little high strung.  It takes the edge off, and seems to prevent my long-term major depression from dragging me into the depths. I'd tried Wellbutrin, Effexor (terrifying), Prozac, and a few others with no luck at all.  Make sure to have your liver tested every 6 months or so, as it was pulled from the market due to liver problems as a side effect. I stopped taking it suddenly a couple times while traveling overseas and running out - BAD idea.  I felt drugged and drunk and could barely stand up, also got very sick and vomitous. Taper off this drug.

I was disoriented, a fall risk because of extreme dizziness, and it lowered my blood pressure to 70/40.  To get me out of the hospital because insurance would no longer pay, I was given ritalin to counter the effects of this drug.  A week later hospitalized again and changed to a different med and was feeling better.

I hadn't felt like normal in 20 years.Then my doctor got scared from the black box stuff and he took me off of it. My current PCP won't give it to me either saying it is banned he would have to fill out so many FORMS TO GET IT, HE JUST ISN'T COMFORTABLE GIVING IT TO ME. MY QUESTION TO HIM WAS...Well, without it,I haven't felt comfortable and my life has come down to reclusivity and my car has cob webs on it!Serzone was for me a way to get out of the house and enjoy everyday things.My liver test were always fine..I want my Serzone back right now! Small town where I live doesn't have many doctors and he belongs to the only clinic.

I have no side effects.  It has been the best antidepressent.  All the others had terrible side effects and didn't work that well. But serzone has taken away all my depression with no se's, it is a miracle.  I hope they never take it off the market.  Some citizens advocacy group is trying to get the FDA to ban it I hope it does not succeed because no drug has worked like this for me, and it is a generic!  Best wishes to everybody.

I was a totally diferent person.  I only had to take it for 8 months and was off of it.  Recently I have become depressed again and wanted the drug again but is unavailable in canada.  Too bad.  It always seems to be that a drug that works gets a bad rap and is removed from our shelves.  I know a lot of people on other antidepressants and not one of them ever comes off of them.  Serzone, for me, worked and I was only on it temporarily.  With the drug and some psych thereapy they were the perfect combination in my battle with depression.

Depression	elizar, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	8/10/2009 1:52:51 PM	Serzone was very effective particularly used in combination with Wellbutrin to treat major depression and anxiety with no sexual side effects HOWEVER after over 4 years of use my liver functions were elevated to more than 10X normal levels.  I was lucky it was caught in a routine blood test.  It took more than 4 months for levels to return to normal.  I would NOT recommend anyone using Serzone despite its efficacy in treating depression/anxiety with little or no sexual side effects. Further, I am now experiencing almost constant lightheadedness, imbalance, orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure) that may also be long-term effects of using Serzone.  Has anyone else experienced any of these symptoms?  I know of one other person who is having similar difficulties who took Serzone long-term....

With the addition of Serzone (in generic form), I've had almost no depression symptoms at all starting at about 2-3 weeks of use.  Yes, it's blackboxed.  I know.  All SSRI's did was make things worse - then I was depressed and couldn't orgasm, which is worse than just being depressed.  With the combination of Wellbutrin and Serzone, I've had no sexual side effects, none - the only mental health cocktail I can say that about since starting meds over ten years ago.  Yep, there's a 1 in 125,000 chance of liver failure and death.  I live in a Metro area.  The chance of death driving to work on a freeway is higher Every Day.  The chances the earth will be hit by a wayward comet by 2011 is around 1 in 250,000, but we don't all walk around worrying about that, now do we?  Seriously - if you are a man and depressed, talk to your doctor about this drug.  It is available still, just in (very cheap) generic form.  Not only is it part of my dynamic duo of wonder drugs, but it caused no weight gain, helps me sleep more soundly, and makes me a nicer person all around.  I'm a huge fan.  And if you are on Wellbutrin XL at a high dose (300mg+) and still have some residual symptoms of depression or anxiety, ask your health professional about Serzone - it's totally worked for me.
Depression		1	1	1			6/19/2009 5:21:57 PM	Everyone should know that this drug has been known to cause severe liver injury, failure, and even death. Serzone has been facing class action law suits involving more than 125,000 people. There have been at least 11 deaths due to liver failure and 23 transplants as a result of this drug. Symptoms, including jaundice, dark urine, even total liver failure, appeared in as little as 2 months.There is no warning for this on their label and that is exactly why thy have been sued.Canada and other countries have already issued a recall. The US is way behind.I was very fortunate that I did not suffer the fate as some users of this drug but I was appalled to learn what Serzone was capable of.I'm not sure why this website would even advocate Serzone. I will certainly think twice about advice from this site in the future if their standard for information is so low.

Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	45-54	2/2/2009 10:37:35 PM	My doctor changed my med from Zoloft to Serzone due to less sexual side effects.  Other than being extremely dizzy and very sleepy on Serzone, I had a strange effect.  Once I got to an effective dose, it only worked for a few days and then stopped working.  This happened all the way up to the highest recommended dose and it still was not effective.  You have to taper off this med very carefully because it has a short half-life and can have withdrawal effects.

I get a bit dizzy sometimes &amp; I have dry mouth but that's about it.  I went off serzone for 4 months about five yrs. ago &amp; I was a mess. I tried a few other medications but soon realized I needed the serzone ASAP. I got back on Serzone &amp; have been feeling much better.

My migraines have severely comprimised my depression treatments. Also being dissatisfied with the loss of sex drive with many of the SSRIs, I knew that my Dr. &amp; I would have to try an older med. Migraines were our 1st concern when he put me on 100mg Serzone.  Changing meds is old hat for me so I'm well aware it takes a good month to get used to a new on; I took this one at night 1hr before bed. MY DR. HAS BEEN BETTER THAN ANY I'VE SEEN IN THE LAST 20 YEARS! He wouldn't change the med or increase it at the first rough patch &amp; encouraged me to continue to &quot;Heal My Heart&quot; with cognitive behavioral therapy. When I couldn't shake the &quot;meanies&quot;, we added 20 mg of Celexa in the AM; low enough to still love my husband! I did go to 150mg of Serzone for a couple of months, but am back down to 100mg. REMEBER, TOO MUCH SERETONIN &amp; THE LIKE WILL MAKE U JUST AS MOODY AS NOT ENOUGH! I'm well maintained enough to treat my migraines when I have to &amp; can work on myself in a way that was too difficult between migraines &amp; med changes before. Good luck &amp; get those liver panels!

I see the doc in two and we will probably go in a different direction.

It isn't as effective for me as Prozac, Lexapro or Celexa but it has none of the sexual side effects of those other medications. Serzone works moderately well for my cyclothymia and OCD and is potentiated effectively by Wellbutrin.

I have been on it for about 8 years. Having tried several other medication,I found that this is what works for me. Controls my depression and flashbacks. I haven't gain weight or have loss of sexual desire as I had from past medications. No liver problems. I take 3 tablets daily. It has been my wonder drug.

About a year ago I had told the doctor I wished they still make and he told me they did but only the generic. I began to take it again and have been without any major depression since. I still get down but only for a day or two. I also like the fact that it has very few sexual side effects. Works great for me!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	9/24/2007 1:45:24 PM	I took this medication several years ago to deal with postpartum depression and other depression related issues. This was a very STRONG medication for me. Be sure not to drink alcohol or caffiene while taking it. There were nights where I stayed up all night and slept the afternoon if I had a day off. Be sure you also eat a well balanced meal and keep up with your diet as it can make you irritable if you just take the pill and refuse to eat. I lost a lot of weight while on this medication. When first starting out, I had to take it gradually, beginning with 1/2 a pill per night, 1 pill per day, and then the 2 per day. I was prescribed 3 refills, and only used 2.
