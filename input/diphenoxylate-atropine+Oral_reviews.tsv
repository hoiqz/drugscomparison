Diarrhea	consafe1, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	5/23/2012 5:54:51 PM	This medication has allowed my wife to resume a normal life free from embarassing episodes of uncontrollable diarrhea. A survivor of stage 4 cervical cancer, the medical interventions included chemotherapy, external radiation and radioactive interstitial implants. These collectively produced multiple bowel obstructions resolved by five separate surgical interventions over two years wherein with each the obstructed segment was removed and the intestine resected. There have been no further obstructions for the last 15 years.....the good news. The bad news....chronic diarrhea. By balancing her diphenoxylate-atropine with diet, life has returned to an acceptable near normal life. Considering the stakes at the time, this outcome is something we can both live with.

Diarrhea	dottie7179@YAHOO.COM, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female		6/18/2011 8:13:59 PM	took this medication by mouth for 14 days after that I started to get loose stools again and I had to take it more often. More often means more than 3 times a day or more than every 8 hours a day. I sure loved this pill because it gave me more confidence to go places instead of sitting home always. I was able to get out more.

Diarrhea	green guy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	45-54	2/26/2011 11:48:25 AM	Son and I came down with some kind of virus. Both vomiting and diarrhea for several days. Ped doc put son on Pedialyte and Patient First doc put me on this. I'm in probationary period at work and cannot miss work, but still missed two days (even with on this med for one of those days). It slowed it on the first day, stopped on second day of treatment. However, nearly a week later I still have to take it. Keep healthy, clean house and sanitary practices. Not sure why this cannot stop it. May have to return to Patient First. Can't miss any more work.
Diarrhea	Pat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	2/17/2011 9:00:27 AM	Stopped diarrhea first day but did cause constipation. If I went off the med, diarrhea came back. I only take at night so being sleepy is not an issue.  Is doesn't seem to cure the problem, just hold it off.

Diarrhea	Roxie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	11/26/2010 9:40:14 PM	Liquid diarrhea for 4 weeks now. 2.5 weeks ago began bland fiber-filled diet. No change. 1.5 weeks ago began using Immodium-still no change. Saw dr. &amp; he prescribed this drug 5 days ago-still no change! Trapping me at home-afraid to leave the house-accidents at night. Never had anything like this before.  Now doing analysis on samples taken in today!  Very frustrating since I've got 2 job interviews coming up &amp; am afraid this might keep me from them when I desparately need to get a job!  Anyone have a clue?!  This is not only physically affecting me - but emotionally also!  Help!

Diarrhea	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	65-74	2/20/2010 12:10:38 PM	After taking this drug for 3 days as directed, my B/P dropped to 84/52 with a pulse rate of 118.  I decided to stop taking it without notifying my dr. (it's Saturday and they are difficult to contact).  I have also temporarily stopped taking my BP meds. I don't know if this drug is responsible for the lower BP readings because there is nothing in the side effects supplied by the pharmacy that would indicate this kind of adverse reaction.

Only problem I have is a hard time swallowing my food due to the slowing of the digestive tract.

Diarrhea	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/9/2008 8:48:22 PM	I have IBS and had diarrhea with extreme pain nearly everyday. This has done wonders for me sine the very first dose. It relieves the pain within 5-10 minutes sometimes less, and always prevents the diarrhea. I could barely function to work let alone go to a movie before having this dream medication. I strongly suggest talking to your doctor about this medication if you have pain or diarrhea prominent IBS. Also since starting this medication the 'episodes' went from nearly everyday to maybe 3 times a week. I only take a dose when needed.

This medication has allowed me to continue to hold down a job and to be able to go out in public without the concern of having to constantly run to the bathroom.  I could not funtion without this medication!

Diarrhea	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/11/2007 12:19:07 AM	I had diarrhea for 4 straight days.  The doctor first told me to use Pepto and sent me home; after 3 days of it not working, the doctor put me on this medication and the diarrhea stopped almost immediately after taking the first dose.  It has also helped me to sleep instead of being up every 20-30 minutes throughout the night with diarrhea.
Diarrhea	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/5/2007 3:40:19 PM	I had extreme cramping and gas pain with my diarrhea.  This medication immediately eased the pain,bloating and fullness.  Calming things down helped get me back to gradually eating a bland diet at first, then to normal bowel movements.
