Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	sometimes, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	65-74	10/2/2012 12:38:56 PM	It knocked the bv out apparently, or almost, after five days.  But as I take an immune suppressant drug, when I took that, the infection recurred.Took two more courses, skipping the immune suppressing drug for many weeks, but it still gradually recurred.Had raging yeast infection after a couple of days each time.The medication stings upon application though that gradually subsides.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Stana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	3/29/2012 8:23:41 AM	Took this medication and it gave me a terrible yeast infection from hell, even though I took probiotics as instructed.  I don't know if there are other options for treating BV, but if I ever get it again I will DEFINITELY ask for something else!

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	girlygirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/5/2012 9:57:18 PM	Thank goodness for webMD. I started using this medication 4 days ago for BV and I noticed a cottage cheesey, very strange discharge. Wondering if this was normal, I came here searching for answers. This medication caused diarrhea for the first day but I am feeling way better. I tried oral contraceptives and they didn't work so this gel has been a life saver. They should really inform the patient about the strange discharge before use!
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/18/2011 11:40:38 PM	Ok so I go in to the doctor because I thought I had a yeast infection that otc meds wouldnt cure. The doctor says I have BV and I have never heard of this condition nor have I had problems with my lady parts. The medicine was easy to use, but the side effects!!!! Lawd have mercy!!!!! 1. Stomach cramps!!! 2. Dizziness 3. Nasty cottage cheesy discharge. I had to do more looking on the internet to find out what was going on. The discharge is the medicine getting the nasty stuff out. I have been off this med for 5 days and so far so good.

Everything went fine except for the side effects: cramping, diarrhea, and the discharge. I now have a yeast infection and I'm treating it with OTC medication.

On Day 4 of treatment, severe cramping, uncontrollable diarrhia, nausea, bloating.  The diarrhia was the worst--I stopped taking this drug after 4 days.  Side effects were too severe.

Other	rosegirl22, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	12/4/2010 3:19:41 PM	Doc gave me metrogel vaginal gel after a routine pap showed low levels of Gardnerella.  I was having no symptoms, but decided to take metrogel as she prescribed.  What a nightmare! Day 3 I ended up in the ER with syncope (fainting/blackouts), low blood pressure 83/74), cramping, and headache, all side-effects of metro-gel.  Doc said many people have a bad reaction to Flagyl (an ingredient in metro-gel).  I suggest trying ANY other remedy, either natural or prescribed before taking this.  It was just horrible, messy, and caused a yeast infection to top it all off.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	5/17/2010 5:21:48 PM	This was so easy to use and only dripped out a little bit early in the day when I got up. I took the oral form of the antibiotic first and it made me severely sick. I was so much happier using the gel. I had no side affects while taking it, the only downside was that it gave me a yeast infection. It was still way better than the side effects of the oral drug! I only had to take this for 5 days which is another reason that this was better than the oral med.

No headaches or nausea but it did gave me a sore throath and fever, oh, and dont forget the cramps, definitively not worth it.

I think it has cleared the infection, but I am having side effects such as upset stomach and cramping, diarrhea and Nausea. I hope these go away quickly after the treatment is done.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	worried, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	3/11/2009 2:17:36 AM	I was 20 weeks pregnant when my GYN prescriped MetroGel because of an infection. I wish there was more information about the risk to the fetus while using this medication. The pamphlet that came with the medicine offered no information of prenatal side affects and most websites advisednot to use the product during pregnany. I hope the doctor knew what she was doing. Overall the gel is odorless and easy to insert. It is clear so it is not staining my under garments

The only problems I encountered were headache, nausea, and diarrhea which, honestly, were worth it especially if it meant getting rid of the problem.  After the first dose, I noticed that the odor was gone the following morning. This had been an on-going problem since last summer and I was getting frustrated because every test was normal.  I know my body and was persistent in finding out what was wrong.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	11/4/2008 8:58:10 PM	Metrogel is very messy and after you insert the gel (vaginally) even if you lie down immediately after (i.e. go to sleep for the night) it will ooze out all day once you do eventually get up. It seemed to thin to actually stay in place. It never cleared up my BV and after a week of messy misery I had to go on another drug to clear the infection. Clindamycin is MUCH better!
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	10/26/2008 6:20:42 PM	It seems to be working well.  But I have a little stinging and irritation still.
