If I ever have a problem that lasts more than a week, all I have to do is get me a bottle of this stuff. It does taste horribe, and it works for about a day and a half.

Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	NJ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	8/11/2012 8:58:45 AM	This past month alone, I have had to travel to three different places so my diet and digestion were impacted by new food, environments, schedule. I had taken this last year when I was constipated (7 days) and it took more than 12 hours to take effect but when it did wow cleaned me out good, I mean really good like that scene from dumb and dumber! But during the wait I felt sick like I had to vomit, but never was able to vomit. This time I also took the entire bottle at 9:30pm, at 8:50 am the next morning had my first BM. I still felt sick during the night but not as bad as the first time I took it. Also the first time left me dehydrated and very week as I had not had a BM in 7 days you can imagine the amount of BM. This second time since I had only been constipated for 1 day, BM was very mild and not painful at all, smooth like jazz..Would I take this again? Yes I opt for more natural alternatives and senna pills/tea but when those don't work I pull out my big guns and chug this disgusting concoction down.

I got home and took all 10 oz. at 4:00 AM with lots and lots of water. It is now 10:44 AM and absolutely NOTHING has happened. Not even an urge to have a bowel movement; if the E.R. doctor hadn't have taken several blood samples, abdomimal ex ray's, and a U.A. I would probably think that he had misdiagnosed me. Still nauseous, and now feeling worse instead of better.

I failed with oral laxatives tablets and Miralax. I tried the lemon flavor, not bad, but extremely tart. Caution: I  experienced a lemony indigestion for a least a week after drinking one whole bottle. This medication was only somewhat effective for me. I experienced maybe four &quot;muddy water&quot; bowel movements in probably a twenty four hour period, but nothing substantial. I felt the medication working as I was drinking it. My stomach growled,rumbled and made all kinds of digestive noises. I felt my stomach bloating, hardness, and pain began to ease. But overall, I still did not feel completely relieved(empty.) I felt as if I should of repeated the course.

Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	12/2/2011 6:09:54 AM	I am 45 years old, and for the VERY 1ST time in my life, am having GI problems. Saw a GI doctor for the 1st time EVER (went 2 months without ANY med. attention-hoping problems would just &quot;disappear&quot;.) Doc did the &quot;dreaded exam&quot;, took x-ray - film showed Profound Constipation, from top of esophagus all the way to top of rectum-IMPACTED!Prescribed blood-work, and instructed me to drink 3 of these-1 every 8 hours until stool runs clear. 1st bottle kicked in after 2 hours-approx. 7 BM,all liquid-was tied to bathroom for 2 hours straight-then no more activity for the next 4 hours. 2nd bottle took 4.5 hours to kick in, produced approx. 10 BMs-spent 3 hours in bathroom (this time not liquid movements - just VERY soft),excruciating pain in rectum like razor blades-had to go to sleep was up ALL night and pain was too severe, so had to wait to drink 3rd bottle. 5 hours later woke up and had 3 soft BMs. Waited 1 hour and then drank 3rd bottle. Took 1.5 hours and then had 5 soft and &quot;piecey&quot; BM's-no liquid to it, more razor blade feelings. Never wound up running clear, plus STILL not emptied out yet - stuff stopped working. Such pain and rectal bleeding (had it before I started - told Doc) Read on here that you shouldn't take this if you have ANY rectal bleeding - Doc had me do it anyway - makes me wonder about him. This stuff seems to increase anal burning (citric acid)-beware if you have that, for I felt like I was literally burning in HELL :(:(:(!

Last 2 have had failed colon preps.  Last week tried SupPrep, exactly as directed.  It did not kick in for hours and failed to completely clean colon.  This time with Mag Citrate am having &quot;similar results.&quot;  2 day routine one bottle last night at 5:30 and no BM until this morning at 4:30 A.M.  dID DRINK A TON OF FLUIDS also but,,,,?  Take second does tonight in about 2 hours and am not hopeful.

Emptying of the Bowel	Numbers, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/19/2010 1:48:19 PM	I had to drink 2 bottles, 6 hours apart along with 2 laxative pills for a routine colonoscopy prep. The 1st dose started to work within 1 hour. 2nd dose was faster. 3 hours after 2nd dose, I was pretty much done.  I only had to get up once during the night about 3 hours later. Definitely get the grape or cherry, and drink it cold.  I just sipped each bottle over 20 mins, drinking some water as well. I don't think it is necessary to chug it. Make sure to drink alot of water, 32 oz, within an hour or so of taking it. Taste is tolerable. It does make your stomach feel like it's full of air, but I never felt sick.  Plan to spend your time near the bathroom, b/c you don't get a lot of notice.  I didn't have any cramping until the next day after the colonoscopy, as a result of the air they pump into your colon.  The cramping was up high and took about 5 hours to go away entirely as the air works it's way thru your body.  Overall, the experience wasn't that bad, and the sedation during the procedure was great!

It started working pretty quickly, and during the course of an afternoon at home, my bowels were indeed empty.However, the magnesium citrate wasn't done.  Perhaps my (still undiagnosed) condition had something to do with it, but my intestines continued to try to expel waste long after I was empty.  The result was terrible, uncontrolled cramping that wouldn't stop.  Finally, I ended up in the emergency room, but there was nothing that could be done except to wait.  A sedative helped me get through the worst, and afterwards my intestinal tract and bowel muscles are aching bad, sore from the stress of extreme cramping.  Imagine a 'charley horse' in your bowels, and that's kind of what it's been like.I would guess my experience isn't typical, but if you are prone to cramping, please be wary and careful with this stuff.  I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone.

I purchased the cherry flavor, as that was all CVS had available, drank half of the 10oz bottle on Friday night, along with water, in hopes of quick results. After no luck, I finished the rest of the bottle Saturday, mixing it with cherry Koolaid to help with the taste, because this stuff is AWFUL! Here it is Sunday evening, and I have yet to have any movement outside of my daily BM. I've been too anxious to leave the house for 2 days after hearing stories about the side effects of &quot;colon blow&quot;, but it's not doing squat for me! Guess i'll be calling my PCP first thing Monday morning!

It will sometimes make you nausas I have never vomited but have came close. but if you drink the whole bottle do it fast and after down you about 3 bottles of water something will defently happen almost all the time water is the secret drink plenty.

About 10 hours later, I saw colors that are NOT associated with the color wheel in any way, shape or form. The stuff was running out of me like a date on prom night. Blacken and the smell alone would make Satan cringe. Needless to say as the ol' deary aire was paying homage to the porcelian God, I didn't feel any side effects..It sounded like a WW2 Battle of Iwo Jima, or porpoises mating. Take your pick. Either way, there was evidences that the stuff does work. Its either that, or the mexican food I had for lunch help moved whatever it was in my intestines out.

Stomach felt bloated after drinking and did have some light cramping during the night - intestinal track made a lot of noise. Overall the experience was better that I was expecting.

I had the lemon flavored kind (I think thats all they sell at walmart.) and it taste horrible no matter what I tried drinking it with. I drank the first half of the bottle and it worked within the first hour but didn't do much more than have me passing gass. When I took the second half of the bottle it worked wonders then. If possible take on a weekend, I was having movements for almost 24 hours.

Although I'm eating a nutritious diet now, I'm still having infrequent and incomplete bowel movements. I saw this product in my local CVS and gave it a try after researching the product. I took the cherry flavor approx. 12pm on a Saturday, I did feel bloated for at least an hour. After the hour though, combined with drinking plenty of water, it started working at 3:47pm. The key is to drink plenty of water, this maybe hard for most people due to the fact they do not consume enough water on a daily basis anyway. Nevertheless I love this product, by the way it's 8:30pm and i just completed my 7th bowel movement since 3:47pm. Lastly, I don't know about everyone else but I just threw away my bottle and no where on it does it say mix with water, it does say you can use water as a chaser.

I bought the citrus or lemon flavored kind can't recall which one. I drank it with 7up and it worked within one hour. Very effective. It did give make me a little nausea but that went away within minutes. It did cause some bloating which went away as soon as I had a bowel movement I was fine.

Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	Secrets, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/14/2009 11:16:58 AM	Occassionally, I eat the too much of the wrong foods such as fast foods and pops. I also have the tendency to not go right when I need too.  Then this little bottle of citrate rescues me from the misery of bloating and the awful feeling of matter trapped in my lower bowel.  It is quick, cramp free and it taste okay until it hits your taste buds.  But, by that time it has gone down the trap.  I recommend that you use it only when you can stay at home.  The last day is mostly liquids and it seems to want out quite quickly.  I only use this 1 or 2 times in a year.  This is serious stuff.  If I am irregular, I use &quot;Now&quot; Oat Bran from the healthy department of the stosre.  It is all natural, at it will work in 24 hours. I usually take half of the bottle the first day and then the rest within 24 hours.  Good Luck.

I am also on MS contin for cronic back pain.  Well after about 10 hrs it kicked in.  The doctor said that due to the fact that I have a longer colon than the average person and the narcotic is why it took so long.

Emptying of the Bowel	Mrs. J, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	55-64	2/25/2009 9:29:35 AM	I drank the lemon-flavored magnesium citrate in preparation for my first colonoscopy, in conjunction with Dulcolax tablets.  Despite the fact that I love citrus-flavored things, it was an extreme taste and took me awhile to down the 10 oz. bottle.  About 2 hours later, I was bloated and feeling sort of queasy, then had to run to the bathroom.  The diarhea was expected, but I simultaneously vomited the entire bottle back up.  I had to call the doctor, who instructed me to cancel the procedure.  I have rescheduled it, and this time I have to drink a 1/2 gallon of HalfLytely, so wish me luck in keeping it down!  I'm NOT looking forward to it!

Dulcolax did not produce a movement after 24 hours.  I took 10 oz of the grape flavor followed by about 2 quarts of fluid over time and had liquid stool within 2 hours.  I did experience multiple movements.  Very effective with minimal discomfort (some bloating).  Stay within easy reach of the restroom for 24 hours after taking it.

We bought the cherry flavored 10 oz bottle at Walgreen's.  The print was so small on the bottle, so we weren't aware to drink it with water.  He woke up in the middle of the night with severe vomiting and also had a bm.  He went back to sleep only to have two more vomiting episodes (husband and I cleaning sheets and towels all night!).  He is very dehydrated and is staying home from school today.  There may have been an allergic reaction, or the fact he had eaten dinner one hour prior to drinking the fluid may have caused it.  Take on an empty stomach and have a bedpan near bed in case of vomiting.

Then read that if you take 150mg of Magnesium Citrate twice a day in capsule form I would get relief.  But now I wonder if this is a good idea to keep taking this medication from a health food source along with P-5-P co-enzyme catalyst?  I do have bowel movement everyday and I am grateful for that, but am I harming myself by taking this on a daily basis?  My doctor had me taking Amitiza 24 mg and also Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF, but it just gave me the runs and cramps.  Thank you for any information you can give me.  I do have an appointment with Gastroenterology Consultants set for Sept.

Her Dr. has had her take this quite a few times and it works great. She is to take it with a flavored soda (lemon lime or cherry) and she has no problems. Every now and then it take longer to kick in but works great (no more than 6 hrs). We have found the two flavors lemon lime and cherry, she says the cherry tastes better and she mixes it with cherry 7up. Hopes this helps anyone.

Dr trying to rule out bowel obstruction vs. appendicitis. recommend desetin or baby ointment as it is very irritating.

I have minor discomfort in the lower intestine, had a tiny amount of nausea but it is passing. I did not know it could be diluted with water or I would have. Oh Well it was not that bad just a little sour grape taste. 
Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	1/5/2008 7:29:06 AM	I used the Mag. Citrate by recommendation of a nurse friend. I had started a new low carb diet and wasn't experiencing regular BMs. I had tried other laxatives but found that they caused a lot of abdominal cramping for 24hrs or more. I was told that the Mag. Citrate wouldn't cause the cramping and that I should have one large BM &amp; perhaps a smaller 2nd but should then be done. I was cramp free but didn't re-act in the 30min to 6hrs as the label stated. It was more like 10-12hrs later. I did however have at least 3-4 urgent trips to restroom instead of 1 or 2. The urgency of the trips wasn't something that couldn't be &quot;safely&quot; held. Just knew you had to go! Even though my experience was different from others I've talked to I find this to be the best OTC laxative available. The reduction of all the cramping is by far the best benefit. I had the lemon flavored the first time I used it...I do NOT recommend this if you're not found of sour food! It was like drinking straight lemon juice! I too was unaware it could be diluted in water or Sprite. The 2nd time I got the grape flavored. Still has a lemon zing to it but much more managable then the lemon. I also drank the grape undiluted. Walgreens carries the lemon, grape and a cherry. Haven't had to try the cherry yet!

I was told to drink this stuff at noon today...well I finally drank it by 2...awful stuff.  I wish the label said okay to add water.  It would have made it more tolerable.  It is now 9:32pm and my bowels haven't even began to empty...I feel bloated but so far that's it....I hope it works by morning.  good grief.

Has completely watery stools within 2 hours.  Now, 16 hours later, still having runny stools.  Afraid to leave the house because when the urge comes, I have about 1 minute to get to a bathroom.

Other	Lindabet, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	10/30/2007 1:09:23 AM	The day before a Flexible Sigmoid I was instructed to drink the 10oz bottle to cleanse the bowel.  It worked but I did begin to have mouth sores approx. 6 hours after use.  My only conclusion is the concentrated amounts of citrus and sodium.
