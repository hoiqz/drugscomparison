Pain	Kathy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	55-64	3/20/2010 2:30:06 PM	I was given this medicine after surgery to repair an inguinal hernia. I took one every 4 to 6 hours after the surgery for 2 days and found it didn't work that well to relieve my pain. It made me feel drowsy and funny in my head and also caused constipation problems. I was allowed to take 1 or 2 every 4 to 6 hours and that may have helped relieve the pain more but decided not to because of the above reasons. I usually tolerate pain well and prefer to take as little medication as possible. I eased off this medication on the third and fourth day and only took 2 a day. By the 5th day I only took one. After that I switched to taking one Extra Strength Tylenol(500 mg.)once or twice a day and feel less pain and feel much better! I don't think the Tramadol/Acet. helps for this type of surgery.

Worked good. What worked even better was the distribution of the levels of serotonin for OCD. Did not no I suffered with this either but it gave me a huge lift in my everyday things. Did alittle research online under OCD dictionary and Tremadol was mentioned as effective for OCD. I found this all by accident which explained the dramatic changes I experienced. Excellent. I only take one a day and as I get accustomed to it, I now take it before eating anything. Have never used more than one/day. The only side effect known was it  suppressed my appetite, which wasn't too bad.

It also helps keep chiari malformation headaches away and eases fibro pain and that ache you feel from it.  I make sure, though, that I have eaten something before I take it or it will make me nauseated.

I have since used it for near everything! I have osteo-arthritus with alot of pain, I also have severe ovary pain. This works! I love it. I only use it when I HAVE to. I can take up to 3 every 6 hours as needed, I have never needed that many! I dont use ibuprofin anymore I use this instead, it does not cause stomache problems that the ibuprofin causes, in which I have gerd,acid reflux, severe stomache spasms, ect. This does NOT bother my tummy troubles. I havent had any side effects with it except if I am ALREADY tired it will knock me out and helps me sleep better (Love that side effect!) No addiction problems with it yet, I might take 10-15 pills in a months time. I am pain tolerant, I wait till its unbearable before I will take it, and it still works great! I have took it on the onset of pain as well, seems to work the same. I would recommend it to anyone for pain. Although ANY med with REGULAR usage with become less effective over time, would require increased doses. 
Pain	Cheryl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	7/16/2009 10:04:19 AM	I have fibromyalgia, but I can't take NSAIDS because of ulcerative colitis.  I have taken tramadol with acetaminophen daily for several years, and my pain and fatigue are about 85% better when using this drug.  Recently, Aetna RX changed generic providers for it, and the new generic barely works.  I am on a quest to find a pharmacy which stocks the same generic I've been taking.  It is unbelieveable that the manufacturer of the generic can make so much difference!
Pain	Rosebud, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	5/12/2009 4:51:35 PM	I have been on this medication for a couple of months now, it seems to be working. It doesn't take away all of the pain, but enough so that I can function.  It doesn't make me drowsy, but I do think that it make me hot and I sweat really really bad especially if I go outside for any amount of time, then I get chills. I take 1 tablet twice a day, 37.5mg/325. I will keep it at this level, because I feel I will have less side effects. My pain level usually runs about a nine on most days, with this it stays around a 5. I also take a muscle relaxer at bedtime. So overall I would say that its works for me. I am 60 years old and I have arthritis, carpal tunnel, fibromyalgia, and degenerative disk disease. I am active for my age and I think that helps a lot also.

I tried Tramacet (tramadol/acetaminophen) a few mts ago and within 30 mins the pain and sensitivity was GONE. nothing has ever come close to working this well. I get migranes often and this always works. Also I have found that my migranes do not seem to be returning as soon. Now I only have bad bouts about every few weeks instead of daily. I am very happy with this drug, it has helped me tremendosly... and I am usually quite sensitive to some drugs.

It doesn't help at all with pain and makes me so sick at my stomach. I tried with food, milk and it still makes me sick. Don't buy it unless you want to wast money.
