He has used atopiclair for a year and a half.  It works great-smooth skin, fewer breakouts.  I am concerned that the treated areas are completely white among the freckles on his face!  I'm wondreing if this new and not all symptoms have been reported.

Now not only am I not going to use it, I am going to report it to the FDA and consider civil litigation. This product is DANGEROUS!
Atopic Dermatitis	Relieved Customer, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/26/2010 12:21:54 AM	Life-long eczema sufferer hoping for steroid-free remedy.  Started use during a mild flare up and immediately noticed a tingling during application, which was actually encouraging (perhaps signaling potential effectiveness).  Noticed a marginal improvement after day 2.  Decided to give best opportunity for success and increased from 2 to 3 applications per day.  The outcome after day 4: outstanding success!  Skin hasn't felt this soft and smooth since childhood.

Dry Skin	Parent, 0-2 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Male	0-2	10/9/2009 10:13:27 AM	Atopiclair was prescribed by my six month olds pediatrician for dry skin when we insisted that we wanted a non steroidal cream. It did provide some temporary relief but the condition did not go away. The worse part is that she is two now and her skin has been bleached in areas where the cream was applied. The doctor says it might take several years for the spots to go away!Lastly, this is quite an expensive ointment with significant copays depending on your insurance. However, it comes in such a flimsy tube that it cracks in various places with the ointment oozing out from those cracks after a few uses!With dry skin / eczema its best to nip it in the bud. The more you prolong the worse the condition becomes. If I had to do it all over again, I would start with Cetaphil / Triple Cream / Aquaphor and if the condition does not improve soon, use a little bit of the steroidal cream early on so that it doesnt worsen.
Atopic Dermatitis	3-6 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	3-6	9/28/2009 5:57:43 PM	My 6 year old has been suffering with eczema for years. we just began using atopiclair a few months ago and she has such good relief.  This is the only medication she will let me apply with no complaints.  The other medicines burn, and she still has itching. This has been such a miracle for us.  It allows the rash to heal without her scratching and reopening the areas.

It was prescribed by his dermatologist and it has made a world of difference. The redness has disappeared and the area no longer seems to be as painful or irritating to him. The worst part about it is that our (typically GOOD) insurance doesn't cover the cost and it's VERY pricey!

I've found it to be a great calming moisturizer but not a treatment per se for my eczema rashes. I've actually spoken with a few derms who have this same opinion of it. The nice thing is it's not a steroid, but for me, it doesn't really work.

The only thing that has worked in recent years was augmented betamethasone diproprianate, a strong steroidal cream.  I had to use it ~ once every couple of weeks.  Since discovering Atopiclair 2 years ago, I have had to use the steroid a total of two times.  Atopiclair not only successfully keeps the eczema under control, there is longer and longer dormant times between flare-ups.  Currently I've only had to use the Atopiclair once in the past 6 weeks.  That's unheard of in my life.  I've used 2/3 of one tube in 3 years.  My sister, who has eczema worse than I, actually has even more dramatic positive results from it.  My biggest fear is that it stops getting made.

Atopic Dermatitis	Marilyn, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	9/21/2007 12:40:36 PM	This cream has been effective in relieving the minor rash of atopic dermatitis.  In addition, it has improved the texture of my skin - softened it, smoothed it, minimized pores.
