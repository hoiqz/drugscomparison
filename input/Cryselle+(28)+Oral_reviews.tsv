Painful Periods		3	3	2			8/24/2012 9:19:49 PM	I have been on Cryselle for about 3 weeks, and I have experienced TERRIBLE mood swings. Before going on Cryselle (my first birth control pill), I had little to no acne.  After going on it, I broke out so badly! My skin is gross now. I wouldn't recommend this BC. 
Other	showstoppa, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	8/23/2012 11:18:37 PM	I have only been on this bc for two weeks and I am getting off as soon as I can. I was on a different bc but switched because I gained too much weight on the first kind (40+ lbs in a year). Cryselle gives me horrible mood swings. I get mad for no reason. My friend told me to switch before I murder someone. I also get extremely emotional for no reason either. I hate this pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	7/19/2012 12:52:06 AM	No sex drive and very dry.  Gained 10 pounds in a year.  Worked great for pregnancy prevention.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	5	1	Female	19-24	7/8/2012 5:47:40 PM	I have been on this pill for about 5 months now...no side affects at all. My face has actually cleared up, I've lost weight and I dont get many headaches. I have never missed a pill, byt i am thinking that I may be pregnant. My breasts have been tender for about 2 weeks straight now, and my periods have been irregular, and I'm on the placebo pill and I have no period. My boyfriend and I are extremely safe when it cones to sex, so I don't think this pill is effective at all. The only thing it has affected is my moods and sex drive. I have no control over them anymore since I've taken them.
Painful Periods	happy.camper, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/5/2012 12:20:23 PM	I have always had painful long periods, but taking this bc has been a big help. I still get cramps and back pain because I have endo. But its a lot better my periods are also always the same, always come on the same day perfectly I've been on this since 16 ( because of endo.) I'm now 22.no weight gain, I'm a small person. And  I use to struggle with acne and it is a miracle! I get the occasional pimple around my period but nothing like before. As far as protection, no babies for me and the husband. Havent used any other backup methods for 4 years and nothing has happened. Never missed a pill though. 
Birth Control	Whiskey_Rose88, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/21/2012 12:04:26 AM	I know I maxed out my stars but I have found no problems using this medication. Its actually shortened my period, and made me feel at ease. Maybe there were some mood swings but I never noticed them. I know it seems as though I'm bragging up a storm about these medications but it does work... well at least for me. However now I'm being switched to Junel Fe, we'll see how this goes but I'm still a bit nervous. 
Birth Control	Ellemun222, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	6/20/2012 1:43:55 PM	Cryselle made me extremely moody and mean around my period. It was the first bc in my 10 years of taking bc to make me gain weight through increased appetite. It was also one of the toughest bc pills to swallow. 
Birth Control	lmichelle6585, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	6/16/2012 7:41:42 PM	This is my first month. I have issues with migraines. I seem to be having problems with the migraines again. I take the pill at 10 am. I have been visiting family and with the time change have been taking it at 1pm for the 3 hr difference. I have noticed that I am tired in the afternoons, dizzy especially at/after dinner time, and I have a constant dull headache. I'm finished my 3rd week today...guess I'll try to stick it out but I'm not feeling so well. I am active and eat healthy. I do not drink caffeine. So the headaches aren't related to that. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Jacqueline, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	13-18	6/13/2012 11:30:14 PM	I think it's fine.I kept breaking through all the other stupid birth control pills, this one finally set me on the right track.Yes, I still get cramps and some heat flashes around my period, but I think that's totally fine compared to what used to happen to me.I used to have periods every 3 weeks, and they lasted from 7-10 days. It SUCKED. And I had major mood swings, heat flashes, cramps, and everything else.This is the one oral contraceptive that has worked best for me.But, it's different for everyone.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	6/1/2012 1:25:23 PM	Although I know that everyone is different I wanted to share my concern.  After taking this pill for 1 week I started getting shortness of breath &amp; oily skin.  After 2 weeks still had shortness of breath and ended up in the ER twice.  Couldn't breathe and have had numbness in my arm and leg.  Thought I was having a stroke.  Test were done and checked out ok.  It's been 3 days since the last time I took the pill and stil have these symptoms.  Not taking this pill anymore.  One of the scariest experiences of my life!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/27/2012 3:09:15 PM	Worse birth control pill ever. I gained 10 pounds in the first month of taking it and started breaking out all over my face, back, and chest. 
Other	Jenna, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/16/2012 12:17:05 AM	I have only been on this pill for about 2 weeks. I'm taking it for menstrual irregularities and acne. I read these reviews and got scared. I considered not taking Cryselle. But I'm glad I tried it anyway. My skin is not greasy, I'm not moody, I got a breakout at first but now I have no acne at all-my skin is actually clearer, my ankles don't swell as much as other pills, and I'm happy with it overall. Granted, it's only been 2 weeks. I just wanted to write a positive review to show women that what works for some women is awful for others. You just have to try it for yourself! If you're wondering if you should try Cryselle, I would suggest it. It is monophasic-meaning it has the same amount of estrogen and progestin in each pill. This way, the hormones don't fluctuate throughout the cycle. (Which is what caused my breakouts on other pills.) Just try it for yourself and see how you like it! 
Birth Control	Jamlynon , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	5/9/2012 7:14:34 PM	Since taking this drug I have had no sex and have become dry!! My face is completely broke out and I'm 33 years old!this has been one of the worst experiences I have ever had. I will be stopping this drug as if today!
Birth Control	:/, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	5/5/2012 9:32:23 AM	i have been on this pill for three weeks. i got my last period the last week of April and still on it due to the pill. My period started to go away then i started to get brownish discharge and occasional bleeding. And acne came too, its so annoying. im stopping this pill.
Birth Control	Laura, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	4/21/2012 3:53:18 AM	I hate this pill! I only took this for 3 months. The first month was fine but everything went down hill after that. The second month I took this I started to get acne really bad then I would just get upset and cry for hours then the cramps where so bad I would be bent over in pain. The Last month was my breaking point...I would get mad at anything, it didn't matter where I was or who you where I would just get so mad. My boyfrind tried and tried to keep me happy but it just got to the point where he was afraid to say anything to me. I even got a yeast infection form this pill. I have only been off this pill for a few days and i'm going thru bad with-draws from it.
Birth Control	ldanie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	35-44	4/17/2012 11:22:19 AM	Since I've started taking this pill I get horrible headaches for days at a time, the last one was 3 days.  My skin is super dry.  I'm moody, anxious and have no sex drive.  I'm not pregnant, though.  I'm going to stop taking it because the headaches, alone, are not worth the bc.  
Birth Control	Hate this BC, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	4/16/2012 4:51:57 PM	Continous painful yeast infections non stop for 4 months now. My doctor took me off of them and i still have yeast infections. Painful periods- acne breakouts on body and painful painful yeast infections.
Birth Control	karend, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	4/16/2012 1:05:44 PM	I have been taking Cryselle for 6 weeks, gained 7lbs in the first 4 week.  crampy, moody and lots of headached. overall malaise. First mens cycle was miserable, painful, heavy and emotional.  I have been taking a different LowOveral generic for over a year and never had all these side effects. I am had to stop this medicine.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/16/2012 10:24:49 AM	Unlike some other users, I have been fortunate enough to just experience an increase in vaginal fluids. My acne actually started clearing up instead of increasing and my periods don't last for three weeks anymore with enough blood to flood a small town. I have been very satisfied with this pill and my worst side effect was mild headaches when I first started taking it. Over one year strong now and I still love Cryselle!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/12/2012 8:13:11 PM	Stay away!!! Gives you acne that doesnt go away!!!!!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/9/2012 2:40:47 AM	I only stayed on Cryselle for 5 days -- every day, I woke up horribly depressed, cried over nothing, was extremely tired all the time (all very unlike me), constant headaches, and anxiety attacks. The awful side effects really scared me, and my husband asked me to please stop taking it, because it was making me feel so terrible. It's been 48 hours since I took my last pill, and since my period stopped, and I just started spotting, which has never happened to me before. I'm calling the doctor in the morning to get a new Rx. Cryselle was horrible for me.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	4/4/2012 1:18:06 PM	I have been on this pill for about 2 years. I have not been moody or depressed on this pill. It doesn't make me sick but I get terrible acne on my chest and back around my period. It is to the point where I may switch because the acne is so bad. 
Birth Control	kwake208, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	3/29/2012 9:53:04 PM	I took this for a total of three years, and the first two years it was the best thing ever. But for some reason, about the last seven months I used it, my periods became really irregular and longer. It definitley did a good job as birth control, but it just started having weird side effects.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	3/29/2012 3:29:18 PM	I've had the worst experience with this birth control. My gynecologist prescribed it because I was spotting with other pills. It's the third kind I've taken &amp; it's the only one to affect my moods. I've been depressed ever since I started taking it. It made my breasts grow, which may sound good, but I'm in so much pain because of it. Also, I'm trying to figure out if I'm pregnant. I had to get this generic version because the brand named version was too expensive, so maybe the brand named one would have worked better, I don't know. I don't recommend this though.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/1/2012 9:21:33 AM	I was on this pill for over 7 years, and it was great until the last 1.5 years. I tried 3 different combo pills before finding Cryselle. Up until then it was great, got my period at the same time, didn't have crazy mood swings, and still had a high sex drive.  Also, I wasn't as hungry as before the pill, so I actually lost weight!  During my last year and a half on Cryselle I started getting migraines before my period started, and that's the only reason I am not still taking this pill.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	tpayne, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	2/27/2012 7:06:35 PM	my overall review of this pill i have hot flash my sex drive sucks it i still bleed heavy im gonna stop this pills i do get headaches on the onsite of my menstrual 
Birth Control	LBoogie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/6/2012 9:18:42 AM	This pill didn't cause mood swings because I had NO emotion on it.  I felt numb.  My back broke out HORRIBLY as did my face, I had no sex drive, and I was constantly bloated.  I swtiched to OTC which immediately kicked out the bloat (what a difference), but now I haven't been able to stop crying...maybe it was all the backed up tears from being on cryselle.lol.  I dont recommend either pill.
Birth Control	JibberRish, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	2/2/2012 8:54:33 PM	I am 23 and Im not going to say that this pill was completely awful because i came from a horrible experience with loestrin fe. But wmy mood was fine, no apparent weight changes (but i also work out) and 1 or 2 headaches during my placebo week. The absolute worst symptom was ACNE. Acne on upper back, chest, chin, jawline, forehead.. you name it i had it. this was surprising because I am a proactive user. Switching to Ortho tri cyclen lo. We shall seeeeee. Ill always recommend nuva ring tho, i just cant afford it :( 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	FreekyFreeda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	1/25/2012 3:04:46 PM	I have been on this pill for a month. According to the the pill pack I should have started my period a few days ago and haven't. I have zero sex drive and all I ever want to do is sleep. Depression, crying, and about to try and switch already.
Birth Control	lalala, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	1/10/2012 4:11:14 PM	This medicine made me very sick to my stomach, especially if I had ANY alcohol whatsoever. I've been on it for 6 months and I've been very emotionally needy, depressed, and anxious too. My skin didn't clear up and I feel bloated when I take it as well. Ironically, the week OF my period I feel better because I'm not taking the active pills.
Birth Control	Helpful, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	1/9/2012 3:25:29 PM	Since I've started taking this pill, I have been feeling extremely big, I cramp regularly, throughout the month and I have NO sex drive on this pill. I did a mini test where I got off of it for a month and I was completely back to my old self (sex drive and all). Oh and I've gained 30+ pounds in the past year (since I've started taking this pill). Trying to switch very soon to anything else.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	1/6/2012 6:22:41 PM	ACNE, WEIGHT GAIN, and ZERO SEX DRIVE!!! This pill is horrible.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	12/25/2011 5:21:21 PM	This north control is great for me, I start my period in the middle of the week and its gone by Saturday which is the best and its never heavy. The only downside is I have crazy mood swings before my period and very short tempered. Other than that its wonderful.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	11/29/2011 5:22:01 PM	Used this BC for about 4 years. It's effective in that I haven't gotten pregnant, my cramping was less severe, periods were lighter and my skin has cleared up, but I'm stopping its use because I have ZERO (affecting my relationship) sex drive and excessive facial fair growth. For the past year I have also been experiencing migraines during the &quot;placebo&quot; pills. I'm not sure if I gained weight, but I'll find out in the next month or two.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	11/26/2011 9:33:23 PM	This pill made me feel AWFUL!! It was very effective (always got my period on the same the day) other than that everything was bad. My sex drive was non-exsistant and i constantly felt bloated and just plan disgusting. After trying to cope with the symptoms for a year i finally stopped it and its been great since! 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	4	1	Female	19-24	11/20/2011 4:28:26 PM	Im currently on my second month of this pill, i was on yaz for 2 years and loved it, just started taking this one after a year and a half of no pill. I have pmdd and hormonal oarian cysts and was told this should help, well it hasnt so far, My face is breaking out like crazy, i have gas and cramping through my whole cycle, horrible breast soarness like i can barely stand them being touched. my sex drive has decreased and i have this wierd vaginal discharge, its almost mucusy and very sticky and gobby. Not to mention i woke up at 4am the other morning and threw up, ive never had that happen before in my life! My 21st birthday is next month and i will continue the pill untill then. but i feel worse on this than i did on ortho-tri-cyclone. Im sure this works for some people, but its just not working for me.
Painful Periods	Shalimar, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/9/2011 8:24:36 PM	I have taken 8 days worth of pills and have been eating anything I can get my hands on. I gained 10 pounds in 8 days! That's why I am on here trying to find out what is going on, and if anyone else has had this problem.....looks like a common side effect. Today is my last pill! 
Birth Control	83MrsCampbell94, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	11/3/2011 8:40:30 PM	I started this bc when I was 13 because of bad periods and I quit taking it about a year ago and took another and it didnt work out so now im on it again and I havnt started my period yet hopefully i'll start soon but it hasnt been bad for me so far
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Jersey1981, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	11/3/2011 10:10:55 AM	I started taking this pill to regulate my period, what I got was three weeks of non-stop bleeding, migraines all day every day, moodiness, somewhat depress, no weight gain, just felt like I gain 100 lbs, sleepless nights even though I took the pill first thing in the morning. I cant real talk of a sex drive due to the uncontrollable bleeding &amp; very bad cramps. Ive been off the pill for two days now Im still bleeding but feeling much like me again. I really wanted to give this pill a chance but these side effects are just too much, I will be calling my Dr. asap this pill is not for me. 
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	10/6/2011 5:27:53 PM	I was more depressed in the 2 weeks I took this medication, than the whole 9 months after my husband left me.
Endometriosis	Jaci, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	10/31/2011 3:19:16 PM	I was on this medication to treat endometriosis for a year.  Unfortunately, on July 1, 2010, they discovered a blood clot in the back of my left knee, so I had to switch to Depo Provera, and will be on Warfarin/Coumadin until I reach menopause or decide to get a hysterectomy/double oopherectomy.  So for all those women over 35, heed the warnings, even if you don't smoke!  It CAN cause a blood clot just like it did for me!
Endometriosis	Madeline, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	13-18	10/17/2011 7:28:05 PM	It works well for what it's purpose should be. I am not sexually active but was put on birth control for extreme back pain cramps and heavy periods. I started my period when I was nine and have been suffering from severe pain since. I am now 18 and have been using cryselle for the past 3 and a half months. It has ,though, conflicted with my acne medication and my face has broken out like crazy. I have also noticed severe migraines and headaches everyday since I started the pill. 
Birth Control	stasia , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	9/27/2011 4:48:44 PM	This worked well for birth control... not that I needed that because I lost ALL sex drive while on this pill. I also went through crazy mood swings.I have been on other pills for 4 years without these side effects, the 4 months I spent on this pill were a living hell. 
Birth Control	PillPopper, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	9/12/2011 5:11:55 PM	Before being sexually active, it helped w/ my irregular and very painful periods.  Going off of it between periods I got bad headaches and moodiness/fatigue.  However now that I am sexually active my sex drive is SUPER LOW and I hate it!  Was not like that before taking the pill...am going off of it now.
Painful Periods	armywife12, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	8/17/2011 2:24:59 AM	For the most part I was very satisfied with this low dose BC.  I had been on it for years to help with having painful cramps and heavy bleeding during my cycle and it did help.  It may have contributed to weight gain, but it was over a long period of time.  It did help in keeping my skin clear also and I have noticed the difference because now I am PREGNANT!!! I am happy.  So overall I have been satisfied with this for pregnancy prevention, you just have to take it everyday on time for it to work.  I will admit it the past I took my chances by accidentally missing pills and never got pregnant until this year and I have been on the pill for at least the past 3 years probably longer.  So overall it works pretty well!
Birth Control	sherr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/27/2011 10:05:32 PM	I have not had many side affects, accept for a really low sex drive (my moodiness is hard to tell because I am planning a wedding and also started a new job).  I have been on this pill for about 6 months and my sex drive has become worse each month. I am looking forward to going off of this pill because this is the first one I have ever experienced low sex drive with.   
Birth Control	Michelle, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	7/6/2011 1:20:24 AM	I was prescribed Cryselle after taking the depo shot and suffering heavy bleeding for four continuous months. Cryselle has been fantastic for me. My period lasts no more than four days. As for the side effects, all birth control has side effects but Cryselle was the best for me.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	6/27/2011 10:07:55 AM	Switched to Cryselle after my birth control pill was discontinued. Only took one month and I was on the phone with my dr. asking for another pill. My appetite went through the roof and I gained 15 lbs. in less than a month. Breasts stayed super sore, bloated all the time, and my face, chest and back broke out so bad. I am 31 and have never had acne like this. Bad pill for me. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/11/2011 8:56:53 PM	This pill has been great! Only side effects I have are terrible migraines the day before my period starts and crying over EVERYTHING. Other than that, my period always starts on Wednesday and is pretty much gone by Saturday. AWESOME! Worth the side effects I think. As with any pill, it will be different for everyone who takes it, but I really like Cryselle! 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	LadyT, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/6/2011 2:24:26 PM	While on Cryselle I had short, light, cramp-free periods. My new doc switched me to Sprintec &amp; I started having long, heavy, extremely painful periods &amp; found out I have a large mass on my ovary which I believe was caused by the Sprintec. I will be switching back to Cryselle after surgery to remove the mass. 
Birth Control	jrzgrl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/1/2011 8:44:03 PM	I have been on different types of BC since I was 18...seems like I would build up an &quot;immunity&quot; to one after a while. However, I really liked this one in the beginning. After being on it for a year though I am going off it bc I have MAJOR mood swings and feel like it's making me feel crazy!! Never going back on this pill
Birth Control	joannie08, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	5/16/2011 7:57:31 PM	This pill made me gain weight 3 pounds and gave me mood swings. For the first 2 weeks that I was on it, I would be very irritable. 
Birth Control	coeding, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	5/8/2011 11:05:49 PM	I have been taking this BC for a year now. I have experienced severe moodiness, even somewhat depressed and feel very emotionally unstable. I have also gained around 15 pounds. The worst of it is that I have absolutely NO sex drive. I have been off the pill now for about a month (we are TTC) and I still feel a little emotional, crying for no reason. But I do feel like my mood is improving. Also I forgot to mention the terrible cramps, nausea and constant bloating. I won't be using this BC again. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	4/26/2011 7:22:24 PM	This did the job of preventing birth control and regulated my period (I knew within about two hours when my period would start each month), but my sex drive completely disappeared while taking it.  Turns out this pill contains a high dosage of the hormones (3x what is found in some other pills). Too summarize, it's good for regulation but may interfere with your body a bit much if you are only needing birth control.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/8/2011 6:06:31 PM	This is my first birth control to take. At first I had mood swings, i cried alot, had headaches, and felt extremely tired in the mornings because I took/take it before bedtime. Now Im a couple of days in my second pack and everything seems to be balancing itself out I've had no weight gain,sex drive is the same, I had a lighter and short period ( Yay!!) so hopefully everything will stay like it is!

Also after my period when I start the new pack it causes a weird smell but just for the first week then it goes away. I don't have any infections and this has never happened with any other pill.
Birth Control	pleiwithlei, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	2/18/2011 10:12:51 PM	I switched from Ortho-Evra to Cryselle about 10 months ago. My doctor explained about the breakthrough bleeding especially if I was going to use it to skip periods. However, due to interactions with other medications (mainly absorption the of Cryselle), I have just experienced a month-long period and have now broken out with acne from chin to shoulders to back. I'm pretty sure this is not due to the other medications because I have taken them before with no problems. Cryselle is my newest medication and I've narrowed my symptoms down to it. I have also stopped my other meds but my acne still persists. I even did my laundry three times over to make sure. I added benzoyl peroxide to my skin regimen and when that didn't help and then also added salicylic acid. Still no change. I will have to go see my dermatologist because of this and I have NEVER broken out past my chin in acne. I have never had bad acne in my life. I am also having problems with weight gain. I don't eat too bad of a diet, but I've gained about 10 lbs since my breakthrough bleeding started. I have tried to offset that by exercising more (I'm on my feet running all day at my job and added 15-20min of cardio 5days a week) and eating even more healthy (more salad bleh and I don't drink anything but water, tea, or coffee), but it feels impossible to lose. I work in nursing and in pharmacy so I know what most of the side effects are and that they are different for everyone, but this one has by far given me the worst side effects in the 12 years I've been on bc when it's not been used properly (ie the med interactions). I will probably switch to another bc when my year is up.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	2/9/2011 11:08:26 PM	I have only been on this pill for two weeks because of heavy periods, and I already hate it.It's been causing me to be really moody and depressed, which suicidal thoughts and anxiety.I've gained weight, and got more oily skin and hair.It's easy to use, because all you do is swallow it, but still I never want to be on this again.

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/13/2011 12:24:06 PM	Some acne on my face no other side effects.

Endometriosis	Blueyedesign, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	12/21/2010 8:41:01 PM	My dr. put me on this to treat what she thinks i have. Endometriosis. i have TErRIBLE cramps and GI issues. painful sex- etc. I was on Loestrin 24 before &amp; spotted for 2 straight months. the day after i switched i stopped spotting. but now i'm on month 3 &amp; have had the WORST cramps for the last week &amp; spotting. My dr told me to skip placebo pills. so this SUCKS. i shouldnt be bleeding or cramping at all!
Birth Control	soccergrl28, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/21/2010 2:21:21 PM	I was on Cryselle for about 3 years and unfortunately had to switch to something cheaper (Sprintec) due to no longer being covered under parents health insurance. I LOVED this bc - no noticed side effects whatsoever. Ive had migraines since I was 8 years old and this seemed to help lesson the frequency of them. My skin was clearer while using this also, I didn't gain any weight and my periods were always at the same time and super light. And I definitely still loved having sex with my bf. Since switching to sprintec, I gained 50lbs within 4 months, my skin breaks out really bad, moody/depressed and my blood pressure shot up BAD. I regret switching OFF Cryselle just for something cheaper, and have discontinued using any pill for now but will fortunately be BACK on a health insurance plan and will be taking Cryselle again once the new year begins.
Painful Periods	denarose, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	19-24	12/19/2010 8:26:04 PM	I started taking this birth control 8 months ago for birth control and painful periods. The first few months went well enough, it is effective in both of these areas. I gained 10 pounds the first two months, but lost it just as fast as I had gained it. However, the side effects I've been getting the last four months are VERY uncomfortable. Painful cramping before period, breast pain, tenderness, and swelling. A lot of bloating, mood swings, depression, nausea, high blood pressure, headaches, and tiredness. The side effects are at the point now where I will be switching off this pill A.S.A.P
Other	DEGS1010, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	12/9/2010 5:19:16 AM	Has anyone had any vision changes with this one?  Blurriness?  I have also lost more than half of the hair on my head.  Bled almost every day with this one for months, then, it magically stopped.  Let me know if anyone out there has had any vision changes.  Thanx!
Birth Control	Diva Dee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	35-44	10/20/2010 2:03:51 PM	I just started this drug a month ago. For the first 2 weeks of taking these pills i felt sick to my stomach, I craved food and ate all day. This drug made me bleed heavily for a full 30 days. my menstrual cycle began soon after (and i only know that because it was accompanied by cramps). Now i have to wait 7 days to determine if the month long bleeding will stop. i am fearful that i may have turned anemia and started taking iron supplements as a precaution.
Birth Control	WhiGru, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	10/6/2010 4:48:48 PM	I was on Cryselle for 2+ years up until 3 weeks ago (now TTC). Went on it for cramps/long-heavy periods/and bc. Did not gain noticible weight but I was on other BCs for 4 years before this one so maybe I just didnt notice. Worked great, prevented pregnancy, somewhat shorter/lighter periods, and was able to skip them if I wanted. Also very predictable- knew when my period would come every month! However, going off has been terrible! Breaking out on face/back/chest, moody and depressed! Big increase in oil on my face/head- not happy! From other reviews I've read, this will hopefully go away soon...fingers crossed. 
Endometriosis	Jenna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/27/2010 6:28:50 PM	I've been on this pill for about 4 months and take it without breaks so as not to have a cycle. I had some spotting in the 2nd month but none since then. I am now experiencing mystic acne on my chin and neck. I tried Yaz prior to and it was a bad experience. It caused spotting and severe breast pain. I don't think any pill is perfect.
Birth Control	amc1227, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/24/2010 12:33:03 AM	My acne got so much worse not only on my face but back and shoulders too...It made my sex drive very low..I wish I never started this pill my face is horrible
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	9/19/2010 1:03:27 PM	I am literally on day 4 of Cryselle. I was previously on Tri-Sprintec for roughly one year.I just had a physical (pap, blood, etc) and I described to my doctor that during the last month or two, I've had pain during sex in a few positions (me on top-my favs and that's not normal to me!) and also right under my belly button on the right side felt tighter on the inside. She referred me to get a pelvic ultrasound and suprise suprise!! I have a cyst inside my right ovary. Not on top, but inside. Not as common. So at least I have explanation as to why the discomfort. Needless to say I have a follow up in 6 weeks to see if the cyst has dissintegrated or increased in size. I read another review that Cryselle is used to help control the ovarian cysts. I am HOPING that it does. Other than that, I hope that this is effective in preventing pregnancy, won't cause crazy mood swings and does not flair up any ance. Just an FYI: I was on a pill with higher androgen (male hormones) levels and I had a HUGE sex drive and a HUGE flair up of acne. I decided to switch because the acne outweighed the sex drive. It was hoestly the worst it's ever been.. even at 14!!! Best of luck to everyone.. We woman must go through a lot by preventing pregnancies!! The mood swings, irregular bleeding, lack of sex drive, weight gain, nausea, ovarian cysts, depression, etc.. TOO MUCH!! I keep trying to convince my love of 2 yrs to get a vasectomy, but until we have our kids one day, that request is not happening. Ce la vie!
Birth Control		5	4	1			8/14/2010 9:08:45 PM	I started taking this about 6 months ago and since I have become very moody and stressed more than normal. I lost ALL sex drive. I also was constantly feeling bloated. I was not happy at all with how this drug made me feel. 
Birth Control	Casper, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	35-44	8/7/2010 1:59:42 PM	I tried to hang in there through the side effects, but had to stop this pill after 6 weeks. With Cryselle, I had worse migraines, non-migraine pounding headaches, 10 lb weight gain in 6 weeks, acne in weird places (low back, legs, chest), water retention (puffy face), moodiness, and scary painful muscle/body aches. Going to talk to GYN about non-hormone birth control options.
Birth Control	amasol, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	7/30/2010 8:15:00 PM	I was on Cryselle for 6 months and I'm sorry I didn't switch off it sooner. It made me extremely moody, emotionally unstable, and even depressed. For the first 3 months it gave intense stomach pain after taking it, though taking it with yogurt seemed to help. The worst was my sex drive decreased drastically. Soon as I switched to a different brand, my libido was up again and it's been wonderful being off Cryselle! 
Birth Control	tmh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/1/2010 4:55:53 PM	I love this medication; have never had any negative side effects

At first my face got all oily and I was nausious for about a day, but that all went away. I noticed my face began to clear up more. I have clearer skin now and regular periods.I have not gained any weight or have had changes in mood. I am very happy woth this pill.  
Birth Control	sillygirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/20/2010 10:40:18 PM	I had a lighter, shorter period, but that was not enough to put up with the downsides...very moody before period, lots of acne breakouts on my face, felt emotionally unstable- have tried different bc methods for 12 yrs now &amp; Cryselle has been the worst experience- more worse than my allergic reaction to Yaz where I needed two forms of steroids to counter the reaction.
Birth Control	cejkalady, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	4/7/2010 7:18:53 PM	Since I started taking it, I have had lighter, shorter periods, less acne, and less mood swings. My breasts got larger, but no other weight gain noticed. My only qualm was that my sex drive decreased, and if you don't want to have sex, there's not much reason for b/c except for medical reasons!
Birth Control	lauuu, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	13-18	3/20/2010 9:33:31 PM	I've been taking this for one month, and have had trouble sleeping through the night. Every morning I wake up with a head ache, and yesterday I got my period and have been extremely moody crying over everything, and today I've had a horrible head ache all day...I've taken two different types of birth control before and never had any symptoms (except for weight gain). I think I will switch to yaz.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	3/15/2010 12:58:13 AM	I have used this BC for about 3 1/2 months, and am not satisfied. I have had bad breakouts on my back (never had before) and chest, and a lot of weight gain. I have also been extremely tired, as another user commented, and have had bad mood swings.
Endometriosis	ia28, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/2/2010 10:31:44 AM	This is the first birth control medication I have ever been on. The only reason my gyno put me on it is due to endometriosis and periods every other week with heavy bleeding and extreme pain. I just finished my first pack and so far I am very happy with how Cryselle has helped. I had no pain associated with my period, they are extremely light, and my headaches have completely gone away. I have also noticed I am happy and not as moody and short with people as before. Also, this brand of birth control cost me less than $5 a month which is a huge plus.I think weight gain could be possible with this birth control, but I have not experienced any. I began working out the first day of taking the pill. If you exercise and just watch what you are eating, weight gain will not be an issue at all. The only side effect I have noticed is chest acne and bad acne on my chin. I broke out a lot though before my period when I was not on Cryselle, so this is still not much worse than before. I did get very emotional and cry a lot for the first month. I am hoping everything will regulate its self out by month 3 because Cryselle is really helping my periods and endometriosis. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/7/2010 8:12:47 PM	for the past few weeks (ive been on it for two weeks altogether now, just started my third week today) and i am tired all the time, the back and chest are breaking out, and i feel like throwing up.  im not sure if i gained weight, i don't see how i could since im not eating because i feel sick!  my daughter is 5 and i can't stay awake with her and i feel sick all the time.  i get up in the morning and go right back to sleep in just a couple hours and sleep all day.  I dislike this pill, i was on tri cyclin for well over 7 years and switched becauyse my dr wanted me on lower dosage of hormones.  Im going to the dr tomorrow to get a new script.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Jenny4, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	1/3/2010 3:50:27 PM	I've been on this medication for about 4 years now. It worked in the beginning with little side effects. Now it seems that is causing some depression/moodiness. I didn't notice weight gain, but I did notice some unwanted hair on my chin that I could go without for sure. I will probably try some other pill and see how that works for me.
Birth Control	maskjs,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		12/21/2009 8:55:38 AM	I have been taking this for 2 years, no weight gain, no moodiness, lighten/shortened period. Very happy wit this bc.

Started taking it because of cysts in my ovaries, and now for actual birth control. Havent gotten pregnant yet. No weight gain. I'm moodier when I'm off it than when I'm on it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/10/2009 3:21:47 PM	Have been on this pill for about a year now, after having been on Yasmin for 6 years and began to have very irregular bleeding. Main negative is a definite worsening of my acne. I had it completely controlled on the Yasmin, but found myself breaking out horribly on my back, arms, chest, and face (but only around my period). Am on another oral med just to help control the acne now. Otherwise, I really like it! Increased sex drive, larger breasts, no weight gain...I can deal with taking another med for the acne it caused to have all of the benfits of this pill. Very Happy!!

Birth Control	swanindisguise86, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	11/8/2009 7:58:34 PM	I have used this b/c for about 2-3 years and found that I gained weight very fast once started. I never used to have mood swings until later on. It was only a few days before my period that I would have them but they increased in severity over time. I stopped taking them for 3 months and felt completly normal right away. However, I hate condoms and I am with the same person for 2 1/2 years now and we plan to get married but don't want kids. Until he can get a vasectomy I have decided that I will take the take the mood swings over the parania about getting pregnant. I didn't have any break through bleeding on this pill but tried Othrotricyclin for a few months and bled for about 3 months stright with frequent spotting between my periods. I feel this pill works very well, I never had any pregnancy scares while taking it. I was able to lose most of the weight I gained with some disipline and better eating habits so it's not impossible to manage your weight on this pill. If the mood swings return I may try another pill but I'm hoping this break might have done the trick for a little while.

Birth Control	smashly, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/2/2009 10:19:56 PM	When i first took this drug i had nausea every day, a friend told me to try taking it right before bed as soon as i did that the nausea has not been back. My periods are now regular and so far it has been very effective...
Birth Control	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	9/27/2009 9:38:36 PM	Since I have been taking this drug I have experienced low sex drive, acne, breast tenderness, arm and leg numbness, and very bad mood swings.

I can not sleep and I become restless irritable hungry I feel like I have a horrible case of ADD. before when I was just on Prozac I was fine. Cryselle is supposed to be a very low dosage; however I felt the hormonal change right away. I am going to discontinue. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	ready2beamom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	5/21/2009 11:01:40 PM	I take this for many reasons, but mainly to prevent painful periods &amp; ovarian cysts. I've used this daily for almost 2 years &amp; have been satisfied up until the last 4 months. Never before did I have breakthrough bleeding, but it's happened everyday since April (today is May 21). I've been celibate for 9 months so no STD concerns &amp; yes I have been tested since abstaining. Also, after reading other comments I don't feel as weird knowing I'm not the only one who has developed unwanted facial hairs! My weight fluctuates regularly anyway, so not sure if this bcp is helps or hurts. It definitely helps with pregnancy prevention though...when I had sex it was unprotected quite often with my boyfriend &amp; never got pregnant. Hope my review helps someone out there.
Birth Control	no kids yet thanks pill, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/4/2009 1:24:15 PM	I've been on Cryselle for almost four years and it has regulated my period.  I get one every month same time.  I have noticed excessive hair on my neck and chin areas.  But if you don't want to get pregnant the pill is not the only means that you should use.  Condoms and the pill for me have worked.  No children yet.  Never missed a pill or period.  I am satisfied with the pill.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	3/8/2009 12:04:08 AM	After you get used to the nausea and the feeling your throat is closing after you take the pill; you just have to deal with the oily skin, acne attacks, moodiness and weight gain...oh yeah, I GOT PREGNANT too (not a bad thing, just suprised..and I didn't miss a pill) and then miscarried (horrible, not sure if it had anything to do with the drug). This is by far the WORST birth-control I have ever used.

Like others I have noticed that I am moodier and naussiated all the time. My eating habits have changed and I still have not stopped my period. I have been on it for 2 and 1/2 weeks now. I was told it would stop it and regulate them better but so far it hasn't worked.

Everything was fine, except for the last 2 years.  I've become more moody and depressed and i've grown unwanted facial/ body hair, and i've gained weight. I think i want to change pills....
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/15/2009 3:56:37 PM	I took this birth control stop the break-through bleeding when I wasn't suppose to be bleeding. It hasn't definitely lightened my periods but I also find my self nausous and my acne is pretty bad.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	tiredofbleeding, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	12/10/2008 3:08:48 PM	Took this bc for 2 months for breakthrough bleeding, didn't work. 38 years old and caused acne like I was a teenager! Makes me nauseated also. Unless your wanting acne and stomach upset I DO NOT reccomend this!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	12/8/2008 12:40:07 PM	I have been on this b/c for two months. It is effective in the sense that I did not get pregnant but I did experience other adverse side effects. Severe acne on my back, as well as break outs on my face and I have not had a problem with acne in years. Breast tenderness, unwanted facial hair, headaches and nausea were also experienced. Any b/c you may take reacts differently to different people. I believe the estrogen amount in this pill is too high for me, I'm going to ask for a lower dose pill.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	10/27/2008 11:50:14 PM	I have only been using this brand of birth control for 2 months and I am not happy at all my face and hair is oilier and my period is so unregular, I have weird spotting that can last up to a week so Im all confused as to which one is my real period, I have missed a period one month and had 2-3 in a nother with several pregnancy scares. Calling the doc to get something diffrent ASAP!
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	vagirl305, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	10/1/2008 2:11:26 PM	Effective to prevent cysts on my ovaries, but I've gained weight since taking Cryselle. Doing the same exercise routine as before taking this pill, and my weight fluctuates like crazy! Of course, this is depressing. :(
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	4	5	3	Female	19-24	8/16/2008 9:38:50 PM	It did its job, it prevented me from getting pregnant.  I do think it did effect my mood and caused me to become depressed and moody though.  
Birth Control	 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	3	5	3			5/31/2008 8:19:12 PM	My face has gotten oilier over the years as I've taken Cryselle and that should not be happening!  If anything, I should have a drier face because I'm getting older.  That's what I think anyway.  Another negative is that my periods last for 4 days, so no break there either.  I'm going to check with my doctor about switching.
Birth Control	19-24 Female 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	2/26/2008 11:00:29 PM	I threw up all night after the first pill.  I've never had that happen when I've taken other birth controls.

I was on it for almost 3 years and all my acne went away i stayed thin and never had mood swings.Also i knew exactly when my period was.
