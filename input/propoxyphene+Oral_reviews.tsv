Pain	Aarius, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	12/10/2011 10:52:32 PM	Caucasian male, 64, retired law enforcement. Began Propoxyphene 65 mg by Rx in 1977. Med was determined my family MD, with my close consultation, for chronic pain.  Of other choices, this Rx proved to be most effective and innocuous.  Could not take any Rx that in any way impaired my function because of law enforcement job description. This Rx became a normal part of everyday life; I often forgot to take days Rx with me, no problems, ever.  When FDA pulled it, my Primary Hlth Care Provider was concerned, I didn't know why.  She suggested alternatives, like H-Codone and others. 4 the first time in 34 yrs I was confronted with facts I had not thought of. I was very surprised to hear FDA's reasoning.  I have regular phys. exams.  Private Pilot, heart strong as a horse.  I took 6 - 65 mg capsules per day 24/7/365, never any probs, side effects, issues that affected job performance. Now 100% retired, and I take no Rx or other med, occasional OTC Excedrin. My Dr. expressed concerns about such a life-style change, refer'd to specialist who wrote SUBOXON to deal W/withdrawal. 3 days later I returned all but 2 SUBOXON, remaining Propox 2B destroyed, no withdrawal, no problems, just stopped. That was almost a year ago. The FDA, a perfect example of government intrusion, over regulation, ridiculous regs. NEEDS 2B COMPLETELY PHASED OUT - even so,the one thing the FDA ever did that made my life better was pulling Propoxyphene W/O notice or warning. NO RESEARCH, and I do a lot, has verified FDA's finding. I may be the exception and not the rule, in fact NEVER start or stop any med. W/O close professional medical supervision,this from someone who has seen what drugs can do - up close and personal and arrested people for illegal possession of cntrlld substances not much more that that which I was taking daily by legal Rx. THAT, made me think when FDA pulled it. I am fortunate. Please be careful about what U take,why,how much,and legally-it's amazing what just will power can do.

Pain	Phillipe, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male		1/6/2011 9:45:32 AM	I have taken Darvocet for more than 20 years, and lately just the ingredient Propoxyphene, with no adverse reactions and with modest pain control.  I have used these products AS PRESCRIBED! I am a 77 year old caucasion male and now that I can no longer buy this product, I am reduced to either taking something that makes me nauseated or learning to live with pain and those are both very poor choices. I would like to know how and where to buy Propoxyphene so that I can spend what remaining days I may have left in reasonable comfort.

ITS THE ONLY DRUG THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME GO CRACY AND OTHER NARCONICKS DOES.. i REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE THAT DARVOCET WAS TAKEN OFF THE MAKET SO SUDDENLY.. I REALLY THINK THE FDA SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED WITH MAJOR PAIN MEDICATIONS THAT ARE BEING OVELY PERSCRIBED AS OXICOTTON.THEIR IS SO MANY PEOPLE ADDICTED TO THOSE NARCONTIC DRUGS... i JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THE FDA COULDN'T HAVE LEFT DARVOCET ON THE MARKET FOR ALL OF US PEOPLE YOU FOUND IT TOOK AWAY WITH LESS SIDE AFFECTS.EXPECESSLY NOT GOING CRACY WITH NARCOTIC DRUGS...

Seemingly have to take more in winter (cool months) than in summer, but if I go out and do anything out of a walking norm, I end up having to take the fully prescribed amount (no more than 6 per day) I am not sure I have ever taken more than 3 a day, and that nearly put me on the floor.

I can't use so many of the new drugs that cause the problem with death. I think it is so important to keep the medicine that has so many pain killers and do away with these new drugs that kill so many drug users. We see the people that take all the pain killers and they take many of the new drugs. Can't we stop all this taking away of the old drugs and stay with the old drugs                      Sharon Barnett
Pain	Ruthie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	11/29/2010 8:07:41 PM	I am disabled with multiple back fusions. I have been on opiods for 8 years. I have been prescribed oxycontin, fentenyl and this year Dilauded with Robaxin. I am working with a wonderful doctor at the pain clinic and at my request have been trying to take Darvocet during the day. I've done this for 6 months now and feel that I'm buying time from chronic pain opiods as dangerous as Oxy and Fentenyl. So far I can make it to about 2pm before I take one 2mg Dilauded with 1/2 of a Robaxin. I hate headaches and the Oxy gives me severe headache. Dilauded does too but I am trying not to take it. I have to get epidurals every 2 months. I am 52 year old and fairly healthy mother and grandmother so am extremely discouraged that the FDA has taken away what to me is the lesser of two evils in a life long chronic pain scenario. I am allergic to Codiene so Vicoden and other synthetics have been ruled out. If blood tests show health and EKG's show strength are they really thinking that Oxycontin has fewer risks for me than Darvocet? Come on!

IN OTHER WORDS, I CANNOT TOLERATE TYLENOL. I'VE BEEN IN PAIN FOR 2 AND A HALF YEARS.  I WAS ALSO PRESCRIBED HYDROCODONE 5-500 APAP.  MORE TYLENOL!

Pain	Magnoliabelle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	7/8/2009 3:35:11 AM	I was in a car accident with broken bones and and was prescribed Darvon.  I had a severe allergic reaction. My face and neck turned a shiny bright red with my face ballooned up as if I were a blimp. As to dizziness, I can only say that I felt light-headed but not a full-blown dizzy state.  When I reported this to my doctor in person where he could see my symptoms, he downplayed the medical reaction to the drug, probably in fear of a lawsuit.  What is not talked about is the elephant in the treatment room -- &quot;the lawsuit factor.&quot;  I am not one to run to an attorney at the slightest whim, especially when a drug was prescribed in good faith and I knew of no reason to have an allergenic reaction from this prescribed drug. You feel very alone when the doctor, who prescribed a medication, silently backs off treating you as in legal protection of his personal craft. OTC or nothing at all is recommended after symptoms clear. This gives the physician a &quot;get out of court&quot; card, but does nothing for your suffering.  (BTW, I was hit while sitting still in traffic by a motorist who was text-messaging...but that is another story.)  I wonder if these allergic reactions are ever reported back to a governing agency or the drug company here in the US whereby these incidents can be tracked??? I would have felt a lot better knowing that my severe allergic reaction would help others in the long-run steer clear of this drug for certain individuals.

Pain	jbIII, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/5/2009 7:56:26 PM	I have found this med to have less side effects than its stronger cousins. I inadvertently found when being treated for lower back muscle spasms but had a major sinus headache this med knocked out pain for both. One important thing is to take the med regularly as prescribed I have had headaches with higher level of pain (I waited too long) it sometimes does not bring it down alone. Along with some Advil 400 or 600 was how this was originally prescribed to me and that combo 95% does the trick. Its a cheap effective med, does take a doctor that understand you are not out to get addicted. Normally a script for 10 to 20 of these in the APAP 650 tabs takes care of me for 3 to 4 months. This may not be the cure all for those of you with chronic migraines but those of us somewhere in between this works for me, hope this helps someone.

I do not recommend it and I'll be trying something else very soon.
Pain	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	12/18/2008 1:34:17 AM	I have what I term as muscle spasms in left side of neck and left shoulders which are painful.  Pain has been increasing for approx. 2 months.  Surface areas of neck and shoulders on left side are numb.  Xray did not reveal any damages that I was made aware of.  This medication has had no effect on the pain I am experiencing.  I am only using this medication at night to, hopefully, ease the pain so that I can get to sleep.

It takes @ least an hour ( and sometimes up to two ) for the pain relief to begin. Since I was not getting the pain relief I expected, I took an additional dose. About 4 hours later I fainted @ a friends house and my skin was very cold and clammy.I expected this medication to be similar to Vicodin ( hydrocodone ) and it is not. Additionally, PLEASE do not take sedatives like Xanax as it increases the effects of the medication and can be fatal.
