Other	speace, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/25/2012 8:10:55 PM	I have severe pain starting at right wrist all the way to the shoulder and back.  I take 2 capulse a day (1 mg).  I have found that this is the only medication that works for me, I have tried all the way to 80 mg of oxycontin 4 times a day with little or no relief.  This drug works for pain like nothing I have ever takmen.  I have had 3 operation on my right wrist (which I am right handed) I have sever scar tissue that press on the carpul tunnel.  I have been notified since worker comp is not paying for this and I have been on it for 3 months.  Some side effect but they are worth it.  My lawyer is trying to get this taken care of, because I can not go back to feeling the way I did.  SP

It has helped with the nerve spasms a lot but is not too helpful for the osteo arthritis. The dosage which works best for me is a low dosage tablet taken three times through out the day.  Oddly the only side effect I noticed was nausea.

I started at 0.5mg, but just kept building a tolerance to it, so I ended up at 3mg, but I am now slowly coming off of it, 0.5mg at a time.  It worked very well, but I just don't want to keep increasing my dosage. The addictive properties scare me too much. So far so good for withdrawal symptoms.

Other	pam,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female		4/1/2009 1:02:37 AM	starting dose for pain, and hoping to find it more effective after increasing dosage.  Taken at night, helps to relax and sleep.  Dry mouth side affect is pretty bothersome.
Other	Mary, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	9/8/2008 7:17:52 AM	I had to stop using this drug for, pain relief, as it was interferring with memory and over all inability to concentrate.  This medication was Rx for relief of pain related to Dx's of arthritis and fibromyalgia. I had stopped this drug on my own and had problems with headache and nausea. Not a good idea to stop &quot;cold turkey&quot;
Other	maderd, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	8/1/2008 12:47:58 AM	I was prescribed cesamet .05 mg,I fibromylgia, arthtris, RLS, RA, IBS,etc...... Anyway I was prescribed this by my Pain Clinic Doctor. Plus she has also precribed Eslon (morphine).I emjoyed this med. I was able to feel calm for 2 to 4 hours, really relaxed. But now she has doubled the script and I had to stop the 1.mg I just was falling sleep any time, everywhere, it was just too hard to be functionable. I still felt good, but the sleeping part; not good, and driving was making me nervious. The dose of .5 mg, twice a day is just ok, I think that during day I would stick to .5 and the second dose could be the higher dose of 1 mg. Anyway being able to relax has been a big issue. I have been able to relax better, almost perfect for me. The pain is not right there, in my face, always in the back of my mind. It has for some days, been not in my face. Anything for some peace, relaxation, less PAIN, I actually laughed in those days. So for me it's a YES I like this drug. It's just a matter of finding the right dose, or she might just suggest something else to try. arghhhhh between the test &amp; trial of all kinds of meds for Fibro, RLS, not sleeping, and all the other issues affecting my life, right now. And I hate taking pills, ha, now I can swallow these by the handfuls.  arghhhhhhh. I really want body back.

Other	smallrage, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	45-54	2/9/2008 9:10:00 AM	I have been on .5mg and 1.0mg and it seems the more I took the more tired I because to a point where I was a zombie. After being on Methodone for 5 years the Montreal General hospital pain clinic abruptly because I wasn't getting any better so I because a bad statistic for the hospital because I wasn't getting better with any treatments they did for me. So if they don't have favorable results they lose funding, the exact same thing happen to a person I met at the clinic who was suffering from Crohns disease who they said was faking as did they with me because we were un-treatable. That said my family doctor did have a license to prescribe methodone which is why he didn't want me on this drug as he knew they would not let me continue for a long period of time on it and he would of been able to refill my prescription. After being forced to go cold turkey from 120mg to 0 my Dr put me on cesamet this has to be one of the worse drugs on the market I have take many to before getting to methodone but this has to be that worse next to ms contin. So if your Dr wants you on this stuff heed the warning don't go on it unless you like being a zombie your life because thats the felling you will have. As of now I am still on it my will even to come online isn't even there anymore as I don't have the energy to move. Where as 3 weeks ago I was out and about. Take methodone if you have tried everything but take it from me who has had just about every pain med possible
