Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	sedorse, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	9/1/2012 8:00:28 PM	My doctor prescribed the patch for my chronic pain in my back and I have now been on about 3 weeks.  First I was on the 50 Mg and then my doctor added the 25 Mg for more pain relief.  I use a waterproof tape called Hypafix to cover the patch that keeps it on with no problem.  Ive not had any side effects from the patch at all so I guess I can count myself very lucky.  
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	8/2/2012 1:03:38 PM	At one point I was on the 75 mcg/hr patch. It was causing extreme tiredness so I cut back to 50 mcg. After a time I was reduced to 25 mcg. Since I didn't feel it was working as well as I hoped I weaned myself off the medication completely. It's been 1 month since I stopped using it and I am glad to have this out of my system.

Started 12.5 mg every 72 hrs first month. Gave back my quality of life.  The first 3 days the patch caused nausea, lightheadness and got overheated and it made me sick and had diarrhea. After no major side effects.  Was increased to 25 mg. the second month and third month but I have had a return in my pain level so when I see my Pain MD this month will discuss higher dosage.  On Lortabs 7.5/500 mg 3 a day for breakthrough pain but after my pain has gotten worse I called pain MD and was increased to 4/5 a day as needed.  That helped until my visit.  No problem with the patches sticking but need to be careful when showering not to get hot water on them or they will release too much medicine at one time.  All in all pleased with it.

I am not sure if it now comes in a stronger patch, but I was being given the 100mg Patch. I gave it time for a build up, but it never worked, not even the slightest. For an unknown reason, I have an extreme tolerance to pain meds, as well as many other medications. This was a new doctor who specializes in chronic pain, he accused me of being a pain medication seeker. Last year, he was investigated for not treating a man with a broken neck and refusing to give him the meds suggested by his neurologist for proper pain treatment. He lost the case, there were so many who had complained, over 60 people joined in the suit. The doctor was ruled against and lost his license for not following the Hippocratic oath. During his own defense, he claimed everyone was a liar.

Any time between 12 to 36 hours (after application of the patch)is the most critical window to avoid driving a vehicle or making any serious decisions. Being a most fortunate patient, I've had NO ACCIDENTS or mishaps by being aware of this  information that my mind-body has given me. RULE #1-Pay attention to your yourself!

The nerve pain is terrible and I am allergic to Codeine. Although I am extremely sensitive to adhesives, I have found the Duragesic brand (only) to take some of the pain away. My pain treatment doctor will not prescribe over 50 mcg, nor anything for breakthrough pain. Tried the Spinal Cord Stimulator without success. Need a new doc, I suppose.

It has helped immensely along with other meds for pain management control: Carisoprodol, Norco and Xanax.  My neurologist is my pain management specialist and I see him every 6 months for management control. I have had tried all other conventional treatment plans (physical therapy), many, many different meds (such as lyrica, flexeril, prednisone, etc.).

This has relieved the pain so much better, but the first day it is applied I'm extremely tired/sleepy. So every 3 days I feel like I have wasted my day, by not being able to function properly. On th eplus side, I don't have to take as many Lortab for breakthrough pain. I was taking 6 per day, now I'm down to 1-3 per day. The brand of patch does affet the amount of time it stays adheared to yoyr skin. The sticky residue from the patch can be remnoved with oil based eye makeup remover! It is the best thing I have found for the sticky residue. When the patch falls off early I use Tegaderm to hold it in place until it's time to change patches. Both the patch and bandage adhesive leave hive like mrkings and they itch for days.

I'm very scared because I'm trying to do homeopathic as much as possible.  I have been taking Ultram for years (other pain) not working.  I told my Dr. I didn't want to take Vicodin, does not work just gives me stomache ache, so he perscribed 12 mcg/hr patch of Fentanyl.  I'm afraid of narcotics, has anyone had withdrawal from this.

My Drug store stated, &quot;We cannot get the brand, and there is no difference.&quot; How wrong they were. Generic is called, &quot;Fentanyl&quot; brand is called, &quot;Duragesic&quot;. My doctor wrote for brand, however I was given the Fentanyl patch. I could not move out of bed running a fever between 102.7 etc..The next appt. I told my doctor what occur. My dr. than wrote the rx. as Duragesic 50 mcg, brand medically necessary. I found out the generic release different amts. depending on your body temp. etc. When I switched over to &quot;Duragesic&quot; the realease was even. As for the patch staying on again it depends on the type. My doctor gave me the choice if needed to change every 48 hours. I have Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Sydrome. On the McGill Index Pain Scale the rating for pain is 42. It is the highest rating there is. If I could choose my Pain Medication I would prefer MsContin. However, the abuse of pain meds. is so rapid those of us who do have suffer go through hell surviving each day. I hope my input helps others.Linda Calhoun

Considering the dosing instructions of 1 every 3 days, I'm having to use one per day because it always comes off after my shower.  This gets expensive and difficult with my physician.

I USE A 50 MCG PATCH ALONG WITH OXYCODONE 10 MG PILLS. AS LONG AS I TAKE MY PILLS ON TIME, AND KEEP A PATCH ON MY SKIN, I DO ALRIGHT. IF I TAKE OFF A PATCH AND DO NOT IMMEDIATELY REPLACE IT WITHIN 2 - 2 1/2 HOURS, I AM IN SEVERE PAIN .  MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE PATCH NEVER STICKS FOR THE PROPER DURATION, AND IN WARM TO HOT WEATHER THE PATCH RELEASES ALL THE MEDS INTO MY SKIN ALMOST INSTANTLY !!! OVERALL I COULD NOT MAKE IT THRU DAY TOO DAY CHORES WITH OUT IT.

The biggest problems that I have came across are redness, itching and the 100 mcg, only lasts for about 40 hours,not up to 72 as the packet describes. Overall it is a good pain reliever  with little to no side effects.Another problem is finding a new location to put it on without having it seen, I am self conscios about that, and DO NOT EVER put a patch on your back and use a heating pad, found that out the hard way,lol,.

I have tried many different treatments and medications to ease the pain and unfortunately opioids are the only thing that adequately treats it (for the most part.) Before starting the fentanyl patch I was on OxyContin and I had started becoming less and less satisfied with it. Their were to many &quot;peaks and valleys&quot; that not only affected my level of pain, but my mood too. In addition to oxycontin I have also tried almost every other opioid and NONE of them measure up to the fentanyl patch. In my case I experienced much more pain relief and far fewer side effects. The only downside I would note is that only one of the manufacturers of the generic is even worth putting on your skin. It's Mylan, ask your pharmacist if that is what they have. the mylan patches are small, translucent, and adhere well. plus if you call or email them they will send adhesive overlays right to your home for free.

However, after 12 yrs, with the same Dr, he's now going to retire!  I live in central Jersey and I drive 2hrs (ea.way) to see my Dr. who resides in the Atlantic City area where I used to live.  My Dr. has no referral for me because he's not familiar with the area I now live. He told me to talk to my primary Dr. who I'm not fond of at all &amp; besides, he doesn't believe in prescribing pain medicines. The Dr.I see now for my pain mgmt.is a Neuro- logist but I know people see all different Dr's. for their pain treatments. If anyone could please advise or possibly refer a doctor to me, I would be soo grateful!  I can't imagine going back to being bed-ridden! I will check this site &amp; you can refer to me as DNJ.

I'm not moving quickly, but I'm able to move.  I prefer the Mylan patch, it's smaller &amp; seems to deliver the medicine more evenly than the others. My biggest complaint is the monthly trek to the MDs to get a new script.  Yesterday the pharmacy refused to fill it because the doctor had forgotten to write in the date.  So back to the MDs, wait for new script...there has to be an easier way to do this! (They mailed it for a few months until I got stuck without it over a holiday weekend, and I was in pain &amp; feeling sick by the time it finally arrived.)  
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	alffa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	35-44	1/4/2011 3:05:58 PM	The ease of use was great started at 25mcgm patch/72hrs...after one month increased to 50/mcgm to meet pain control requirement as initial side effects eased. they included vomiting extreme sleepiness weakness headache impaired judgment. It was increased to meet pain needs and the side effects slowed my breathing plus I am menopausal so hot flashes increased patch release and hot baths to soothe aches also affected; therefore, I was not able to stabalize the release of such to to fluctuating body temperatures. My speech became impaired and I began twitching and jerking movements while awake and asleep. friends and loved ones had to check my pulse often and measure my breaths per minute over 24 hrs to understand the above was taking place. If i was left alone I beleive i may have involuntary overdosed due to elevated body temps.. please be careful if you live alone You will not know you have overdosed until it is too late. fortunately I researched to the enth degree and asked those around me to watch over me carefully for such symptoms. Yes it relieved most of pain but being a vegetable and not being able to communicate without slurring is not a viable solution for pain relief. The withdrawal of such should be supervised and precautions taken. I suffered for 4 weeks extreme withdrawal even with medication to help . I for one am not a candidate for this med but those whom have had success you are so very lucky...

The only problem is the brand you get, they are not all the same.  The Mylan brand is by far the best.  It sticks good (if you follow instructions).  Have had problems with all other brands.  In high heat it does release more medicine and can cause an overdose.  I take 75mg and can function normally.  Doesn't cause stomach and constipation issues.

I received a phone call on 10-20-10 that he was found in our house and had passed on. I got his cause of death and it was an accidental overdose to the patch. I would not use this if my life counted on it. I lost the man that was my best friend, lover and soulmate to it and could not afford to lose anyone else to it.

I have tried all kinds of waterproof bandages to cover it so it won't get wet inside, but it still does.  I can tell before I change the patch that it is not effective after the first day due to it getting WET and becoming uneffective.  Liki I have mentioned I cannot seem to keep it dry no matter what I use thus the pain starts in again, until I am to change the patch.  They should give you instructions or even something that should come with the patch in order for it to stay dry while showering.  I wish I was never prescribed this medicine that has been nothing but a pain and I mean that litterally!!!!! I hate this patch!!!!!

Took quite some time for my doctor to find the right mix of medication and the end result was a 10 mg muscle relaxer 3x's daily, 50 mg tramadol 2x's daily, and 25 mcg of fentynal TD patches 1 every 72 hours. My only complaints are Tiva brand which neither work nor stay on so I informed the pharmacy I use that I will not take Tiva brand. I prefer Myland brand patches but these too have fallen off but then I sweat so I found a solution. Nexcare puts out a few products that are water proof one of which I buy which are called Tegaderm transparent dressings.Since Nexcare has many products for those interested who have tried everything else and still have difficulty with any brand of fentanyl TD patches sticking I highly recommend the Nexcare brand dressings. The picture on this particular item is of a foot on a bicycle pedal which will let you know this is the correct box. These are not cheap nd come 8 to a box but if you have issues with fentanyl patches falling off before getting 72 hours then they are worth it especially if you are paying cash for this medication like I am and fentanyl patches are very, very expensive and I have no health coverage.

We don`t know why I still have such severe knee pain but am still in the process of going from dr to dr to try to find out. It`s been 2 1\2 years and 3 surgeries so far. I have been on all kinds of heavy narcotics to try to ease the pain and none of them got rid of it enough to function properly. My dr has gradually worked up the fentenal dose from 25mg, 50mg and now 100mgs and finally I can say that I am pretty good.  Not perfect, but at least I can go for a walk with my dog and go shopping with my teenage daughter.  I feel like  mom and wife again instead of a whining blob on the couch. For those having a problem with them staying on... get some tegaderm film... it works great.

This med has helped with that with the side effects of feeling sick to stomach, headache, dizziness, depression. I do not know which is worse the side effects or the pain I have without them. I have to stop these if I can because I can't take being sick all the time.

My Dr. put me on these patches and within 24 hours, I finally had relief. My dose is 37.5mg / 72 hrs, this drug restored me to sanity. I have had no side effects at all. I will continue with it until my jaw is operated on and would definitely recommend it for severe, long lasting pain. I honestly don't know how I would have coped without it...just fantastic.

I was on Norcos (io/325), Gabapentin, Roboxis, Voltaren, as well as experimenting with Methadone and Suboxone purchased off street. I am also a recovering addict for over 25 years. I am now 40 and dont have desire to do drugs or drink anymore. That is until I went on pain managmnt. I now have been abusing my Norcos to a very dangerous level. Last week i had came clean with my doc and requested myself to be taken off Norcos only. I am constantly experiencing withdrawls that have put such a hold on my life that its simple rediculas. I still cheat and purchase low amount of Oxycodone and Hydrocodone from friends but its so inconsistant that i have withdrawls still. I have a 75 mcg/hr patch and applied it 1 1/2 hours ago. The withdrawls I normaly feel are definately worse than the physical pain I have on a constant basis. Can anyone please let me know if this patch will help with opiate withdrawls? I have been through alot due to pain and pain killers. At a total loss.

The doctor's said's I have the big Fibromyalgia most people don't think that is real but it is and hurts all the time.  This is the 2nd time I have tried this patch and both times they don't seem to work very well and they make me stay sick to my tummy.  I hate that feeling and it's all the time.  When I go back to my doctor I really hope he will change me to something else it's hard for me to take meds because it will cause my ulsar to act up and because of being on so much meds it has been hard to find things that work and if we do they stop after taking them 3 months. I went and got some Tegaderm Film to help them stay on if you have trouble with them staying on you need to get these they are made for these. May God Bless everyone that has pain!

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	cjn3, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3		45-54	9/29/2010 8:22:05 PM	I've been on opiads since Halloween 2006 when i fractured my L-3,4,5, and S-1. Until a month ago I had been on ocycodone, ocycontin, Cymbalta, Soma, and Cyclobenzaphrine. I was hospitalized twice for sever dehydration (due to the drugs trashing my stomach)and severe withdrawl symptoms as I was unable to keep any of the medications down. Since I&quot;ve been on the Fentanyl patch I have experienced none of those serious side affects and it has actually reduced the chronic mind numbing pain a bit, not a lot but enough to make the change to the patch. I am worried about the potential side affects and the fact that like it or not i am addicted. I'm not to the point of abusing my medications, I still take them because i need them NOT because I want them, but this is as many of you know, a vicious roller coaster that seems impossible to get off of. Thank you for your time!

I've had 4 back surgeries and have lots of hardware in my back which creates pressure and nerve pain on my SI joints. I was taking Lortab 7.5/500 mg 6 times a day along with 600 mg neurontin 3 times per day and flexeril 10 mg 3 times per day. In addition, I used Voltaren gel 4 times per day and Lidoderm patches at night. My pain mgt. doc says I can reduce the Lortab down to 4 per day to treat any breakthrough pain.I am appreciative of my doctor for listening to me when I let him know the above meds were no longer working very effectively for me. I would encourage other patients to make an appointment with their doctors and have an open and honest conversation with him/her about possible medication changes. The results could be a better quality of life, which I am beginning to experience!

Been on this drug / dose for about 14 mos. 50 mcg every three days. It's my lifesaver. The patch is the only thing that allows me to function so as not to have to file for disability. I am a quintuple bypass survivor; but this was prescribed for Degenerative Disk Disease in my neck and spine. The DDD cannot be corrected or treated; the disks are shot and the nerve pain is debilitating.Will probably move soon to patch every 2 days Don't try to use these without the Tegaderm overlay on the patch. Found that the patch does not work very well at all without the Tegaderm.

It has given me a very good quality of life. Without it, I would not be able to get out of bed. When used as prescribed with constant monitoring by your physician, i don't think it would be addictive. No one should have to be in constant pain when there are medications out there that can give one a good quality of life.

It took a while to get used to them and to figure out how to get them to stick! The only way I can keep them on, get them wet in the shower, etc. is to cover them with Tagaderm. It works great and never loses its adhesive, even in water, heat, sweat, etc. I started with 50mcg/hr and gradually moved up to 100 which has worked for quite a while. I definitely still have bad days, but my overall quality of life has improved 100%. Chronic pain is a cruel, punishing nightmare, but with the support of a great MD, it can get better.

I given the patch when I was hospitalized earlier this year, when the doctors took me off Norco for my chronic pain which I have on a daily basis beginning in January 1997.  I am 100% disabled because of several injuries to my body and have spent most of my days in bed in sever pain. Accompanied with severe depression because of my chronic pain. Since being on the patch 100mcg/hr. I have a quality of life I never thought possible and now enjoy riding my horses again, working from home and earning a living, spending time with my family and children, whom are now grown, from which I lost all those years of quality time with.  This medication has no euphoric affect which I LOVE and the only negative experience I have had is when a patch is defective and does not administer the required dosage, therefore I will spend the remaining hours or days in bed waiting until I can put on a new patch.  The company who makes my patch is working with me in their research and development department to better their product.  I have tried other brands and they are worse, i.e. not sticking to my body or not administering the medication into my system at all (I recommend the lower to mid-back or upper arms). Therefore, I use only Mylan Pharmaceuticals because they are the only Company who seemed to care about how their product works and have done something about it.

I was prescribed every narcotic pain medication there is and have gotten very little relief. My pain doctor finally is trying the 25 mg/hr FENTANYL 72 HR.transdermal system on me. Put the patch on monday PM it seemed to work great with no side effects like nausea and vomiting which occured with the MS CONTIN. And it is still sticking good on my skin. By wednesday AM the pain was back.after 32 HRS. I called my DR. and he said to change the Patch tonight at 9PM which would make it 48 HRS. I also have had a total proctocollectomy where the colon and the rectum was removed and now have a illeum which discharges into my Pouch. Since i only have my small intestines left to work for me, i just wonder if that is the reason for the fast absorbtion of the fentanyl ? Is there any one out there who has an Ileostomy and could offer advise or suggestion on this ? I would appreciate any help i can get !!! thank you and God bless.

If I do not have the patch I would have to use a walker or chair even in my apartment. I can walk better and move better because of it. I have tried all the other stuff, vicodine, methodone, all that jazz and they only helped some what. If I forget to change my patch after 72 hrs and then realize it and put another one on, I go into withdrawl symptoms. Like extreme pain, restless body and leg syndrome.I get muscle spasms just from lifting something easy sometimes that come outta nowhere. I too have a hard time keeping them on at times. The best place I have found is on your abdomen. Your Chonies (underwear)and your pants will help keep it on. The upper thigh works every now and then, but the abdomen works better for me. I tried the upper arm, and they just fell. I just know that if I didn't have these I would be extrememly miserable. People ask me what my pain is without the patch, I describe it as- Giving birth x 10 24/7 with muscle spasms that feel like your being stabbed 100 x. I hope I have helped someone.

Request Mylan brand as they are smaller than other brands.  Also, use Bandaid waterproof bandaids to cover the patch as they work well with any that do not stick.  A good place to stick them is on the upper thigh.

The patch is very effective at controling my every day pain and goes a long way of helping on my bad days.  I have found that the only way to keep it on for three days is to tape it on with cloth medical tape.  Be CAREFULL and have your doctor start on the low dose and work up, with my history we tried to start on a higher dose and I reacted badly to it.  I would suggest talking to your doctor about this to replace the daily pain pills.

Had back surgery on herniated disc due to wearing my flak jacket in Iraq. Had the surgery and the disc reherniated and scar tissue healed around it and the S-1 nerve. The patch helps but it is still hard to walk from the pain and I now use a wheelchair when my family goes shopping. Works well with Lyrica for nerve pain. Found an easy way to keep the patches on. USE A TEGADERM PATCH (a clear plastic bandage used to cover an area and keep water  off) USE THIS AND THE PATCH WILL DEFIANTLY STAY ON. Ask your doctor for some and I'm not sure if drug stores carry them but they will stay on with one.

My pain Dr. switched me from Oxycontin to the Fentanyl Transdermal patch. I have noticed a fairly good bump up in pain relief. I know oxycontin is supposed to last 12 hours but I was lucky to get 4 or 5 good hours from it. The Fentanyl feels as though it is maintaining a constant dose in my bloodstream which relieves me from some of those highly irritating highs and lows. I was on 40 mg of Oxycontin twice a day. My pain Dr. started me out on 25 mcg of Fentanyl and we have found that taking 75 mcg every 72 hours gives me fairly good results. I also take 2-10/325 Oxycodone pills for breakthrough pain with a maximum of 8 per day. I also take Norflex (orphenadrine citrate) 100 mgs twice daily and they seem to offer a little help. I realize everyone's situation is different but I hope I've helped someone out there. My best to all. On a side note, the patch can slip off sometimes so I use a surgi-op band aid from Walgreens to hold it in place. Works quite well.

I cannot believe how it has helped me! I used to just sit in the house, very depressed because I couldn't hardly walk. I was using a wheelchair because of the terrible pain. Now I can walk and get around so much better. I have a problem with mine falling off but other than that....they are great! I still have what's called &quot;break through pain&quot;, but it's nothing like what I have been going through for the last 5 years. I can live a much better life and have a better &quot;quality&quot; of life.

I also take Hydrocodone at 10/500 for spike pain which used to help but lately it hasn't. I am afraid that I will need to go to 75mcg/per hr next. I also change the patch every 48hrs. I feel a lot of the side effects due to my condition of R.S.D(Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy) as well as having 2.5 feet of my intestine removed from cancer back in 1993. Originally I was ran over by a car in 1998 and developed permanent nerve damage which leaves me in intense pain every second of the day. When the patch does work it's great but I seem to have the patch wear off about every 36hrs instead of 48hrs like it is supposed to, I also suffer from severe bowel pain due to my cancer in 1993 and all the scar tissue which I can't find a doctor to take care of which leaves me severely constipated which I am told can reduce the effect of the patch. I am in a catch 22 because I am allergic to most pain medicines and have to watch the constipation factor because of the aforementioned. If anyone knows how to make the patch be more efficient please let me know for I am going out of my mind with the pain and discomfort in my bowels. I have a 88yr old grandmother to care for as well as a 65yr old mother to help with loosing eyesight to her diabetes. I have no one else around and need to be alert and ready for them. Please if someone can help me please contact me through here or at thumpers1127 at yahoo. I thank you very much for your time, William

I have two slipped discs in my back, two herniated discs, bulges along my spine, disc protrusions at the base of my neck and pre-mature arthritis along my entire spine as a result of all the trauma. I am only 32 years old and arthritis doesn't run in my family. I too, have been on every narcotic known to man except OxyContin, as I refused to take that, and the Fentanyl patch does seem to work well for me. I am on 150mcg (two 75mcg patches at once) every 72 hours as well as MSIR (morphine sulfate immediate release) 60 mg, 3 times a day. The only problem I've found is that MY body seems to absorb the medicince in the patch faster so instead of getting 72 hours of relief, I get about 60. I spoke to my pharmacist and she reccomended talking to my doctor about applying 2 patches every 48 hours, instead of every 72 hours. As well, I've been using the Teva brand, with the foil backings and they do stick better than other brands, but do come off in the shower. I found a product made by Nexcare called Nexcare Active Waterproof Abrasion covers, made by 3M. You can find them at most Wal-Mart stores. I hope this helps some of you experiencing problems with your patches falling off. The covers are waterproof and breathable and my PCP said it was okay to use to cover the patches completely. Good luck everybody and I hope this helps someone.

I will never use it again here is why:  It really did not help that much even with the doctors having me put two of them on at one time (both was 75's).  It did help make my break thu pain meds feel stronger. but, the first time I got hot is the 85 degree spring wheather.  I passed out lucky someone found me in time and I was flown to the hospital I come to 18 days later on a ventlater and that is coming up on a year ago and I still can not breath good.  If a doctor told me this is the only drug he could give me to help with the problems I have I word ask NO and if that is all you can give me I will find a doctor that is a little smarter then you that can give me something different to help me be productive and not dead!  but,  it what happen to me!

The fibromyalgia I can finally cope with began in 1979 witha difficult labour &amp; delivery. For YEARS I was not taken seriously. I FINALLY found a physician who specializes in pain management. After trying less drastic measures he suggested fentanyl. I was up to 100 every 2-3 days but have been able to decrease to 75 now and coping pretty well with 2 or 3 Hydrocodone a day depending on whatever. It became very important to begin taking an anti-depressant as well. I STILL find it humiliating to have to deal with this. I sure don't like taking medications, but wshen I deal with my reality instead of my hopes, I feel better and can do more. When a person is in pain, it affects the entire community. Without fentanyl I'd be on disability hiding at home. Instead I work full-time at a middle school and love my work. Expectations and life-style has changed, but most days I can still walk my dog and hug my husband - I'm glad I'm alive.

I've read that some people have had bad results did'nt work for ,they were not as strong as the Sandoz brand. Sandoz STAY ON,unlike the Mylan. Ask your pharmacist if they can get the Sandoz brand.I think you will be happy with the results.

I have been on the 50 mcg patch for over a year now, I still take Loratab for breakthrough pain.  However, prior to this medican I was bed ridden for 2 and a half years, on lortab, soma, xanax and nubain injections and still in pain.  Once I change doctors, I was given this miracle patch and am now going to school full time and can function normally!  I do however have to change mine every 48 hrs.  Everybody is different and my body soaks it up quicker.  If not for this patch I feel I would never have made it out of bed and become a fully functioning member of society.  The only problem is it is somewhat diffcult to keep it from falling off.

I had brain surgery, which was supposed to alleviate the pain.  It did for about 2 weeks and now I am back to square 1. I've been on Morphine and every other pain med under the sun and NOTHING helps. I was prescribed the Fentanyl patch 25 mg about 1 1/2 weeks ago. I read all of the info the Pharmacy gave me, which I normally don't do. I was home when I put the patch on, unloading groceries and within 20 minutes I was on the ground in my front yard having a seizure! Thankfully some wonderful people stopped to help me &amp; call 911. I was alone with my 9 yr old. I've never been so scared ! When I came to, the only thing I remembered was my daughter!  I had no idea who I was, where I was, nothing!  It was a frightening experience and I hope anyone who is new to this patch will PLEASE use with caution!

Prio to this I experienced severe dibilitating pain radiating down my right arm and leg following 6 attempts at a spinal anaesthesia for emergency caesarean section at 34 weeks gestation. I was given the diagnosis of CHRONIC REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME. I was so severely dibilitated that i was unable to work or have anything approaching normal activities of daily living. The pain was sudden and intense. Whilst I really hate the side effects of the drug, i now work 18 hours per week and am able to manage due to carers, and work place amendments. Whilst my life changed forever in2004 I feel extremely lucky to be alive( I was really quite depressed at one stage) I made the decision to live my life to the full and look at it as one would look at an enemy. I thought there were two ways I could go.1. To retire to my bed and lie there feeling sorry for myself.2. Get on with life.I choose number 2. Its only pain I constantly tell myself you can and will deal with it. When I want to cut my arm and leg off without the aid of anaesthetic because it is soooo painful, I often rue that comment. I have one life. Two beautiful children and an extremely supportive husband. I know that by the tie I die I will have been in pain longer than without, I owe it to them to keep my smile on my face and get on with each day.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	SelaClein, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	10/27/2009 6:17:06 PM	After becoming disabled due to severe fibromyalgia pain and multiple weekly flareups, I have tried a number of different medications, including the use of time-release morphine tablets for over a year (up to 200mg daily!). Between the trigger point injections and this beautiful little miracle patch I am able to wash dishes and do my own laundry again as well as play with my seven year old son, which I could not do before. I still take 7.5/500 vicodin tabs for breakthrough but we have finally hit on a winning combination. My husband has a wife again after over two years (married 1-1/2 yrs but together for 5), my son has a mother again, and I have me again which is a wonderful feeling! I still have &quot;fibro-fog&quot; symptoms but I can work through the brain fog now, where I couldn't while taking so much morphine and vicodin every day. I hope more people whose lives have been effected by fibromyalgia or other unresponsive chronic pain treatments are able to find relief with this medication. It isn't a perfect fix, but honestly there are none with chronic pain. I'll take a dull ache daily as opposed to a pain that keeps me in bed all day any day of the week. Please, if you are suffering as I did, talk to your doctor about fentanyl patches! They are a little pricey but having my life back is worth every penny. It took me a long time to ask because I didn't want to be seen as having drug seeking behavior (I hate taking meds!) but my husband went with me and started the conversation and I am so glad he did. Thank the gods for modern medicine! Better life through chemistry perhaps?

I thought I was going to permanently go crazy because of the ammount of oxycontin i was taking, but the development of tolerance was inevitable. I suffer from lower back pain, 2 lumbar fusions, awaiting a third. The mental side affects of this med compared to oxycontin/oxycodone are so much more tolerable. I feel like &quot;me&quot; again, which is a INDESCRIBABLE Feeling after being on oxycontin 4 soooo long. i do have problems with the patch sticking but am new to this med so still have a few options to fix that. So to anyone dealing with chronin pain, I soooooooo hope u read this and it helps:)

I've had procedures, injections, medications &amp; so on to try and help with my problem. The patch has worked better than anything to keep my pain at bay. I wear 2-100mcg patches at a time. I can now function so much more and not be in so much pain.I do not have the side effects like I did with the meds. either. I have had trouble keeping the patches on too. It was very frustrating until I found Tegaderm Transparent Dressings made by 3M. I knew there had to be something that would help because I have had the clear dressings over my IVs before. If you can't find them, ask your doctor about a RX for them. I use the size 2 3/8 X 2 3/4(6cm X 7cm). This size covers the entire patch with extra on all 4 sides. I hope this helps the ones who are having the problem with patches not sticking!        P.S. I hope to soon be able to start cutting back on the strength of my patches. God bless each and every one of you who are suffering from chronic back pain.

Had withdrawl symptoms and couldn't get out of bed because of it.  Insurance won't cover Kadian even after having my Dr. wrote special letters to insurance. I think alot of us feel frustated. I pay a a BIG premium and then a $2,600.00 deductable to boot. The insurance is still horrible. Like how am I supposed to meet a deductable if they won't apply the cost of my medicine towards my deductable. If this helps anyone though.There is a tape available called Tegaderm. It's expensive at CVS but found it at a Medical Supply store for less..$2.00 for a square that I cut in 1/2 and use to cover 2 patches. It's just nice to not be in pain. Seems to work pretty good so far.

Now I'm up to 200mcg with dilaudid 2mgs as needed for the spikes I am very satisfied with the medications. I do have a question though I hope some one could help me with, that's I have a problem with them staying on. We have a swimming pool and I have not found any good soloutions yet any help would be greatly appriciated.

But since my insurance (Humana) isn't wanting to pay for the Opana, I'm on the fentanyl patches (with Oxy I.R. 30mgs 4x's a day) and the ONLY way I can get the patches to stick is the 'Teva' brand - it has a foil backing on it &amp; the adhesive is VERY good with sticking! I told my PM doc. about the patches not sticking &amp; he told me to try a new body wash/soap, blot dry *not towel dry* the area, but nothing seemed to help &amp; I ran across the 'Teva' brand patches &amp; they are the BEST so far! So for those of you who can't get your patches to stick, my advice to you is to ask for 'Teva' brand &amp; try those, they WILL work! And if they don't, 3M makes a tape that is tan colored &amp; water proof, it works good with the patches (especially the ones that didn't want to stick too good) - I found the tape at a Rite-Aid Pharmacy in my area. Hope this helps someone out there!

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	nameless,  Male  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male		9/10/2009 12:15:50 PM	i used 25mg patch for a year. for proarich arthritis in numerous joints, upper back &amp; both knees (11 orthopedic surgeries 15 yrs ago)   hopping to reduce hydrocodone use 4 to 8 pills 24hr period. pain clinic dr increased patch to 50mg every 48hrs. this medicen keeps me awake. slowly started to have stomach cramps right side. from the belly button all  the way to testicles. pain would increase first 6 -12 hr period and gradually diminish 30 - 36 hrs. only beneficial is that i use 4 -6  hydrocodone 24hr period. however patch does not take the pain away. hydrocodone does. because of sleeplessness and stomach pain i stop using the patch. controlling the withdraw symptoms i've taken 2 hydrocodone every 10 - 12 hrs and plenty of rest and liquids and yogurt.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	70351, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	8/23/2009 4:09:10 AM	I was prescribed Fentanyl 25ug nearly a year ago. A month later I went to the 50 microgram patches every 72 hours. Since I had never heard of Fentanyl, prior to taking it, I had no idea what to expect. I have to say this medication has worked very well for me (neck pain 24/7 before and after surgery).I first started on Hydrocodone many years ago. Two years ago I was prescribed Oxycodone (10/325's) every 8 hours. Although this worked at first, it didn't take long before it just wasn't enough and I was taking more and more Oxycodone (more than I should have really).Once my doctor put me on Fentanyl things were much better in life. Although I still have some pain, it's nothing compared to what it was. I can now sleep wonderfully day or night and have really meaningful time with my family now. Both my wife and son remarked how much better I looked and how my attitude was so much better about life in general once I started taking Fentanyl.I still have to take Oxycodone in between but I no longer use as much as I once did, and I feel so much better now that I don't feel doped up all the time (or going through withdrawals in between doses). I have benefitted greatly from this medication as have my family because they now have the husband and father they always needed but never really had because my quality of life was so up and down in the past due to using pills only.I wish I didn't have to take any medication, however I'm glad to have what I do now and that I feel so much better than I did in years past. I, for one, can say I am very grateful for this medication, and my family will say the same on my behalf.However, I can't overstate enough that you must take it strictly according to your doctor's instructions. It could be easy to abuse this medication but if you take it precisely as prescribed your pain level will decrease to a point where you can live life comfortably (within reason). It will likely take a few months to properly adjust your dose.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	bbqcity (Patient) 	4	4	4			8/12/2009 8:10:30 PM	After taking a variety of pain medications over a 10 year period, ranging from asprin to Oxi's, I found the &quot;pain patch&quot; to be an enormous help. While not 100% pain free, I am more able to cope with and, now manage my pain. 6+ month user, no major side effects what so ever! These patches no more kill people, than guns kill people. Uncontrollable additions, those who fail to heed the numerous warnings and those who purchase the drug illegaly are the things that will leed to one's death. I RECOMMEND the Duragesic Fentenyl Patch!

I get about a day's worth of relief out of it. I also have to take Percocet for &quot;break-through&quot; pain. I have a degenerative disc disease and a protruding disc as well, i also suffer from a neurological nerve disease (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2). I don't know what will be next. The dr says i am not a candidate for surgery. If anyone has any suggestions as to how to keep this patch adhered i would love to hear it. I even wear an overlay and it still pops up away from the skin. So i guess my question would be how am i to get any real relief if it is not sticking to the skin? the dr's look at me as if i am crazy, b/c i have reported this to them. I have tried just about every area of the body that i can think of. Please help?

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	45-54	7/30/2009 7:10:44 PM	Some brands work better than others.  I use Mylan brand, a generic.  The patch is much smaller and the glue does not irritate the skin like others.  However, the rate of distribution varies, I think usually due to environmental conditions, such as excessive heat.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	KATEY, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/28/2009 3:53:29 PM	I was a nurse,herniated 2 discs lifting a patient.Had 3 spinal fusions with lots of hardware. First was Oxy but couldn't really control the pain but have been on &quot;Mylan&quot; brand for a couple of years now. Can't tolerate the gel brands, broke my skin out terribly. I sweat alot and gel brands fell off.  I cover with clear dressing if swimming etc. This patch has helped me considerably. I do take Vicodin for breakthrough pain, but not as often. I do put a new patch on after 48 hours or else I feel the effects of it wearing off. I leave the first patch on for an additional 12-18 hours before removing because it is already wearing off. Only side effects are some sleepiness, constipation. But otherwise wouldn't know what to do without it. I do have to pay for it because of Workman's Comp and I pay about $650.00 per month. My pain specialist has been great by helping me find the right combination and type of drug. Have had the side effects of withdrawl when admitted to the hospital for non back issues and ER doc forgot to order my &quot;VERY&quot; longstanding dependence on this medication. Threatened to leave against medical advise if they didn't order my Fentanyl Patch.  Finally got the order after 2 days. I don't want to ever go through that again. I even had a Spinal Cord stimulator put in.  Very bad side effects from the placement.  I'm very happy with the patch.  Sorry for the long reply.  Hope this helps someone.

I have been on many long term opiods and I found that the patch is easy due to not having to remember doses, etc.  I did have the duragesic patch at the time and it wouldnt stay put.  I did feel that I had to put a patch on before day 3, because by then, the meds seemed to have peaked.  I have a question for those of you who have tried long term opiods for long periods of time.  Does anyone keep getting rashes on the trunk of your body?  I am now on Opana ER with Percocet for breakthrough.  I do not like all the pills and worry about addiction. Opana makes me extremely nauseaus to the point of having to take an ANTI nausea pill to overcome the reaction. My Dr. suggested methadone, to which I freaked out. I have a problem with feeling like I am never going to find the right combo and then my tolerance is going to go up constantly.  Does anyone have anything else that they really like, but doesnt cause too many side effects? Oxycontin is out. Severe allergic reaction. My doctors hands are tied and I am out of patience.  I am staring my 5th surgery in about 3 weeks (massage therapist dislocated the prosthesis).  I would really like some indepth help on long term opiods and subsequent side effects.  With my Opana ER I also take 20 mg of percocet for breakthrough.  Average about 4x per day. THANK YOU TO ANYONE WHO HAS HAD PROBLEMS LIKE MYSELF, AS I HAVE BEEN ON LONG TERM OPIODS SINCE MY FIRST SURGERY IN 2004.   THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!!!!

However, the parts of your life the pain has not altered may eventually be affected by the fatigue, lethargy, and other side effects associated with the medication.My frustration with the quality of life while using Fentanyl 100mcg TD patches every 48 hours eventually made me desperate to not feel dependent on the drug.I went to a pain management practice that offered alternatives to my dependence on this narcotic. Withdrawing equalled what I imagine a heroin addict's cold turkey must feel like. I was so ill, it distracted me from the ever present back and shoulder pain. I took epidurals to the spine. This worked nicely as long as I did little physically.Exertion and even sitting created such discomfort, I could not sleep through the night. I began to take 10mg Ambien to sleep through the pain.I kept a box of 100mcg Fentynal patches for an emergency. Christmas Eve 2008 I returned from worship with severe pain from all of the holiday activity and after sitting in the hard, wooden church pews I was in real discomfort.I excused myself from a family function, drove home, and applied a patch. I took an Ambien, determined to sleep and not be miserable Christmas Day. I put my 11 year old son's new snowboard under the tree, lit a fire, and retired.I did not awake. The patch had leaked. The narcotic was delivered in a volume that was deadly. When combined with the Ambien, I was very close to death when my wife noticed the green foam on my mouth and my lifeless body.The 911 call dispatched a great crew that got me to hospital care in time to avoid brain damage. I came out of it after amazing care at 8pm Christmas evening. In two weeks I was better.I tell this story so I can save some family the anguish my family endured. I made the decision to use the narcotic without consulting my doctor. This dumb choice almost killed me.I still have the chronic pain. I still have my life. Be careful, please.
Other	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/14/2009 6:11:42 PM	I have been on the patchs for 2 years. I am very happy with them after trying many other pain medications by mouth. I have gained weight on it, and the sight locatins get red and sore. I have to change location every 2.5 days and it takes about a week for each area to heal after. When it starts to wear off it is terrible so i always make sure that i have extra at home so i can not run out. I get sweats, dizzness, horrible tummy aches if i do not change it exactly on time. Some times I have to change it early because the site is so inflamed that it is almost bleeding. All in all it have worked very well for me.  I take a break through medication Hydromorphone as well a few times a day.  I have been very satisfied with the patchs considering the other options that I have had. They work well for the pain relief but I have also had to increase once. They stick well if you wash the area well with soap before adhering them and then hold your hand over them to the count of n30 for the heat from your hand to help them adhere. This has worked very well for me as a tip.

I have DDD, radiculopathy, and severe siatic pain from my injury.  I have found the patches to be the only thing that has helped to alleviate my pain, although I have built up a tollerance to them over the years.  I am now on 150 mcg every 24 hrs, (a 100 and a 50 mcg patch combined), as well as JUST put on a Fentanyl lollipop for break-thru pain, so I can function somewhat normally.  Did anyone even know that medicine came in a lollipop?  I didn't until a few days ago!  And, WOW!  It really helps the pain FAST!!!  It absorbs thru the mucous membranes in the mouth, which is a very fast delivery system, especially when the pain is crippling.  Might want to ask your Dr's about it, guys!  It REALLY HELPS!  Good luck, everyone!  :)

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	copesee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/29/2009 1:18:46 PM	The patch tends to loose its effectiveness by the 3rd day.Considering I've been on 25mg since March of 2008, I'm not surprised they are not working as they did when I first starting using them as my body is probably tolerate of 25mg and may need the next higher dose which I'm trying to avoid.Prefer the patches manufactured by Mylan which is a generic. Was given patches manufactured by TIVA and had nothing but problems with patches falling off and not controlling the pain prompting me to contact the manufacturer for a partial reimbursement and fighting with the pharmacy over getting the preferred manufacturer since I'm paying cash. One downfall is those not having insurance these patches are expensive. I enrolled in RX Access and the cost of 25 mg patches for 10 is $ 128.20 for generic patches manufactured by Mylan. I've read a previous post that someone is paying close to $700.00 for 10 patches. Ouch! Costs of the drug probably varies depending on the brand, region you reside in, strength and pharmacy. I would suggest those without insurance look into the drug manufacturers whose brand they are using to see if they offer assistance to non-insured individuals or as I did apply for a discount prescription card which does not cost anything but you do get a discount on most prescription drugs.

Keeps chronic pain at bay very well, w/Norco (hi-dose vicodin) taking care of breakthru pain where spine is fusing in neck &amp; lower back when working. Patch effectiveness seems to decline around the 48-60 hr. point, so I add the next one the last 12 hrs before removing the previous one.  Went without it for a couple wks when changing Dr's-didn't have horrible withdrawal, but all joints started screaming at once (even elbows and ankles) after about 24 hrs without a patch on. The Norco took the edge off, if I took it every 4 hrs, but the patch just keeps the pain relief much more even and constant.  The Norco is more for acute pain or breakthru pain in specific areas (&quot;as needed&quot;). But for those worried about going off the patch, they will probably wean you down with hydromorphone (synth.morphine) couple of mg tabs probably every 6-8 hrs. Since the relief is very even and more predictable with the Fentanyl patches, you can feel pain and mood &quot;spikes&quot; when taking pills every few hours. I feel as though the Fentanyl keeps me on an even keel painwise, and doesn't make me feel high.  Hope this helps somebody out there...

I have been on this drug for two days and I am very satisfied with it. It actually works.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	Erna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/22/2009 8:50:25 PM	I am 25 years old and have been suffering from auto immune peripheral neuropathy for almost 2 years now. The pain became so severe that laying down or sleeping became almost impossible. The doctors never seemed to take me seriously on how bad my pain was most likely because of the fact I'm so young. They pumped me full of neurontin, lyrica, hydrocodone and oxycodone. None of the medications worked and I felt so hopeless that I would ever find any relief. I finally became so sick and toxic from being pumped full of so many meds that I tried a new Dr. that prescribed me 50 mcg of fentanyl. For the first time in over a year I have had all day and night relief and can finally sleep again. I do feel tired a lot and sometimes sleep a lot but I'm not in pain anymore so I can deal with it. My legs have felt a little itchy but I don't know if it is from the patch or not. I also feel hot most of the time as well. I will also recommend to people dealing with severe pain to try acupuncture. I started getting it done a month ago and have noticed wonderful results as well. It's a slow process though so you have to be patient with it. Overall, I would recommend this drug to those with very severe pain.

Was on morpine then dr. wanted to put me on morphine pump I said NO. I use 2 fentanyl patchs 1 is 100 mcg 1 is 50 mcg. also 4 times day take oxycodone5/325 and2 times flexoril 0.5 , I took me 20 years to get the right combination and now I am free of most of the pain.  I have had no bad side effects from any of these meds.

At first there were problems with the the brand name (Duragesic) patches falling off. Since changing to the generic brand Mylan I have had little problems.I am taking this medication for spinal problems and it has been effective in dulling the pain enough to make it tolerable. My Doctor has had to increase the dosage through the years from 50 mcg patch to the 100 mcg and I fear that soon the dosage will need to increase again.I have had to deal with this drugs side effects on a minor bases except for severe sweating. the frustration of sweating does not outway the benefit that I get from using this drug.If you are just starting to use the patch and are having problems with them falling off, I have found a few things that may help. The first one is find a spot where your skin does have a lot of movement. I use the upper back and chest area about an 1&quot; to 1.5&quot; below the collarbone. Before applying the patch make sure the area is clean by using 91% isopropyl alcohol. By doing this I have had very few times where the patch has lost it's adhesion.

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	5/11/2009 4:46:00 PM	I have been dealing with physical pain most of my adult life.The cause of this pain is in part to Schurrmann&quot;s Kyphosis and moderate scoliosis.I learned this two years ago.(MRI confirmed both conditions.)I have been given almost any narcotic one can think of ,Avenza,Morphine,Oxycontin,Hydrocodone,Oxycodone. .I think we all know the drill.... After taking this and trying that we (the Dr. and I)have found doable plan.One month it works like this,90 eighty mg.Oxyconton with 120 Percocet 10/325.. And the next month fifthteen 100mcg.Duragesic with 120 Lortab 10.500. This &quot;plan&quot; is called Narcotic Rotation,and &quot;we&quot; do it this way,so that my system does not become too used any one product.There are a lot of real horror stories here, I hope and pray that everyone (including myself)can eventually get away from this &quot;stuff&quot; and get on to better lives without all of this medication.For me surgery is'nt a real option,it can be done but the benifecial results are far far less than the harmful risks. So for now I'll keep on doing what I am doing.maybe later something can be done.GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU!!!
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	Danny, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	25-34	5/1/2009 11:22:11 PM	I'm a young 29 yr. old mother of 2. Around Nov. 08 I noticed occasionally a sharp pain in my toe similar to a thorn. I had no injury by Jan. 09 My toe had turned purple and after antiobiotics and testing it has still spread to my other foot and I have severe throbbing and sharp shooting pains in my les and shoulders. The Dr. first prescribed Channel Blockers with Hydrcodone and after several more specialists they have still not been able to diagnose the problem. I have been in pain for about 5 months and I'm very tired and stressed and worried about the effects of the medicine but can not cope with the pain without. My Dr. has just recently prescribed the patch and I was so upset that he had increased my dose along with prescribing 6 other medications, some known to interact when taken with this patch. I feel as I have no say in the matter and am so tired of the Dr.'s not listening and wanting to write prescriptions. I have been very sick wearing this patch. It has helped with the pain but I wake up sick and vomiting, break out with terrible sweats, feel like I'm going to pass out and can not concentrate or focus on the very busy life I live. I'm not going to let this get the best of me. Does anyone know of a medication used to treat sharp pains and throbbing in the arms and legs, without the harmful side effects of narcotics? Some of the bad symptoms have worn off but I feel like Dr. want to keep increasing medication to boost their paycheck and don't care that you don't have a choice when you are in pain, I feel as you are at their mercy!
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	msbabyblake, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/29/2009 4:00:42 PM	After my 38 major surgery at the tender age of 45, I had been On pain managment for approx 15 years. Given everything you can think of and then some. But my surgeon after the last surgery put me on 100mcg of fentanyl after a few weeks he up it to 150 every 72 hours. I was maintain and great. I had a script for norco for break through when I was getting  work done on my teeth. The original Fentanyl patchs are huge sound like your wear a diaper and fall off. If you switch to the genric Mylan brand there half the size and will stay on till you peel it off. I take long baths every day, go swimming with it. But if you plan on going into a jacuzzi, or the sun make sure you put the patch in a area where it wont heat up. Otherwise it will dispense more medication then normal and make you loopy. We recently where transfered to Washington state where I had to find a new pain  clinic, and every time you get switch the new doctors always wants to try his cocktail on you. Even though I asked to be left on what I was normaly taking he would not listen! He wanted put me to on methadone telling me it was a better drug so after seeing him for 7 weeks every week, y final dose was 80 millagrams per day, and six perscet for break through?Not only was it the worse idea  he could have made. I know have to have a 39th surgery for another bowl obstruction. So he puts me back on Fentanyl YEAH but in the other hand gives me a medication for muscle pain because he lower my dose from 150 to 100 . But that medication comes with abdominal pain, nusea, vomiting. He must have forgot they removed most all my stomach two years ago, and the methadone was causing me to throw up and lose 15 lbs in the short 6 weeks I was on it. If you are on fentanyl it is great for chronic pain it is better then having to take pills and it works. I tell you one thing before I let another doctor have a great I idea I will listen to my body it knows best and fentanyl is my mircle!

She is diabetic and was given to her for kidney stones. This was given for pain when she needs it. However she now has sezures, and I am wondering if the patch needs to go. Her sezures are not electrical. I feel the long use of the patch may be causing her sezures. She has had no kidney stones for almost a year, but she still wears the patch. It scares me. I think she is killing herself with this medication.

Getting the patches to stay on for the full 72 hours is a real pain though. Load up on the medical tape or the duct tape. After the second day the sticky wears off.

It is addictive. I decided to quit using this drug after reading how addictive it is, seeing news articles on TV. Newspaper articals. I knew I was addicted because I would go into what I thought was withdrawl after 2 days. It was prescribed for 75 mcg every 72 hours. I had started abusing this drug and was concerned. I made a bad mistake by not telling my doctor I was going to cold turkey it. (just quit without reducing the amount. I was VERY sick for 1 week. I told my doctor that I wanted off this drug due to addictive nature of the drug. When he found out I went cold turkey he was mad. To address the pain I now use Ultram. It does not completely stop the pain but it has become manageable. PLEASE PLEASE be careful when using this drug. Know that it will be addictive before you start and then make your decision. 
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	redneckdivabham, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/16/2009 3:43:32 PM	I have a 20 year old knee injury that was causing unbearable pain. When I first went to pain management almost 4 years ago I was taking Lortab &amp; Methadone. After that became ineffective my Dr. prescribed the 75mci patch every other day and up to 5 30mg Roxycodone daily for the breakthrough pain. One brand of the patch was large and I could not make it stay stuck for love nor money. I would literally have to wrap tape around &amp; around whatever body part it was applied to. That was a mess and taking it off was very painful. I did get one made by Watson that is alot smaller and works alot better. I still have to use a clear adhesive patch called Tegaderm to cover the medicated patch, but with that in place I can shower, sweat or swim and they don't come off and there is not alot of adhesive residue after removal. Some days are better than others, but I could not function without this combination of medication. This Watson patch is probably 2 X 3 inches and actually has &quot;Fentanyl&quot; on the patch. I make sure that these are the patches I get. I think they are a generic brand, but they work the best for me. You can buy the &quot;Tegaderm&quot; patches at CVS and probably most other drug stores. I am very lucky that this is workman's comp because with the Naprelan for arthiritis and Ambien CR that I take so I can sleep the total cost of this is over $1000.00 a month. I apply my patch to the outside of my upper arm between my elbow &amp; shoulder. This area isn't usually constricted by clothing or making regular contact with anything the might loosen my patch. I have not as yet had any negative effects with this patch other than constipation, but ALL of the meds I take can cause that and I am sure the combination of all of them doesn't help that any. Alot of people think it is a stop smoking patch. That's OK because whoever said earlier that people think you are a &quot;druggie&quot; because you HAVE to take these meds is right. I wish I could go a whole day without them &amp; still be able to function.

I haven't put on a patch yet and reading reviews is very helpful. I have arthritis everywhere and a pinched nerve in my lower back and this is where the extreme pain comes from.  I also am on coumadin because of a blood disorder so conventional methods of treating are not an option. The pain is excrutiating at best and pills are just not working so Dr prescribed the patch.  I'll send in a review once I start applying the patch. thank you.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	mommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	3/9/2009 2:06:40 PM	I am only 28 years old. I have some very serious medical conditions that leave me in alot of pain all of the time. Where i live, because of my age i have a hard fight just to get someone to hear me and understand what i was going through. After finally finding a doctor whom would listen and run the correct test i was put on Morphine, Hydrocodone, Methadone, Oxycotten, and Dilaten. Although these can be helpful, it just was not enough. I was adverageing a hear rate of 160 all of the time, this is with heart meds, blood pressure, and benzo dialitors. After being put on the patches, not only has it helped my pain better that anything i have ever tried, but it has helped with my blood pressure and heart rate. Under estimating what chronic pain does to the body can be fatal!!  I am grateful everyday to have the patches. I use them to the letter of how they are suppose to be used and i am aware of what not to do with them. They have given me the chance to throw ball with my kids for the first time in almost two years. To not have to do anything for 72 hours, and sleep through the night (not waking up in pain, waiting on something to help) has been a god send!!!

I am under the care of a doctor outside of my home state and this doctor did not follow through with enough patches for me.  My body went into extreme withdraw within 17 hours of the patch being removed.  I have NEVER encountered such misery. I also didn't know that this patch 25mcg, is 80 times stronger then morphine. I agree with the ease of use, not up and down and yes it relieves the pain but you must make sure you have plenty on hand.  The detox/withdraw from this scared me to death.  I thought I was going to go into cardiac arrest.  I collapsed at the hospital and was released with a patch to control my heart and an anti anxiety drug.  Time to remember how much pain I am in because I am unable to take anything for the pain until I can make it through this withdraw period of 5 days but could be longer to get my body back to a pre-fentanyl condition.  Just be careful.

Started on the Mylan generic brand at 50mg every 3 days then went up to the 75mg very soon after. At first they worked great and I was able to go on with my life then started having problems with them lasting the 3 days so went to 48 hrs. Eventually it wouldn't even last the 48 hrs so went my doctor he sent me to Seattle to see a real doctor and she found the source of my pain and can very easily fix it. So now trying to get off the patch. The first thing she did was put me on the name brand patch from Johnson &amp; Johnson 75mg. Just that step had me experiencing withdrawls. This lasted about 4 days then started getting better then she asked me to make the patch last 72 hrs. On the third day I could hardly move, breath, sweating, everything went right through me and just very weak. I changed the patch that night and woke up still feeling weak and stomach cramping. 2nd day and still feel sick. I can tell this is going to be a long road but does anyone know how to beat this drug or any prescriptions that will help you along the way? Please for those thinking about this drug for treatment it is very dangerous and addictive! If anyone read this whole thing thank you and please anything will help!

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	jthomas40@msn.com, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/15/2009 3:36:52 AM	I have been using name brand patches for about 3 years with great success in controlling pain from 3 spinal operations.  Started out using the Johnson &amp; Johnson (name brand) system at the 50 mcg/h delivery system size. Had to be upgraded to the 100 mcg/h (1 each 48 hours) pouch because of my tolerance level increasing. When I was forced to use the generic version by my overpriced insurance company, I had issues with the efficacy of each brand in controlling my constant and persistent pain.  And we all know the looks we get when we inform the Doctors that a generic version is NOT as effective as the name brand. Finally I used the &quot;Sandoz&quot; brand with adequate results but, by a noticeable amount, NOT up to the level of the Johnson &amp; Johnson brand. So here is my issue: &quot;Sandoz&quot; is the only generic brand that utilizes the jell pouch delivery method. Almost immediately I noticed that at the end of my patch cycle with the &quot;Sandoz&quot; the amount of jell inside the unit is seemingly equal to (or so it seems to the naked eye) the amount when I first applied. So I then ate one the cost of 1 box (WOW!!) of the J&amp;J name brand delivery method. At the end of the 48 hour cycle the amount of jell contained in that J&amp;J pouch was clearly less then when I first applied it. Dilemma; am I to assume that the absorption into my body is better achieved through the name brand Johnson &amp; Johnson system versus the generic &quot;Sandoz&quot; delivery method?  Could someone help me? Has anyone noticed the performance difference between the two?  Does the amount of jell remaining have any influence on performance? Because of this issue I now experience need for additional &quot;break thru&quot; medication (which we all know brings up additional issues altogether) and will soon have the necessity to increase to the 125 mcg/h every 48 hours dosage.  Well if anyone does read this lengthy note, please allow me to thank you for spending the time necessary to hear me whine a little.

I have very sensitive skin and I sweat excessively.  I have found that using a pumice block in the shower to clean the area where I will be applying the patch and then applying the patch after the shower and covering the patch with 2 3M Tegaderm transparent dressings size 6cmx7cm, will keep the patch on the full 72 hours and there will be no adhesive residue.  Tegaderm patches can be found on ebay for relatively low prices.  I have had no skin reaction to the tegaderm.  The fentanyl has worked okay for me but my tolerance increases very quickly and I am back in pain shortly after increasing dosage.

I am going in for a 10th in a couple months. I had a spinal fusion of the SI,L4 AND L5 in 2001. Since I have had a spinal cord stimulator implanted with a paddle lead. It has broken several times since and was told that this was the last time iy could be repaired! Doc has put me on the patch (1 / 100 and 1/75 but this barely covers the pain. I also take 5 methadone (10mg) a day plus 5 / 50 mg Tramadol. I'm still in some serious pain every day!!! Its almost to the unbearable point. As far as the patches go I use the clear perferated tape to keep them in place and this works fine so far! Other than that my Doc is going to have to find something better for the breakthrough pain as I can no longer live this way!!! The patches have helped a lot but have been on narcotics so long that nothing seems to work any longer! Am going this week to talk to my Doc to see if he has any other solutions for the time being? I hope so as I've had some really bad thoughts going through my head lately! This drug works extremly well but once you become tolerant it is no longer helpful to me! ThanksAndrew
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	35-44	1/11/2009 3:38:00 PM	I was on this medication for 3+ years, I Loved it, however, I lost a lot of weight. I found the clear tape, the doctors use for to bandage their patients worked great for me, I only taped the edges (all four) sometimes they would still come off, but for the most part, they stayed where i put them. (on my chest, below my collar bone) The hardest thing, for me was getting the adhesive off after I changed the patch. (i put the new patch on the other side of my chest, and used baby oil to remove the adhesive)I too had a big problem with break-through pain, my doctor advised me to change it every 48 hours, instead of the 72 hours as indicated on the package. Then I was able to function &quot;normally&quot;. I have been off this medication for 2 years, because I have lost my insurance, and can't afford to purchase them on my own. When I did get off the patch, the with-drawls were so bad, I couldn't eat, sleep, or move, it took about 2 weeks to get off all together. (2 weeks of hell)

She ended up using up to 4 patchs simultaneously, which was rather alarming.  They did not cause serious skin irritation.  After reading the box, I was rather scared of handling them, so I used gloves and was very careful to avoid skin contact with the patch.

I have tried the other and it did come off in hot weather and at the beach. Mylan, no problem, it takes time to get the adhesive off after removing the patch.  So if having a problem keeping on patch I would sugguest having your pharmacist order Mylan brand.  I've been a fentanyl patch user for about a year and a half.

I was using it for a while along with the pills, then just the patch (200 mcg to start). I am now down to 75 mcg after 2 years. Even though it relieves my pain, it only works for the first 48 hrs and it is extremely difficult to get off it. I've been trying to lower the dosage each month and the withdrawl symptoms are sometimes unbearable.

She was lethargic for hours and we had to walk her for a long time, according to the vet, to keep her awake and alert until it wore off. I am fearful of the patch with my grandkids though.

At first I liked the patches, then I was having to up the dose constantly because of the ever growing tolerence, I had to be put on Restoril so I could sleep at night, but during the day I couldnt even hold my head up. Then I was also put on Phenergan for the nausea. Then the mood changes set in, I was completely miserable, depressed, and my temper was really short, I was hurting the people around me. And I also stayed either overdosed or underdosed due to the uneven dispursment of the medication. Also my chest stayed covered in blisters and sores. And there is so many more things i could mention. Then after almost three years I told my doctor to switch my medication or else. He put me on MS Contin and I havent been this happy in a long time.

It took a while however to find the right dose during which I experienced severe withdraw symptoms like sweating, restless leg syndrom (RLS), no sleep, urge to find anything that would take the edge off. I am 230 lb. male with cronic back and knee pain and I take 1 100mg patch every 2 days. I overlap doses by about 6 hours. You will become addicted if you use for a while so make sure you factor that into your decision to use it. On a possitive note it freed me from all the discomforts of having to remember when to take a pill or how many I have taken. Overall very satisfied.

Their is no magic pill for cronic pain. I put the patch on after I get out of the shower and after I have washed the area with soap and dried real good. I also use a high strenght durable cloth medical tape made by 3m. My Doctor said that the generic brand uses a differant delivery system than the brand name. I have used Watson,Mylan and Janssen and found Janson and Mylan sticks better than watson.

But  after 1 year of using the drug it change me in horriable way. Mostly if effect my mind . So I took myself off of it. It was 1 week of hell.  But in then it was well worth it.I don't belive i should have ever been put on this drug.  If my dr. had not quite  who knows what would have have to me. It was the new Dr. that told me the truth. I really like my first dr. but in the end,he had lied so much about this drug. I think its a good drug for poeple that don't have long to live.

I have to get the watson brand now, my problem is that I have had boxes that did not have all 5 patches in it, when it first happen I told the pharmarcy that I new that they couldn't do anything about it, so I started checking all of the boxes in front of them before I left the pharmacy after not finding any missing for a few months I stopped checking them, now I have two differant boxes with one missing. This has only happen with the watson brand, I just wnat to know if this has happen to anyone eles. It had to happen during the packaging of the boxes because it didn't look like anyone had open them, then sealed them back. Unless the Dr. or Pharmacy sees it themselves I know its hard for them to believe you. I will go back to checking them at the pharmacy when I pick them up.

I have lupus, fibro, osteoporosis, degenerative disc disease, chronic migraines, carpal tunnel, osteoarthritis. I was on stadol and vicodin before, but could not maintain pain control. The patch has been a godsend. It reduces the pain to the point that I can walk again. As otghers have said, the biggest problem is with sticking to the skin. I am on 75mcg. The pain mgmt. dr suggests removing every 2 days, but primary is afraid to go that far. The level should be higher, but because I am 47, I want to be able to reserve space to increase in the future.

At first I had problems with it staying on,I work in a kitchen as a cook and we have no air conditiong. I found that patches called IV 3000 work great for keeping them on for 3 days . Even through sweating and showering they wont come off. By the way you can only buy them in med supply stores and they only cost .85 cents a piece. I hope that this info helps.

Before my pain management doctor switched me to Fentanyl patches, he had been precribing Oxycontin. When he switched to the patches, it was the best treatment I have ever had!!!! The bigest problem with the patches was during the summer months, or whenever I sweated alot, I would either, breakout with pain and itching under the patch, or the patches would come part of the way, or all of the way off. My doctor then precribed 15 patches per month, instead of 10. This has worked great for me, changing the patch every 2 days,instead of 3.

I have had every test done and tried every method for pain relief (pharm and non-pharm).  I have even sought help at Mayo Clinic.  No one has been able to give me any answers.  Some say it's from Anemia, some say nerve and some say bone pain.  I am a young woman who is in nursing school and trying to live my life.  After a year, the Vicodin or Lortab didn't work for the full dose.  My anesthesiologist prescribed Fentanyl patch.  It works WONDERFUL.  I don't have to worry about taking doeses of meds with me when i leave the house.  I put the patch on and change it every 3 days.  I don't run out of my Rx early anymore.  I feel like i have my life back.  I started accupuncture 6 months ago (as a last resort) and i have been plesantly surprised that it really works for pain.  I have my dose down from 75mcg to 25mcg.  I am hoping soon to be drug free:)  Fentanyl used correctly really gave me my life back!
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance		5	2	4			7/4/2008 6:20:37 AM	Patch form is easy to use. Average daily pain was at a 8 to a 4. Sometimes works itself loose after shower or rubbing it my mistake. Very expensive to waste.

The Sandoz patch stays on much better than the Mylan.  I use it for back pain due to surgery when my muscle and nerves got cut during surgery.  I use 100mcg patch and oxycodone 30mg four times a day for breakthru pain.  Highly recommend the patch.

I am having difficulties getting the patch to remain sticking to my skin.  It defitnitly works in taking the pain away!!  The only problem I have is trouble staying awake.  Although I have no pain, I tend to fall asleep no matter where I am or what I am doing. Last week, I fell asleep while walking in the hallway at work.  If it wasn't for the pain releif, I would beg to go off it, but It has been the only stuff that has completely worked for me.  I would overall rate thi drug at 9.5 on a 10 point scale!

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	Bill, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	6/6/2008 1:08:27 AM	I have been taking this medication since 2002. I started on the 25mcg and now am on the 75 mcg. I suffer from Severe Illuinguinal Neurapathy, because during a firefight in Afghanistan, I had a mortar shell explode, and I lost my left testicle with severe nerve damage, among other tissue damage. This patch gives me freedom from taking multiple pill forms of this medication, howevever, I feel I am hooked on it now, and dread the summer months because of sweat, and the patches do not seem to last as long. I wonder if anyone else has this issue, because on that 3rd day, in the hours before I have to change the patch, it seems that I start to feel cold, but my back starts to sweat, then I yawn alot, and have to stratch a bunch. The first time I tried the 50mcg patch, I was taken to the ER because they thought that I had OD'd, only I just woke up and was not answering questions correctly while I was in the military. They then gave me a high dose of Narcan, and it almost instantly flushed all of the opiod from my system. WOW, that was not fun, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Needless to say I woke up pretty fast from that! Aside from tears, and extreme pain, I was sweating profusely, and the sheets of the bed seemed like they were tearing my skin off. Overall, I am proud of my service to my country, but I am saddened that I cannot get free from this monster. My ownly hope is that children do not have to suffer anymore from me sleeping all the time, and feeling bad alot. Anyone else have these types of issues? Don't get me wrong, i love this drug and the freedom it has provided, but given the choice to take it and not, I may not have chosen this path had I known what it would be like 6 years later. But hindsight is always better huh?

I have complications from diabetes (Type1, 24 yrs living with it), severe TMJ complicated by lichen planus (including Oral), am slowly losing use of hands/shoulders, with extreme pain.  Am on 50mch patch, and like otheres, feel it wears out before it should.  Still am not off opiods completely.  I do not get any &quot;high&quot; or really notice this drug at all, which is wonderful: i just have less pain.  which is why all the withdrawals stories mystify and scare me a bit.  would like to know what others are using to supplement Fentanyl or if they just have dr. UP the patch strength, etc.

(I know, just about everything falls into that title.) Since '01 I've had 3 back surgeries, with the first 2 leaving me worse than before. I ended up taking close to 20 percocet daily on bad days. In 2004 after the last surgery, 4 level fusion, and after lots of nerve damage in the process, I was introduced to the patch.It took a while to find the right spot to apply it. I began putting it on my chest as the intructions recommend, but it would fall off and I would use tape to keep it on. Though the instructions say not to, I rub my upper arm with alcohol and apply, and I've not had a problem since.I've been on 100 mcgs since '07. I returned to weight training 6 months ago and have remained 'nearly' pain-free. I am in the best shape I have ever been. While no drug is right for everyone, this one has saved my life. 
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	bellytwister@hotmail.com, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	5/12/2008 3:42:50 PM	while this patch which was put on me at 100 mcg in the hospital was effective in blocking my pain, i came to realize after using it for almost 3 years that if I didn't not change the patch in exactly 72 hours i would start to go through what seemed like withdrawl symptoms.  I asked my new neurologist about this ans he was very against the patch so I made the decision to wean my self off of the patch.  IT WAS HELL!!!  even though i did it slowly and stepped down 100, 75, 50 ,25 mcgs. the witdrawl symptoms where excruitiating!!!  Also I had not realized because the patch had dulled my pain for so long, how much my disease had actually progressed and I may even have another much more serious/life threatening disease that has been masked because of the use of fentanyl.  My advice to anyone prescribed this drug is to seriously consider another option.  To be on tis drug is to married to it for the rest of your life unless you are willing to go through the agonizing withdrawls to be off it again.  DON'T LET THIS DRUG STEAL YOUR LIFE!!  TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR AND SEE IF THERE ISN'T SOMETHING ELSE YOU CAN USE.  THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING FROM END STAGE CANCER OR SOME OTHER HORRIBLY PAINFUL DISEASE.  Doctors had this drug out way to easily and we as patients eventually pay for it.  Sincerely...a survivor of this drug.

The patches worked well (I tried all the brands) and I rarely had problems with sticking. Usually wore on the upper arm and would cover the patch with my hand for about 20 sec to make sure it was sealed. None of them ever came off or lost effectiveness. Now I have had surgery, and I took myself off the patch due to less pain. One warning- withdrawal is horrible. Felt like every muscle and joint in my body was exploding for a good week to two weeks. But if you need it- it works. Just be cautious when you get off of it.

I literally broke into all over rashes, sweats, chills, and have sever swelling...40 pounds of fluid since using the Fentanyl Patch and when I used Dilaudid.I have Fibro, migraines, and on top of that herniated 3 discs in my lower back at work. I survived a terrible plane accident, and did all the physcial rehab when they said I would be in bed the rest of my life. Now 10 years later I herniated my 3 discs in my back. I have chronic pain for 13 years, but nothing close the problems I have since taken these 2 meds. I know am having to deal with my kidney, livers and hormones being thrown off so much that these meds put me into menapause at 33! Please get advice, information, think &amp; pray. These meds will steal your life, and could kill you. I have been into the ER &amp; had cardiac arrest problems 2 times, once on the patch, once on the dilaudid. I know it is so terrible to live in chronic pain, I KNOW IT. But the word there is LIVE! I am know in the process of having to take all these other meds &amp; treatments to reverse the damage from these meds before I can even deal with the pain of my back (&amp; the pain is so bad I am now in a wheelchair) I have a great faith in God that helps get me through.  I just wish I could go back to 3 years ago and tell the doctors NO to this patch, stay on oral pain meds and seek different treatment. I am facing a surgery that will put in 1/2 pound titanium. That doesn't scare me as much as this medicine. Please please, just do your research, try anything else, chiro, natural meds, other things. But dont just take doctors words for it, or others. Every BODY is different. If it works for you, I am HAPPY sincerly for you..chronic pain works on me every day. But I NEVER REMEMBER IT BEING AS BAD AS IT IS SINCE TAKING THIS MED. You will hit a plateau in relief from the meds, and they will cause other complication. Weigh out the price,causes colon comp also.WOW

I was the starting catcher on my baseball team for my first three years of college. Took toll on body and found out have spondolothisis.  I have started pain therapy and the pills made my IBD worse.  The patch was last resort.  Started at 50mg/72hrs.  It did nothing for my pain.  I still had breakthrough pain everyday!  It just makes me over sleep lol.  I am a college senior and this patch does not fit into my schedule. It always falls off and does nothing for pain.  Its great for some, just not for others 
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	m_reinhardt,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female		4/15/2008 9:19:29 PM	I had a hernia repair in April of 2007; the doctor that did the surgery pinched two nerves while performing the surgery.  I went to the pain clinics and was given injections that hurt worse than they helped.  I had been taking percocet a lot before and after the surgery but had a problem with the pills b/c I was told to take one-two pills before my pain level reached a five.  I was always feeling like I was at a five.  I talked to my family doctor and asked him if he could treat me since the pain clinic was not helping; he suggested these patches.  Like in a review I read before on WebMD it really only gives relief for about 48hrs.  I am allergic to the sticky stuff and it causes the spots to break out, itch, and once removed some swelling.  If I did not have the patch though there would be no way for me to even walk as the pain radiates from my back into my side and down my left leg.  The small side effects and the few extra break through medications I have to take are okay, because I can live more like a normal human.  I still hurt, but I can live with it, most of the time.

The patch DOES take the edge off the pain the first 48 hours and I am able to move about and live more normal....but the 3rd day is always very hard for me requiring more break through meds! All in all, it is the best pain relief I have had thus far and the easiest to use! I have very little side effects and am thankful for the sharp edge it takes off the chronic pain from severe back problems!!

Started in a pain management program in April of 2007. When I first started I was prescribed 240 10/325mg of percocet per month it seemed like all i ever did was take pills. It was so bad i was missing a lot of work and even on my days off i just wanted to stay in bed. 3 months ago my dr decided to put me on the duragesic patch (Sandoz Fentanyl) I started out at 25mcg and they seemed to work great for the first 24 hours. I was still taking percocet also. So next appointment he jacked it up to 50mcg and cut my percocet down to 150. I have not had any side effects and feel great. I've not missed a day of work in over 2 months. I no longer dread climbing stairs or try to avoid them.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	Jerznurs, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	3/19/2008 11:48:10 AM	I have been using the patch for about 7 years for Fibro, Lupus and Degenerative Disc (6 spine surgeries). I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Janssen who makes the actual Duragesic patch will mail you a special clear dsg, free of charge, to cover the patch and keep it in place I used to need them when I put the patches on my arms. But now I wear them on my chest I don't have as much trouble even though I am fairly active and live in the Florida heat.  I am on 300mcg/72hrs at this point so I worry that sooner or later I'm going to hit the max and then I don't know what I'll do but I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.
Other	diskel, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	3/18/2008 1:25:44 PM	I take this along with Lyrica for FibroM.  Condition has been chronic since 1990.  The two together have done more in terms of dulling the pain for an extended period of time, than any prescription narcotic, ie vicodin, darvocet, percocet, etc.  I don't seem to have much trouble with the patches staying put,but I do wonder if water seeps in while taking a shower.  And if so, does that impact the usefulness of the drug.  I do sometimes get really tired, (usu. mid day)and sometimes feels as though I could sleep at a moments' notice.  But I try to stay active when that happens, even if it's just sitting up and working on the computer.  So far, the two have worked very well for me.  I take a 25mcg patch every other day. (48 hrs.)  Have lost significant weight.  Although I cannot attribute that totally to meds.  I have been under considerable personal stress.  I try to exercise on the ball every day, even if its just sitting and keeping my balance, I know this goes a long way towards improving my stability.

I got tired of taking all those pills,and told my pain doctor to put me on Fentynal...started me out at 150mcg patches,and Fentora lozengers for breakthrough(200mcg),and it has worked unbelievabley!!!!! That was 2 years ago,I got bumped up 2 200mcg patches,and 400mcg lozengers+8mg of Dilaudid if needed.As for the non-sticking issue when Igot the Sandoz brand (THEY SUCKED!!!!) they wouldn't stick!!!! Where I live they have the Watson brand&amp; it even has one corner that sticks out like a triangle so when you peel it offand go to use it you can hang onto that corner and smooth out the rest of the the corners and sides before you hold down on it for 30 seconds or so. This patch has been a godsend for me!!!!! No more handfulls of pills.....JUST RELIEF!!!!!!

Fentanyl is a wonder drug! No watching the clock and counting pills. I found that Mylan is the best brand, but everyone is different. Very addicting though and withdrawls are almost enough to make u want to commit succide. Im on the 75mcg every 48 hrs i found they DONT last 72 and talked to my dr. and he changed it to 48. Have no complaints now, except my mother calling w/ all the bologna in the news about it.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	 Female 	4	5	4	Female		2/16/2008 1:36:32 PM	The Mylan brand works the best for staying on the skin. It's a small patch, that sticks well and works great.Imark the date on the patch.On the day I need to change, I put the new patch on, and leave the old patch on for 2 hours, before taking it off. I thinks this  works best.Stay away from brands that are a very large saranwrap patch. These not only don't stick well, they irritate the skin, leaving it red and sore. I've been using the patch for over a year, the only thing I noticed, is that I am very tired all the time. Sleeping a 24 hour period, at least one day a week. Which is a bummer.

I like the fact that the patch helps me a lot with the pain and does not affect the head the way the pills use to. I would not like to have to go back to the pills. The 100mg every two days takes care of my pain.

I have rsd and my pain is really bad, so maybe this is why it only lasts as long as it does. If the Dr. prescribed them for every 48 hrs. this would be much better.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	35-44	1/30/2008 2:40:00 AM	I started pretty much like the rest of the posts, 25mg @ first then gradually up to the 100mg. This has been a wonder drug, I found the best way to keep them on is to clean the area ( usually under breast) then I use an alchol wipe to make sure there is no body oils, I use my blow dryer to warm up the area (NOT HOT). It was a nightmare when I first started using them they kept coming off,(the gel kind) an old nurse's trick is to use betadine it makes the skin a little tacky, but let it dry! Reading the posts have made me realize it's not just me, cause by the 3rd day I feel like I'm going thru withdraws,I have no energy, shaking &amp; major breakthru pain and have to increase oral narcs till the next patch goes on. I read 1 of the posts that they're on 100 &amp; a 75 WOW and 1 post they change it every 48hrs. Do you have to have your Dr. write the script that way? All in all this has been a life saver to me. I would reccommend this drug to anyone that has been thru the narcotic menu. But this is one drug that I can see it's going to be a real fight to get off of,if ever. Very Addictive!! Good luck &amp; good Health
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/27/2008 1:07:22 PM	I had a severe reaction using this medication the very first time I used it.I was nauseous which I understood I might be but then afer being on overnight I started vomiting and this continued all throughout the day.Doctor had me remove the patch but I was still vomiting for several hours.I may have had a reaction between the fentanyl and another medication I was on that the doctor didnt realize I was on.He said it was possible this was the problem.Also the pamphlet said not to use this if people weren,t already opeoid tolerant and I was not on opeoids I was on a different painkiller. I strongly reccommend patient going over everything with their doctor before trying this patch .

They seem wo work good for the pain but being a dialysis patient I have very dry skin and had trouble keeping patches on. I always had to use extra tape or bandages. Also about 2 days into the patch I started feeling very drugged and loopy. But had no pain.

I went on Fentanyl TD 25, which didn't help...so they put me up to 50, which was better but I was getting break through pain, then we went to 75. That was too much.(caused tinitus in my ears.) Went back to 50. Try wearing your patches under your breast. I have never lost one. I am currently trying to quit due to extreme weight loss from the drug and high fevers. Watch out for the side effects.

After 2 or 3 years, the medicine is not very effective, but I do not want to increase the dose. Easy to use and it keeps a slow stream in your system at all times.

I am hoping that this will help.  I still have pain, but it has only been a day.  I am nervous about it, and hope that it helps.  The patch is hard to keep all corners closed so the drug doesn't get out.  That is the only problem I am having.  I hope that it helps.

I had to change meds when I started water therapy for treatment. One big problem was that when my husband tried it it would not stick well to his skin. Our puppies got an old patch and played with it. It almost killed them both. I got them to ER Vet. just in time. So I guess my two contributing statements are to stick em on your butt and then flush them! hope this helps

These patches help somewhat, but they do not at all administer the pain  relief I have had before with another narcotic.  These patches make me sweat really bad to the point of after finishing one shower, I feel as though I need to take another one immediately after!  The application, for me, is complicated, they will slide off my arm, and I have lost a couple in the shower.  All in all, for myself, I am soon asking my doctor to please take me off this medication and I need to try something else.  If this patch works for you, that's great.  I definatly say to try it and see how it works for you.  I have spoken with different people and heard the 'good' and the 'bad' for this medication.  With '10' hurting the most, the only relief I could say I receive, my ongoing pain is still about a '7.'

This drug makes life a little easier. I am almost pain free. I also use hydrocodone as a back up when the pain gets unbearable. My biggest problem with it is that I need my wife to put the patch on. I have found for me the best place to put it is on my back. Some of my side affects is that I can sleep as long as I like. When I have nothing on my calendar for the morning I'll sleep until noon and still take a nap in the afternoon. About once or twice a week I'll sometimes feel a little dizzy for a few seconds at a time. Overall this has been a great drug for me.

Have had neck surgery, chronic pain from other herniated cervical discs and herniated L5 disc.  Tried many procedures.  The patch does provide - so far - relief of chronic pain, but not numbness or pins &amp; needles or sharp stabbing pain which is random.  Does provide ability to function better in everyday life than w/out.  Some sweating and dizziness.

I DO NOT TAKE ANY OTHER NARCOTICS AS OF THIS TIME AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MY PERSONAL TREATMENT.

The steroids caused me to develope osteo arthritis and osteo perosis along with several other problems. I had an accedent and fractured my lower back that still causes me pain. I can not use time release pain drugs because the pills do not break down at all in my bowel, so I've been using hydrocodone and have just recently been prescribed the patch. I started out with 25mcg and I'm now on the 100mcg.They seem to work pretty well for the first 2 days but by day 3 I'm in a lot of pain. My biggest problem is where to place them so they stay on for the full 72 hours. The first 2 days I'm able to decrease the amount of oral pain meds I use, but the third day I have to increase the amount.

My DR prescribed 25 of the patch to start, I didn't get any relief then he boosted it up to 50. The pain relief is like night and day. I am not walking around like a zombie and sleeping most of day away like I was on some of the other pain killers. I have also tried 4 Facet blocks over the course of 2 months without any relief. I am on Utram ER for breakthrough pain that sometimes happens on the last day of the patch. I am not sure that is working to well but I am willing to try it for a few more days. I recommend this patch if you haven't found relief through pills and other methods.

Hopefully it will just require a small adjustment, it was originally for fibromyalgia and pain after and ongoing from surgeries in my neck.

Withdraw was prolonged compared to other Narcoticts such as demerol and dilodid.  Being an addict it is very difficult to get reliefe of sever pain.  This med was very effective at treating the pain.  Decreasing doses to come off of it is a much better idea.  If your looking for the &quot;buzz&quot; of narcoticts than this is not a drug to gain that uforic state.  If you want pain reliefe it works very well.  it does have a slight narcotic feel but not so much a high.  It is a good drug and does its job.  Just expect a hard withdraw if used longer than 10 days.

I was advised strongly to start with the 50 mcg. I refused 50 because I wanted to start at 25 mcg. I don't care what anyone tells you about the conversion table, I strongly disagree with it in my own personal opinion.Start low, as one can always go up in as little as 6 days.Fentanyl works wonders for me. I find using the upper arm along with a strip of that white medical tape over top of the patch works just fine. I also wash the skin area a few hours before applying a new patch. I seldom if ever have any of the sticking issues I see mentioned here.BTW. I just moved up to the Mylan 50 mcg or mch. TD. Love it, love it. I also realize, what works for me, may not work for you.Have a happy pain free day.

That was the first time that had happened.  I was sent to the ER and admitted to the hospital for observation.  I was given Narcan to reverse the effect of the side effect.  Everyone was really nice and helpful.  
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	11/13/2007 7:34:38 AM	Only been taking it about 5 wks,  started at 50 mch and have moved to 75 w/i the first week. I like not having to keep track of every 4-6 hours on oral meds, having trouble remembering and sometimes taking to doses.  Works well with the pain along with a oral breakthru med.  I've had realy good luck placing it on my upper arms, Had alot of trouble when placing in on my back or chest.

I'VE ALREADY HAD 2 BACK SURGERIES. THE DRS. ARE TRYING TO KEEP FROM HAVING TO PUT ME THROUGH ANOTHER SURGERY. SO WE ARE TRYING PAIN MANAGEMENT. I TRIED AVINSA AND IT WAS A HORRIBLE EXPERIANCE. NOW WE ARE TRYING FENTANYL 50MG. IT STILL DOES NOTHING FOR ME. AND AS FOR PUTTING THE PATCH ON IT CAN BE DIFFICULT AT TIMES. IT DOESN'T WANT TO STAY ON. I'VE HAD TO PUT BAND-AIDS ON TO HOLD IT IN PLACE. OVERALL I DON'T CARE FOR IT NOR WOULD I RECOMMEND IT.

It is easy to put on also. I use it every 2 days 150mcg/hour. I will probably use forever. I put it on just below the rib cage on the right or left side so that it stays on better. I take a shower before I put it on also which gets the old skin off and it helps it to stick. I have used everything from aspirin to fentanyl and this is definately the best product so far. I still have breakthrough pain sometimes but if it gets bad enough then the dose is upped to the next level. I have also used all 3 brands... Duragesic, sandoz, and mylan. Duragesic and Sandoz are essentially the same and work very well ,However, Mylan did not work very good for me . Everyone I have talked to has said exactly the same thing also. I think Mylan Brand is a slightly different fentanyl variation than the others also. I use sandoz brand now cause it is the same as duragesic and much cheaper also.

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		11/2/2007 4:52:05 PM	only 1 brand sticks to my skin- Sandoz. I bought a velcro wristband to hold it on if it does get loose, and I stick it to my wrist. I've tried all other long acting pain relievers and this worked the best by far, in combination with the short acting pain meds. I have found the gel ones work better than &quot;dry&quot; patches. I've got lupus and fibromyalgia, so nothing completely gets rid of the pain, but it helps. I don't know if a fentanyl manufacturer has a program for people on Medicare Part D, but if you can no longer afford to buy it, I'd check into that. My mother gets her 200.00 RX for 25.00/ mo from the manufacturer because she used up her part D benefit.

Dr did not believe I could have all these symptoms and felt I just wanted my former drugs back.  My doctor continues to insist that i remain on this medicine.  My family doctor does not wish to interfere because he fears a lawsuit against the Dr in question. My dilemma now is trying to find a Dr to write a prescription to replace this medicine and get me off of it and take care of my treatment.  I phoned Dr 5 times in two days in extreme distress and was told not to call again.  Ended up in hospital ER with heartattack from medicine.  horribile side effects.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/25/2007 11:32:13 PM	I have just recently been using the Fentanyl TD Patch,and it actually works great.It's easy to use because I can put it on,and forget about the patch for a few days.Instead of being on a daily schedule to take numerous narcotic pain medications that didn't have much effect on me for my spinal conditions that have disable me,and puts me through immense pain.This is the first thing i've been on that has actually helped me with my pain management programs I go through to manage the non stop chronic moderately severe pain I have every day of my life.If it wasn't for this patch i wouldn't be able to function properly to do daily things like cooking meals,bathing,cleaning my house,or even checking the mail without being in intense pain.

Had gastric bypass surgery and ingested long-acting pain medication doesn't work because of my changed digestion process. This is only thing that's worked for me. Getting out of bed in the morning was very difficult before I started using the patches. Nausea was a problem, but is effectively controlled by anti-nausea medication.

The concept that is.  I have used Durgesic, Sandoz and Mylan and all of them were extremely hard to keep on during the summer months or in any humid setting.  With all of my aliments, I generally have to be in comfortable setting so I do not suffer from spasticity.  The patch RARELY stays for the duration it should!  Coming from someone whose insurance company capped their prescription plan extremely early in the year and having to pay out-of-pocket prices, which FYI are ridulicous to say the least considering it only costs them roughly 14 cents per patch, I did everything I could to keep them on. I tried band aids(and the waterproof kind), every kind of medical tape, and then sometimes had to resort to using self adhering elastic wrap.  I looked ridiculous all the time b/c my arm was the ONLY place it would possibly stick to in the beginning and everyone would stare at it before even looking at me which was impossible for my students to ignore :(  Obviously, if its not sticking... it is not working!!  I truly wish it would b/c it's not a drug that can be replaced and leaves you empty handed in EVERY aspect!  I have encountered countless people in the same position, as soon as they see it they ask if it sticks!  I do not want the option of popping pills but if it takes the pain away... at this point it is worth switching back to taking pills every 6 hours. It is amazing with all the technology in the world and they can't get a pain patch to stick to your skin- even with a price tag of $400!!!!!

Other	Mark, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	45-54	9/24/2007 2:02:56 PM	provided little to no effect in pain relief. Had extreme trouble maintaining the patch as the adhesiveness was aweful. Came off during sleep the first night and could only keep it adhered by using medical tape as a supplement. This is not effec tive for somone who is activily mobile, it maybe different if you are sedintary. Overall I not cetain if I was recieving the correct doseage due to the fact the application system constantly became unstuck (Loose).

Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	9/21/2007 6:55:20 PM	I take fentanyl patches for chronic pain.  They are effective at managing pain so that I can work, but even at the highest dose it does not control all of my pain.  I have to use other medications in addition to this one.  Side effects minimal.  Biggest complaint is finding the correct brand so that the patch does not fall off by losing its adhesiveness.
Chronic Pain with Narcotic Drug Tolerance	quandalina, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	9/18/2007 5:33:54 PM	I found out after having surgery that I don't respond to narcotics like Morphine.  They administered the Fentanyl patch.  It worked in terms of pain relief, but it was a crazy experience. I had hallucinating, was extremely sleepy, slurred speech at times, and had very shallow breathing.  I couldn't have made it though the pain without Fentanyl, but the side effects were outrageous &amp; made my family extremely nervous and upset to see me essentially become a different person while on it.  You doctor MUST keep a close on you while taking this drug.
