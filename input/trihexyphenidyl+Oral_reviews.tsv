Extrapyramidal Reaction	barbara, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	1/9/2008 11:30:12 PM	Abilify at 10 mg made my restless leg syndrome worse, as I had the symptoms all during the day, as well as at night, and seemed to have been the cause of additional, stranger side effects. My feet and toes became very tense and felt as though I had to get up and do something, move around. While sitting, both big toes would move as if to scratch the second toes.  This medication has helped a great deal!

Recently started hallucinating and losing weight.  No longer able to properly care for himself, now living in the US the current doctor questions if he really has Parkinsons at all. He has some tremors, but could be a side effect of the medication itself.  In the meantime, while living with us (8 weeks) has gained 10 pounds.  Contatly complains of heartburn but nothing seems help.  A new neurologist will be seen him soon and, according to his primary doctor, will likely decrease and slowly remove him from this medication.
