Cold Symptoms	Gardiner, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	6/13/2010 10:26:15 AM	Thid medication seems to work well for me in clearing up nasal congestion and coughing. I experienced none of the side effects mentioned here. I did notice that the effect wore off about four hours sooner than claimed, so I ended up taking one every 8 hours or so. At this frequency practically all cold synptoms went away.

Cold Symptoms	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	4/7/2008 6:05:21 AM	Received this prescription after 5 days of severe congestion hoping to relieve symptoms.  Since on the medication for 3 days, I'm actually coughing more and am waking up during the night every 4 hrs. or so.  A mild headache has also developed -- perhaps due to lack of sleep.  Still congested and not happy with the results to date.

Cold Symptoms	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	2/28/2008 5:32:35 PM	Sleeplessness and difficulty urinating beats the constant sinus drainage and sore throat.  Unlike Actifed, this drug does not cause me to be drowsy.
Cold Symptoms	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	35-44	2/18/2008 10:36:17 PM	Symptoms: Massive chest cold and sinus congestion. This drug was prescribed to me and it is taking forever to loosen/clear up the sinuses and congestion. Worst part are the side effects. Basically what is listed for this drug, I have: headaches, dizziness, nausea, slight hand shaking, tired/weak, loss of sex drive and also have experienced unusual sweating. Also have experienced shortness of breath but that may be due to the congestion.This drug is awful. I'd rather cough an extra week than with the above. It is worse enough where I have avoided driving at times. Oh, and the side effects comes in waves. I will feel okay (not great but okay) for a few minutes then it'll hit like a ton of bricks.Good times!

Cold Symptoms	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	12/31/2007 9:32:57 AM	I feel weak, get constant headaches, am having trouble sleeping, and get muscle aches...all of which I do NOT normally get and which were NOT symptoms of the cold I had.I continued to have chills, which may have been due to the cold. I was shaking, again possibly due to the cold, but also possibly due to the weakness I felt after taking pseudovent. On a very odd note also, it made my gums and teeth hurt and feel sore as if I had been punched in the mouth. This symptom is constant and doesn't go away until about 24 hours after I DON'T take pseudovent.
