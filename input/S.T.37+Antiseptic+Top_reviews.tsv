For the last 8 years I've used it for all kinds of scrapes, cuts, etc. Orthodontists should recommend this for their patients. It is the most wonderful product. From minor mouth sores to the most painful wire punctures, it is takes the pain away almost entirely.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/16/2011 12:44:23 AM	I have used this product ST37 for sunburns road rashes, infected lacerations on animals, dermatitis, sore throats, and earaches, jaw aches, pulled teeth, infected toes, and blisters on animals feet.  I gargle with it before I have my teeth cleaned and used it after an episiotomy. I have kept more people at work by having ST37 available that other supervisors also purchased some to keep at their desks.  I am always amazed at how well it works.  I keep it in the bathrooms and at our summer homes.  My family laughingly say ST37 when someone has an owe.  I kiddingly say it will heal the sidewalk cracks.My Aunt put me on to it and says its been around forever. It is so worth it to have it in the kitchen. Kathy from Hend. NV

Since we lived close to this products  earlier location outside Philadelphia,it was well known. Later it became difficult to locate ( Florida &amp; Montana .)Thanks to internet--easier now to locate. Old timers know how great it is for cuts, scrapes and oral applications.

I have used it on minor cuts, minor burns and as a gargle for a sore throat.  It not only works but it is gentle and painless.

My father had a bad foot infection about 1930, before the days of antibiotics, and they were going to cut it off.  An intern suggested trying this new ST 37 product and the foot was saved.  ST 37 was off the market for years, and just returned a few years ago.  It is great for all cuts and even sore throats, when diluted and gargled. Painless, with a slightly sweet taste, it works wonders as a wet compress.

This liquid antiseptic is absolutely incredible for so many things: burns, cuts, scrapes, mouth sores, fever blisters, sore throats, and mouth sores. I recently discovered how quickly it heals rashes. It takes the sting out of sunburns too. S.T. 37 does not sting at all so I have no problem putting it on my 3 year olds boo boos. The amazing thing is how quicly everything heals up when you use this product. Unfortuneately, S.T. 37 is hard to find. You can order it from any pharmacy or order it on Amazon. It is made by Numark Labs in New York, right here in good ole USA too!

I'd never heard of it before my mother-in-law told me of it. It instantly relieves  mouth pain from braces, ortho devices, etc.  Plus it helps wounds heal faster. It doesn't hurt to apply so your kids won't be squirming around.  It's safe enough to drink (per bottle) yet it works like alcohol.You can dilute it by 3 and its still as effective as full-strength (so a little goes a long way.)
