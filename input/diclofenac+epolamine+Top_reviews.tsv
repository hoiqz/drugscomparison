Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	45-54	2/8/2012 9:47:47 AM	I have chronic neck and back pain from scoliosis and two car accidents and I had C4-7 fused.  Since I am very sensitive to all oral meds, especially anti-inflammatories, I tried the Flector patches.  I used them for years until recently I ended up in the ER with severe abdominal pain from an ulcer caused by these patches. Be careful.

My Doctor put one of these patches on me in her office.  With in 15 minutes the pain was gone, and now, 12 hours later is still gone.  I now have a prescription and will continue the use.  I suffered so so long, and now have no pain.

Other	Peaches, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	5/20/2010 7:57:35 PM	I have tried a lot of prescription and OTC medication for the arthritis in my back. I am a nurse and walk and bend alot. This patch has helped me make it through my 12 hour shifts. I am also able to turn over in the bed after using the patch. This is the only prescription that I went back to the doctor for a repeat. I have very little patience for things that don't work quickly. I have been able to stop the patch and go back to just Aleve. But believe me, I have a few on hand for when the back has been over worked.

I am using it for torn cartilage in my knee.  It was extremely painful and actually had me in tears and could barely walk when at it's worst.  The patch has reduced the pain to a managable level.  I am very impressed with the effectiveness of this patch.

Other	Kneeprob, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	5/23/2009 9:30:22 AM	I had knee surgery four years ago. When my knee hurts this was a great solution because it sticks well to the area and stays on.  I found it does not work right away, but slowly takes the pain away for 12-24 hours. Nsaids can cause buzzing in the ears.

I am using it for pain in my hip (Trochanteric bursitis). It has cut the pain by at least 60-70%. I was once addicted to oxycontin and vicodin so I had to try other means of pain relief. 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/20/2009 10:44:52 AM	I have had over 10 car accidents, a major ski accident hitting a tree, and broken most of the bones in my body.  I am applying these patches on my neck and lower back as needed in addition to receiving depomedrol shots in my C7 and Sacrilliac to relieve chronic pain.  I am not on any narcotics and just began this new pain management process.  These patches are amazing and relieve the pain so well.  I am very pleased.

This was very effective at relieving both the pain and swelling. Also, he is a senior in high school so he didn't have to take pills during school hours!
Other	Jill, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/5/2008 10:53:21 AM	I have a pinched nerve in my elbow and tried accupuncture, physical therapy, and a cortazone shot. They each worked for a very short time. When I used the patch I was amazed at how quickly it worked (after just one use). I have full range of motion with my elbow, no pain, and have even resumed working out. It has made me extremely tired though, which I just read was a side affect.

I have severe inflamation of my shoulder causing me to not to be able to hold my head up and the patch was put on in the doctors office and within 15 mins. I walked out with the pain gone and able to put my neck back and hold my head up . and the swelling went down that was causing a hump. and i could sleep out of pain and I have taken pain medicine to try to stop the pain and it did not work. and I have sleeped on a heating pad and it did not work. the patchis wonderful. I even had my hip hurting that I had to hold it to walk and it made me limp I put a patch on it and in 5 mins. I could walk without pain and by the next day the pains was totally gone and has not returned. I was very skeptical of the patch when my doctor wanted me to try them . but I am very impressed by them . and I have so much more movement and less pain.
