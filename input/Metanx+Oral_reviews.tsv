Something with my blood. Dr. said I have to take for life. It is a rare type. I was going through caremark cvs but found out by calling many places all over priced any where from $160. to $200. for 90 day supply. Found out a wonderful mail order on metanx site www.bdhrx.com 90 day supply for only $72. share this info with others. I pay out of pocket to. But I only have to take 1 tab. a day.

No, it is not roccea, dermatologist check. The price is to high! Mfg gives us a break!

I developed pain in my feet and stiff joints after being diagnosed with Diabetes type 1.  Metanx is the only drug that helps.  But you must take 2x day as prescribed.  I tried 1x day due to cost, with no results.  It is cheaper if you order it off the Metanx website !  I pay out of pocket, but it is worth every penny !

I took it for 2 months because I stretched it out to 2 months.  I then received samples from my doctor.  I really did not see any difference.  I have severe peripheral neuropathy in both feet. I tried Neurontin which put on approximately 10-15 pounds.  I was always hungry but no help. I tried Cymbalta.  It kept me very calm, put on weight but the neuropathy pain, burning and tingling was still there.  I am going to try the Metanx again and take it as prescribed. 2x per day. I know it is very expensive but I really cannot endure this pain especially at night.

So my Rx program suggested a lower cost alternative.L-MEFOLATE-PYRIDOX-MECOBAL 3-35-2MG. I researched both. Metanx is different than the cheaper one. the cheaper one suggests it is for diabetic neuropathy. I have Multiple Sclerosis, this was suggested for a specific vitamin Folic Acid nutrition therapy. It is to help with the cognitive and degenerative effect of MS. SO I am actually not getting the benefit of the actual brand, Metanx. I don't think the cheaper one for Diabetic neuropathy is right. I have had some benefit, for my cognitive issues. Can't say much about it helping. Also, I have been having HOT FLASHES, I am disappointed to say the least. Patient BEWARE!

BC/BS covers mine - still expensive at $60 for 90 day supply through Medco- this year the plan will use CareMark and it will be either $60 or $70. My diabetic neuropathy in feet, especially toes, has improved after 2  months use. I am also taking Alpha Lipoic Acid (600 mg daily) and that may be the reason for improvement or, possibly, the combination. At any rate I intend to continue both.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU SEND YOUR PRESCRIPTION TO BRAND DIRECT HEALTH OR HAVE YOUR PHYSICIAN SEND THEM AN E-SCRIPT.  THEY CHARGE $72 FOR A 90 DAY SUPPLY (90 PILLS) AND $144 FOR (180 PILLS).  THERE IS NO INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THIS MEDICAL FOOD AND I WAS PAYING $145 FOR 90 PILLS FROM MY PHARMACY, SO THIS IS HALF THE PRICE.  THEY ALSO HAVE A MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN.

I was experiencing severe numbness in the entire bottom of my foot and severe nerve pain from where tibial break was down thru the bottom of my foot and out the ends of my toes.  Was very uncomfortable. Metanx was suggested to me; taken daily.  Have been on this med for 6 weeks.  Experienced nausea and headaches for about 4 weeks.  Both have subsided now.  I have noticed a remarkable difference in the discomfort with my left foot since taking this drug. Still have the nerve pain, but it is highly tolerable.  Med didn't affect the numbness. The biggest thing I noticed was an increase in my overall daily stamina.  I now have no side effects and will continue taking this medicine.  Hope this information is helpful.

At first I didn't think it was doing anything, until I forgot to take it, and my feet went haywire.  This drug has been wonderful to me.  It reduced the amount of &quot;pins and needles&quot; in my feet to a livable level. I wouldn't do without it.

In fact, the neuropathy started getting worse and I now have pain in one foot, too.  I have read some posts about Metanx where people said their feet got worse after taking this medicine.  Others said it helped them.  I hope there will be an answer for this soon.

Had injections several times; didn't help. Was referred to my Orthopedic Doctor to see what he thought. He said that within 6 to 9 months I would lose 50% use of my (R) Arm; and that in one year, I wouldn't have use of it at all. He sent me to see my Neurologist to have EMG done. It showed that I had already suffered some damage to my elbow. With his recommendation of surgery, I went ahead with it;noting that it does have risks. He did recommend that I do take Metanx before the surgery and continue taking it after until further notice. To this date, I have no complaints because it has help aide in the recovery of the surgery.

As a result I have an inflamed Planar, calf and achillies tendon and am taking an NSAID for the inflamation and using a splint to stretch my planar muscle. I have only been on the vitamin a short time but so far I am already noticing a benefit from it. The numbness in my heel is quickly reducing and hopefully I will regain full nerve involvement now that the root issue has been diagnosed (the cycling shoes) and the course of treatment is aggressively addressed. I am back to running and cycling will be a lot better once I am able to find a properly fitted pair of triathlon shoes for future races. I also have a C5-C7 fusion in my neck and suffered nerve damage in my left radial nerve extensions in my hand that are exacerbated by sitting in one position too long... especially when I am in aero position for long periods of time. Since starting metanx I have had no recurrence of that nerve numbness as well and I was completely flopped on the couch tonight which usually sends me looking for advil for the impending headache from such lazy posture.So with this good of results... I may be taking this the rest of my life. Good thing it only costs me a co-pay but would be well worth paying out of pocket for it. As with anything I think it is well within reason to do a lot of reading and map your reactions to this and any other medications but I hope it works for you as well as it has for me.

It works!  I have been taking Metanx for 3 years. I have had no negative side effects. I stopped taking it once, thinking it wasn't really making that much difference, but I was extremely wrong!  I had forgotten how bad my previous symptoms were. It was given to me by a podiatrist to help with the stinging effects that I have with Fibromyalgia.  I've had Fibro since 1984, before the doctors had a diagnosis for all those symptoms!  I was first diagnosed with MS (by an MRI).  Thank God the doctors were wrong.  The Fibro is hard to deal with at times but much better than dealing with MS.  The Metanx really has STOPPED the stinging symptoms.  Happy to at least loose one symptom 99% of the time.  I have never had the blood test but will do so next time I have blood work done.  I was also low on Vitamin D (by blood test) and taking Vitamin D has made a difference in the Fibro.  Magnesium has seemed to help with sleep problems.  Hope this helps someone.  I almost cry these days when I see the Fibro commercials on TV.  It took so long for the general public to know about and understand what we go through.  I almost cry because I am relieved that someone else won't be told it is all in their head or will be ignored by a doctor who just doesn't have a clue!  Try the Metanx for the stinging - I pray it works for you too!

Metanx is a medicine aimed at Diabetic Neuropathy, check it out at Metanx.com. The Person with the very adverse reaction, I guess you must be allergic to one of the ingredients and/or taking to much of them in other form.If you have cramps etc, especially at night, try Quinine (or tonic water, from experience that solves the cramping problem.For myself, so far I have noticed some improvement in the tingling in my feet which feels like walking on hot coals.I hope the longer I take it the more these problems will improve.

Other	Annie, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	5/31/2010 9:36:45 PM	Have taken Metanx for about three years since I began seeing a new internist. Was taking Foltx before.  I began experiencing  swelling of legs and ankles and possible yeast-type infections on upper trunk that secreted a bloody fluid with a strong, offensive odor. MD has ignored complaints. Symptoms increased and underclothing was regularly soiled and stained by the secretions. A couple of months ago I began alternately omitting certain meds and discovered that the yeast-type rash, secretions and foul odor were much less when I had intermittantly discontinued Metanx. When I ceased using Metanx completely, the rash, odor and secretions also ceased. I am inclined to think that those symptoms may have been caused by the Metanx.  The swelling in my legs and ankles has diminished also. I need to address this with my internist for change of medication.  I was under the impression that Metanx was just a vitamin.  No one ever mentioned it was intended to treat neuropathy and related problems. If that is what it is intended for, I am puzzled.  I have serious cramps that settle in my shins and awaken me from sleep at times. I also have cramping in my hands and feet related to chilling temperatures that distort their appearance and use. I believed the leg cramps were caused by a back injury and bulging discs of many years duration.  Whatever, the medical profession needs to sort out these symptoms and medications to effect improvement in my qualify of life. I do not believe Metanx is the correct medication for me.

Other	Wild Irish Rose, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/3/2009 11:56:34 AM	Prescribed by my PCP for non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  We have finally hit on the right combination of Lyrica (150 mg/day) and Metanx (2/day).  For the first time in over 5 years, my feet do not burn, hurt and &quot;buzz&quot; all the time.  I am getting to sleep for the first time in a long time.  Currently fighting with the insurance carrier since they don't want to cover it.  Funny, they covered when the dr. was trying massive Vit. D.  HMMMMM......
Other	OldFurre, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	45-54	9/1/2009 9:53:38 PM	My severe peripheral neuropathy from diabetes is too far advanced. There are no feelings or movement from my knees down.  Also my hands are numb and very weak. I was on Metanx for a few months, but noticed no difference.  It would be an improvement to feel pain, that would mean my nerves are healing, but nothing.  Due to the exorbitant cost I discontinued taking it and now I have chewable vitamin B-6, B-12, Folic Acid tabs that cost $9.95 for a bottle of 60 and should do the same thing.

Metanx has stopped the pain and the numbness.  I can walk normally without fear of stumbling now.  It took about a month to see results.  At $30 per month, it is well worth the price.

I have been using Metanx for 2 months and the results have been astounding.  I had not felt my toes in 20 years due to neuropathy. and now it has been dimished by 99%. For me Metanx hss been an amazing find prescribed by my endocrinologist.  My pharmacy found a subsidy so I only pay $55 for 60 tablets, not $83.  For me it has been a miracle, so even though Medicare won't cover the cost, it is well worth the expense.

Part of this isue is the diabetic neropathy, poor circulation, issues in my legs. I was taking Lyrica; but, the side effects of tiredness and shortness of breath were real troublesome. I was switched to Metanx. The neropathy issues still remain but are lessened. I'm worried about overdosing on folic acid.

I also have heredity hyperhomocysteine.  I do not absorb B vitamins well. I had previously taken large doses of B vitamins and folic acid to lower homocysteine. This left me with a constant stomach ache. Once I was put on Metanx I tolerated it well, lowered my homocysteine AND had no stomach distress. It does cost me $35 a month, insurance does not cover it.  I have decided the $1.20 a day cost is worth not having a stomach ache. Probably will take it as long as I have $35 a month.

It has worked wonders for the pain sensitivity in my toes as well as my restless legs!  Yes, it is expensive, but there is a savings card and it's cheaper to buy a 90 day supply as opposed to only a month at a time.  I suggest calling all of your local pharmacies to get the best price.  The only side effect (maybe) is that my feet are cold now.  If i keep socks on I'm ok, but my feet never used to be cold.  But I'll take cold feet over the pain anyday!!

Other	Scared, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	9/13/2008 6:42:13 AM	My neurologist prescribed this medication for my numbness and tingling in my hands, legs, and feet. I started taking it for about a day or two. Then, decided to do a little research. I am a little scared to continue this medicine because of some of the reviews that I have read. I have Rosacea, so I do not want to experience the flushed face. I have heard that there is a little swelling with this medication as well. I cannot afford to gain any more weight. In addition, I do not want heartburn or gas. I know that some people will have these symptoms and some may not. I am a little scared to continue because I do not want to end up experiencing any of these. The other reviews were positive, but with my luck, I may end up one of the few, that will have the side effects that I am fearful of. The best thing is to sit down with your doctor and/or pharmacist and make sure this is something for you. I think that I will discontinue this medication and talk with my neurologist about taking something else.

I thought it was due to a compressed disk. The numbess was finally keeping me from getting good night's sleep, so I went back to my neurologist. He did some nerve conduction tests AND did some blood work (because I also was experiencing extreme tiredness/exhaustion that I could not attribute to the sleep interruptions).I was not diabetic, I was not anemic and my thyroid was performing normally. My B12 was very, very low. He place me on 2 Metanx per day (1st year I took only 1 and built myself up to 2). The numbness is very much reduced. My 2 little toes on my left foot have stopped curling inward. My energy level has increased and I can now get my home chores done on the weekend without feeling I need to take an extra day off from work, just to rest up. Once I got adjusted to the Metanx (which created some hyperness at first), I got back to exercising daily (because I finally had some energy). I'm so happy that this has helped me. I tell everyone to have their B12 levels checked! Candice
