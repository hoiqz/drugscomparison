If you are not getting an erection, check supply dates, then increase dosage.  If your erection is lasting to long, you can take a sudafed, a hot bath, and also, go for a brisk walk for about 30 minutes, and it will subside. Inject at a 45 degree angle staying away from the top of the penis, the side of the penis, and any blood vessels that are visible. Injecting the penis is not difficult, just take your time.

But overall this stuff is just the best.

Other	unhappy, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	65-74	2/19/2009 3:32:12 PM	I have been using this treatment since 1997 and his has worked extremely well for me until recently when the last 6 injection did not work at all. In fact it caused a painful swelling around the injection site and no erection . the site was also very tender and sore with extensive bruising. contacting the manufacturer did not elicit a satisfactory response to my problem. the doctors also did not seem very concerned. In short, Caverject has stopped working for me and left me in limbo  regarding my problem. all other medications failed miserable to produce any erection.

The shortage of the impulse kit has been disappointing; however, I have adapted well to the mixing and self-injection with supplied syringes.

This has been the only medication that can give me a good erection.Adjustments in dosage are very important. Start low and increase gradually if needed.Some discomfort during injection and sometimes I've gotten no results, I think that had to do with the injection site.I have been using the 20mg. and now my pharmacist tells me that the only availiable strength is now 10 mg. When properly used with the right dosage, it's great.

I started with 10mg and had a full erection for 2 hours which was very uncomfortable. Reducing the dose has cut that down to about an hour and much less discomfort. It is quite amazing and enjoyable to use. Getting used to giving myself the shot has been helped by my wife's participation. As a side effect, I seem to be not at my best mentally for several hours. My mind tends to drift off. Drinking lots of water clears it out of my system faster.

I had better results with Prostiglandin(spelling), which had to stay in fridge. Caverject does not. Do not know why it does not have to stay in fridge.
