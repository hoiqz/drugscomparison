I've been told to use the ProIr as a rescue inhaler but it is alsmo useless. I can't tell when or if it is working.

Its the ineffective delivery system of ProAir. The stream of drug is so weak that it barely makes to the back of your throat. Other manufacturers have a better delivery device.
Asthma	c1Chelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	4/24/2012 8:10:22 AM	I have only been diagnosed with Asthma for a year. This is the third inhaler that I have tried and I do not like it at all. It will initially help when I get really short of breath, but the asthma symptoms have increased from rarely to 3-4 times a day since I have been on this inhaler (just a few weeks). I wake up in the middle of the night wheezing and can't even have a long conversation before I have to rest. I'm an active 30 year old non-smoker and I didn't even know I had asthma. Since I've started using Pro Air I feel like asthma has taken over my life. I had the same reaction to Ventolin, but not with Advair or straight Abuterol. Pro Air is $35 with insurance which is high for something that only works for a few minutes and then makes symptoms significantly worse so you run out of it quickly. I will be switching to something else as soon as possible.  
Bronchitis	Nancy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/12/2012 12:38:59 PM	I was diagnosed with bronchitis / Reactive Airway Disease. Was having trouble getting enough air. I used this along with prednisone for five days and it helped after the first few. Was very helpful for me. I suffer from lone atrial fibrillation (they come/go from time to time) and was nervous about an interaction, but fortunately there wasn't one.

I used to take two puffs of Proventil at night during hay fever season and I would be fine until morning. I have been taking this far more often and never really clearing up.  Besides that my mouth and throat burn. Really bad stuff.

I am going to ask my pulmo to DC this and rewrite the albuterol rescue inhaler and get rid of this Proair.

This new PROAIR sucks big ones. I want the old albuterol back. I have used many inhalers and medicines in my time to know they have NO idea what they are doing. I bet the people changing them don't even have asthma. Plus the insurance coverage is crappy too. It's not just my insurance coverage it's many different plans. I hope they read these and take into real consideration what the actual consumers are saying.

We should be given a choice of what to use to relieve an attack. Find others work much better but not on formulary. Too expensive. Who ever brainstormed Proair, lets just say that person should have to use it!

The new inhaler,maybe safer for the environment, but I have to use twice as much to get the same results. Now the OTC stuff is going off the market for the same reason!

Asthma	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	8/19/2011 10:45:06 AM	The inhaler container should have a counter on it.  How is a patient supposed to know when he/she is not getting the correct dose becuase it is impossible to tell when the canister is empty.
Asthma Attack	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	6/8/2011 6:39:05 AM	I used my old inhaler very infrequently.  In fact, I was given the new proair inhaler because the old one had expired a couple of years ago.  The new inhaler is less effective than the expired one I was using. I am using the new one frequently with no relief.

Asthma	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	5/16/2011 1:43:17 AM	I Had mild Asthma since '73, after a very dusty summer. It comes and goes and triggered by dust and other things. I found when my asthma was mild the inhareler would be just right to fix it for days, but recently when has gotten severe it is slow acting and luckily to last 4 hours. now my doctors as added to my treatment a LABA and hopefully that will cover it. It clogs often, and has to be clean often and if you take to much of it it can cause the same effect your trying to resolve. And when it clogs you don't know how much the dose you got, and cleaning it you have to decide if you want to risk going over the does. I finding the more i use it the less effective it has gotten, And my satisfaction of it use is dropping the longer i use it.

My son had a mild asthma attack but the proair did not help.  Within 15 minutes he was passed out and the EMT's had to intubate him.  He was in ICU for three days.  Needless to say he went back to his Ventolin, which has always worked and he has been fine ever since.

The ProAir HFA is slow to work and leaves me with a burning sensation in my chest for about 20 minutes.  Also, I never had to clean my CFC like I do the HFA and I'm concerned that the gas propellant used in these new &quot;green&quot; inhalers will prove to be damaging after long term use.  Very worried!

I would get short of breath, start to wheeze and tightness in my lungs without it after being outside for long periods of time. It has worked wonders for me. I take one puff 15 minutes before going outside and then one puff when I come in, only as needed. I have had no issues with clogging as some mention. It said right on the drug info that this medication should be used mainly to treat exercised induced breating problems, so for those of you who have sever asthma... you probably are having trouble because this is not the right medication for you. You should have doctor investigate other options if it is not working!

Asthma	dissapointed,  Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		6/30/2010 1:44:11 PM	ProAir frequently clogs and never really seems to dispense properly. It's effectiveness is a large step backwards from fast acting inhalers 10 years ago. It cost more than 2x the previous prescriptions I have had. I would suggest finding a new medication if possible. This is a waste of money. If you are having an asthma attack you are in trouble. There will be a law suit. This medication does not do what it claims. F-

The puffs are way too weak and I waste some by checking the spray. Does not seem to last the whole month. Don't like it at all. Am going to try to go back to Proventil or Ventolin. How about one with a COUNTER like Flovent has.

I only used it two days before I was overcome with uncontrollable coughing episodes. I used it once on the third day prior to using Flovent and found that the effectiveness of this therapy to be lacking. I would not recommend ProAir at all. It's a shame we can't use the effective product that has helped so many.

I miss my old inhaler.  I used to take one puff of my old inhaler and feel fine for a very long time, sometimes even day.  This inhaler is very ineffective and I have to take it constantly.  I don't understand why we can't have our old inhalers back.  This is ridiculous.  Many people are suffering now because of someone's bright idea to take away medicine that actually helped us.

Since using this product 30 mins before and after intense cardio exercise, I have produced phlegm (unlike before); a sore throat; coughing and hacking. I have now reas other reviewers and they confirm my suspicion that this is an inferior product for my symptoms. I also have used this with a spacer, which practice I will discontinue in the hope of getting a better impact. Thanks for sharing.

If I was really having an asthma attack, this would be worthless.  I don't get much if any relief from it.  My experience with this new-fangled inhaler has caused me to have considerable resentment toward tree huggers.  Third world countries are still using the CFC inhalers, which ARE effective, but here in the USA it's illegal to use them or import them.  And the cost!  My CFC inhaler was $8, and the new ones are $50 even WITH my insurance card.  I was totally shocked.  Why does the government think we will always have enough money to pay for their big fat ideas??  I don't know who forced this on us, but I think it's a very serious mistake.

I was feeling awful before and after using the product and just assumed it was allergies. However last night is when i figured it out. I was feeling ok but was having a somewhat hard time breathing so I decided to use my inhaler. It can only help right? No not at all. Within 10 minutes my hands started tremoring severly and my noes became all stuffy, very stuffy. I began to feel as if my throat was swelling shut, along with my noes. I was having a really hard time breathing. I began coughing and had to drink a lot of water to help relieve me. My temples have been hurting and I have head unusual headaches the past few days. My hand are still trembling today and its been well over 15 hours. Very scary experiance and the symptoms were occuring all weekend but I was finally able to pinpoint them from what had happened last night. Please be careful, this product did not help me at all.

It doesn't work for me at all and I am scared to exercise or do anything that will cause an asthma attack because I know the proair wont help. I think we should be able to get albuterol again. I think this whole &quot;going green&quot; was a good idea, but it failed. I would rather be able to breathe well than know that I am making our world a little greener. How is that going to help when all of us are dying from asthma attacks. I am very frustrated with this product. I don't feel safe using it. I use it a lot more frequently than I did the albuterol and it doesn't even work. I am very disappointed, and hope that maybe in the future they will switch back to medications that actually work.

They should discontinue this product it provides no relief for a very serious condition.

My pharmacy referred me to the lab that made them, and the lab said that they had a &quot;lot of complaints recently&quot; and had Teva's number at his fingertips... Upon calling Teva, I ended up with a recording requiring me to leave a message for a return call.  Still waiting.  It could be very dangerous to be out - say, riding my bike in the mountains and get caught in a rain - and have my inhaler decide not to work even though it is STILL FULL.  My question: why doesn't anyone post information on defective drugs (or defective batches) to make this easier for the consumers to get replacements?

Emphysema	can't breath with new inhaler, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	7/2/2009 10:38:11 AM	This is suppose to be a rescue inhaler. Thank God I didn't die. It doesn't work, it's more expensive. You want to quit messing with the ozone STOP sending the space shuttle up all the time so those of us need help to breath we can have our old inhalers back. Remember, we aren't the only ones who created ozone, others did to but you pick on certain groups. ashthma, copd patients, smokers, what group will be next and what will you take away from them. OBAMBA get your head out of your butt and fix this. If you watched a loved one die of copd, asthma or emphysemia you would make the FDA change thier minds about this new inhaler stuff.
Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/17/2009 9:22:13 AM	I hate this new inhaler! It cost almost $40 dollars with insurance when my other cost $10.I go through it a lot faster because there has to be a major defect with it and it gets clogged up. It really is so annoying... How would i go about getting my old albuterol inhaler??

I am on Singulair and Theophylline as well as Albuterol.  Since I have peen put on this inhaler, I have had heart problems that I never had before.  I do not know for sure if this medicine is the cause, but this is the only change I have unwillingly made.  This medicine is not as effective and I am more sick with my asthma as well as other problems  since I started taking this.

Asthma	Chris, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	25-34	4/17/2009 9:51:51 AM	With Albuterol, i was going 3-4 days between needing it. With ProAir, i am using it a few times a day. It works quickly for me, but i'm much more reliant on it than i want to be. Also, I'm having increased heart rate as well. I was on here looking for some explanation as ProAir is the only thing that has changed in my daily routines. I've also noticed that i am mildly irritable and i'm an easy going guy... HELP. New Solution. PLEASE.

Since going to the new inhalers his condition is bad. He doesn't get the relief as he did before. Like they say-junk and more expensive.

Usually by day #3 I am feeling relief with the help of my inhaler.  But this time I get no help from this inhaler and will need to see the doctor tomorrow if I don't improve.  I wish we could return to the old propellant inhaler--I have an old one that is the only thing givng me relief right now.
Asthma	GB, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	3/11/2009 9:51:17 AM	DITTO to most commenters here. Pro Air is junk and costs A LOT more $$$.  Slow to relieve breathing probs. I've had increased headaches, rapid heartbeat, blurry vision and trouble sleeping and sweats. Give me back my Albuterol and &quot;bleep&quot; the ozone.

Asthma Attack	luckyfrancine, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/9/2009 12:59:49 PM	I don't think that asthma inhalers are the place to cut out florcarbons. The old albuterol inhaler was very effective. Using the ProAir landed me in the ER. I stocked up on OTC Primatine inhalers despite the fact that they are harsh. People are going to die. I've had asthma all my life and the treatment protocols are always changing for the worse, and this is the worst change ever.

Asthma Attack	Kate, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	2/7/2009 7:31:30 PM	This inhaler DOES NOT work as a rescue inhaler for asthmatics. This will cost people lives.
Asthma	kajo55, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	2/3/2009 2:56:22 AM	&quot;Rescue&quot; inhaler??? Without the propellent which was containted in the Albuterol inhalers, this new inhaler is barely effective for me. The medication does not go deep enough into my bronchial tubes to be of much relief. I fear there will be a lot more asthma related hospitalizations and deaths. Seems a high price for a token gesture to be &quot;envirnmentally friendly&quot;. I see this as a giant step backwards in the treatment of asthma...we get a lesser quality product for nearly 3 times as much money. As a 60-yr-old severe asthmatic with no health insurance, I am very concerned. I want my Albuterol inhaler back! 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	2/2/2009 12:23:46 PM	does not work--- costs me 3 times more $$$$

Asthma	maschad, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	1/8/2009 10:02:35 AM	I have had asthma for 12 years and have had to switch to ProAir HFA inhaler as my fast-acting inhaler in place of albuterol/Preventil. I have been on Advair as well as preventative asthma medicine. I am aware of the propellant issue and adjusted to it accordingly. Generally, it works somewhat.However, I have had nothing but problems with this inhaler since the beginning of use. I have learned how to use it accurately, but have at times found it insufficient for relief and have had problems with the dispenser. It won't release medicine despite the frequency of cleaning. Further, I have had break-through attacks in which the ProAir still leaves me breathless, but with a burning chest, and sometimes feeling worse. My pharmacist insists on its effectiveness, but I believe he has never tried it.

This is a product being added to our gasoline! This stuff burns and has made my worse.If there are any better please post and save lives.I will die if this is all I have.
Asthma	annd, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1		55-64	12/21/2008 9:45:35 AM	I cannot agree more. This drug is dangerous. I have had Asthma for 35 yrs. I have swelling, asthma attacks, dizzy. I know we have to protect the ozone but look at all the chemicals the company plants put into the ozone. I don't personally see how our inhalers damage the air. They don't care about our breathing just getting what they want. If their children or themselves were using it it would be a different story. Do no use the Zopenex it is worse than the ProAir. All of the HFC is dangerous. Any meds you take read the side effects first. That would cause you much less trouble and you would know up front what to expect and you can make and informed decision for yourself. I have Asthma, COPD, Glacoma, Emphysma(never smoked)and on Oxygen 24/7. I have only 41/47 percent lung function. I desperately need something I can use. I am severely allergic to most medications. The regular Albuterol is the ONLY thing I can use. I will now have to start using 2 nebulizers, 1 for home and 1 to carry with me. And they are NOT a short term to stop the attacks quickly.

Asthma	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	11/16/2008 10:16:46 AM	I'm sure the medication would work even better if I could afford it. then i could take it as directed. So I usually find myself in the ER once every 2-3 month.

Asthma	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	11/11/2008 10:21:12 PM	I have had asthma for 25 years and my albuterol inhaler has worked for me all this time.  This new one is crap! Its delivery system sucks! I have had worse attacks since having been forced to use this one because someone thought the regular inhalers were harming the environment!  Well, this inhaler is harming my health!! Guess I will have to see if I can get a good inhaler in Canada!

Other	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	11/3/2008 11:53:36 AM	I have been using this *replacement for about two weeks for effect of cold, worse always as previous chain smoker. I hate this med.... burns throat, feel jittery and nauseous. Spray miniscule, compared to previous albuterol. Rapid heartbeat for long time after taking.... and usually perfect blood pressure before. What else don't we know about this.?????
Asthma Attack	Eddie, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	35-44	10/23/2008 11:28:40 PM	ProAir simply doesn't work ... the pharm's Doctors who evaluated this product &quot;claim&quot; that this product works just as well as the old inhalers.  Well although the quantity of med may be the same that is released, the propellant is far less, and there is NO immediate difference if you're having a bad attack.  Stay away from this product, and try to get a old inhaler from Canada where they're still available.  Also, sign the FDA complaint form, and call your congressman.
Asthma	Jennatrz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	10/18/2008 10:46:44 PM	This product doesn't work very well.  The Albuterol is much better.
Asthma Attack	sallyjane, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	10/7/2008 5:02:14 PM	This med is AWFUL. For one thing there is no generic, so instead of the two dollars I was paying for another inhaler, it is now 22 dollars. Then it doesn't even work. According to drug reps it is just as effective &quot;if taken properly&quot; I don't know about you, but I have had asthma 32 years and never once during an attack could I take an inhaler &quot;as directed&quot; Gore maybe thrilled that this inhaler is 'saving the air&quot; but I guarentee asthma realated deaths will increase dramatically when this med replaces proventil.

I havent noticed any results and i have been feeling terrible since my attacks and since using ProAir. I may just need a different medication, but I, personally, do not recommend this product.

It just doesn't work as well as the Albuterol I have been using. It makes me feel awful. Make me cough and swelling as well. Since I have read the side effects that is the reason for the swelling of my hands and feet and face. My doctor told me their is another Albuterol that is not the HFA but I can't remember what it is. But I know it is the old Albuter and not the HFC. I will repost when I call and find out what the name of it is so maybe it will help someone else as well.

Asthma	Candy56, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	3/22/2008 8:52:57 PM	You know that old saying &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;.  The canister constantly got clogged up. I had to run water through it to unclog it. If you're out in the middle of no-where, the inhaler wont work if it gets clogged up.  I switched back to the Proventil HFA. I rather pay more money for medicine that will work.

I used it for about a week &amp; then I had a severe reaction to it. My throat almost closed completely! I was given Proventnal in place of it but it swells my face and hands. Good thing I always carry Benadryl with me. I have no clue what I will use after this year, my pharmacy just started restocking on albuterol again. Has anyone else had allergic reactions to this med?

CFC devices will no longer be sold soon so you will have to switch to some type of HFA device eventually.

Be careful and see if it works, for me it does not.
