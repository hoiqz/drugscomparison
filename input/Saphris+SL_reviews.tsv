I have taken steps to take my wants a little slower because i am not 18  so i am reminding myself that i have to ease into working out and big projects as a kid would have done with no thinking, has anybody else had this energy and sex drive change?

It made me extremely sleepy, which was great since I took it at bedtime.  However, I had WILDLY RESTLESS LEGS AND ARMS!!!  The only thing that helped was walking, or because I was so drowsy, stumbling around the house.  I desperately wanted to sleep, but couldn't because of the constant urge to move.  I will NEVER take this medicine again!

I take 5mgs orally at bedtime and not only has it helped me sleep, but it has balanced out my moods and my thinking. I have not experienced any side affects from this medication and I definitely give it a high rating. If you suffer from anxiety and/or Bi-Polar depression disorder, I recommend a combination of Saphris and Vistaril. Consult with your doctor before taking these medications to make sure they are right for you, almost all medications do side affects so talk with your doctor about your medicine options. Thanks!

It gives a slight tingling of the tongue and bitterness but at this stage I hardly notice it and it passes in less than 20 minutes. It is helping me so much to feel alert, think clearly and sleep easily. Also I have found I eat less and am not as hungry as I was on Abilify and am finally losing weight again which I am really grateful for. I was suffering major depression and anxiety and combine Cymbalta with Saphris for these conditions. I can now honestly say I have no more symptoms of either condition and am truly delighted. It's definitely worth trying especially if you have found other antipsychotics to be a problem.

Other	lmcar_64, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	6/3/2012 1:37:42 PM	This was prescribed for severe insomnia.  I do get a full night's deep sleep with Saphris.  The only trouble I have experienced is that I am in such a deep sleep I have began wetting the bed.  I already have problems with bladder spasms but the medication I am on for that along with bladder suspension surgery had that under control.  As I've only been taking Saphris for two nights, I plan to continue to use it a while longer but begin wearing incontinence pads at night &amp; protect the bedding.  I also suffer with depression and bipolar disorder and feel it is beginning to help those conditions as well.  Overall, I feel this is a good medication.
Manic Phase of Manic-Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	5/26/2012 6:00:03 AM	I was given this medicine to help calm my mind and induce better sleep patterns. I can't stand taking this medicine because it causes restless leg syndrome, fast heartbeat, and has actually worsened my mood. It is impossible to sleep with restless legs. When I do get to sleep, I feel like I just came off of anesthesia when I wake up. I drool, slur my speech, and eat like I haven't seen food in weeks during the day so people think I'm drunk or high at work. Please communicate with your doctor/psychiatrist if this drug doesn't work well for you because there are better solutions.
Schizophrenia	ramborob79, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	5/19/2012 2:28:38 PM	Be careful this stuff is strong! It makes me extremely tired about 30 min after I take it at night until morning.I eat or drink the next morning and it wears off quickly.It is the only antipsychotic ive tried that I can function as well the next day without being tired most of the time.Hopefully I can take it only once a day at night because it is strong at this point and it would be hard to function taking it twice a day.I think they should make a lower dose to start people out on in case they are allergic or extra sensitive to saphris or even antipsychotics.Doctors should be extra careful with this medicine but for me it has been the best one.

This drug has more mind altering effects than lsd I mean major mind alter effects like changing your whole settings from rock n roll to country and lets talk about memory problems memory lapse and collapse you start thinking and acting a way you did 10 years before you might be new to Saphris but give it a year 
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	confused!!, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2		35-44	4/29/2012 10:46:41 PM	Approx. 23 yrs ago I was diagnosed a Manic-Depressive/Bi-Polar2. I've been through the ringer as far as medications are concerned. After many years of different medications, I'm now taking Valium, Saphris &amp; Buspar. I've only been on the Saphris for 11 days now, after months of Seroquel found to be ineffective for me. I can tolerate the numbness/tingling of my mouth as well as the nasty taste (wish that was the worst part of it). I realize that as with all meds they take time to take full affect. In the short time I've been on the 10mg dose, I'm finding that I have a very LOW tolerance for anything. I get rather irritated &amp; have less of a tolerance for anything. I can't say for sure it's the meds but I can say I'm not usually agitated to the point of throwing things, screaming about what seems to be nothing &amp; wanting to physically beat something or someone. This I find extremely disturbing and am unsure if it's normal &amp; will pass or if I need to seek help. I have mixed feelings about this med. Hopefully my next visit to my Dr will help explain something. I would recommend asking about things of this nature before agreeing to take the medication.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	mizzfit, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/23/2012 11:30:33 AM	I was prescribed this for bipolar I.  I am also taking lexapro.  Taking this drug sublingually is a pain, mainly because it tastes horrible.  I am also convinced that this drug caused the severe panic attacks I was having, which seemed dose-dependent (I was on both 5 and 10 mg of Saphris).  Upon first taking the drug, I would get severe restless legs that would last for about 3 hours.  The drug makes me very drowsy, but it was hard to sleep with severely restless legs.  This side effect went away after about a week on the drug.  I am no longer taking this drug because I found it ineffective and could not tolerate the panic  attacks.  The attacks are pretty much gone now that I am off of the Saphris.

For years i was treated with risperdal, seroquell, haladol and others and nothing worked. Within days of starting Saphris my symptoms drastically reduced. I function normally now with very few episodes of voices. My only complaint is the taste of the stuff but i can live with it.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	4	Female	45-54	3/11/2012 6:31:20 AM	Been taking Saphris for almost two weeks. Started at 5mg at bedtime and after 4-days added 5mg in the morning.  While my emotional state has improved TREMEMDOUSLY, my sleep has worsened which I will discuss at my next Dr. appt.  I do, however, notice that after I take the tablet under my tongue and wait the 10-min before eating/drinking/teeth brushing, I feel physically awful.  Neasua but no vomiting, headach.  If I can sleep it off, I am ok which works for the PM dose, but the AM dose not so much as I have to work.  I've tried eating something before taking the pill as well as 15-min after with no improvement.Has anyone else experienced this?  How did you handle it?Thanks!

I felt so good and could function again with ease.  Now I have been on 20mg a day and I have feel more depressed and can't function.  I was really hoping this would work as I've been on other medicines before it but will have to go back to abilify.

I had to get my husband to take to the bathroom and bring me back, I had all the bad side effects, Just had catact surger in my left eye the week before and cause me not to see as good as I did when I had the surgery. Plus I gained weight over night and legs and feet start swelling.  I will never be on the drug ever again. I was serverely manic at the time and my doctor told me to watch how I take it because I was so sensitve to medicine in the first place. I don't recommend anyone taking this medicine.  My doctor did what he thought was best when he gave it to me and if I had any problems to get off of it which I did.
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	Charlotte mom, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	12/12/2011 8:14:41 AM	I have been on Saphris for two years now and it works great for my bi polar 1 but I have put on 50 lbs since I started it and I am really having a hard time getting the weight off. Its slow going but I am sticking to the Atkins diet of 20 cars a days and exercising everyday 15 min. of cardio and 45 mins of yoga and i am drinking 64oz of water a day which in a large squirt bottle is quit easy. I am losing 1-2 lbs a week and my goal is one year to lose all the weight. Saphris makes me hungry but the more water i drink the more full I feel and it cleans out all of the toxins in my body so I would highly recommend my routine for anyone who is suffering with the weight gain. Best of luck

But then I started to gain the weight and I am not happy with it at all.  I worked very hard to take off the pounds and now I have to do it all again.  So now I am on something different.  So lets hope that it works.

It does taste bad, but it is nothing compared to the agony/misery of this past year. Abilify worked great for me but i gained a lot of weight and i was just to whatever, so to speak. I laid around all the time.  I still feel like me on this med. I still have my passion, my sense of humor..etc. I hope it stays this way. So far so good. What a relief. I was very sedated the first few nights on 5mg. However, i am now on 10 at bedtime and it knocks me out. I might have to cut back on the trazodone i usually take for sleep. I am wondering if it will ever be possible to take one in the morning...whew..i would hate to be that messed up and try to function. I'm very happy with this med and i have renewed hope, again..!!! hang in there..never give up!

Unlike other drugs, I have no problem with weight gain, blood sugar and am loosing weight again, which improves my mood by itself.Unlike Serequel, while it puts me to sleep at night easily, I wake up wide and refreshed with no hang over.And did I say it doesn't make me hungry after taking it so no weight gain.I still believe the best anti-depressent is exercise so this supports that 100%.I am thrilled with this new drug.

The second night I kept waking up due to restlessness...I absolutely hated the way it made me feel. I was so sleepy but could not rest. After 1 week, I'm at work crying ALL DAY and back and forth to the bathroom crying, crying and crying so much all day. Then comes the thoughts that death has to be better than living like this. My mom was livid and hated seeing me like that. I had to stay with her because she wouldn't let me go home by myself. I haven't felt a low like this in a veyr, very long time. I stopped taking it on my own. I'll never be in this again. But the black cherry flavor was better. If you ever feel like this call you're doctor immediately...I've been through the works with these meds and just ready to stop ALL of them...I am way too sensitive to these side effects. I'm tired of the up and downs with these. But I must say that the Saphris was the worst...Good luck if you're taking this...

After the first 2 days I noticed a tremendous difference in my mood. I felt great. I wasnt as depressed, I felt very calm, and actually had alot of energy. I seemed to have a peacefullness feeling.  I also have taken Depakote, Seroquel and others medications that did not work and had horrible side effects.  I was very hesitant about starting another new medication because I had taking everything and nothing seemed to work. This is like a miracle for me! I have noticed my hands and feet have swollen when I awake in the morning but it eventually goes away after a few hours once I start moving around. So far that is the only side effect.  I start on 10mg tonight. Hopefully it will still keep improving.  If everything else has failed I would definiely give this medication a try.  Within the first couple of days I could definitely tell a tremendous difference. It definitely puts me to sleep within an hour after taking it at night and I do sleep alot better.

Additional Medications to Treat Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/5/2011 1:29:32 PM	Saphris has basically changed my life. I have been suffering with BP II for 22 years (heavy on the depression), and this little, awful-tasting pill has given me hope I've never had. I've been on it for about a year, and it's still working. The only side effect I've had is tiredness. I take it before bed to minimize the effect, but I still wake up very tired. Sometimes it afects my ability to start the day. Still, the benefits greatly outweigh the side effect. My advice....ask for the black cherry flavor only! It's hardly tasty, but 200% better than the taste of the original.
Other	down and desperate, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4		45-54	8/30/2011 6:31:19 PM	I have had the diagnosis of Bipolar for over 10 years so first I would like to start by saying that I am cautiously optimistic. But this is the first time that I have been this satisfied with a Med. so fast. Severely depressed and totally stressed out, I had pretty much given up hope of ever seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I had to try. People talk about the taste...it's nothing compared to the hell that I have just returned from. It took me a couple of nights to adjust to the added intoxication but even that's nothing in comparison to what life was before Saphris. I'm sure there will be adjustments...seems like there always are with me but I pray that it continues to work.

My doctor decided to put me on Saphris after Seroquel, Depakote ER, Trazodone, Effexor, Zyprexa and Elavil all shut down my thyroid and caused rapid weight gain and fluid retention. It leaves me slightly hungry after I take it but overall it helps regulate my sleep pattern as well as my moods.

Results are great for me so far. Benefits include no more suspicious odors of harmful impact. Side effects are very low.  My motivation level is through the roof, it is not really restlessness and it is not really akathisia. I don't have anxiety any more like I did on the other meds. I have to take trazadoone for sleep since saphris interferes with my sleep.

First &amp; second doses seemed to agree with her. Third dose, she suddenly was having difficulty standing, was confused, and had some muscle weakness. I do know that this med is making her sleepy, which at night is GREAT, but she needs to take it during the day as well. Wonder if these &quot;side effects&quot; will go away with a little time. She also has a history of seizures, but she has not had any since starting Saphris. My daughter would say that she was hearing voices, but hasn't mentioned the voices since she started on this med. However, it may be too soon to tell if Saphris made those voices go away for good.

My entire mouth filled with saliva that caused a numbness that in some places burned. I slept great, not too heavy but I did awaken twice. Oddly I was extremely tired in the morning after arising. Not sure if it will address the paranoia in the long term but I am hopeful. I was afraid to take it because of all the bad reveiws. It didnt kill me so I guess I will give it a chance.

The doctor at the hospital responsible for my med management put me on 5mg of Saphris at bedtime...no one checked on me until morning. All night I had body aches and couldn't walk when I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. That morning with the nurse came to check my blood pressure I had 2 major seizurs which led to major memory loss and head trauma. Scary stuff....be careful if you decide to take this and make sure someone is monitoring you throughout the day and night that you first begin taking it.  Good luck. There are lots of good meds, but this one is very new.

Nothing else seems to work on my irritability and aggression and even my family has commented that it has made a great difference in how I relate to people.  The black cherry version is much better than the original in taste and I dont think my tongue stings for as long.

I have had bipolar for over 2 years now and again have tried many medications to treat it. most of the attempted medication gave me horriable side effects and allergic reactions. when i decided to take this medication i was seriously not prepared for the taste! i saw on the reviews that it was horriable but i thought its no big deal i have others that are much worse. yea right! this is bad, i even thought the black cherry would be ok that the flavor would cover up most of the taste.. Man was i wrong. It is officially the worst tasting medication! it even made my tounge numb for 30 min... other than that the medication is great. it has not completly taken my symptoms of bipolar away but has relieved a lot of issues i was having...

Wow, I wake up in the AM well rested and alert, not groggy and wanting to stay in bed all day like with Seroquel.  I had some trouble waking up too early but switching my depression med (nortriptyline) to the evening and adding a little more benzo's is working very well and I've been sleeping 7 to 8 hours a night.  Seroquel had me way overweight but with Saphris I'm loosing weight.  The first 3 days I lost 10lbs. probably all water, but since then I'm still loosing about a pound a week a total of 18 pounds so far.  I still have food cravings like with Seroquel, but not as bad.  I seem to be overeating less than before and can stop eating when I'm full.

I have been taking it for a month now.  I took 5 mg at night for 20 days and have been taking 10mg at night for the rest of the time.  The taste is awful for sure.  But as soon as it dissolves I throw 2 altoids in my mouth and chew them up.  That really helps.  I do binge for about 30 min after the med kicks in.  It kicks in fast.  I make sure to binge on healthy food and do not allow unhealthy food in the house to binge on.  So far no wt gain.  Then I immediately fall asleep.  The sleep is good but I do wake up about every 2 hours, but fall right back to sleep.  I make sure to stay very well hydrated with water and unsweet tea.Since increasing my dose I have noticed a lot of irritability, but it coincided with PMS time, so I am waiting to see which is actually causing the anger and irritability.  Psychosis is completely gone! NO paranoia at all now.  I have been disabled from BP and other mental dx, and am able to work part time now.  I have taken ALL new and old ap's and above all, this is the best one I have tried so far.con: sex drive is completely gone.  And when I do have sex with my hubby I cant climax.  hopefully pdoc will have an answer for that this week!

I have tried every possible anti-depressant marketed with the exception of a few. I had no choice but to retire from a 20 year career. After about a year with my new physc, trying basically all the new anti-depressants on the market, it would relieve some of the symptoms for a short period of time then nothing!! At last we thought we had found the right combination of meds to deal with my illness. I started taking Celexa, Lamactil, xanax and trazadone. That lasted for about 2 years then my symptoms came back with a vengance!! My doctor gave me samples of Saphris SL, discontinued the Celexa and cut my trazadone in half, they told me about the terrible taste so I was expecting that. I have been on the Saphris SL for about 4 weeks at bedtime and stopped the trazadone because the combination was so sedating. I would sleep for 2-3 hrs and wake up sometimes needing to go the the restroom and I couldn't even function, I could hardly hold my eyes open and my coordination was limited at best, much to my regret, I have turned into a monster! I have never been a violent person even with my illness. My family noticed the change in me after about 2 weeks of taking the medication and I am gaining weight rapidly and serious swelling all over. I did start to notice that pretty much anything anyone said to me made me angry. I blew it off as stress, but never have I experienced such aggitation before. I continued to take the medication for 2 more weeks trying to give it a fair shot. Last night to my horror I started throwing everything I could find at the wall!!!! I grabbed my car keys and off I went. Thankfully I arrived home safe., I knew it had to be the medication. Last night I quit taking it and will NEVER take it again.  I DO NOT recommend this. Please read ALL of the reviews on this medication. If it works,I wish you the best.

The taste however is terrible and is a rather unpleasant experience. Once you have been on it for 6mos-1yr you get used to it. I have been taking saphris for a while now and it has worked wonders for me. I have really bad insomnia and saphris allowed me to finally get some sleep. Before I began taking saphris I went with 20 hours sleep for a period of two week straight. 720 hours in one month. With two weeks at 20 v 336 hours you can only imagine how bad the first two months were. Saphris was a god send for my bipolar disorder I disorder. The side effects are becoming a nuisance but I am happy to be stable.

For three days I felt human--if slightly hypomanic. Then, I went into a horrible mixed state. By the fifth day I was having visual hallucinations and in a full mania. I am BP1 and already on two anti/d and Vyvanse, which is an amphetamine because EVERYTHING makes me sleepy. I want to stay on the Saphris and think/wonder if I can discontinue the Vyvanse and not have the mixed mania. We'll see how it works.....

In the morning I felt like my head was spinning out of control, could not walk properly.  Never felt so sick in my life, later in the day I had the urge to binge on everything in the fridge.  I stopped taking this medication and will be discussing the results with my DR.

My daughter started this medication and had to go to the ER that night because she passed out and we could not get a heart beat on her. I will never allow her to use this again. I hope it was an allergic reaction only, but recomend caution to anyone starting this med. Have a family member close by.

I take 10mg in the morning and 10mg at night. It makes me tired i feel like doing nothing and my anger has gotten worse I just flip out for no reason sometimes or vice versa I will be sad for no apparent reason. All in all it hasnt been the worst drug I have taken but it certainly isn't the best either. So if your over weight to begin with I wouldnt reccomend this medication at all cause it will make you gain a lot of weight! and also if you love sex i wouldnt take it either like i said my drive is non existent.

I have been on so many combinations of meds that I can't even write them down. I have not gained weight, I lost weight. I  had episodes of psychosis and was put on saphris. Since then I feel great. The taste is horrible but I got used of it. I'd rather put up with the horrible taste than lose touch with reality again. You do get used of the taste. I have to only take it at night because it will knock me out. But that is a good thing for me. I go thru periods that I don't sleep or sleep only 2 or 3 hrs a night. I have had a great experience with saphris and love it. The best medication I have been on. I started taking it in April 2010. Its great because I'm not a huge combination of meds like in the past. I have narrowed it down to just taking saphris and topamax. Oh, I did have a period that I was really depressed but dr. put me on wellbutrin and felt a little better after that. No longer on wellbutrin. I feel great, no episodes of psychosis in 8 months, I feel stable. One thing I did notice is that if I did miss one or two doses it would effect my moods in a big way. Have to make sure you take everyday!!!

It does cause your tongue to go numb with unusual taste.  I do not like how it makes me want to binge eat a few minutes after taking it.  I can only take at night before bed because it knocks me out.  I have gained a ton of weight because of this so I am not going to continue using it.  I would recommend you try it you may not have the urge to binge. We all metabolize medication differently.  I just cant afford to keep gaining weight after Depakote and this Saphris I am depressed from weight gain.  I have to try something that wont cause me to retain water or binge eat at night.  Good Luck! It does work just not the right med for me.

Just a waiting game now.

Give yourself a 6-8 hour time frame to rest. The taste is bad but so far the effects are going very well for me. I have been Bipolar for many many years and I have been on many different medications. I have trouble sleeping but when I take this before I lay down I wait the 10 minutes like I am suppose to and drink something with flavor to wash the taste away. Yes it does make my mouth under my tongue numb(where I put it) to dissolve. If you can keep it under your tongue do it. My normal reaction on first couple doses brought it above my tongue. Don't its worse tasting and makes your whole tongue numb. Then I lay down and that is all I remember for the next few hours. Don't try to do anything after taking it, Just rest. The side effects I do not have yet and may not have. I am in the time frame of my most possible manic state of the month, I do not feel that everything is 100 fold worse then it really is. I can say this is working for me. Please keep in mind when reading these reviews that most of us are in a state of saddness, moody, etc... it is why we are taking it to begin with. No medication has it full effect for at least 30-40 days. When trying this medication please give it 30-40 days before you decide on its full effect for you.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	red, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	11/8/2010 11:27:57 PM	Before starting Saphris I had never once gotten relief from any other medication I had tried for my mixed and rapidly cycling states. I was in a deep suicidal depression and my new psychiatrist decided to try Saphris on me. Within two days I could feel the depression lift. Just as others have reported the first three doses knock you off your feet, literally. When you wake up (especially without a full nights sleep) you almost feel like you are in a drunken state. The medication doesn't taste horrible, but it definitely is unpleasant. Your mouth goes numb, there is a lot of drool, and you can't eat or drink for 10 minutes. Definitely the worst part of my day. However, I have tried Seroquel, Depakote, Abilify, Cymbalta(made me go SUPER MANIC), Lexapro, and countless others. I'm a little over a month in and I've had to gradually increase my dose but it has worked well. The depression went away within days and hasn't came back and my rapid bursts of hypomanic/manic behavioral symptoms gradually have faded. Before Saphris I was coming off of a roller coaster that had given me 40 hours sleep in 20 days, a depression so deep I was giving up on life, and a lost faith in medication. No drug works the same for everyone but I do recommend that you at least give this one two weeks and see how it turns out. I haven't experienced any of the muscle twitches but I do have hand tremor. A little tremor is worth the sleep and stability I am getting, I just wish this drug was a little cheaper.

Not only was it awful tasting but the part of my tongue and underneath it where the pill came in contact became numb within just a few seconds. Less than 10 minutes later my speech was slurred, was dizzy and couldn't keep my balance. When I went to bed just a few minutes later I found my legs were &quot;jumpy&quot;, constantly jerking keeeping me from being able to rest or sleep. In the morning I woke up with a bad headache, still dizzy, stumbling, and slurring. It took another 7 hours of sleep for the effects to wear off so that I was functional, and another 3 hours before I was back to normal. I will NOT take this again.

This drug has squashed the mania and psychosis, but has spurred on a depression so deeply, that I know I won't climb out unless I go off of it. I am flatlined with no emotion except overwhelming sadness. This is not me, it is the drug. As for the taste, if you're desperate enough like me, it's something you have to endure. Takes like you're sucking on codeine cough syrup, but I had high hopes and didn't care. I'm going to the doc this morning. It's that or a hospital, and that's not an option.

My spouse says I'm a grouch when I forget to take my pill by 7:30 PM.  So, far.  Taking the pill in the AM is problematic.  I and the Doctor are both waiting another month and then I will start taking the AM pill.  The initial druggyness worries me because I am a working professional and - well I do not need more problems than what I have now.  Reasoning - I was hospitialized and tried several meds.  I even took a month off from work.  With Saphris, life goes on.  Thoughts of taking my life are fading away.  The manic appears to be slowed but I need more time to adequately evaluate.  I am sorry others appear to be having problems.  A one or two time use doesn't give this drug a chance to really start working.  I am on for over two months.  Hey!  I am alive versus the alternative.

I felt crazy. I could not think rationally. But of course it did zonk me out.Then for awhile I have been trying 1/3 of a pill at night. It helps me sleep, but has no effect on depression. Mania may be more. Or perhaps, with such a small dose, there is no daytime effect. I am going to stop taking it. It scares me.

Schizophrenia	theguy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	25-34	9/7/2010 3:48:52 AM	I took this because it has no weight gain and I was happy with losing weight because of it. The cons bad tasting and having too wait ten minutes to eat or drink.Here is where it went bad.I had OCD when I was a child and it went away ,but it all started off with getting my car modified and I was not happy with the job and decided to start fixing my car and was angry , then my friends and family told me leave your car alone. It became an obsession working on my car. I ended up ruining my car and I tried fixing it ,but things kept getting worse. OK now I will get to the point, this medicine gave me obsessive compulsive disorder bad and made me an angry person. I now have a bill worth 2 grand to have my car fix because I can't control obsession when I am on this med. I quit it and started crying for the first time in 8 months because I hurt my car.

I take lithium and xanax also,  the xanax helps with the restlessness.  Overall it works, thats why I put up with the side effects.  I'm 43 and my body can't handle the highs anymore.

Couldn't stand the way it made my body feel. I was dizzy &amp; groggy (physically slow, not mentally). So my dr switched me to 10 mg at bedtime.  HATED the bodily sensations! I stopped after 3 days. For me, the taste wasn't too bad, it did numb my mouth. But the worst was the jitteriness of my body (restless leg, &amp; arm?). Made my body feel thick, but didn't put my brain to sleep. I've tried most of the older meds, most recently 800 mg of Seroquel XR; nothing seems to control my rapid cycling, mixed episodes for very long. But I do not recommend Saphris.

I had severe wrist pain in both wrists, headaches, neck pain, and sleep disturbances.

I was on Saphris for over six months and my pain steadily got worse.  It was excruciating.  Please be aware of DIP when taking Saphris!!!

The depakote worked, but three out of three dr's say it's causing breast milk. As if you don't feel sexy enough to gain weight and be psycho?  The saphris dissolves quickly, tastes like poo, and makes your mouth numb. However, my agitation is alot less, I have noticed some more anxiety, but that's what the xanax is for. I have noticed more joint pain than before, and the pain meds don't work as well on saprhis. How is this possible? All in all, I'm alive, and need less sleep than with depakote. I can actually wake up at a decent hour...but it's honestly more time for joint pain. BLECH

But having tried literally every other drug similar to this in the past 12 years, I am getting the best results I have ever had with any of them.  And it is fairly weight-neutral - nothing a little extra time at the gym and some good food choices won't overcome.  NOTHING like the 40 pounds I put on in 8 weeks with Zyprexa.  Currently, I take 10 mg of Saphris each night with 60 mg of Prozac each morning...and my depression is better than is has been in years (without being manic).My advice: just put up with the taste for 10 minutes.  Its not that bad if you do it carefully...and Id much rather have a bitter taste in my mouth followed by a little temporary numbness than the crazy weight gain I was getting from other atypical antipsychotics I was being prescribed for my treatment resistant depression (which has been argued to be Bipolar II Disorder...but really, what does the specific diagnosis matter?  I was super depressed for a long time...and now I'm not).Now heres the catch: my insurance is NOT covering this drug yet.  Luckily my psychiatrist has been giving me samples for like 6 months now.  Hope we can keep this arrangement up until this gets added to my insurance formulary (or we can successfully appeal the insurance company to cover it).  I really dont want to go back to the way things were before I found this drug.Every drug works differently for every person.  But if you have tried all the other options, dont be scared to try this one.  A bitter taste in your mouth is a small price to pay for what might be the right med choice for you.Oh, and when I started taking the Saphris, I started seeing positive results within my first week of taking it.  I wasn't cured overnight or anything like that, but things started getting noticeably easier within the first few days of having this med. Good luck, and dont be scared to try it  it may be the wonder drug for you!  I know it was for me...

It interfered with my sleep/made the mixed state worse and during the hot weather recently, I developed heat stroke in spite of mostly being in air conditioning and ended up in the hospital.

The taste was horrible, it's nearly impossible to wait an entire 10 minutes before drinking something. My entire tongue, lower jaw and throat were numb for at least 20 mins later. I haven't noticed any improvement in my depression.  I actually feel more depressed than usual after taking this medication for over a month. The worst part is by far the taste, followed by the massive weight gain. I have gained 12 lbs. in one month!! The medication caused drowsiness for about an hour, but I still couldn't sleep throughout the night.  Sleep was restless. Not convinced so far, especially for the high cost.

Kind of leary when Dr. prescribed this sublingual, but the difference is amazing! I HATE the taste and when it dissolves it fills my mouth with saliva as well as numbs my tongue.  I also hate having to wait ten minutes after to eat or drink. It's the worst part of my day.  However, prior to starting this medicine I was constantly thinking about suicide or attempting it, my moods were all over the place with rage, impatience, and lack of motivation and I hadn't written anything worthwhile in over a year.  I also was only getting about two hours of sleep a night.  This medication does make me drowsy so, I take it right before I go to bed and sleep like a baby, waking up pert and perky (something that's never happened until now).  No signs of depression or suicidal thoughts and I love the fact that I feel like a normal woman.  It's really been a miracle for me and even my husband has noticed. I've been on this about a week, so I hope Saphris is the one for me. So far I haven't had any negative side effects.

Taking with Paxil and it seems to help some, but dr increased Paxil too, so not sure which one is working on the depression.  I wouldn't say my tongue gets numb - it's like drinking a really hot cup of coffee &amp; burning your tongue, but it only lasts a hour.  Awful taste goes away quick.  I take it at night and it makes me drowsy &amp; helps me sleep, tho I read about people having restless legs with it.  I already have that so not sure, but I feel more rested the next morning so I guess I have the opposite reaction.  We'll see.  Already had weight gain with Abilify and only been on Saphris for 10 days, so not sure about that side affect.  I want to continue and see what happens - maybe it's just the increase in Paxil that helped!

The drug seems to be helping but the tossing and turning for 2.5 hours is excruciating, especially b/c it makes me so tired.

However I am now experiencing what is known as a flat affect. Kind of scary.  Is this normal?

Crazy behavior like taking the sheets off the bed and hiding clothing items. Insisting all electric powered items be turned off like the tv or computer or ceiling fans. Not able to sleep and is causing paranoid feelings that I have never had before.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	Bipolar, but not stupid, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	45-54	3/29/2010 11:37:46 PM	I am Bipolar-I Mix States, Rapid Cycler, Medication Resistant, with Psychotic tendencies, and this was my second attempt attrying this medication in as many months: Both attempts fail due to extreme lethargy and inability to function, even after twelve hours of continuous sleep. I would wake and remain useless and tire for an addition two hours. My behavior is far more irritable than ever before, and I find myself full of anger and wanting to pound my fists through the wall, or destroy sometime just because it was within arms reach. I find the taste of this medication absolutely repulsive. My appetite has spiraled out of control and I have gained 17 pounds in the last two months. My Diabetes is hyperglycemic with blood sugars above 200, thus requiring higher than normal insulin injections with greater CC's of insulin per injection. Finally, the copayment is prohibitive, even after insurance pays their pittance-share.I do not reccommend this medication whatsoever. I will never try it for a third time.D. Gordon Tipton

Nightmares/night paraylsis from Seraquel stopped immediantly. Wake up in the morning rested. It does make me hungary all the time, but I am cheating and taking an anti appeite pill (OTC) but again talked to the MD (I hate being bipolar and am terrified of going off the deepend so I ask a lot before I let my meds get messed up). If I start gaining weight I will probably stop the meds though.  I found (per the recommeded of another rating on this site) that rinsing with mouthwash before taking the pill really helps a lot. And I put it in my check instead of under my tongue

I took it for 3 months. I became severely depressed while taking it. It was the worst depression I have been through in my 11 years of dealing with this horrible mental illness. I became completely psychotic and suicidal. I put a dangerous weapon to my throat and wanted to die. I hurt myself with a dangerous weapon and was taken to the ER.

I started the med on Monday &amp; was bursting into tears by Wed &amp; Thurs was awful (I bawled over Ray Stevens Mississippi Squirrel Revival, no joke). Dr. doesn't work on Fri, so I have decided to give it until Mon when I can phone conference with her. Last night I awoke after two hours of good sleep and was up the rest of the night, finally took a klonopin in desperation &amp; did get a few hours sleep. I am not a happy camper and may have to get back on the zyprexa &amp; be satisfied with being a well adjusted fat person. Will update in a week.

I have been on saphris a little over 2 and a half months. I have continued gaining weight about 20 lbs I can account to this drug. My shrink said the norm is 4 lbs. She decided to do blood work to see what could be causing this continuous weight gain. I am even taking 50 mg of adderall a day!!! WELL&lt; my chloresteral levels were off the charts!!! I guess a good number is around 100 or so. I came in at 280!!!!!!! Somehow this mixes in with the weight gain, I don't yet know all I need to know. I am being put on an aspirin regimen and also have to take a pill to help get that level down before I have a heart attack. I have enough stress and anxiety daily and am very scared as my father had heart disease and heart attacks. I am only 34.SO PLEASE anyone trying saphris keep on top of it and get your blood levels checked. Wish you the best, Lucid
Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/22/2010 2:00:03 PM	I had read other reviews, but still decided to try this drug.  The taste is worse than I had imagined and the melting pill caused a gross foaming saliva.  My tongue was numb after a few minutes so gulping soda to rid the awful taste didn't even help.  I spent the next 2 1/2 hours kicking and tossing and turning in bed with restless legs.  Really wish I hadn't spent the money on a whole order.  FYI, the pills come in packs of 10 so I could've probably just bought 10.

The dissolving process is hell but it seems to be keeping my mania under control. However is seems somewhat useless towards my never ending depression. I have tried almost every other drug out there over the last 3 years and so far this seems to be a better drug for bi polar. Not happy with the weight gain, on top of my last weight gain from Invega and Abilify. I can only pray the drug keeps working and I can get this depression in order

I switched over from Seroquel XR once a day.  To beat the bad taste use Listerine breath strip or mouth spray when you take it.  This is a Doctor approved method.  Brushing the tongue 10 min. after taking the tablet helps with the numbness of the tongue.     It gets the residual medication out of your mouth as well. I still get tired about 1 hour after I take it in the morning or night.  This is the same side effect I had taking Seroquel.  However Seroquel knocked me out for 10 hours at night and did not affect me during work hours.  Saphris only seems to make me really tired for about one hour.  However I seem to have difficulty keeping my mind awake from about 9:00AM to noon.  I take my pills at regular intervals: 8-9:00PM at night and 6-7:00AM in the morning.

It took me a little while to get used to taste and the numbness it left in my mouth but after that it is not so bad.  With the goodness I get from it dealing with the bad taste is a small thing to deal with.

I took first dose at night and next day felt better than I had in 6 months, it does taste pretty bad,let dissolve and try to produce little saliva(if it is possible) and try not to swallow the medicine. maybe a patch would be a good idea? 
Other	Terrif, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	1/14/2010 12:50:09 AM	First, as others have stated...THE TASTE IS AWFUL. Are we being punished? Second, my entire mouth is numb for well over an hour - what's up with that? Third, for it's use as a mood stabilizer (in my case) it makes me agitated/anxious, so I need Klonazipam to level me. Also, right after I take it, I feel very spaced-out and my verbal skills are in the toilet. Dr. had me switch from p.m. to a.m. dose as it was affecting my sleep. I am also taking it every other day; EVERY DAY is way too much.  Very strange drug. While my energy is up and my thoughts are clearer, we will see where the build-up goes with the 40 days' samples.

Helps me sleep, but can't function until the dose wears off. Have taken it for two weeks and am not noticing much improvement in mania/mixed state. Side effects: (1.) after taking, tounge and throat are numb for up to an hour so I don't eat or drink because of possibility of choking, (2.) tastes terrible but the bad taste only lasts for a minute or two, (3.) Feet and ankles are swelling. My guess is this drug is probably more effective for schizophrenia than it is for bipolar.
