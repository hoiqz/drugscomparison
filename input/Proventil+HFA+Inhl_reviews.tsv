Asthma	Brugor, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male		7/14/2012 3:51:46 PM	I have used it for about six months. I may be getting resistant to it.  It used to last 6 hours, now only lasts about 4 hours.  I tried Qvar inhaler and Singulair pills, which have no effect on me at all.  Proventil is effective, although slower to act than the old albuterol.

Other	missy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	8/7/2011 5:00:21 AM	My Dr gave me one of these inhalers because I am having shortness of breath due to anxiety..but find it doesn't really help.  I've never used an inhaler before..but this one doesn't seem to make any difference.
Asthma	Gerbil89, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	7/28/2011 11:50:40 PM	When I feel an asthma attack coming, it helps within about 10 minutes, but the after effects drive me nuts. Sometimes I'd rather deal with the asthma attack. My hands shake, I get a headache, my heart starts racing and sometimes it makes it hard to BREATH. It works when I absolutely need it but I think I might try ProAir instead.

Asthma	mmartin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	6/8/2011 1:26:35 AM	I have had asthma for 22 years.  In the past, I have only had to use my inhaler if I was ill or sometimes following exercise.  I'm not sure if my asthma has gotten worse, or if it's a casualty of this replacement inhaler.  The new Proventil HFA is NO WHERE CLOSE to being as effective as the old Albuterol inhalers.  I am all for decreasing the amount of CFC's we release into the ozone, but are inhalers seriously that big of a concern compared to all of the factories, air conditioners, etc. that spew CFC's ALL DAY EVERY DAY?  I went to pick up my refill today, and was shocked to learn it's $68 (I am a student and without insurance).  I have to wonder if the EPA and Big Pharma are in on this together, or if it's just a &quot;happy coincidence&quot;.  Nearly every post I have seen and nearly every person I talk to says they have to use this BS inhaler more often, and that it is significantly less effective.  
Asthma	betty, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	45-54	2/18/2011 8:05:29 AM	I have been using this medicine for two weeks now and find that I have to use it more to relieve my breathing. Also now I have muscle cramps in my lower leg. This is one of the side affects, I am going to ask the Dr. if there is anything else I can take to relieve my asthma.

I can't believe they stopped making it. I'm disgusted with the fact that I have to pay $40 for a rescue inhaler when my old one worked just as well. It's great that someone wanted to clean up the environment, but it's criminal that they are charging everyone at least $35 for an inhaler that used to cost $5. This is a medication that some people can't live without and with the new prices, people can't afford it. I'm livid that there is no generic available. I'm half tempted to lock myself in a closet for the next 2 years while I wait for a generic because I simply can't afford to be out and about in a world full of allergens when I have to pay $40 for my inhaler! Ridiculous.
Bronchitis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	8/13/2010 11:18:01 AM	I LOVE this inhaler! I was using regular albuteral and almost ended up in the hospital. This inhaler helped immediately! I am able to breathe freely, it's a wonderful thing!
Asthma	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	19-24	8/11/2010 9:23:33 PM	Now I can't speak for everyone, but I agree with everyone 110%... I really miss the old albuterol sulfate! This medication isn't very effective and I find myself constantly using more than what is prescribed. Also, no matter how hard I puff... it never seems to be despensing the medicine, you could hear and feel my old inhalier working... but this one does work after a while. Just do yourself a favor and get a different perscription; because this one is worthless for emergencies! The only reason i'm still using it, is because it's only a $2.50 co-pay with my insurance. Which, by the way, is really all this crapp is worth.
Asthma	45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2		45-54	8/3/2010 9:29:02 PM	I was changed to this inhaler and it does not work. I finally got so tired of having to spend my day (puffing)that I went and got my Asmanex filled and am starting it tonight. Hopefully that will take care of it and I wont need this useless inhaler!

Iv'e had albuterol in the past and it worked!!! Are the drug companies trying to keep us sick?!!!!I wonder.
Asthma	lgomez, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	10/28/2009 9:41:57 PM	I'm a 26 year old asthmatic and I hate this new Albuterol all Albuterols are the same the generics or brand names the problem is once they made the HFA the medication strength doesn't work the same. I find myself using more and more often as before I only needed a puff once in awhile now I use it like 4 puffs or more specially when I really have a severe asthma attack. I believe if its not broken don't fix it. We were all doing very well with the old one. At work since I'm also a repiratory therapist every one of my patients complain of how ineffective this new inhaler is. Specially for our eldery patients they find them self more in the hospital because they find no reason to use their inhaler since it doesn't work for them.
Asthma	Beth, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	10/5/2009 5:19:49 PM	I have used Albuterol for the last 8 or 9 years.  When they took it off the market I was put on this and it DOESN'T work.  AND I think i'm allergic to something in it but its the only thing I can take when a sudden attack comes on(even though it really doesn't work).  
Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	9/23/2009 12:46:40 AM	I have been using this inhaler for the past 10 months.  I am not happy with it.  I feel like I have to use more of it than I ever had to use my albuterol inhaler.  After I use it it makes me feel sick to my stomach.  
Asthma	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	9/21/2009 2:24:35 PM	Well,my six year old daughter has been on this medication for about 6 months and at first she could not breath through the night,she would cough &amp; have problems breathing. But, now she sleeps all night with out having any problem of breathing. 
Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	9/15/2009 2:16:26 AM	I have only been using this inhaler for about 6 months as opposed to the 6 years I used my other inhaler.  This one does not work most of the time!  I feel like I am constantly needing more medicine, since it hasn't controlled my attacks as well as I need it to.  I'm going to the doctor next week to hopefully try something different...
Asthma Attack	756emt, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	9/6/2009 6:27:49 PM	I have been taking Proventil as a rescue inhaler for my asthma attacks....I was put on ventolin before. I started this medicine and my blood pressure has increased dramatically..Im 23 with it ranging from 140/100 to 122/100. And before i began the Proventil it was 110/70 all the time...This drug works well but the risk of highblood pressure is too great.
Asthma	Cindy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	8/26/2009 9:39:28 AM	Not effective at all! Need my other albuterol inhaler.  Having more difficulty breathing.  Just hoping my MD can help with something else.
Asthma Attack	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	8/16/2009 7:06:07 PM	This generic is AWFUL! It burned my lungs and the more I used it, the worse the asthma got and sooner it returned. Perhaps it was the carrier chemicals because Ventolin's albuterol was soothing and long lasting. My insurance wouldn't let me choose so I went OTC with Primatene rather than use Proventil.
Asthma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/3/2009 1:33:41 PM	It works but there are cheaper alternatives such as Ventolin.
Asthma	Ann, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	6/15/2009 11:44:52 PM	When using this medication I get a very warm uncomfortable feeling in my chest and lungs. It makes me sick on my stomach. I used the albuterol (old one) for 33 years and never had a problem. For myself taking that one off the market was a very big mistake for severe asthma suffers. I wish I new where to order the real inhaler.
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	COPD sufferer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/15/2009 5:04:12 PM	I have been on Symbicort for 2 years. Proventil works so much better in opening the airways. Cost with no insurance is $48 at WalMart. It's worth it to be able to breath.
Bronchitis	wmccloud, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/9/2009 2:46:09 PM	It works!!!!
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/13/2009 8:57:03 AM	My Dr. put me on this for COPD. I find it works quickly and is easy to use. Will continue with the treatment.

What else works this well at a lower price. This is not the only medication I take, and when I picked it up I was floored as to the cost of this medication.If I did not need it I would of not gotten it. 
Bronchitis	Charlotte, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/19/2008 5:05:47 AM	I'm taking this inhaler for 1 week for bronchitis. The aftertaste isn't good, but it effectively clears my bronchial tubes. I would take again if needed.

Asthma	Crytical, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	5/5/2008 1:49:11 AM	While Proventil *seems* to have a softer spray than plain albuterol (CFC inhalers), I find it easier to use. It doesn't seem as if most of the med ends up on the back of my throat. The taste is also far better :-) I just switched and I don't think I'll go back! While a regular albuterol inhaler only costs me $4 each and Proventil is a $30 copay, it's worth it.
Asthma	Candy56, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/22/2008 8:45:31 PM	It works really well for me.  I was on a generic brand and it wasnt as good as this.

Asthma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	35-44	11/24/2007 10:06:19 PM	I have a hard time with the amount of spray coming out
