No narcotics needed. No side effects that I'm aware of. It doesn't make me sleepy but when you first take it, you should make sure it is the same for you. No heartburn - empty stomach or w/food. I take it 3 times a day and have for well over 10 years.

It does not take alway all the pain, it just makes it tollable. It does make you drowsey so be careful until you know how this drug will affect you. I have been taken this drug for over a 2 year period now. I don't think it working as well as it did when I started this drug.I have been warned by my family doctor that he will not prescribe this drug because it is to dangerous with no explonation. I get my Carisprodol from my pain management Dr.in Longview, Texas Dr. Mark Williams Who specilliges in pain management and he is very conseverty on giving out drugs. He is the surgern that did my fusion in my neck,an He has done 4 back surgeries on my back in the past 20 years  due to advanced degenitive disk disease and I trust him more with understanding my pain , where a family physcian does not. The only recommendation is to have a blood test run at least every 6 months to check for liver damage, side effect of the drug.

WHEN YOU OVERDOSE WITH THIS DRUG YOUR ARMS AND LEGS WILL NOT WORK, AND SOMEONE WITH YOU WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE DEAD.  YOU CANNOT MOVE.  I THINK THAT THIS DRUG IS NOT A SAFE DRUG FOR ANYONE TO TAKE.

I have a very high tolerance to medication,It doesnt last as long as it is suppose to. I cant seem to get my doctor to understand that it isnt working. Is there something I need to tell him other than it doesnt work to get some other medication. He has me also on Vicoden 7.5/750 at the same time I take the SOMA.. but I am not getting complete relief. I dont know what else to do. I cant do anything that I use to be able to do anymore. Cleaning house, walking, sitting for long periods. I spend most my time laying down. If I am mobile I am in pain, If I am still I am in less pain. There has to be something to help me. I know I will have to be on medication for the rest of my life and most likey I will have to take Narcotic medications for the rest of my life. But like I said, I have a high tolerance for medication. It might work for a month then it doesnt work at all.. Its like Im taking this medication for nothing now.
