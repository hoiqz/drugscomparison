I find it works better with a &quot;dry&quot; cough, rather than one with a lot of phlem from the chest. I've used it for both kinds of cough and that was just my observation.

My father was also VERY drowsy, talked in his sleep and when awake and talking did not make any sense at all. Very disturbing for his family, and I do not recommend it at all.

Benzonatate works very well for me. Max needed dose= 100mg three times a day with the last dose at bedtime. Nyquil cough formula is not as effective,and all that red color and sweet additives are nauseating.

Cough	305breathe, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male		1/11/2012 2:33:51 AM	This medication has worked wonders for me. I had a terrible cough for the past three weeks and had tried other treatment, but nothing worked. Went to the doctor today: took 2 tablets and gradually the cough subsided; eitht hours later (now) and no more cough. Overall Iam satisfied with my experience. My doctor diagnosed me with bronchitis and bacterial infection.  My dead and chest were clogged and aching. I had self-treated with NyQuil Cold &amp; Flu, Nighttime; Rub with Vicks Vapor Rub to chest and back; Mucinex DM, Cough &amp; Chest Congestion; Coricidin HBP, Chest Congestion &amp; Cough; Herbal Teas with honey &amp; lemon: none of these treatments gave satisfactory relief. My doctor prescribed the dose pack of Azithromycin 250MG and Benzonatate  100MG, 1 cap twice a day as needed for cough.  NO SIDE AFFECTS.  NO DISCOMFORTS.TONIGHT I WILL BE ABLE TO SLEEP LIKE A BABY.THANK GOD!  EASY TO USE AND VERY EFFECTIVE.

Cough	Black Diamonds, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/7/2011 12:05:09 AM	Due to being on AEDs (Anti-Epileptic Drugs); the restriction to take other medications is severely limited. While rare that I develop colds, or worse; once in a blue moon being smacked down with Bronchitisis - this does work, but it is not for everyone! Do let your Doctor know about your medications you are on and your medical conditions as well. I have been on this multiple times; but not continual, only on a as needed basis always following my Doctor's orders upfront and then after that it falls into my control as to &quot;when to say when&quot; because this medication will LOWER the seizure threshold on many of the AEDS (Anti-Epileptic Medications) and may lower other medications as well.

The first time I took this medication I was amazed, my cough was gone and I had no side effects at all. I now request it any time I get a bad cough. I've been reading through the reviews here and noticed a lot of people have mixed feelings....remember that with all medications the results and side effects will be different for each person, our systems are all different. I'm one that suffers from basically any possible side effect from meds, but this one gave me none. It works womders for me.

Cough	Lika, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	12/21/2010 6:43:59 PM	Took 1 100 mg pill before bed last night; almost 18 hrs later, still not coughing and loopy as heck. Was afraid to drive into work this am, but since coughing for 5 days, need to catch up. Initial Rx was 1 capsule, 3x day; cannot imagine how goofed up I'd be if I did that. It works, but all too well. Not sure if this viral infection/bronchitis is getting worse or just still too goofy from the single capsule.  I don't think I will take another one tonight and see when cough returns (dry hacking); too scary being this affected 18 hrs later on a single dose!

Cough	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/10/2010 12:44:38 PM	I have used this drug for many years.  It is the only one that works for my cough.But until this year, I was never told to use it during the day.  Because of possible side affects I will continue using only at night and I sleep all night.  Lots of water, limited talking and cough drops work during the day and I've experienced no side effects. Love this drug!  Getting sleep at night is what actually helps me get well and with this pill I find 4-5 nights is all I usually need.

Cough	jenica, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	4/13/2010 11:19:42 PM	I did notice my cough eased up a bit after the first dose, but not enough to justify the intense headeache. Not a person who ever has side effects to medication, I was surprised to find myself congested, lightheaded and feeling like I had a migraine several hours after taking this medication.  I see from the reviews that it has worked well for many, so maybe I am an exception to the rule, but I just wanted to put my experience out there so those of you who feel as I do, do not think you are imagining your symptoms.  It did decrease my cough but did not eliminate it and the side effects made it seem not worth it.  This is the first time my doctor gave me this medication instead of the usual codine medication, and I was very pleased and optomistic, since I do not like to deal with any narcotic no matter how low the dose.  For me the side effects did not justify the possitive effects.

At 2:45 I was so dizzy I wanted to lay down.  At that time I coughed and threw up over and over.We called 911 for the ambulance because I felt so dizzy and had read the side effects and thought I was having a reaction to the drug.  I went to emergency and the only thing they could come up with was a reaction  to the drug.  I left the emergency at around 6 pm after having a very bad smelling bm the was loose but not direaia. I am ok the next day.

I had been using Nyquil and still woke up every 2-3 hours coughing and taking more. It gave me a horrible drugged feeling in the morning. The first night I tried Benzonatate I only took one capsule instead of the recommended two, and slept through the night without coughing. I only needed to take it two more nights throughout the course of my cold. No drug hangover the next day, either, and what a relief to be free of all that icky cough syrup. This is the best cough remedy I've ever found.

With use of my albuterol nebulizer and the Benzonatate perles, I have been amazed how much better my cough has been.  I usually use a cough syrup and have never used the perles, but I am sold on them, I don't get the side effects I get from the narcotic cough syrups.  I'd definitely use them again if needed!

Cough	karen, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	5/23/2009 3:59:43 AM	I made a sad mistake and put a whole one into my mouth not realizing I did not have enough fluid in my glass to swallow this pill.  I move slowly, so by the time I reached the kitchen and swallowed the pill my mouth had, in fact, become numb.  It began to subside within minutes and all is well.  I had never thought of a cough suppresent as one having a numbing affect.  I suppose that makes sense, however, I feel this only treats the symptom and not the cause, therefore, I am not liking this at all.
Cough	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	5/19/2009 9:43:03 AM	Side effects are scary, also the feeling in your whole system after taking the first pill.

I took this med and was up all night coughing and it never stopped.  I had to make a 2nd trip to the doctor to get 'tussin with codeine.  If you want relief for your severe cough I would NOT recommend this med.

However, it seems the brand name nor generic of this drug is on most of the Medicare Advantage plans I have checked into.  Does anyone know of a generic drug that works as well as benzonatate?  Thanks!

Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	2/10/2009 12:02:55 PM	My doctor prescribed this medicine along with the ZPack (antibiotics) for bronchitis. The pills help decrease my painful cough, but don't get rid of it. Used with NyQuil Cough at night - would wake up coughing at the four hour mark. Pills only work for 3-1/2 to 4 hours at a time. Some lightheadedness and drowsiness.
Cough	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	35-44	2/9/2009 12:06:12 PM	I was diagnosed with viral flu and involved a great deal of coughing.  Prior to seeing the doctor I'd used a dayquil generic (didn't seem to do much) and Theraflu (seemed to help for a little while) so I was eager to get something more powerful prescribed.  It has given me relief.  I'd have long spells of no coughing, which I was pleased about, however I was lightheaded and would have mild nausea.  I found that eating before taking the med seemed to help blunt some of the side effects.  Overall I'm glad that I was prescribed this.  While it didn't eradicate the coughing it greatly reduced it, which was enough satisfaction after 5 days with severe coughs.
Cough	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		2/5/2009 5:12:42 PM	This is THE BEST cough medicine I have ever taken!! I DON&quot;T do liquid medicine (just can't get it down). These little pills are the cat's meow!! They work GREAT!!

I was so miserable and my cough just wouldn't leave me alone.  I had a spray &quot;Zicam&quot; cough max and I would use that to help me try to sleep.  I also would take my usual clariten.  From Friday to Monday my cough has been ongoing and my throat continues to bother me.

It helps immensely and is not habit forming (unless you count not wanting to hack and cough a habit lol)! 3 times a day is the minimum I would say though. It starts to wear off after 4-5 hrs. You really know when you missed taking a dose too. I highly recommend. Also, I have not noted any side effects at all. My mother has also had the same success.
Cough	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/13/2009 2:08:51 PM	I haven't taken this med,as after I read the paper I received after getting it really bothered me. It said that if I get a side effect that I would have to call the FDA @ the 800 number they get me. So I felt like it wasn't a good med to take.

I'm still coughing like I'll cough up a lung, and now I have a stuffy nose too (one of the listed side-effects). Every 8 hours is not a good dosage regime for someone hoping to catch up on lost sleep. Requires utmost precision on timing. (Not that it matters, since the cough is still here anyway). *sigh*

Cough		1	4	1			9/9/2008 11:02:08 PM	After second day on it, no improvement at all so far. I experienced nausea, as well. I am on the fence about staying on it another day. I need quicker results. No problem with taking the pills.
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/5/2008 10:59:18 AM	I was diagnosed with probable pertussis(whopping cough) YUK!  After 3 weeks of a very painful and nasty cough, I have refief. Though I did get a bit sick to my stomach and quite sleepy, the pain in my chest, throat, and abdomen from the constant violent coughing has ceased and my cough is controlled...nothing else had helped until now..I adore this medication.
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/17/2008 10:06:48 AM	This pill is GREAT! I developed a cold that include lots of congestion and wheezing. I developed such a deep cough that I almost threw-up from coughing. I was told about this medication by a collegue (medical field) and asked my doctor for a prescription. I took one at 9:15 am and by 10:00 am I was coughing less than 3 times per hour.  I did feel a little disoriented after the first pill, but that went away and I felt just fine the two other times I took it.  I would recommended this to anyone who needs cough relieve (especially if they are unable to sleep due to the cough, which was my problem).

I am still coughing to the point now where I cry now when the coughting spells happen which is usually all day long and into the night. Thank God I am not experiencing any of the side effects.  I'm beginning to think that this drug is not strong enough for me.

After 2 days, I hardly coughed at all, so the pain in my upper back disappeared.  I like the way this worked.  I had sunusitis with cough.

Does not clearly state what medicines are contraindicated. I threw away the bottle after 3 doses.  I wish I had insisted on a narcotic cough suppressant so I can get some much needed sleep.
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	3/27/2008 9:38:03 AM	This is the 2nd time I've tried this medication. I can't get past the side effects to know if this drug works on my cough.  It makes me sick to my stomache, gives me the shakes, and I broke out into a rash on my forhead.  It also made me real dry and very foggy. NOT for me.
Cough	MeccaMiles.com, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	4	3	Male	35-44	3/20/2008 11:50:09 AM	The medication didn't work initially, but after the second day, it seemed to work -- my cold did get worse but the coughing subsided from 30 coughs an hour to about 2 per hr.  For some reason I had difficulty swallowing the pills, not sure if it was due to cold or what.  My cough greatly reduced but, I felt kinda dizzy and nausea -- I rarely have this effect with medicines.

What he didn't tell me was that it works fast and I might want to wait until i get home to take it.  See I have to drive 38 miles to get home, well i took it as I left the urgent care center and stopped at the commisary to get a few thing and about 20 minutes after taking, I was not coughing, my sore shoulders ans back from coughing so hard did hurt any more and well I am not sure, but I think I was Intoxicated, cuase I felt GREAT.  I decided to call someone to pick me up instead of driving.  Needless to say it works for me, but than again I felt like I drank about fifty beers @ a Party if you know what I mean  ;-)
Cough	erm51, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/14/2008 2:42:28 PM	This is the best medication I have ever tken for a cough!

She prescribed Benzonatate for me and it couldn't have worked better. I took the 1st dose a little before bedtime and I slept through the night, cough free! I have had no side effects from this medication.

Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	2/21/2008 12:31:56 PM	This drug was prescribed to treat a sore throat.  Did not work, and after investigating the drug further, I am at a loss as to why it was recommended by my doctor (given that I said I had no cough).  
Cough	woowoo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	2/20/2008 3:28:24 PM	This really worked on my cough, the muscles around my mid section were hurting so bad from coughing, after taking this it was instant relief. However it left me a little dizzy and disoriented. My only complaint.
Cough	Jan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	2/15/2008 3:24:32 PM	I still continued to cough all night long after taking.
Cough	Michelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	2/14/2008 7:59:19 PM	I have bronchitis and was perscribed this drug.  I think that it has made me sicker than I originally was.  Shortly after taking the drug, I became nauseas, dizzy, and have had the worst headaches that I have ever had.  I rarely have adverse reactions to medication, so I didn't immediately make the connection that this was the drug and not my original condition getting worse.  It has to some degree helped my caugh, but not enough to justify the side effects.
Cough	trikergrace@yahoo.com, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		2/14/2008 4:01:19 AM	not one second of relief

Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/13/2008 5:57:03 PM	I have asthma, so whenever I get a chest cold, it wrecks havoc on my lungs. This medicine really does work in a short amount of time, although I wish it lasted longer than 3 hours. I'm taking it to get over acute brochitis. I'm amazed at how quiet I am (no more hacking!) and my husband is happy he can sleep peacefully (and so can I!)
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/12/2008 10:38:06 PM	I was able to sleep (ah, sweet sleep!) after taking a dose for about five hours.  Medication did not last full 8 hours, but it has been better than the OTC cough medicine.  It also helps during the day.
Cough	a237916, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/9/2008 9:14:40 PM	A week after I'd gotten over a bad flu I was still coughing.  It got so bad that my back was going into very painful spasms.  I can't take codeine, so my doc tried this.  It was a miracle for me!  Within the hour of taking it I was down to only coughing once or twice every 15 -20 minutes when I was previously coughing several times a minute!  By the second half of the second day I didn't need it anymore.  Best cough suppressant I've ever taken!
Cough		1	5	2			2/6/2008 10:06:56 PM	I have cough- variant asthma and have been taking this drug for the past 8 or so years- each time I have had an attack, which I would say is approximately 2-6 times a year. When I first started taking it, it worked. It no longer works for me and I can't seem to find anything to get rid of this cough. 
Cough	mamachicky, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	2/6/2008 2:49:11 PM	nothing else would work. This reduced the cough by 2/3 . It also decreses the force of the cough about 2/3.

Cough	rich, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/1/2008 2:22:39 PM	I had coughing spasms both day and night due to bronchitis.

(my husband agrees as I keep him awake all night). It also made me a little sick to my stomach.I was also given a z-pack which could be causing my upset stomach. I will stick to over the counter stuff for my cough.   
Cough	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/21/2008 5:16:52 PM	Eureka, I have found it!  After getting whatever has been going around Northern CA in November I relented in January and went to see my PA.  She prescribed this after prodding, (I think she thought I wanted an antibiotic!) and I took it for a few days along with Mucinex Maximum Strength.  It worked wonders!  I slept at night-with a good nights sleep, I worked a full day, and I now feel much better.  I'm embarassed to admit the other side effects of the constant coughing, let's just say I went now know how it will feel when I am incontinent due to aging!  And the meds made all of that much better.

Cough	jaybeedee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/9/2008 8:46:20 PM	I had this with me on a trip to Florida, when I was just getting over bronchitis. Well, the FL humidity brought the cough back full blast. Running all over Disney World, I needed something, and this stuff did the job beautifully. The only drawback is that it only lasted 3 hours, max per dose. I needed to take something that lasted at least 6 hours. But hey... it was better than nothing at all, or something that would make me sleepy.

But then it seemed to stop working after that. My cough came back full force after the first day. Hopefully it works better for people with less severe coughs.

It was a little overwhelming.  However, after the second day the cough began to subside.  It worked when nothing else would work.

Cough	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	9/19/2007 6:16:57 PM	Worked great, within an hour of taking, My cough had decreased dramatically. Unfortuneately, my pharmacist had told me I could also take an expectorant syrup along with this med. Sadly, both medications works SO well, that I had the unwarrented feeling of choking, IE: the suppressant decreased my urge to cough, and the expectorant loosened my chest congestion, but was not able to &quot;cough up&quot; the phlegm. Once the effects of the expectorant wore off, the suppresant worked fine.  I suggest you NOT take both a suppresant and expectorant at the same time!
