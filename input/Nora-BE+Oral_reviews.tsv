Birth Control	ShopWench, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	9/29/2012 11:00:58 PM	I have been on and off BCP's since 2001, and have no history of blood or heart problems or estrogen reactions. I was put on Nora-Be because estrogen and nicotine do not mix and I had smoked 2 or 3 cigarettes within the preceeding 6 months before trying to get back on BCP's.Nora-Be prevents pregnancy by killing my sexlife with irregular periods, relentless spotting, random abdomninal cramps, breast-tenderness and increase in size (which I did NOT need/want), mood-swings, bloating, tiredness and constant heartburn which messes up my sleep patterns. I put on 15 pounds after starting Nora-Be despite trying to loose 20.This must be taken at the same time every day - impossible with my crazy sleep patterns.I am not satisfied with Nora-Be.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/29/2012 3:18:52 PM	I have been taking this medication for 1 year now. My doctor started me on it after I gave birth to my 1st child because it was a birth control pill that I could take while breastfeeding. I breastfed exclusively for 6 months and had absolutely no problems with this pill. I did, however have irregular periods. One month I had 2, some months I did not have any, but that could also have been from the breastfeeding. I have continued on it even now that I am no longer breastfeeding and have not had a period in almost 4 months now. I'm not too worried about that, but I will be following up with my doctor just to make sure that everything is ok because I do want to have more kids in the future. 
Birth Control	Kelli, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/18/2012 3:19:21 AM	The nurse perscribed me Nora-Be because the Micronor (which i had no problems with at all)no longer was available. After one month i started gaining weight which was NOT due to over eating or increased appetite. I have had constant bleeding for six weeks now. Some light days and then a gush of blood. Then a much heavier period then normal and then back to the light bleeding again. I finally realized it was not due stress of a new job. Its this pill and i am NOW stopping it after reading alot of comments with the same effects. I loved Micronor .35 and hope i can get it again thru another provider's office. Or try another..This pill has been awful!!
Other	Riley, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	7/8/2012 9:28:59 PM	I've been on Nora-BE for a year now, and I love it. No cramps, hardly no periods, I even lost ten pounds last summer, which surprised me because I knew one of the side affects was actually gaining weight. Besides loosing it, it didn't affect my weight at all. Mild mood swings, and it decreased my bloating a lot, and I feel great ever since I started Nora BE!
Other	cyndis8, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/11/2012 5:15:09 PM	I was put on Nora Be because of excessive menstrual bleeding.  I am 41 years old and since the birth of my last child at 36 I have been having terrible periods.  They last for 7+ days with lots of blood loss.  I am anemic because of it.  My insurance wouldn't approve an IUD, so my OB/Gyn wanted me to try this to see if it would help before surgical methods were considered.  So far so good.  My husband has had a vasectomy, so birth control isn't a problem.  My period has been light, hallelujah for that.  I am so tired of spending an entire week near the bathroom.  
Birth Control	Jes, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	4/26/2012 11:33:11 PM	My doctor prescribed this pill because my other pill was giving me trouble like headaches and dizziness. Everything seemed fine the first month on this pill just got my period a little later than usual. Then, after I got my normal period I have been getting it HEAVY with painful cramps every other week! Also I have been feeling depressed on random days ( might be unrelated to the pill, who knows)  Not what I expected at all! I hoped it was just my body adjusting but this is my third time having a period this month! I cant take it anymore! 
Birth Control	Nora-May Be Not, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	4/20/2012 8:40:26 AM	I started taking this pill because my doctor suspected my old BCP was causing migraines. Within days of starting this pill I began getting bad acne, which I never had before, I am nauseous all the time, I also have a bad pain just in from my hip bone with I assume is ovarian pain.  I continued taking the pills thinking it would just take a little while for my body to adjust to the BCP. However these side effects have gotten worse not better. Ive called my doctor and Im hoping to get off this pill soon! 
Birth Control	kay18, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/16/2012 7:20:20 PM	This is the first birth control I totally love. I've been on it for over 2 years. I take it on time every day at the same time. I never have my period unless I decide to take myself off the pill for a month just to cycle. I don't get any mood swing or have I gain any weight. It hasn't affected my breast size one bit. I'm 28 years old standing at 5'3 tall and weight 125 lbs. I've tried other birth control pills and the IUD nothing works like this pill and my boyfriend loves it. I think that all of our bodies are different. One method of birth control might work for some may not work for others. Yes it sucks but our body has a mind of its own. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/12/2012 11:39:24 AM	Horrible mood swings, irritability and overly emotional. I'm a fairly even keeled person and this pill has made me feel so emotionally labile that my relationships have suffered. Also have had terrible cramps, heavy periods, unrelenting breast tenderness and lowered libido. This is my second time around with this pill and both rounds were awful. 
Birth Control	Monica, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/28/2012 8:37:23 AM	I have been taking Nora BE for a year now, I am 47 yrs young. I am 5 ft tall petite. Was worried about gaining weight being on the pill, but only gained a few pounds. My breast sized increased alot. i hardly ever have a period now except for spotting once in awhile which i love about this birth control!!! Mild mood swings once in awhile nothing major and hair loss but am taking biotin to help with that.  I love Nora BE!!!
Birth Control	 Female  (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female		3/14/2012 1:58:09 AM	Extremely emotional mood swings, increase in acne/pimples, heavier and unpredictable periods, stomach cramps/pain. This pill must be taken EXACTLY at the same time, each day to be most effective.. not practical for most people, including myself, not for me...I threw the pills away a few days ago. Still having serious mood swings but so glad to be off them. Never again! 
Birth Control	likesnorabe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	2/15/2012 8:05:49 PM	I had been using Nuva Ring before this pill but had to go off it due to migranes.  I had mild acne and regular periods before starting this pill and haven't noticed any change...if anything my periods have been slightly shorter/lighter.  I did have 3 times when I had an &quot;extra&quot; period in a month but over a two year span of taking this pill I don't think its a big deal.  The only thing that does cause me a little stress is having to be so exact taking the pill at the same time everyday because missing the pill or taking it late does seem to trigger a reaction of cramps/spotting.  As long as I take the pill at the regular time every day things are great!  I am considering changing to Mirena or Paragard for more convenience but I'm a bit scared after reading reviews on each so I might just deal with the daily pill...

She switched me becasue she thought it would be better.  well since i have been on it my periods are 5 times worse and they come at random times sometimes with only 3 days in between and she wont listen to me about changeing back.  I am so ready to find a new doctor and get the heck off these pills I HATE THEM!!!! I have cysts as well and the Trivora worked so well on them  and this stuff forget it i have had so many pop since i have been on it.  if you get on this get off as fast as u can.  the wieght gain is horrible and the periods forget it they are heavy horrible and yuck!
Birth Control	kmber08, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	2/3/2012 10:49:58 AM	I had to switch birth controls due to the migraines I was having with microgestin. Nora-Be has been ok....no weight gain yet and no more Migraines...The only thing is, is that my periods are just as heavy when I'm not taking birth control and my facial acne has been TERRIBLE. I have been getting the hormonal break outs (you know the big massive zits you cant do anything about?)I never had acne before so I'm seriously disturbed by it and I hope I adjust and it goes away!
Birth Control	happy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	12/28/2011 12:58:59 AM	I take this pill because I get migraines.  I've had no problems with it!  No weight gain, unusual bleeding or anything.  I hardly notice it, except when I take the pill!  I wish it was more effective, but that's the nature of the game.  You just have to be a machine about taking it at the same time each day.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	12/15/2011 4:46:54 PM	This is the worst BC pill ever.  I have to take it because I'm over 35 and smoke and its the only pill you can take because it doesnt have estrogen but literally I bleed every single day.  For the first year or so I barely had any periods but now in the 2nd and 3rd year I bleed non stop with maybe 4 days break in between.  Needless to say its ruined my relationship with my boyfriend and I'm going to now try the Mirena IUD. 
Birth Control	bdouglass, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	10/12/2011 8:30:59 PM	I started taking nora-be because of my blood pressure. I am 48 years old my doctor thought it may help to control my blood pressure the 1st two months I had a full period with bad cramping,acne on my back heartburn, chest pains and headaches.My blood pressuer has not changed much.
Birth Control	PrettyGirl143, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	9/3/2011 2:04:33 AM	I gave birth to my son 4 months ago. Since i wanted to breastfeed my baby doctor recommended that i get on the &quot;mini pill&quot;. I am on my 3rd pack, I have not had a period since i began taking these pills. I have gained 10 pounds from my post baby weight and it is not due to over eating. I hate these pills, i can not wait to finish the pack and get off them. 
Birth Control		3	5	1			8/22/2011 3:11:58 PM	I started this pill bc the Sprintec caused me to break out in a rash when I was outside. I'm starting my 2nd pack. The first week I had a period that whole week, going from 3 day long very light periods to this. I just got it again yesterday and have had horrible cramping and heavy period. The first 3 weeks of the pill gave me bad headaches, nausea and tender breasts. Worse than when I was pregnant. I don't think I like the fact that my periods will be irregular, I like knowing when it is coming, and I don't want to have to worry every month if I'm pregnant or not. As soon as I get a call back from my dr, I'm switching. I think I can deal with breaking out in the sun to this horrible period...
Other	la-la, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	7/20/2011 1:44:50 PM	I have been taking birth control pills for over 12 years to try and prevent ovarian cysts from forming.  In 2008, my doctor had to switch me to this pill since I had developed a blood clot in my leg.  Overall, I am disappointed in this medicine since I put on weight, developed adult acne, and grew facial hair faster than my husband!  I can be extremely moody 1-2 weeks before my period begins and the menstrual cramps can be unbearable.  (FYI: It's pretty unusual for me to complain something.) Because my ovarian cysts have returned, I will be going back on Mircette later this month.
Birth Control	cargirl, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1		35-44	7/20/2011 11:30:00 AM	I was prescribed this bc after giving birth to my daughter.  I found out that i have a genetic blood clotting disorder and i would no longer be able to take any bc containing estrogen.  I needed progesterone only, therefore I ended up with this pill, on this pill I had horrible, horrible Acne...so bad I made my spouse get a vasectomy and I discontinued use...it works and was easy to use.....but oh man....the ACNE was worse than the thought of having another baby...good luck all

The first two packs were rough, but now that I've just completed my 3rd pack and starting my 4th I'm feeling much, much better. For the purpose I am taking it, I am very satisifed.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/29/2011 1:25:30 PM	I have been taking this BC for about 14 months now &amp; my periods have been regular, but sometimes I get them 2x a month. They are heavier and I have bad cramping, which I didnt have before. I needed to use this due to nursing my daughter and it seemed to work. Dont nurse her anymore &amp; it's been fine since then too. Causes major pms though; acne hasnt been that bad for me. My period hasnt come this month though and now Im worried I may be PG. We'll see! I take it at the same time every day; even set my phone alarm to be sure I do. Havent had a horrible experience like other people here, and pill seems to have been effective so far.

I had a horrible period at the very start, which was longer than normal. I've also had a small amount of acne. The worst thing, though, is that it has killed my sex drive! Not sure yet if I will stick it out another pack or switch to another type.

Haven't had a period for 2 months, test negative.  Feel like I could have my period any day, cramping, etc., nothing.  Want to get back to normal.

I have an increased appetite, facial acne and bad cramps even when spotting. Some days I would spot a little and then with no warning the spotting would turn into a huge surge of menstrual and I have to actuall stop to get to a bathroom! Im done with NORA BE!

Birth Control	marisaniki, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	4/25/2011 7:44:52 PM	I started taking this medication bc my liver labs contradicted the use of an estrogen birth control.  I used it for about 3 months- I gained about 5-7 lbs (which could also be related partially to grad school studying all the time), noticed increased irritability, depression, and overall am quite unhappy, mostly due to the weight gain. I feel like it changed by body as though I was pregnant, but am not. I never had a period, and noticed increased lubrication during sex, which wasnt a bad thing. Overall, I just got the nuva ring in hopes of getting this Nora-Be out of my system and loosing the weight I gained.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	4/11/2011 8:59:10 PM	I started taking this after my period returned at 10 months postpartum and I was still nursing.  Two cycles in and all was fine.  I set a timer on my phone so taking it at exactly the same time each day wasn't so cumbersome.  But soon after starting the third pack I felt just like I feel when pregnant, but repeatedly tested negative.  After three weeks of morning sickness, exhaustion, breast tenderness, and crazy moodiness I'm going off this pill.  No longer nursing, so I'll be going with a BCP I am more confident in and hope I feel better!
Birth Control	kribrenn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	4/7/2011 2:29:52 AM	Overall, I have had a good experience with this drug.  My gyno switched me to this after having a bad experience with the Nuva Ring (I have migraines, and it was giving me weird migraine and other neurological symptoms) and I have felt fine ever since.  The biggest downside is that my periods, which were very regular before Nora, are now somewhat irregular (I kind of expect it to be up to a week later than what it should be month to month).  Otherwise, I have some weird aches in my legs that I wonder are due to this upon reading about side effects in various places, but that could be totally unrelated.  Anyway, I have been quite satisfied, and SO much better for me than the Nuva Ring.  
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/8/2011 12:10:17 PM	I started taking this medication while breastfeeding.  My breasts were hurting so bad that I quit.  I feel like I am pregnant again since the nausea and faintness. Also, the hair on my body isn't growing anymore which is a plus.

Never been more than 15 minutes late taking a pill.  I have had at least two full periods during each pack, frequent odd headaches, and weight gain that can't be due to overeating.  These factors lead me to feeling pretty lousy all around - intimacy is sometimes difficult, my head hurts, and I want to be my normal weight again!  The only plus is that I am not pregnant.  That's big, but I'll find some other method to manage that.

I do get a little bit of cramps.. and I think I'm gaining weight.. I have been working out and eating healthy but haven't lost any weight..

As a matter of fact I didn't even have a period. I was on it because it  was the only option for a breast feeding mother. I'm on it for the second time now and have had nothing but problems after the first 5 months. I have a period every other week that lasts from 2-7 days. My vision is blurred from time to time, headaches constantly, dizzy spells and the latest sleeplessness and depression. I quit as of today!  I've had enough! Users beware

If I miss a pill (which is about twice/month), it seems to trigger my period...and the cramping is extremely painful!  I have also gained wait and decreased an entire cup size!  It's prevented pregnancy, which is great, but is it worth ALL of side effects??

I've only had sex once, 2 weeks ago, and used a condom. I hadn't gotten my period before i had sex and I still haven't gotten it now. Is this normal to not get your period at all while on this pill??I haven't been spotting either. I really don't think I'm pregnant because I didn't get my period before the sex either.

My periods were so regular that I knew exactly when to expect the first cramps. I am now late for my 2nd period on this bc. I followed the instructions and took it every morning at 9am without fail. Now I am starting to worry that I might be pregnant and its only been 11 weeks since my daughter was born. I have taken oral bc before and never had problems with missed periods well I guess there is a first time for everything. I know this much if I am PG again I am going to be very disappointed, not for the pregnancy but because it will be so risky since I had my first via c-section.

I can't stand it anymore, they're full periods lasting 5--7 days with literally just days between. My face has broken out pretty badly, as well has some on my shoulders and back. The dr. says it's b/c it doesnt have the estrogen which helps regulate acne, but b/c of myheadaches they don't recommend taking pills w/ estrogen. are there any other options out there?! help!!

I am not pregnant so I guess it is helping that, however every other pill I have tried in the past I know when my period is starting and usually it is much lighter. Not with this pill. I get 2-3 periods a month. and extremly heavy. with occasional spotting in between. I break out bad with this pill also. this is the worst pill I have tried yet.... I am changing pills as soon as my doctor calls me back.

Migraines led my doctor to put me on a pill w/o estrogen. Doctor told me that this pill would allow my menstrual cycle to be controlled by my body, which appears to be the case. I have very irregular periods when not on birth control pills (due to PCOS). I have very irregular periods when on Nora BE! I had beautiful skin prior, but began breaking out on my face, back and buttocks (EW!)after being on NoraBE for ~3 months. Acne seems to have decreased now. I am satisfied with this product. The acne is bothersome for sure, but I will work with it.

My acne has increased a bit, and i sometimes get random bouts of dizziness and nausea.  It has not made my migraines worse so that is a  plus.  Also, i just want to comment that no birth control method is 100% effective, you other ladies just don't seem to get that.

Birth Control	janname, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	7/8/2010 11:50:06 AM	I'm only taking this during breastfeeding.  My skin is breaking out...all over.  No periods in the 7 months since I had my baby - not even spotting.  
Birth Control	acne-girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	35-44	4/4/2010 10:57:04 AM	I had to switch to this pill, because I was over 35 and a smoker. The first year was great, but had minor breakouts on my face &amp; shoulders, which went away after a few months. The next year, got switched to another generic form &amp; more breakouts. Starting my third year on the actual Nora Be, I have worse acne than a teenager. Over the counter acne medicine aren't even helping. I also blame my weight gain on this pill.  I like the very short periods and sometimes skipping periods. The only thing is you worry about pregnancy. I have taken several tests, but they have all been negative. I want you to know that I take this pill everyday at the same time, because I wasn't ready to be a mom yet.I have actually decided to go off the pill, because I think I have more side effects that I realize.  
Birth Control	Iluvmycash!!!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/3/2010 2:45:28 PM	I started using this form of birthcontrol because I'm a smoker. I only got one very light period for a few days. No problem! I haven't put any weight on, but I did have to spend some money on new bras! I'm petite, and they went up two cup sizes! Goodbye B's! Overall I'm highly satisfied, I am not pregnant, and the hardest thing to do is to take the pill at the exact time everyday.
Birth Control	Teacher1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	11/29/2009 10:00:47 PM	I started norabe because I was diagnosed with Factor V (a blood clot disorder) and I am no longer able to be on the NuvaRing.  Started off great, no nausea, regular periods, all was good.  3 months into the pack I am gaining weight despite my good eating habits and daily work outs.  I am going to speak with my physician about the next step. If I continue is the scale going to continue going up?  Has anyone else had this problem?

However, when I do miss a pill, it triggers a period within two or three days... weird. I always use a back-up method after missing a pill. I was told by the doctor who prescribed the medication that I would no longer get a period after I had been using it for 3-6 months.
Other	C.rekel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/21/2009 8:22:05 PM	It made me bleed very heavy and way longer than i usually do. It mad eme very weak and drowsy.
Other	hurtinmama, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	11/21/2009 8:10:40 AM	I have been suffering from long/heavy/painfull periods my whole life. After I had my last child (8 yrs ago) I had my tubes tied and have been suffering more ever since. I have tried many different birth control pills and have had D/C's. Nothing has helped. My doctor said that Nora-be will be our last attempt before surgery. I have taken only 2 1/2 weeks worth of Nora-be and am hemorrhaging with huge clots so bad, I'm changing my pads every 30 minutes! I am in so much pain too!!! Its been 3 days since I stopped taking the pill and my docotor has scheduled my hysterectomy for 12/02/2009. I can't wait for this painfull nightmare to be over!!!
Birth Control	Nuggies, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	10/7/2009 10:22:50 AM	I have taken this pill for 2 months now and have not stopped bleeding and pms is constant.  Where's my Nuva-ring?!?  Can't use that anymore because I smoke...guess I'm on my own.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	9/16/2009 12:47:51 PM	Went on this pill because the combination pills were making me moody and killing my libido. Haven't had any of that on this pill or any other weird side effects. Started spotting four months into taking this tho, which is annoying. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	6/20/2009 8:23:15 AM	Since I am breastfeeding, the doctor prescribed me these pills. The physical problems I've experienced while taking these feel as if I was in the first trimester of my pregnancy all over again: bloating, nausea, dizziness... Don't know how effective this is because I am staring my second pack, but I know once when I'm done breastfeeding, I probably won't go back to this medication again...
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	6/10/2009 4:45:39 PM	Used this while breastfeeding, since it contained no estrogin.  Worked fine, except when I didn't take it at the same time of the day (which resulted in spotting).  Since this is not 100% effective, I was a little paranoid about getting pregnant.
Birth Control	JesBlaze, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	6/8/2009 1:05:58 PM	This pill is easy to take but some of the physical side effects I am experiencing are so upsetting that I have asked my doctor to take me off this form of birth control.  I want to go back on my NuvaRing. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	25-34	2/11/2009 1:57:04 PM	I cannot take estrogen because it gives me migranes and I am a smoker.  My M.D. put me on this due to those factors.  I have horrible PMS symptoms and have gained a bit of weight.  I'm ususally happy go lucky but foudn myself in a bought of depression last week (the week before my period) crying and all...I would only reccommend this for people who cannot take the combination pill like me.  
Birth Control	Brittany, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	13-18	11/19/2008 11:16:37 AM	This birth conrtol was easy and I took it everyday at the same time,however, I did end up becoming pregnant with my sencond child while using Nora-Be. I don't reccommend this form of birth control to someone who doesn't want to become pregnant because it isn't 100% effective. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	19-24	10/2/2008 10:58:59 PM	This pill can be difficult to adjust to. The first three months on it I had major mood problems. I stuck with it and after three months my mood returned to normal and i have shorter periods. Although i have worse PMS symptoms. its been almost a year now and im still not pregnant, so it must be working.
Birth Control	AlannaDQ, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	8/9/2008 5:08:40 PM	Warning to women who try this, wear uncreen. I have dark skin and have only been buned a few times in my life. With an SPF 15 and two days of water sports in the sun I was covered with an allergic reation to the sun. Always wear suncreen but especially on this pill

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	10/16/2007 3:50:23 PM	I am on my second pack and must I say I have now been spotting for over a wk... after this pack Im done and will return to the patch.
