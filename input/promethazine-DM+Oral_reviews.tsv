It works well and doesn't make me too drowsey to perform my job and operate a vehicle. Taste wise it wasn't any worse than OTC Nyquill, it helped a lot. 
Cough	Pattyjake, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/21/2012 1:47:51 PM	I found this med relieved my cough and promoted rest (yes, with drowsiness...but I welcomed that after 5 days of deep chest congestion with cough). As long as I'm not working or driving I will continue to take this for cough :)).

Works wonderfully for my cough, tastes TERRIBLE. I can't get over the sensation that I'm floating on a cloud watching everything that's happening around me. All I want to do is curl up with a blanket and go back to sleep for ten years... Hopefully this will pass!
Cold Symptoms	lipstick912@aol.com, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/26/2009 11:28:31 AM	My doctor put me on the cough syrup and it gave me blurred vision and I was also taken to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack. They put me on a heart monitor did EGK, CAT scan of my head, xray. All the doctors in the ER keep asking why I was on this for bronchitis. I had the scare of my life. Just to find out that my heart was fine but had a reaction to the syrup. So if you get blurred vision or fast heart rate stop taking and to the ER.
