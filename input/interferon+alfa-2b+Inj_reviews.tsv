Chronic Hepatitis C	ja999, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	8/8/2012 1:39:40 AM	Took drug for Hep C genotype 2.  Failed to clear virus.  Developed psoriasis, arthritis all over jumping around from joint to joint and settling in a number, balance problems, vascular problems in feet, fried thyroid, autoimmune hepatitis, depression, brain fog, loss of identity of self, tremors in fingers.  Liver damage increased rapidly and significantly during treatment.  Horrible medication.  Evil.  Worst side effects come on in few months after you quit taking drug, after you quit seeing your hematologist or gastroenterologist. Hep C never bothered me.  Treatment causes pain, discomfort, loss of income and disability every day of my life.  It's absolutely crazy.Most doctors are ignorant or in denial about severity of side effects (or really, injuries).  Be very very wary of this drug.  It can utterly ruin for life.  
Multiple Myeloma	 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male		5/22/2012 3:12:40 PM	I had Stage 3 melanoma.  I completed the 48 week treatments w/4 weeks of IV treatment (20 treatments) and 44 weeks of injections 3x's week.  First two days were ok...then wham!  Attitude is important as fatigue was alarming...it wasn't 'I need a nap' but rather &quot;You are taking a nap now.&quot;  My blood levels (white count) dropped bigtime however, 10 days after ending treatments ended my white count more than doubled.

Chronic Hepatitis C	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/8/2012 1:41:30 PM	I took this medication for the first time yesterday &amp; am still waiting for the horrendous side effects!  I'm doing great!  I think alot of the way medicines work on people has alot to do with attitude.  I expected the worst, but prayed for healing, guess whats winning?  25 years of geno type 1b hep c I'm ready for treatment, Iv'e already been down in the slumps so to speak without treatment.  One day of treatment &amp; I feel better than Iv'e felt for over 2 years!

A Malignant Pigmented Mole or Tumor	still alive, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	1/27/2012 10:17:26 PM	After 6 weeks of high dose infusion I started self maintnance 3x per week for the rest of the year.  This was the second time I had melanoma, stage III.  In the last 7 years since treatment I have had 2 more smaller melanomas that were caught early.  Side effects were at times unbarable.  But, I am still alive.  After having major flu like symptoms; high fever, weakness, mussel loss, weight loss, nausa, irratability, exhaustion, I do not complain anymore about getting a cold or flu!It was 6-8 months to get the matelic taste out of my mouth and 2 years to feel normal again an have enough energy to return to my active life.

Chronic Hepatitis C	Joe, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Male	45-54	1/13/2012 10:21:47 PM	I took this drug in 1993-94 for 6 months, shots in my legs/thighs 3 times weekly. It put the Hep C in remission, but 2 months after ending treatment I had Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and had to go through 6 months of Chemo and a Stem-Cell collection proceduce which cured the lymphoma. I haven't been the same since! I was never sick before the Hep C, but since I've had 3 Heart Attacks, a Kidney Turmor, Restless Leg Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, RSD after a knee operation and I have CONSTANT PAIN in my legs, especially where I give myself the shots and I'm CONSTANTLY TIRED and have to sleep every few hours, these conditions have gotten worst slowly over time. I still think that INTERFERON caused MOST of this and cost me a VERY high-paying job and SCREWED UP my LIFE!!!

Chronic Hepatitis C	bluemama, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	7/16/2011 5:26:15 PM	My Geno Type is #1; the first month I showed a huge drop in the viral count; by the second month minimal drops &amp; the onset of side effects of the mood swings, aggression, fatigue, hair loss, general pain all over has taken an extreme toll on my body.  During 1 of the high aggression episodes I called my supervisor a bitch &amp; that I hated her.  This is NOT my normal personality. I almost lost my job, had it not been for letters from the doctor &amp; the fact that I do an excellent job.  Even though my employer knew I was on this treatment, I am being blamed for &quot;willfully&quot; being insubordinate. I have been off the shot &amp; the 800 mg Ribavirin for 37 days &amp; am feeling better, but have a long way to go.  I will not take the treatment again.

This was somewhat difficult for me.  I didn't feel like eating and I also seemed a bit agitated.  Then my treatment was reduced to three shots a week for one year.  I felt a little more tired and headachy but just tried to get more rest.  My hair did begin thinning out a couple months after treatment, however I did not lose it completely.  It has just been five years for me of being cancer-free.  Maybe I was one of the fortunate ones because Interferon was vital to me making it through Stage 3 of malignant melanoma.

Would I do it again, yes, but it has knocked my body around very much and nearly drove my family to breaking point with mood and temperment swings.

Chronic Hepatitis C	Frank E, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	55-64	3/19/2009 7:28:56 AM	from the onset of taking the injections and the oral tablets I began to grow depressede and fatigued.  My physician said these side effects are expected and will clear afteer the six month program.  Three years now I have been on every anti-depressant known.  I suffer chronic fatigue and what they are now calling Fibromyalgia.  I contracted the virus when I had a blood transfusion in 1968, presumably, as I have never done drugs and remained faithful to my wife for 40 years-I am now 60.  I have found many others who suffer the dreadful side effects. I am happy for those who were fortunate enough to get thru the treatment without lasting side effects.  I have sought in vain most of the medical colleges to see if they are doing any studys on persons like myself.  If anyone knows of such a study please let me know.  Before treatment I felt good, jogged 2 miles every day, out going etc. now I can barely walk and I guess I could say life doesn't seem worth living anymore
