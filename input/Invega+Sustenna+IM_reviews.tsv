They didnt work because I always forgot to take them and so I constantly was in and out of Psychotic episodes. Felt a difference after the first injection. The voices began to quiet. Was very sleepy in the beginning. And moody, but not raging. Mellowed out over a few months. The facial twitches and personality glitches started to fade away. I was able to interact with my family again and now have a great relationship with them that I cherish. I love my kids and am learning to function as a mother and a provider for the first time on my own in a safe an loving way. This drug truely has saved my life and the well being of my children and their upbringing. Unfortunately it has come with a price. I have gained 76 pounds in 7 months. My thyroid is effected. I have abnormal heart electrical signals. High blood sugar. I stop breathing in my sleep. I have constant swelling on the arms legs and feet. I look like Im 8 months pregnant. I sweat and am constantly hot and dehydrated. I get hives and skin rashes all the time. My face is swollen and puffy. My vision is blurry and I cant hardly taste my food. Seems the side effects are piling up faster and faster lately and Im totally bummed out about it. Im suffering through them because I have tried literally dozens of other medications that havent worked at all and this is the best I have found. For those that havent tried it, you should. Its great. Its peace of mind for those who havent had it. And a chance at normalcy. For now, the side effects wont stop me from continuing to take it. Im seeing a specialist to help. Ill keep you updated on if there is resulution. Its the best I have found in 20 years.

Schizophrenia	Taylor, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	6/3/2012 12:54:35 AM	This medicine has worked great for me.  Before getting on this drug, I was very psychotic and nothing was helping.  Then when I started this I could tell a little difference, but after being on it for 5 months I'm experiencing hardly any symptoms and I'm feeling normal.  This has been a great drug for me.  When I first started using it I was very sleepy, but now I only get sleepy the day I get my shot, after that I'm good.

After trying other drugs I found the pills are fantastic in making one feel alert during the day. These are slow release tabs so you may have to take a sleeping pill to get to sleep. Now I've been taking the injections for two years. The first six months it takes a little more effort to stay awake during the day though with me this day sleepy feeling decreased. However I can still take day nap though the main reason for that is simply being bored in that I'd rather take a nap than stay awake. Night sleep is normal and you probably won't need a sleeping pill. On doses the first day seems the same as the last and there are no extreme highs or lows. I take the 117 dose. When considering the alternatives there is no other drug I'd rather be taking. Lucky for me with my insurance I can get three doses for $125.

I've found I can think very clearly on this drug. I recommend taking no sleeping pills on this and maybe only one cup of coffee in the morning. Don't smoke or drink alc unless maybe a little drink once in awhile to help you sleep. Don't eat things that can make you nervous like excessive sugar. I take the 117 dose and consistantly feel good as long as I sleep at least six hours a night.

We ought not torture people who we find have a different understanding of life than we do. This drug is terrible. I have written the Hague and reported administration of this drug on an involuntary basis is akin to a crime against humanity. The doctors who prescribe this &quot;medication&quot; or others like it ought to be tried for their crimes and brought to justice.

He just received the shot and is being monitored.  He seems calm and is able to better articulate his thoughts and think more rationally, but it is too soon to tell if this will help him to function as a normal 23 year old.  I'll post again as more time passes.

It lasts for 2 years from one shot and will make you a vegetable. I took one shot of this and it had me wanting to commit suicide all the time. My family thinks it has made me retarded and i am forced to live under the care of elders because of what its effects are every day. I have personnaly been messed up on one shot for 7 months and its as powerful as it ever has been. I recoomend no one recieve this medication and take it oraly if you must...this is more like torture and it should be reserved for pedofiles and rapists.

And the end results of not taken it was bad so for the sake of my children and family I took the shot and scared of needles but wasn't as bad as I thought. However it starting to make me feel tired and I just hope it make me eat cause I had to stop taken the one that made me eat so I get depressed and won't eat.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/8/2011 9:47:01 PM	I have schizoaffective disorder along with borderline personality disorder, and I've been on the Invega injection since October 2010 and I've been extremely happy with it. I was hallucination free for over 4 months which a small win for me.  I've been hearing voices since age 17 and I am now 25.   The voices are mildly coming back for several weeks now.  I am now able to study at the community college now and can concentrate better.  I have been on pretty much any mental health medicine you can think of since age 14.  The only medicines that have worked besides Invega are Risperdal Consta injection, Geodon, and Depakote, but I have to say the Invega injection is the best medicine I've been on by far.  As far as side effects I get hot and flush sometimes but it goes away maybe a half hour later.  This medicine ha changed my life for the better, I almost feel as good as I did when I was a child.

He is also on lithium as well. He still talks to himself some and paces around the house at times but considering how poorly he was doing on some of the other meds its a major improvement. He is able to set down and enjoy watching a little TV or play video games now where he wasnt before this medicine. Be careful with any of these meds and good luck.
Schizophrenia	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Male	19-24	10/18/2010 12:00:48 PM	Hi-I am the mother of a 20 year old son on Invega Sustenna IM for 6 months.  He has not had any weight gain but he is more sleepy.  The drug has dramaticly lowered the voices but has not eliminated them all together.  The mood swings are reduced significantly but don't forget he is still a young adult.  I as the care taker love the once a month injection.  I am no longer concerned with him being compliant with his medication.  As a care taker I highly recommend this medication.  It is expensive but Medicaid does pay for it.  Good Luck!!

Schizophrenia	dollie, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	11/10/2009 3:39:11 PM	The drug is wonderful that it only needs taken one time per month.  My symptoms that come with schizophrenia are gone after the 3rd shot.  The only negative is the side effect of weight gain.
