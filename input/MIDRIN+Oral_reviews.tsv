I found a compounding pharmacist who made it for me (with a dr.s prescription) @ $2 a bill. The only other drug that worked was Almotriptan at $30 a pill.

If you couldn't find it before, try again.

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/21/2012 2:22:08 PM	I have taken this drug for over 20 years for migraine headaches.  It is the best, most effective, medicine I have ever used.  What are they thinking taking it off the market when so many people use it!!!  I hope it is brought back again!
Migraine Headache	Jennifer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/21/2012 12:56:02 PM	I'm glad to see that this medication is back on the market. I have tried many other types of medicines for my migraines and they all seem to have terrible side effects. Midrin is the only one I can take and still function without feeling terrible. And it works fast and effectively. Another thing, when I see people complaining about Obama in a medicine review it triggers a migraine. That is all. Obama 2012!
Migraine Headache	hypochondry83, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/8/2012 9:28:58 PM	I just got prescribed this medication for my migraines, my doctor told me that I couldn't find this at Walmart because they quit making it for some reason but she told me that Super D drug store has it but it is really expensive $58 for 20 pills. I haven't taken them yet because I am worried about side effects but since reading everyone's reviews I feel a little bit better about taking it. I have been prescribed so many different kinds of meds but I've been too apprehensive about taking something that has too many side effects. But so far this one doesn't scare me as much. If anyone has or gotten really bad side effects from this med I would appreciate a email titans_angel_420@yahoo.com. Thanks.

Migraine Headache	Shellian, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/4/2012 4:18:50 AM	My migraine is gone within 20 minutes of taking the first 2 capsules.  I have rarely had to take a 3rd.  Midrin does not impair my ability to function.Where can I get it?  No pharmacy I have contacted has it.  Has it been discontinued or are they making it again?  I have found some relief with Maxalt but not any other migraine medication.

THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT NOW BUT IT WORKS JUST THE SAME AND MY INSURANCE STILL PAID THE SAME.  THANK YOU TO MY DOCTOR FOR RECOMMENDING THIS OPTION!  THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY WORKS FOR ME FOR ONSET MIGRAINES.  FROVA ALSO WORKS WELL FOR FULL BLOWN MIGRAINES FOR ME. THESE TWO MEDS TOOK YEARS FOR ME TO DISCOVER, BUT THANK GOD AND MY DOCTOR FOR HELPING ME FINALLY FIND RELIEF!
Other	Me, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/17/2011 2:25:35 PM	I get sinus headache's and they use to get so bad I would vomit.I would have to try cold packs on my face just for some relieve.The pain I had was in some of my teeth,jaw cheek/cheeks behind my eyes.Just to tuch any part made it hurt more. I would have to try and stay in bed like I said with a cold pack on my face and just keep my eyes closed. Sometimes it lasted most of the day.I couldn't work because there was no way without getting sick,and not even being able to drive myself.I would have had to keep my eyes closed.Until my family doctor said lets try Midrin.She told me most people that was given it they didn't have the same problem that I had.They were giving it for migraine headaches. After she gave me the prescription for Midrin it really did work.But I did after that first two to three times try only one to start with.But it didn't help at all.So I did do as she had told me to.And that was to start with two caps at the first sign of sinus headache.After that if still needed take one cap every hour.Until the sinus headache was gone.But not more than five capsules in a 12 hour period.But now I was told by my family doctor that the goverment don't make Midrin anylonger.I don't understand really why. But now she has given me a prescription for Fioricet.I don't know if it is the same or not.It probability isn't the same at all.Because if it was the goverment wouldn't have stop the Midrin.The Midrin worked for me and I am sure it must have for alot of other patients.Why stop something if it works.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/8/2011 6:31:53 PM	Midrin is coming back!!! I used to take this many years ago, but had been switched to Zomig, which is very effective for me.  My insurance (thanks Obama) after the beginning of the year will have no Rx coverage until after I meet a $2K deductible, and the Zomig is $485 for 12 tablets!  I recently checked with a couple pharmacies and they let me know that Midrin is coming back in stock (at least for now...)  Hope this helps others!

Migraine Headache	Jan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/28/2011 10:19:32 PM	I have been taking Midrin since it was prescribed for me (for Migraine headaches) by a neurologist more than 20 years ago. (I saw the neurologist after 10 days of unrelenting migraine pain).   When it has been unavailable or difficult to find, various Doctors have tried other drugs for my migraines - NONE worked as well as Midrin, or with as few side effects.  I have high blood pressure, and do not want to take anything with caffeine or other stimulants (which don't get rid of my migraines anyway).  PLEASE make Midrin available again!

Now I can't get it and I'm trying to find a Rx that doesn't knock me out and doesn't cost so much and I can have more than 6 or so a month.

Thanks to FDA I get to suffer  or go the the ER for a shot every time.  Please return the Midrin

Now they say you can't get it because FDA says it's not effective. Every medicine I have taken for a migraine. They take it off the market. They need to try this drug for their migraine and they will know it works. It's so unfair to all of us that used it.

I have a neuro-stimulator but still need pain medication for instance Midrin. Which cannot be found due to not being FDA approved company is working with FDA to start making it, but this will triple the cost. It is the only compound that works with my headaches. I have no idea how they got by with making it unapproved, I don't really care I need the drug.

I hate that we can't get it any more. I always had to take mine with a double dose of caffeine in some form to have it work and not put me to sleep. Now that its off the market, I'm trying to wrangle an RX for a med called called Prodrin that omits the sedative and see what that does. My &quot;ration&quot; is 6 Relpax a month so I do need alternatives! Before menopause, I also had an ongoing Rx for Frova which is the longest acting one (though for me, slower onset too) and could use that to cover more of my monthly vulnerable times a little proactively, but now they let you get only one med in any given class at one time.

I called several local pharmacies and savon did have it.  Also it is not discontinued, it is just severely backordered.  Im just glad i can use this again as i tried other different meds and it didnt help.  i would get migraines minimum 2 times a month since i was 24.  im 37 now and i want some relief!!acupuncture and feverfew pills have helped in the past, but now im getting the &quot;pms&quot; migraines which last only a few days.

No idea why it's off the market now.
Migraine Headache	 Female  (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female		1/4/2011 2:43:50 PM	Midrin has been discontinued as of dec. 2010. So far, there isn't any indication of recall. I know price doubled in month prior. Midrin worked at beginning but I soon developed a tolerance which is common for me w/ all drugs. I've had headaches due chronic pain and Midrin did help for awhile. I'll now try Prodrin which is similar sharing 2 of the 3 meds w/ Midrin.

My doctor switched me to fioricet which helps some but not as well as the midrin, it is also more expensive. Recently I have been able to get midrin in limited quantities. It is my understanding that it is available only in certain areas. Good luck to all in finding something that works for you without the side effects.

I went thru all the different meds, all the fancy &quot;triptans&quot; Now with the help of 3 preventive meds and Midrin I am able to have a somewhat normal life and the FDA thinks that Midrin doesn't work WTF REALLY. Then why are so many people using it with such success?  Now what are we to do?

Migraine Headache	JayBird, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	13-18	11/10/2010 11:03:24 AM	I was taking generic Midrin for migraines, didn't work for me. Took it for a month. But have learned works very well for some, not at all for others. Depends on Migraine triggers. For those being told Midrin no longer available I searched FDA site and found that Caraco is no longer allowed to manufacture 33 medications including Midrin. But generic brand is still available from other Pharmaceutical companies. ISOMETH/DICH/APAP capsules,Midrin was a compound medication containing acetaminophen, dichloralphenazone, and isometheptene mucate so shouldn't be any different.

Migraine Headache	sandyb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/18/2010 11:05:51 PM	I have been using Midrin for over 12 years and the 1st 2 tablet dosage is usually enough to stop the migraine.  Like many of you, I just found out that it is no longer being manufactured (Epidrin is a generic form - so it won't be available either).  My doc just gave me samples of Dolgic Plus, so here's to hoping it works!
Other		4	4	4			10/13/2010 8:54:15 PM	To all the folks saying they can't get it - I just filled my new prescription today. Are you talking about the brand-name or the generic that has stopped being manufactured? I got the generic. (btw, I gave everything 4 stars b/c I just wanted to let everyone know that there was no problem filling it, and I didn't want to mess up ratings, but I haven't actually tried it yet.)
Migraine Headache	renlau46, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/9/2010 7:14:07 AM	This has been the best treatment for me as I have 3 to 6 migraines a week, mostly weather related.  Until I found the Midrin I could not function on a day to day basis but am now able to work as the Midrin is mild enough with no major side effects. HELP-I am desperate learning they are no longer making as I just tried to refill mine--any advice on other substitutes?
Migraine Headache	katyakat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/8/2010 2:59:27 PM	I have been taking Midrin and/or the generic form. When taken as directed it gets rid of my migraines within 30 minutes 90% of the time with just two capsules. Very seldom do I have to use more than 2 capsules a day. Unfortunately, I also cannot get my prescription refilled because this medication is no longer being dispensed. I called the manufacuturer today: Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, and they informed me that the FDA has pulled the medication. So now we have to try to find a substitute that works as well. Sad, because it took so long to find this one that worked - without any side affects! For me that was great because I am very sensitive to medications. So the search is on...if anyone has any suggestions, please share them. I've read a little about Epidrin...is it similiar to Midrin? If anyone is familiar with it/has used it...would you please share your experience with it? Thank you.
Migraine Headache	Tuffy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	65-74	9/29/2010 9:35:30 PM	I have used Midrin for 36 years for migraine.  It has been effective about 50% of the time when used at onset of pain; if pain is not eased early on, more Midrin does no good.  I don't leave home without it.  I use the generic.

Midrin does nothing for me, except make me nauseous. Unfortunately, because Imitrex works great but costs way too much on insurance.  
Migraine Headache	Jaggers, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/24/2010 12:01:10 PM	The triptans do nothing for me.  After my second ER visit in 6 months, my doctor prescribed midrin.  If taken when the first symptoms of a migraine start, it gets rid of the headache 75% of the time.  The other 25% keeps the headache under control so that I can still function.  I've never had any problem with addiction of feeling high.  I was recently told (9/23/10) that the manufacturer is no longer making this drug.  So I guess I'm now back to square one.

I didn't realize it but I have been suffering with Migraines for years.  In one day this medication has made me feel like my old self again.  I was suffering from nausea, dizziness, weird pain, and fatigue.  This medicine is a God send.  Thanks...
Tension Headache	Moderate1, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	25-34	8/15/2010 7:58:52 PM	Bismillah. It's Aug 2010 and this drug is still available at my pharmacy. I don't know why everyone thought it was being discontinued...I reviewed this drug in 2008 when I first started taking it. After further review and more time using it, its kind of ineffective and if I take more than 1 I feel like i have this lump in my throat! I tend to clench my jaw and hold a lot of tension in my jaw which gives me tension headaches. It's worth a try and may work sometimes but I rarely fill my prescription and just keep some on hand as a last resort.
Migraine Headache	Mybrain sufferer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/28/2010 2:16:24 PM	Severe complex migraines since age of 18, frequency and severity have decreased with age. My triggers were hormonal (menstrual period), atmospheric pressure changes (including frontal passage with storms or airplane flights,) and aspartame. Learned to take midrin before flight if other triggers coincided with air travel. Still never eat or drink foods with aspartame. Ever. Midrin taken at onset of migraine prodrome (including visual changes, confusion, sensory changes,) either decreased intensity of migraine or at times aborted headache all together; usually had to take for at least 24 hours to maintain effectiveness, sometimes longer. No other meds (except narcotic for pain before I began using midrin,)ever helped. Now am 55 yrs. old, rare mild migraine now that am post menopausal, but still use midrin to abort migraines maybe twice a year, always works. Migraines are strange; not all treatments work for all people, but Midrin was a lifesaver for me.

This medicine is wonderful!!!!!!! I've tried several seizure medicines but they caused to many siade effects.  The midrin is the only thing that works with very few side effects.  I love it!!!!

I take 1 at onset and if I need to an hour later take another. Usually works like a charm. Sleepiness can happen. Not normally for me though unless I have to take 2 for a migraine where I was not home to take right away!

This medication has worked from day one!  I am VERY pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone.  I do not get over drowsy, just relaxed and almost never need follow up doses. 
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/23/2010 2:54:04 AM	I was prescribed this type of medication as an experiment to see what type of medication would work on my type of migraine. This particular type had absolutley no effect at all on my type of migraine which includes cervical involment as well. I do hope that it works for some. You don't want to be on the medication regimen I have to take daily. Don't give up. :)  GOOD LUCK...Lynn
Migraine Headache	nbillshale, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/20/2010 4:58:19 AM	My first migraine was at age 13 and those initial symptoms (visual aura, numbness passing up my arms/across my chest/not being able to breath without consciously focusing on the inhale and exhale) along with the later symptoms (extreme pain in my temple, nausea, vomiting, and wanting to &quot;just die because of the pain&quot;) were very frightening. As a teenager and young adult, my whole life was ruled by the fear that an &quot;attack&quot; was imminent. At age 25, the greatest doctor in the world prescribed Propranolol as a daily preventative and Midrin as the immediate medication to stop the migraines once they began. Today I take Propranolol (beta blocker) daily and when the aura comes (less than 5 times per year), Midrin is my lifesaver.  Two capsules and 20 minutes later, the aura subsides without the fullblown pain of the headache or other symptoms.  If possible, I will relax and &quot;sleep&quot; awhile, but at work (first grade teacher) I can take a short 20 minute break and continue with my normal day. Midrin is truly my &quot;miracle&quot;.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	3/15/2010 7:42:40 PM	Having been diagnosed with migraine's and trying all sorts of headache meds, midrin is the first medication i've been able to take with some sort of relief without feeling like i couldn't breathe like I did with imitrex. It doesn't always work, but it never makes me drowsy or gives me any other side effects. 
Migraine Headache	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	3/3/2010 7:22:27 PM	I was given this medication for migraines. Took this med for 2 months and it made no difference on the headache, sound/light sensitivity, and nausea. It did not work for me but might work for someone else. I was given imitrex and it works like a charm minus a couple side effects.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	2/23/2010 6:21:29 PM	I take this for migraines and tension headaches. The first 3-4 times I used it it worked great. But, I got so drowsy that sleeping for the next 3+ hours was the only thing I could do. The more I used it, the less effective it became. Now it rarely works, and if it does it is very short lived. The side effects are not worth the measly hour or so of relief I MIGHT get.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/18/2010 11:39:08 AM	I started taking this just as needed for migrane headaches 5 years ago. I tried some of the new medication and it made the pain worse. My script is to take two tablets to start with and then one every hr until the pain is gone. 99% of the time it is gone after just taking 1 pill total. It has definately helped me a lot.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	2/4/2010 3:33:47 PM	I get migraines about 3 times a week for a 2 weeks period. theres times when i take my midrin and it works and times when it doesnt. im not the person that will sit here and pop pills til its gone, but thats what happens from time to time. its somewhat effective when it works. 
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/3/2010 9:06:45 PM	I have severe migraine headaches, sometimes up to three a month, that will knock me down for two or three days.  Light hurts, sounds hurt, moving hurts - it really stinks, as anyone that has migraines will tell you.  My doctor prescribed me Midrin and from the start I was very impressed with how well this medication works.  When I picked up the prescription, I was in the middle of a massive migraine.  I took two of them, and I noticed within about 20 minutes that the headache was much better - but not gone.  I took one more 45 minutes after the first dose, and within another 15-20 minutes the headache was gone.  It was the first time in almost three days that I could think straight, I could watch TV, listen to my daughter playing - all without being in agony.  I would totally recommend Midrin to anyone that has migraines or other bad headaches.

I haven't felt this good in a really long time...I feel like myself again. I am having a little bit of trouble concentrating at work because I feel a bit drowsy from it but I'd prefer drowsy over the headache pain that lasts all day.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/11/2009 6:03:36 AM	I have had migraines for several years now.  I have been addicted to narcotics due to my migraines. Thank god, I am over that hill! Midrin is the only medication that works for me.  I have had one for the last 4 days and even went to the ER last night because of it, and because I didn't realize I was out of Midrin.  I left with the migraine and it only went away after I filled my script of Midrin.  For those who say narcotics are the only answer, I would say take a look in the mirror.  I have been in your place, but there is always a better answer than narcotics.  I love this medication- it works wonders. And as a caregiver in the ER, if you come in and say all that works is narcotics and you are allergic to ibuprofen, tylenol, and torodal- we know your full of crap and narc seeking. FYI

Migraine Headache	Suzie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	8/26/2009 9:45:38 PM	I have suffered from Migraines and Tension headaches for several years. I have taken Midrin for most of them. I take it at the start of the tension coming from the base of my neck and before I go into a full blown migraine. It is very effective most of the time. I do also take Relpax if Midrin doesnt work completeyly. I have no sied effects to speak of, possibly a little drowsy sometimes. I only take 1 at a time, followed by another 4 hours later or so if needed. It seems to be a mild muscle relaxer which is fine for me because I have a lot of allergies and am very sensitive to drugs. I am allergic to Aspirin, Codeine, Sudafed and some others. I do also go to the Chiropractor regularly and when I go faithfully I dont get the headaches much at all. I would reccommend Midrin to anyone with Tension/Migraine headaches.
Tension Headache	megs, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/5/2009 9:35:42 AM	Because they will only give me a few pills at a time, I use this very sparingly, and only when all OTC meds have not relieved my extreme pain. Midrin is the only drug I have found that works, although I have also taken Rx muscle relaxers, and that sometimes works as well (not taken together of course!)
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	8/5/2009 5:56:53 AM	I tried Midrin for migraine headaches and it didn't work. It's good for tension headaches and it made me drowsy (of course sleep feels good when easing your headache.)

I take nortriptyline caps to decrease the amount of times i get a headache, and the midrin is used at time when i do get a headache. I try not to take it every time I get a headche because , this drug may cause dependancy if used to much. I try to switch it up and use the midrin and sometime take tylonel extra strenghth. whenever i take this medication I have to take at least 2 for it to work. But they work wonderfully. I do get a little drowzy when taking this medication.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/30/2009 10:38:51 PM	I was prescribed Midrin yesterday during an appointment with my new doctor. I have migraine headaches quite frequently and my usually medication hasnt been working. I had a migraine for a week, and she gave me midrin, told me to take it last night and the migraine should be gone. I woke up this morning, not feeling up to par. I continued getting ready for work, and started driving.. Bad idea. I began to feel sick to my stomach, felt a bad chest pain, and started having trouble breathing. I began to have numbness in my face, and my left arm. I slowed down, pulled over and called an ambulance. After 5 hours of tests, they told me it was an allergic reaction. I am home now, resting. They told me to drink lots of water to flush it out of my system. Im just glad i only took one pill... Just wanted to post this on here, to let others know. I do not believe my doctor considered my medical condition (i had my spleen removed), and that may have been another trigger to it. I am not a doctor, and i do not know, but that is my theory. Please be careful with this. That was one scary experience that i dont ever want to go through again. I am 19 years old and it felt as if it was a heartattack.

The doc told me to take two starting out then one every hour till the headache was gone, but dont exceed 5 in a 24 hr. period. I had a migraine for two days before I took Midrin and i will say that Midrin worked wonders for me! It got rid of the headache and never came back. The only thing for me was I felt really loopy and weird for about 20 mins.

I've never felt loopy or &quot;crazy&quot; after taking it.  Always ask your doctor first.  I keep one on hand.  Once the stars start in my eyes I take one and the migraine pain never comes.  If I wait Midrin usually takes the pain away in about 30min.

And anyone who has migraines does not want to take something that they have to take again in an hour. YOu want something that is going to do away with the headache completely. Midrin did not help or slightly relieve my migraines

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/10/2009 11:29:11 AM	This medication by far has worked the best for my migraines. I had tried different medications in the past that had many different side effects I experienced. However with this medication it worked so well to relieve my migraines and without any nasty side effects. I would definitly recommend anyone with migraine headaches to try this medication for themselves.

Tension Headache	stephmor, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	1/27/2009 3:27:25 PM	I began to take Midrin after I had been treated for headaches ( migraine and tension) with Torydol injections, OTC Advil Migraine, muscle relaxers and chiropractic therapy. The first dose I took seemed to help but headache came back in full force less than 1 hour later. If I take 4-5 it helps enought to let me rest and sleep at night. However, I still kept getting the pain. My neurologist just perscribed Topamax which I am very concerned about taking due to the many side effects reported. I am going ot give it a shot and see how I react to it. 
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/15/2009 1:18:33 AM	I have suffered with Migraine headaches for the past 19 years.  The worst one lasted for 3 SOLID MONTHS. By the time someone finally believed me that it wasn't &quot;all in my head&quot; (you'll pardon the pun...) I was suicidal from the pain, which was FAR worse than childbirth.  I ended up in the hospital for the DHE Protocol. I've been hospitalized 3 times for Migraines.  I went through every medication in the book. At the time, the only thing that worked was Topomax. However, it caused severe weight loss &amp; I had to d/c using it, as I was literally wasting away.  Fortunately, it broke the cycle and this was when my neurologist prescribed Midrin.  Most of the time it does the trick, within 20-30 minutes.  I don't have any of the drowsiness that others have reported, but it does tend to take a minimum of 4 tabs over 5 hours to knock it down. Unfortunately, it isn't 100% effective, but for the most part, I've been very satisifed with it's performance.  Rumors that it's to be discontinued are very alarming. I hope it's not true. 
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/13/2009 10:18:10 PM	It took a lot of years to find something that worked. This with the combination of Topomax has been such a blessing to my life. I start with 2, then if I need to an hour later take another, not exceeding 5 in 24 hrs. I rarely have to take more than 2 and only a few times have had to take more than 3. 
Migraine Headache	n/a, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/6/2009 4:07:43 PM	This has been an effective Rx for tension migraines, but Fioricet seems to work better. I find taking it w/ a caffinated beverage (if you're not about to go to sleep or are not highly sensitive to caffiene) makes it more effective. 
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	12/20/2008 2:49:03 AM	I have been on numerous medications to control my migraine headaches.  Midrin is the only one that has ever worked for me.  I notice the intense pain start to subside very shortly after I take two pills, and if I take a third pill, the migraine dissipates entirely.  It also helps relieve the headaches I get that are accompanied by back and EXTREME shoulder pain!

Now when I start getting halo's, loss of vision, tingling in various body parts, or pain (all of which can signal a migraine for me) I take this.  9/10 times I am able to fight the migraines off now that I take this medication.

I'm now 21, so I've been suffering with this for about 10 or 11yrs, though it feels like I've been suffering soooo much longer! Previously, I have taken Imitrex, Topomax, Tylenol, Ibuprophen, aspirin, Excedrin, Advil, Maxalt etc. You name it, I've tried it at some point, and NONE of them worked for me. I was at the end of my rope, until I recently started taking this medication, and it has worked wonders for me! I take it at the onset of my migraine, and the pain goes away almost instantly. Yes, there is very slight drowsiness that comes with taking Midrin, but other than that, it's absolutely perfect. Because of this medication, I no longer live in fear of my next attack.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/2/2008 9:19:03 PM	I have suffered from classic migraines for twenty years.My first was when I was twelve.folks,I'm telling you,I have suffered these headaches practicly my whole life with no hope of finding any med that would work.Some that I was prescribed actually made my aura onset painfull.A family friend gave me a couple of midrin and told me to try them.I went a year and a half before my next migrain and then I was with my son on a school feild trip to 'sea world' when it hit.I was almost totaly blind within 15 minutes and I had to be drivin home by one of the staff.I had suffered severe pain for well over an hour on the 100 mile trip home.My wife met me at the school with the 2 midrin and within 15 minutes the pain and sickness just lifted off me and was gone!completely gone.I thank GOD for this med.It is truly my little miracle.When I got home I ate dinner and watched t.v with my wife,in utter amazement.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/29/2008 8:39:12 PM	I have had migraines for approx 3 years.  I have been percribed every medicine possible.  The only one that has worked is Midirin. Just like others have said, it works within 20 minutes if taken at the onset of migraine.  Yes it does make you sleepy, but when having a migraine, ther isnt anything else I can do, besides sleep.  :)  Wonderful product! Instant relief!
Migraine Headache	 Mostly Pain Free due to Midrin, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/23/2008 12:20:28 PM	I have had migraines since I was 17 years old. I am allergic to narcotics. No over-counter migraine medicines touch my headaches. Midrin helps me as long as I take it as soon as I begin the ocular symtoms of the headache. Most of the time I am helped 100% unless I am somewhere where I cannot take it in time, which does not happen often. When it does, I can have the headache for 36-hours and the Midrin just chases the pain until the migrain cycles out.  My pharmacist says Midrin is going to be discontinued and this concerns me to have to go through different medicines again.

I usually take a nap after i take it. but it works!
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/9/2008 3:47:57 PM	i have had severe migraines for two years, this is the only drug that has worked for me. it relieves the pain within twenty minutes. there are some concerns as to whether or not it is still available...i just picked up my prescription yesterday, i'm in california.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/5/2008 3:33:17 AM	I've had migraines..well for as long as I can remember. Tried everything. ALl OTC, none work. Several different prescriptions, nothing worked. Then finally, Midrin. I feel better in almost twenty minutes. Although there is a very distinct drowsiness, which normally passes after half an hour to forty-five minutes. But if people would realize it does have a SEDATIVE in it, maybe they'll understand. It's the only thing that works and it works like a dream.!!!
Tension Headache	Moderate1, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	8/30/2008 4:39:22 PM	Bismillah. I thought I was having migraines but the doctor says they're just bad tension headaches. No over the counter pain meds worked for me, not tylenol, advil, aleve, or excedrin.  When I tried Imitrex and it worked I realized I need a pill with a vascular constrictor. Imitrex and other migraine meds like it cant be taken more than weekly and is extremely expensive where as Epidrin/Midrin can be taken a bit more regularly. I have to take at least two pills and then one every hour until it subsides. This pill contains is acetaminophen(tylenol), a vascular constrictor which shrinks the blood vessels, and a light sedative. As for its availability, I'm in Los Angeles and this is August 2008. It's available and called &quot;Epidrin&quot; they cost 50 cents a pill at my pharmacy and come as a white/red capsule. So they are available now. I hope all the pain and suffering can be taken care of for all people in the world and healthcare can be free for all. Because no one should have to suffer like this when there are cures but one just can't afford to see a doctor or pay for ones meds.Good Luck and God Bless.
Migraine Headache	Millie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/22/2008 12:19:44 AM	Used Midrin for over 21 yrs. Only Med thatworked every time. I only used when I neededit-per doctors instruction-took 2 capsuleswhen it started/or when it struck suddenly -&amp; 1 every four hours after that.  Some yrs.couldn't get Midrin because company that made it either couldn't keep up supplies orthe same company wasn't making it, etc. I'mvery med sensitive-but, I never got addictedor had any problems w/it. Midrin helped witheach/&amp; every symptom I had:tension, cluster,sick migraines w/dizzy, nausea, throwing up,can't see-so sick that I couldn't function-those so sick migraines that required hospitalization/just shoot me pain-take me  out of my misery kind. After they becamemore available again - Midrin was not madethe same as it had been done before. Thesub med that I took during that time wasnothing like the original Midrin I had beentaking. This Midrin works well enough - but,I remember the original Midrin was way better-example: my migraines were major painful - and the original Midrin only took 15mins. or so to work - it was fast! This Midrin does not work as fast &amp; I have to take more med in order to get better results. Either way-thankful to have had theMidrin to fall back on ---don't know what Iwould have done or lived without it!

A couple of months later it stopped working and it made me very depressed and had a bad taste.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/17/2008 5:49:39 PM	Midrin when taken during my auras stops the migraine. It does cause some lightheadedness and sometimes I still get just a mild, tolerable ache; but it is well worth it.

Migraine Headache	KeeCherie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	8/8/2008 8:56:12 PM	Yesterday was my first time taking Midrin, after a 2 day migraine.  I've never taken anything other than Excedrin because my migraines are usually not severe.  This was the 2nd time that I had the aura first and then the migraine.  The Midrin helped tremedously because I was able to fall asleep without the throbbing pain at my right temple.  I'm looking forwarded to taking the second dose tonight to knock out the little ache that remains.

Migraine Headache	jsellman, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	6/5/2008 8:45:25 PM	I was prescribed this medication as a replacement for Excedrin Migraine (which was wonderful!). Sometimes it works after 1-2 doses and other times it take 4 doses to work. Unfortunately the doctor said not to take more than 10 a week so during a really bad period I have to take Vistaril.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	5/28/2008 2:32:25 PM	This medication has worked on the first dose every time for my migraines.  I have tried multiple other meds, and no others have given me such consistent results.  The only down side is that it makes me very drowsy.  I have to plan for at least an hour long nap after taking this med.  The results are well worth it.

Tension Headache	Dave, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/15/2008 1:46:49 PM	Midrin has worked like a wonder drug for me for many years.  It will knock out a bad headache within an hour. I have not experienced any negative side effects, other than a small amount of light headedness due to the tranquilizer content. This drug is a good alternative for those folks who can't take Motrin or Advil, which are also very effective on tension headaches. This simple drug has so improved the quality of my life; it's almost magical.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/14/2008 12:02:26 PM	Midrin has worked for me for the last 10 years.  It is the only thing that allows me some comfort and sleep when a episode comes on.  There has been some lingering dizziness, but it is mild and goes away with in a few hours.  
Migraine Headache	tre, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/8/2008 10:31:13 PM	I've had headaches since I was 18 (I'm 34 now) and after YEARS of going to doctors (neurologists..etc) and having MRI's, CAT scans, any diagnostic tool possible, and numerous medications - they said &quot;Last resort&quot; use this - it has done wonders for my life - I now do not have to 'hold it' until I get off work so I can crash when I get home and be debilitated by a headache - it goes away pretty quick if I take it early.  Even when I couldn't get to my pills and it was really bad, it only took two doses and after a few years I have gotten past the sleepy part - my body has adjusted to where I'm just a little more calm when I take one.  This was a wonderful drug, sad that it was a last resort.  They now have LOTS of generics and work just as well as the Midrin.  If they say it's not available, ask the doctor to find the generic and ask for THAT by name.

Migraine Headache	Stacey, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/22/2008 5:24:35 PM	I was prescribed this medication during pregnancy for treatment of migraines brought on by hormone changes. It worked so well I continued to use it even after I had my baby.  I highly recommend this medication.  Obviously not all medications work the same for everyone, but should consider at least trying Midrin.  (Midrin is actually currently on backorder, but generics are available).

Takes away little aches and pains you didn't know you had until they are gone, sinuses, back, and joints.

Tension Headache	kayla, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/24/2007 7:59:09 PM	I am not able to swollow pill, so I open then. I have not gotten any side effects from doing this. It has been at least 10 yrs since I have been taking this pill as needed for pain.  Today is 11-23-07 and the pharmacist is saying they have not been able to get this med in stock, so I have none to take. WHAT IS GOING ON? Who is making this pill and are they/habe they stop making it?

Migraine Headache	printcessl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/20/2007 3:38:08 PM	Even though I had a history of complicated migraines as well as normal I found this drug to be by far the BEST. As soon as I saw the aura I would take two and lay down. Nine out of ten times it would completely short circuit the headache even with extremely wild auras. My auras were ussually an indication of how bad the headache was going to be.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/7/2007 12:49:20 PM	I tried every type of migraine medication on the market for years nothing worked until the doctor prescribed Midrin. It works wonderfully. It works fast without making me sleepy. I can actually take it and function. Others meds just made me sleep without actually making the headache leave.
Headache caused by Disorder of Cranial Blood Vessels	angpetsche, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	11/5/2007 4:25:10 PM	I was extremely unhappy to hear that they pulled Midrin, true walgreens say that, there are other places that do have it.  The only thing that they are pulling is the Generic Versions &quot;Epidrin&quot;, etc.  Midrin is so worth it.  It helps me tremendously, one dose and i am usually can function.  Take my word for it, seek a neurologist, do not let your family physician attempt to figure this out for you.  Get real help, get a cscan get a MRI, get sleep tests and stress tests.  FMLA most of the time will cover you as a single working mother who has been on the job for at least a year.!!  please look into it for yourself so that you dont have to worry about losing your job while dealing with the delapiating pain of a migraine.
Migraine Headache	Leslie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/31/2007 10:05:02 AM	Good news for those of you who have been told Midrin is being discontinued.  This is not the case.  The manufacturer, Caracao, has stated that Midrin is on backorder because all of the generics have been discontinued.  They are making weekly shipments to distributors, but you shouldn't expect to see it easier to find anytime soon.  I have found that it is best to call each pharmacy directly to see if the have it in stock - I made the mistake of asking my normal pharmacy (a Walgreens) to look up inventory and call other area stores to see if they had in stock.  They said no.  I then made calls to 5 other locations and found it in stock.  It's worth the effort.  I've recently been diagnosed with mirgraines, so I haven't had to go through trial and error on many of the other drugs out there; however, my headaches seem to start out as tension headaches that develop into full blow migraines and last 3 - 4 days.  Midrin is the only drug on the market today to deal with both tension headaches and migraines.  I've read that Imitrex injections are an alernative that may help with tension headaches; however, I'm not too keen on that idea.  I've had 3 episodes since July and Midrin keeps them from going full blown and I'm usually funtional within 24 hours if I catch it right away.  If I don't, it takes me a good 3 - 4 days to get over it, but the pain is gone within a day. 
Migraine Headache	Nancy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	10/27/2007 8:57:31 PM	I am on a daily medication to prevent migraine and tension headaches and have been for about seven years. Needless to say my doctors have tried a lot of medications to treat the migraines at the onset which is usually still about twice a month. From Imitrex tablets, Maxalt, Imitrex injections that actually worked for a few years but eventually having the affect on my heart that it was going to explode and my blood pressure go up, headache worsen and ending in after the second injection still bedridden with the migraine for at least three days. In between the Imitrex injections when the migraine would become full blown, I would take midrin. I soon found out that I didn't even need the injections to get rid of the migraines. They were a God send for about three years and now for the past two months I have been bed ridden with 5 migraines that have lasted no less than 4 days. I am a single mother raising 2 teenage boys. I can't afford to miss another day due to a migraine. The interfere with every part of your life and your body. I think that most all migraine sufferers can identify with me on that. Now, my question is that there are too many people benefiting from this medication for it to be pulled simply because someone did not do their part of the paper work. Evidently whom ever this pulling of the great working medication and the ones working for the manufacturer that did not make sure it was not FDA approved do not suffer from severe headaches. We as sufferers need to do something about this because their actions and non-actions affect our lives and whether they are good and pain free or are scaling from 1-10 9 or 10 and living a dark room for 1-5 days. Good luck to all who suffer from any kind of headache.
Tension Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	10/27/2007 3:00:51 AM	I Have Migraines/Tension Headaches 5-6 times a month. The first time I took Midrin My headache was gone in 30 mins. I was amazed. I thought this was the best stuff ever UNTIL... I had another headache that same week. I took the first two pills.. NOTHING.. took the one every hour .. NO RELIEF .. SO I stop taking them for about 2 months and only took them once a month SO I could get the &quot;Great first time affect&quot;. and suffered the rest of the month.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	10/19/2007 2:45:33 PM	Take at first sign of migraine 'aura' and it prevents it from becoming a full blown migraine. I still generally have a bit of a headache, but I can continue to function.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/18/2007 4:19:21 PM	In use for the treatment of migraines, I have found that Midrin has been a perfect answer for me. In taking some other migrain medications, they have cause extreme elevation in my blood pressure. The midrin does not cause this and the relief seems to take place very quickly. Also, with possible dosage at onset and possibly hourly, it wards off any contiuance of the headache.
Migraine Headache	former midrin user, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/15/2007 10:23:37 PM	About 15-20years ago when I was a little kid suffering from extreme migrain headaches I thought there was nothing I could do to stop the pain.  As a child this is devistating to your life.  I could not go out and play sports or anything stressful due to the fact any thing that got me excited and my adreniline going instantly caused massive headaches to the point I would throw up and cry.  the pain was so unbareable sometimes i wish I would just die!  If that doesnt prove how serious the pain was nothing will.  My mom took me to the doctor and they prescribed me midrin... after that I still had migrains but took two pills right away and the pain would go away.  I finally was able to have a normal life a child should have and I am very greatful to the makers or midrin.  I took midrin for a couple of years and eventually out grew the migrains.  I am writing this incase others out there are suffering as much as I did.. there is help and its in this medication. the choice is up to you and its your body but you can find relief with midrin im sure of it!  Sincerely,Corey k

Other	relief, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/9/2007 10:31:27 PM	used imitrex- hated it- tried relpax which was okay but 12.00 per pill after insurance- and often needed more per mo than insurance would cover- someone suggested midrin- it works better than anything else I have used over 10 years- helps with migraines, tension headaches, etc- don't need all the time- but when I do it works great without any noticeable side effects- 
Migraine Headache	electra,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/8/2007 5:54:36 PM	I have combinations of Migraine and Tension headaches.  Within 30 minutes of taking this I can function with barely a sign of any headache for 4 hours.  This taken in combination with a mild dose Flextra DS makes my headaches totally disappear.
Tension Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/8/2007 12:49:40 PM	Recently when I tried to get a refill on this med, I was told by my pharmacist that they can no longer get it and that it is being taken off the market because of it's 'side effects'. this med has been around a very long time, and it's one of the only one that works on my tension headaches. So, he prescribed Fiorocet-this does not work on tension headaches as it does not have a vasoconstrictor in it. I called another pharmacist who told me Epidrin is basically the same, but a generic. I'm hoping my doc will give this to me so I don't have to suffer.
Migraine Headache		5	5	5			10/5/2007 6:42:37 PM	I had to try over 9 different migraine meds before trying midrin. My doc made me try beta blockers, and other types of meds to stop my frequent migranes.Midrin works best for me, better than imitrex and others. I can take just one if i catch it early, or two to start and one every hour there after.  I've never had to take more than 4 to totally stop a migrane.Even if i was unable to get to my midrin and migraine is badly underway, 2-3 midrin will stop the headache.  usually i'm 100% fine after an hour to 90 minutes.i have heard that recently manufactures have stopped making it; i'm trying to find out if it is true.
Migraine Headache	Rose, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	9/26/2007 1:55:14 PM	Midrin has worked well in treating my migraines. Sadly though my pharmacist informed me that it's being discontinued and suggested that I try and stock up. There is a long backorder on all of the generics currently. To the person who said it was being replaced with epidrin, that's a generic of the drug and has a long backorder, much like all others. I hope it's just a supply problem and not that it's really being discontinued
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	9/26/2007 9:59:16 AM	Very effective for me, though it makes me very drowsy.  The hardest part is staying awake or waking up to get the correct dose.

Migraine Headache	nikita, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/24/2007 6:24:07 PM	My pharmacy just told me it has been pulled off the market, but I can't find anything anywhere about that. She said it has been replaced by epidrin, but that is long-term backordered because of demand. I looked them both up here and they are exactly the same compound! 
Migraine Headache	Yolunda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	9/22/2007 2:24:55 AM	My biggest problem is finding this drug. It is the only thing I've found that help my headaches.....
Migraine Headache	peachbrown, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/20/2007 3:55:14 PM	I get occular migraines first, then the headache pain, unless I take the Midrin right when the visual effects begin. If I do that, 90% of the time, I get the pretty sparkly things and no headache.
