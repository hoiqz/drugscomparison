Problems with Bladder Control	wardandceleita@aol.com, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	9/13/2012 6:46:29 PM	Seems to have given relief relative to my former frequent urges to urinate. I have a fairly good experience with this drug. Had a cough prior to using this drug and it seems that it continues (Dry/irratated Throat).
Urine Leakage When there is a Strong Desire to Void	bjinouno, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	1	1	Female		8/18/2012 11:44:14 PM	my mother age 78 went from always going to a complete STOP in 36 hours, also stopped pooping,not being able being able to swallow, Very dry mouth and throat, heartburn, and blockage in 4 days of upper bowel.  had NG tube down her nose for 10 days, pick line put in for medications and nurishment, When NG tube taken out, felt great UNTIL Staff restarted all my meds, including Ditrapan, which landed her AGAIN to all above, except NG tube, was catherized, straight cat, (due to not peeing) No one saw I was on this drug that nearly killed me, 90 days in hospital, and than on FLOMAX to make her pee again. WATCH for every side effect and get off of it IF u notice any.. one leads to another!
Other	Angel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/27/2012 4:07:23 AM	I found it amazing to treat my hyperhydrosis (auxilla, hands and feet). It seemed like a miracle cure, after trying other options for years. And I was able to deal with the side effects of dry mouth, dry nose, dry and sore throat....it was all far better than shaking someone's hand with sweat literally dripping from my fingers, or avoiding any meetings in the afternoons, once I had body odour. But I wasn't able to deal with the dry vagina I also got. In fact, that was bad enough for me to stop taking the drug - which was not an easy decision to make. I'm still searching for something I can do to combat this side effect, so that I can start taking the drug again, and also once again enjoy spontaneous love making with my fiance. If anyone has suggestions, I'm very keen to hear them. Thanks.
Overactive Bladder	VickiG, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	3	5	Male	3-6	10/25/2011 11:23:55 AM	My 6 year old son was put on the medication for bladder spasms that would cause him to be wet all day long. Immediately after starting the meds the leakage stopped.  It's hard to get him to take a pill, so we started weaning him off after a month and no more leaks!!

Problems with Bladder Control	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	45-54	2/15/2011 4:12:21 AM	Much more effective than Enablex, and very affordable (a bonus).  Three times a day is hard to remember, but it sure beats an accident or a diaper.
Problems with Bladder Control	SoozeB, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	4	1	Female	55-64	1/29/2011 7:40:52 PM	I already have dry throat syndrome and this not only made it worse, it also felt like my throat was swollen and I had difficulty swallowing.  Even worse was the really bad heartburn.  I'm calling my doctor on Monday for something else.
Needing to Urinate Immediately	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/17/2011 1:03:34 PM	What a relief! I am on day 2 of taking oxybutynin 5mg (the generic for ditropan) and I couldnt be more satisfied! I have had problems holding my urine in since I could remember and frequent urination. As a child, the doctors told me I &quot;would grow into my bladder&quot; whatever that means lol. On a normal night, I would've woken up atleast twice, but last night was the first time EVER that I slept through the night with out HAVING (that second) to go pee AND I even fell back to sleep for 2 hours!! When I woke up, I made it to the bathroom with ease! Seriously, I highly reccommend this medication. Now if only Ditropan could make me a spokeswoman!! Thank you Ditropan for giving me my life back!! :)

Other	all, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	8/23/2010 12:07:38 AM	My 8 year old Grand Daughter was prescribed this medicine for bed wetting.  At first she took it twice a day, but stopped urinating during the day. Has been taking it once a day, at bed time for the past 3 days.  She has had changes in behavior.  She is normaly a very well behaved child and a joy to be around.  The past 3 days she has been very aggressive and very emotional.  She has been rolling her eyes alot. I asked her why she was rolling her eyes and she said that she was just stretching her eyes. We noticed that she was rolling her eyes after about every 2 to 3 winks.  Not sure if it's voluntary, or possible side affect of meds.  If it continues tomorrow, will report it to her doctor.  Has anyone else had these effects?  She also has complained of stomache upset.

Since taking I have not seen a big difference could be because I need surgery to tack up my bladder but I am trying everything not to have to. No side affects that bother me
Overactive Bladder	SamanthaMarie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/19/2010 8:17:11 PM	My 6-yr.old son has been taking this medication for almost a month now. THere has been no improvement since taking it. In fact, he has gotten worse because of drinking more water.
Difficult or Painful Urination	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	12/29/2009 8:30:18 AM	I have been taking this medecation for two weeks and i still have painful urination
Frequent Urination	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	12/13/2009 1:45:46 PM	I have only used this medicine for approximately 1 week.   I have severe dry mouth, and also having trouble urinating when I need to, I have to strain, eventually I will go.   So far I am not really sure I want to continue this medication

Other	sclark, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/13/2009 8:07:41 AM	This drug has changed my life.  I was sweating profusely which caused me much embarassment and also always running to the bathroom. I take 5mg 2x a day and I have had great results.  For the dry mouth I use  biotene mouthwash and toothpaste.  This allows me to sleep and go all day with no dry mouth. I've also bought a spray can for my purse if my mouth gets dry.  The spray is not tasty but it chases away the dry mouth immediatly. Other option is to have sugarless candy or breath strips. 
Other	Hyperhidrotic, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	5/26/2009 6:35:49 PM	Works miracles for my hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating out of proportion to heat or anxiety), even though it is not approved for it.  Pretty much, this drug saved my social life after chronic meningitis messed up my nervous system and caused me to sweat buckets (once to the point of fainting/collapse).  Only major side effect for me is dry mouth.

Recent PSA results confirm no cancer. Occasional and minor leakage still requires constant protection with pad. I decided to try weaning from Ditropan as an experiment. It's been 2 weeks and find NO CHANGE in frequence nor amount of leakage.  
Frequent Urination	miagrrl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/23/2008 12:41:38 AM	i know some have complained about the dry mouth, but mine is not very bad. slight dry mouth is a small price to pay for the time i earn back from not being in the restroom. i am leaking less urine and going about half as much. i took more expensive medications and this one works as well, and its a fraction of the cost.

Problems with Bladder Control	jlarey24, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	25-34	2/23/2008 2:11:22 PM	OUr son was put on this medication because he wets his pants a lot and he says he can't control it.  I don't feel like this medication is working for him.  Since he's been on it he doesn't eat very much and when he does put food in his mouth, he has a hard time swallowing and he ends up spitting it out.  Maybe this is due to his mouth being so dry which is a side effect of this medication.
