Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	Kandice, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	9/1/2009 3:26:25 AM	When my daughter was thirteen years old, she had acne soo bad that it would hurt just to lay her face down on a pillow at night. She religiously washed and cleaned her face three times a day. Never helped. Our family Dr prescribed her some creme for her face and that only made it red plus the bad acne now. A friend told me about a dr who could help her by prescribing her Sorcet. Her first visit with him, I told him if had any medication that would help her I'd be the most thankful person in the world. I just knew there was no helping her. After about a month of using it(she had to take it twice a day for five months), you could already see clearing on her face. I was estastic!! So was she. After 3 months, her face was completely cleared!! It was a miracle. She wasn't afraid to go out anymore, she went to ballgames and with friends. She just felt normal. She is 19 years old now and still has the most beautiful complexion. It never made her sick or have any mood swings. I cannot tell you how wonderful this medication has been. The doctor had told us it was a bacteria inside her body that had to be taken care of instead of on the outside with cremes. The price was expensive, but very well worth it.

I used to live by the clean and clear oil pads because my skin was so oily. I have not had to use any of them since completing this medication. I do not have any more sudden, hard to treat breakouts. If i get anything, it's a barely visible bump that goes away the very next day. I have also noticed that my hair does not get oily anymore. I used to have to wash it sometimes twice a day, but not anymore. I did not encounter any serious side effects, although friends and family will tell you I was pretty moody while taking it. I had tried all kinds of pills and creams, but they had done nothing for me. Deciding to take Sotret was the best decision I could have made in regards to my skin condition. I am beyond pleased with my results.

Before Sotret, my face was oilier than a pizza within an hour of being washed, no matter what products I used. My hair looked so oily I had to powder it twice a day. Even long wearing make up wore off after a few hours. I constantly looked dirty. I had acne all over my body, starting at age 9. I tried every single product line and treatment and always used them religiously and patiently, but nothing ever helped. All of this has already changed. I still have some acne on my face, but everywhere else it is gone. Just the reduction in oiliness has changed my life! I can skip a day showering! I am a normal human! My only side effect is dry lips, which is a normal skin problem regular people have, not freaky grease-monsters. I love this drug!

I have seen so many Dermatologists (some in my Health Plan others out-of-pocket). Before starting this medication I can remember only 2-4 days in the last 15 years that my chin has been clear looking like a &quot;normal&quot; person. I went through a period in time where I hung my head a lot never gave eye contact.  This medication has really worked well for me.  I understand it's not for everyone!!! The only side effects I have are the usually dry lips, eyes, and I had a bad case of rectal bleeding.  The rectal bleeding did not start until the second month.  I found out it was the dryness that cause this.  Started taken Stool softener (DOS 250mg) it's over the counter and no more problems.  Funny the rectal bleeding was scary but I was going to find a solution because I did not want to stop the med.....  I DID SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE.  I would tell anyone to try the med but tell friends &amp; family members to let you know if they notice mood changes.  Because sometime changes like that I hard to tell on our selfs.

This treated my acne so well and easily. The only bad part is the dryness of skin and dry nose, occasional nosebleed, and thats it.

His acne cleared up but severe depression developed which he had not had before.  Three months later he committed suicide.  He was 17. Needless to say I am devastated.  Definately wrong decision.

He had never had a seizure before and has not had once since we have taken him off the medication.  It was definitely not worth it to us.

I've tried every type of oral medication you could imagine for my face and this is the only one ive seen improvement in. I've only been taking this for less than a month and almost EVERYTHING is gone. Despite the dry lips, peeling skin, and noticable mood changes this is definetly worth it. If nothing has worked for you yet definetly try this, you won't regret it!

I have spent $$$$$ in the past and I hate that I waited to do this. So worth it. For dry lips, I use carmex and for dry nose, I use a saline gel called &quot;Ayr&quot;. Works well. I hate the need le poke every month but sooo worth it. Have all the confidence oin the world now. Took about 6 weeks to notice results. I use she butter for skin drynes and Aveeno SPF 30 on face! You will love yourself for this. I take 3 pills of 20mg, 3x?day and I weigh 135lbs.Beware 1st 2 weeks you will have headaches but after your body accepts the drug, you are much better in the following weeks. GO GET IT! :-)

I started seeing results in the first week of treatment. There were problems with minor headaches for only about two weeks in the beginning. But after being on every antibiotic out there to speak of, and making numerous trips to various dermatologist around town, I finally found something that truly works for me.
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne		5	5	5			12/19/2007 2:43:33 AM	I had tried everything about twice, and this was my last hope. It was a pain in the butt to get (birth control, pregnancy and blood tests, signing into the program...) but it was well worth it. I am in my second month of treatment now and have not had any new acne since my first 2 weeks on the medicine. Furthermore, the redness from my previous acne bumps are beginning to fade.

Finally cured my acne.  ebA Multivitamin Supplement, a multivitamin free of Vitamin A, was recommended to me during treatment since my multivitamin contained Vitamin A. Sotret is related to Vitamin A and you aren't supposed to take the 2 together due to potential side effects.

My doctor said that typically, you should be cleared by the end of the third month, and I'm not. I've definitely seen a significant improvement. But I read that just 85% see complete results. What about the other 15%? Still, I have seen an improvement.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/6/2007 6:25:36 PM	Although it is time consuming to have monthly blood tests and apmts, fill out the test online, and then pick up the meds; this is the best acne medication i have tried. My skin is completely clear after 60 days! The only problems have been my side effects; severely dry lips, bloody noses, dry skin patches on my hands and arms. Overall, very successful and only minor side effects.
