Seasonal Runny Nose	CGB, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	10/2/2011 10:41:08 PM	This drug has kept me out of the hospital on many occasions in my life. It is the only drug that will always work. I have taken it for years to relieve allergic reactions during seasons that are especially allergic ones. Whenever I experience a reaction, I immediately begin a regimen of this drug, and I can always count on relief.

Other	Grammie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	1/8/2011 8:05:26 AM	I had vertigo and nausea believed to be from congested eustachion tubes.  This med did take all that away but, after being on it a month (1/2 tab - 2X daily) I started getting heart palpitationa especially when lying down.  Stopped it and won't use again.
Other	Danielle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/23/2010 3:52:36 AM	I begin taking due to an ear infection caused by allergies. Doctor put me on antibiotics plus many other allergie meds that did not work. 1st day of taking Respa AR I was feeling better then I had in a week. Everything was dried up by the second day and I was back to normal. Only side effect is that it makes you very drowsy and tired so I only take at night before going to bed. If I am feeling very sick then I do take 1 in the morning also but only have to do that for 1 day. I call this the magic pill!

Non-Seasonal Allergic Runny Nose	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/16/2009 9:39:58 PM	This stuff is the only med that works in clearing my sinuses, the only problem is that your mouth gets really really dry. I found that hard candy works best to get rid of it. I would definitely recommend this. 
Cold Symptoms		3	3	3			5/6/2009 9:24:58 AM	I had a sinus infection and sneezed nonstop for 24 hours before I used this perscription.  I took 1 pill at 2:00p.m. in the afternoon and my sneezing and blowing my nose almost totally stopped.  HOWEVER, I did not sleep at all that night due to the pill and anxiety it caused which made me feel miserable due to lack of sleep.  Two days later I took a 1/2 pill early in the morning and that worked much better.

Allergic Conjunctivitis	KB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/28/2008 5:04:35 PM	I have had chronic allergies for years, nothing seemed to help including Claritin, Zyrtec, and Nasonex. Now I am taking RESPA-AR twice a day, usually half pill doeses and I feel great. My sinuses are clear and its great. The only down side is the dry mouth that it causes. For me the dry mouth is worth it because I have a dry nose too!I carry sour mints to suck on and that helps.
Non-Seasonal Allergic Runny Nose	Shannon V, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	5/30/2008 11:43:25 PM	I took Respa AR for a sinus infection. After taking it for a week or so at half the dose and only once per day, I experienced chronic dry eye.  Not only did it dry up my sinusus, but also gave me severe cotton mouth and now dry eyes!  This side effect caused my eyes to be so dry that my contacts caused corneal abrasions on both eyes.  Not realizing that this drug was causing my eye problem, I began taking it again a few months later when I got another sinus infection and the same thing happened!!! Eyes so dry that I can no longer wear my contacts.  After 2 Rx eye drops and eye drops 12x a day, i am hoping the dry eye caused by the Respa AR will be corrected. Beware if you take this drug and you are a contact lens wearer!!  It does get rid of the excessive mucous  - and all your eye lubrication!
