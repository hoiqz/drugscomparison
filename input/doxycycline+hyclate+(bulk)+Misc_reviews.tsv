Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/3/2011 5:00:33 PM	I have recurring boils. I hate them. Have been taking med. for 2 years. Worked great until recently. Going to new doctor now. My mouth is burning sensation. Don't know if this med is causing it --or because I have a bad tooth. Tooth is not hurting though. SO...want to get off this med but afraid of a bad breakout of the boils. Going to get appt. to see doctor soon, especially about my burning mouth!  Oh..I take 100 mg 2 times a day. Maybe I am lacking B-12, so have been taking B-12 for the lst two days and mouth is a little better. OHHHH  I want the dumb boils to be gone for good! Thanks.

Other	NSPounds, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	12/28/2010 3:04:01 PM	I was taking this medication for a bacterial skin infection. After about 10 days I noticed that the joints in my wrist were hurting. Didn't think much of it, then after a few more days, my hips, knees and ankles started aching terribly. I called my doctor and she said I was having an allergic reaction to it and to discontinue using it right away. I've been off it for a week now and am still struggling with joint pain. I also was extremely fatigued while taking it. I would not recommend this product.
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	11/28/2010 12:11:44 PM	Im using Doxycycline for facial acne and have found it to cause sever stomach pain in the hour after taking it. I have come close, but so far have not, thrown up. Taking a very large amount of water with the medication almost completely protects my body form this reaction. However taking so much water so quickly cases some discomfort as well. Although I am using topical gel Diffein (adapoline) in conjunction with Doxycyline to try to really defeat my acne. After a month on  Doxycyline and Differin their has been no effect on my acne.
