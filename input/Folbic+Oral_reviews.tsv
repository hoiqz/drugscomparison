Subsequent medical tests following angioplasty and stent placement revealed a hign Homocysteine level. Based on a family history of heart problems, my Doctors consider my case to be genetic. Folbic (2 per day) along with other blood pressure, anti-clotting and chlorlestoral medications were prescribed. I continue to take all of these medications and have had no reoccurances of vascular or heart problems.

The report showed mutants associated with hyperhomocysteinemia and vascular disease. Therefore my doctor has prescribed Folbic oral for me.
