I lost the 30 pounds in 3 months and am keeping weight at 120 with no longer using the diet pill. I love the Bontril SR, its the best pill i have ever taken,Thanks, anna

Overweight	Shelly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/25/2008 10:36:22 PM	I have been taking Bontril slow release for 2 months and have lost 25 lbs. My doctor prescribed it after blood tests and a detailed check up. It has been a great kick start to help me get back on track and feel motivated. My appetite is under control along with my cravings. I also have enough energy to walk 2 miles 4 times a week after working a 12-hour day. This medication is good for someone who is committed and is willing to make that lifestyle change. Bontril just gives you the jump to do it. My doctor has me under close supervision with monthly check ups on my weight and blood pressure (which has improved).

You still need to really watch what you eat and exercise along with the medication.

During menopause I could not lose any weight and only gained.  I never weighed more than 110 until I went into menopause at age 48.  This drug is helping melose weight although my appetite had already decreased before taking  it.
