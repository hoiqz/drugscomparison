High Blood Pressure	Georgia, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female		7/7/2012 10:45:06 PM	I use no drugs except for high BP. I have tried most of the ones on the market, side effects of rashes, cough, muscle spasms, blurred vision.  During 8 weeks without ANY BP drugs, my BP ranged 135/65 - 180/80 and I felt great. After 4 wks Edarbi 40m, BP now ranges from 170/90 to 116/50 within minutes. Frequent hot flushes, diarrhea, muscle aches, dizziness, very diminished sense of smell and taste, and fatigue.  Not happy with this one, either.
