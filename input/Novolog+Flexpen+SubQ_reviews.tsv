Diabetes	alfnelle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	9/21/2012 9:10:42 PM	Some pens are super and others I wonder if they are not sending the amount of insulin I have programmed it to send.  Some pens I consistently see high Blood Sugar readings.  I am experimenting with changing the pen to see if that makes a difference.  
Diabetes	Moonshyne, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	55-64	7/8/2012 12:26:18 PM	We are experiencing difficulty having confidence with the pen. We have watched the &quot;how to video&quot; to be sure we are doing it correctly. The pen seldom if ever reaches zero with a single push of the button (usually 2-3 times). We always do the air shot to be sure the tip is not clogged! Is any one else having this issue? We simply can't be sure how much insulin has been given!
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	55-64	6/22/2012 2:28:27 PM	I've been taking novalog flexpen for about 6 months now before each meal.  I also take 65 units of levemir once daily.  My novalog injections are based on what my sugar reading is and the number of carbs I'm about to eat at each meal.  I started out lower units, but now take 13 base units for each meal with 45 carbs or more or 10 base units for each meal with less than 45 carbs and to each I add 1 unit per every 25 I am over 100.  I understand it's different for everyone and you just have to start low and find what works for you.  The main thing for me was learning what number of carbs I was going to consume at any given meal.  It got easier with practice.  I've had diabetes for over 10 years, but only been on insulin therapy for past 6 months.  I find my body tolerates the insulin better than the metformin and actos I was on, in fact so far I've had no side effects.  The injections were not as painful as I had imagined.  The testing needle hurts worse.  I've lost 30 pounds in 6 months, but I contribute that to my drastic change in diet, but proves you don't have to gain weight on insulin.  I don't know about the long term effects of insulin, but feel it is best for me now.

Diabetes	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	3/14/2012 8:22:40 AM	The NovoLog FlexPen is very easy to use and convenient, especially when I'm away from home. It works quickly, and overall, I feel much more in control of my blood sugar. It's much better than the pills that I had used for years.
Diabetes	leduck, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	3/12/2012 12:50:34 PM	I didn't give it the overall 5 stars because I'm not sure if it is in fact the Novolog that is working in my case or the combination that I also take Levemir insulin and the drug Metformin. My AIC has also dropped from 12 to 6.8. I do find it annoying in any case to have to prepare and take the drug before I put any food into my mouth. But that, of course, isn't the drugs fault, it's the disease's fault. In any case, it does seem to work in keeping my sugar level down. I just need to work on an exercise program that is right for me and get my weight down. I do feel as if I'm hungry most of the day and turning away from food and snacks almost seems impossible. I also have to find a schedule that fits me during my work hours when I can administer the drug without perfroming blood tests and having to inject it in front of co-workers. I do like the convenience of using the pen compared to having the vile of insulin and the syringe with a much longer needle. I'm  not able to carry alcohol with me at my work place nor do I believe we have alcohol swabs here. So, I kind of have to rely on everything hopefully being pre-sterilized before I inject the insulin. The situation is not 100% comfortable with me but it's getting better over time.

Diabetes	SweetBlood01, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/3/2011 8:03:00 PM	My A1C was over 12.0 so I was placed on this medication in early August. I have done a complete turnaround in my diet and I try to exercise every day and the therapy has worked very well for me. I am averaging 126 on my levels but I have to watch my carb intake. I love sweets as much as anyone else, so my will power must be strong. Stick to it, exercise and most importantly, watch your carbohydrate intake. You can do this and beat this disease!

My BP seems to be a lot lower than normal.and also have leg pain/heaviness..m.m.
Diabetes	Brian, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male		6/10/2011 11:07:52 PM	The Flexpen involves some fiddling around befoe and after use. You have to attach a needle before use and you can't carry the Flexpen with needle attached. The air shot might be wasting some insulin that you are paying for, and there is a dribble of insulin on withdrawing the needle. Makes me wonder did I get the whole dose or is some of it dribbling away. You can't go out to dinner and inject yourself unobtrusively.  A prefilled syringe is much better for that job. Everybody will notice your Flexpen because of its black and orange colors. It's too big to clip into your pocket like a ball pen. Flexpen is good to carry with you and it's not too hard to use. However, everybody will know what you are doing. If you don't like inquisitive onlookers and questions, then Flexpen is not for your.

WORKS TOO WELL IF YOUR NOT REALLY ON TOP OF YOUR CARB INTAKE. THIS DRUG CAN QUICKLY LOWER YOUR SUGAR. I HAVE GONE FROM 220 TO 68 IN 30 MINS. IF YOU KNOW YOUR CARBS, THIS DRUG IS GREAT.
Diabetes	derakh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/3/2010 2:05:19 PM	I switched to insulin from glipizide because my husband and I are trying to conceive. I really like the control I get from Novolog. My doctor paired it with 10 units of Lantus and Metformin. The combo put my A1C at 5.9%. I really like not having to take a ton of pills each day. I am considering just staying on insulin even when we are not trying to have a baby.

However, had problems with two pens leaking and not knowing how much insulin when INTO my body.  Had high readings because of leaks, then blood sugar level dropped to 35...a bit scary both ways.

With great results.  I have found out that I can self adjust insulin should I need to. I have kept my blood sugers levels under 140. Checking your sugar level before your meal, can help you determine how much insulin you should give yourself. I love this product.

Just this morning when my blood sugar was over 200, it quickly lowered it to 41 and I nearly fainted. Pretty scary, and this is not the first time it's happened. I plan to be in touch with my dr's office to possibly adjust the dose
