I am 59 year old white male, 155 pounds, no other medical problems. Am on oral inhalers to manage (successfully) a mild asthma condition. No other support meds.Been using Vardenafil (on-line order, all I can afford) for four years as of May 2010. Results are astounding! Firm hard long-lasting erection, good for an hour plus of sex. After a nap, 50% of the time I am good for another round of sex.Contraindications: Alcohol! Yes! Do not take more than two beers (alcohol-equiv)for two hours before sex. VERY Noticeable interaction with alcohol and Vardenafil. Also, I have to take the 20 mg dose at least two hours before we have sex.Make it work for you: Get lots of good sleep. Have your intimate times with your lover in the morning after a good night sleep. Definitely block-out a morning where the two of you are totally uninterrupted.Take Vardenafil in the early AM when you have a morning urination. Go back to bed, cuddle and hug, go back to sleep. When you wake up a couple hours later, you will have an astonishing hard erection. I do, and I am feeling like I am forty years old again.Also, have afternoon sex on a quiet week or weekend day, again block-out the time strictly for you and your lover.Lastly, find a damn good urologist who understands YOUR problems, not just comparing you to a statistical population. My guy is originally from Columbia, South America. And, BOY! do they understand the need for highly charged satisfying sex and feeling like a man.

Having talked with my Dr. we decided to give Levitra a try.  Works great.  A couple things I have noticed.  20mg Rock hard in 30-45 minutes  Painful at times  Little semenHead acheStuffy noseWill be hard off and on all day10mgRock hard in 40+ minutesMore semen than 20mgStill have head acheStuffy noseHard off/on all day5mgOnce again Rock hard 40+ minutesNormal amount of semenHard off/on most of the dayCan have sex in the morning and at night still have enough to get going againSlight head achea little stuffy in the nose but not muchOver all noticed the pill work great.  I normally take 5-10mg 1-2 hours before sex.  Noticed I would be harder/stay longer if I waited 90minutes before sex.  Seems to be my magic number.  This amount is perfect for me. Can last with out having to worry about the wife finishing.  Allows for an easy erection hours after if we want to continue.Now the side effectsHead acheStuffy noseRinging in the earserection hurting(once every 5-8 times) nothing to painful but never had it before the pills.

I take drugs for high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes.  I have taken Viagra and Cialis and Levitra was by far the best for me.  Viagra causes me a bad upset stomach and Cialis causes some and leaves me with a loggy and drugged feeling the next day.  Levitra gives me little or no upset stomach, same for flushing and no nasal problems.  I do get a hard and maintained erection, detained and large volume of ejaculation.  My wife was amazed with the amount of semen and detained ejaculation. She calls them big boy pills.  I get no drugged feeling and can have sex again in the morning.  My insurance covers 80% of the cost and I hit my doctor up for samples.

I went for my 6 wk checkup and told Dr. I am losing erection near end of sex. He gave me a sample 10mg of this product and I tried it last night. I am amazed! I had orgasm after my wife said she had enough and an hour ater we were sitting in a chair, recuperating, and she reached over and started rubbing me. I got harder than before and she finished me off with a massage.  Wow! I have taken natural suppplements before but not as effective as this. I told my doctor to write me an RX. Great days are ahead for me!!  Only side effect was slight nasal congestion that went away.  Great product!

Inability to have an Erection	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	5/26/2011 2:45:24 AM	Levitra is great, after talking to my dr. he prescribed the 20 mg for me.  I have found that it works best on any empty stomach and  for me it takes about 45 minutes for a full hard erection to happen.  Since using Levitra I am able to achieve and sustain a rock hard erection until I ejaculate.  Until starting to use Levitra I was never sure if that was going to happen.  I do not know if other guys are experiencing this but  when I am having sex and taking levitra, I get a more intense orgasm at the time of shooting, able to usually have sex a second time with the one pill and I have also had an increase in the volume that I shoot at the time of ejaculation. Seems to be almost 3 or 4 times more when using levitra.  It takes a bit of time to see what works best, such as timing, when do I need to take my levitra, stimulation during the time I am waiting also makes for a much harder erection.  I am a believer, just wish I had not waited so long to talk to my dr. about my ed, he understands and made me feel very comfortable with the conversation.

Took 1 hour to work because of a meal I had before. When it did, though, my wife was a very happy camper. Multiple erections possible, but my wife crashed out after the first time. Mild side effects including: flushed face, dizzyness, sense of unsteadyness on my feet, and mild-moderate headache afterwards. All are worth the feeling of being able to satisfy my wife again. I am back in the game!

Bata blockers prescibed after surgery gave me a very soft erection and difficult to maintain over any period of time.  Levitra is my magic pill (although they claim otherwise).  Took the 10mg pill and within 15 minutes all I had to do is think about sex and BOING...I was ready to go.  I should also mention that my wife says its even bigger than she remembers and downtime after is about 5 minutes before I'm ready to go again!!  I think my wife wants a break! :)  Anyway, awesome product that I will use for the rest of my life!!

I barely mentioned this to my MD, and he said, &quot;Try this!&quot; That was over a year ago, &amp; I feel like I'm 21 again. In addition to the the oft mentioned headach/sinus congestion, I also get some flushing of skin, and sometimes stomach upset . Very well worth the side effects for me, though. I was taking 10 mg, decided to try 15 to 20 the last couple times I had sex - it did make a noticeable difference. Levitra gets great reviews from me and my girlfriend.

Inability to have an Erection	dave, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/3/2010 9:09:56 AM	Wow, I took a 10mg dose for the first time and felt like a 17 year old again!!! I'm 43!!No side affects to report, apart from, seeming to prolong ejeculation, which was not really a problem, it just seemed the love making was an eternity!! My partner was very satified both with my performance and that of the miracalous effect of the drug; approx 15 mins after taking the drug I was able to get fully erect after stimulation from my partner.Well recomended!!
Inability to have an Erection	young again, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	5/26/2010 5:29:28 PM	I am a 37 year old male and started having erection problems after my wife passed 2 yrs ago.  I started dating again and found my erections not up to par.  The women were VERY attractive but my friend only worked somewhat or not at all.  I finally talked with my doc about it and was given samples and a prescription of Levitra 20s.  I must say the first time I used it with the woman I was dating, WOW!!!! I felt like superman and a teenager again! We had multiple rounds and the next morning also.  I immediately filled my prescription.  Sorry to say we're no longer together but I do thank her for recommending the doctor which is also hers. It has helped immensely. With additional exercise and sleep and proper diet, I don't always need it. But it always helps as a back-up and for firmer erections.  My only side effect experienced is a stuffy nose/head.  Results are great!  Just fairly expensive and not covered by my medical insurance because they said I was too young :(

I take Quianapril and also had red wine before taking 18-20 oz. Red wine contains nitrates. After suffering side effects such as vomiting and liquid diarhea most of the night, i reda warnings and it said do take with nitrates. I guess nitrates in wine count.

It is way better than Viagra and Cialis and cheaper because you cut in half. Most times you can have sex twice . A good workout .

I am very satisfied with Levitra. My best results are always on a near empty stomach.  If I do eat its a very light meal and a 2hr wait before taking it.  That appears to be the key to my success for a strong erection.  Side effects are occasional light headache the next day and slight nasal congestion. 
Other	retired0889, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	4/10/2010 11:54:53 AM	I am a 61 year old male and have had trouble maintaining an erection. Levitra has answered my prayers. After about an hour I am able to perform like a 25 year old. I have had no side effects with the 10 mg with the exception of mild flushing. I highly recommend this product. The only down side is the expense (not covered by my insurance, and I have great insurance.)

No other drugs taken; no health issues. Experience: Works. I'm like a porn star, can do it 6+ times a night. Only use it maybe 2x month, 45min to hr before sex best. Side effects experienced: Headache, the drug stimulates everything. 500 mg Advil, water helped a bit. Sometimes no or mild headache. other side effects face warm, flush. Do not take with fruit, fruit juices, sodas. Drank 70% fruit juice soda (white grape juice in it) and my effect tighten muscles in neck little, may constrict airflow to brain. Drank water after, and focused on relaxing. Other issues: expensive. Insurance USA does not cover. Cost about $20 per 20 mg. Pricey, but the sex is worth it.   
Inability to have an Erection	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	3/24/2010 9:45:03 PM	I have used both Viagra (3 years) and Levitra (1 year), both producing sustained erections for a revived sex life. Viagra produced more of a headache afterward. Other side effects from both are flushing and stuffiness and diminished hearing for a while. Recently I had ringing start in my left ear. Even more recently &quot;floaters&quot; (posterior vitreous detachment) appeared in my left eye. I saw another reviewer had the same eye problem--makes me wonder. No previous eye problems myself or in my family. I'm very fit and healthy otherwise and in my early 50s. Too young to give up sex but concerned about the side effects.

When I used Levitra, only ten times, I had an erection in 20 minutes without even thinking about it. Still I had premature ejaculation and only can do it once, which is a lot better than nothing at all.Too bad I bought 60 pill of VA. I have a headache right now and no erection.

Finally talked to my Dr. who prescribed Levitra.Some flushing lets me know its working. Erection was like I was 20 again - just as hard and long lasting. Even after ejaculation and about 10-15 minutes, I could get another erection and go for seconds!! Slight annoying headache, but I can still feel effects 6 hours later.

Inability to have an Erection	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	2/11/2010 12:09:48 PM	57 yo male suffering from ED for 2 yrs related to diabetes. Was rarely able to have a full erection and had gotten very frustrated losing hardness before or during intercourse with wife. Gave Levitra a try for the first time 4 months ago - 1/2 tab of 20 pill. The results have been amazing for my erection. Usually effective in 20-30 minutes. Best at about 45 minutes or so. My wife says I am bigger and harder than she can remember (married 30+ years). The erection lasts through intercourse. There is a carryover effect often and can acheive good erections later that evening and sometimes next morning without additional dose. This works best in mornings on an empty stomach. Much less effective in evening on a full stomach. So eat light or use in mornings.It has given me a huge boost to my self esteem, much more than I expected. I was beginning to think that normal intercourse was a thing of the past.There are some side effects. I almost always get some nasal congestion which is annoying but tolerable. There is also some flushing to face and ears about half the time, but it doesn't persist for all that long. Very rarely a mild headache. Despite these side effects this has been a wonder drug for me.

Inability to have an Erection	She_smiled_after, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/3/2010 5:23:08 AM	I tried this med four years ago when the VA changed over from Sildenafil to Vardenafil. I was shocked at how small the pills were(kind of look like a baby asprin), smaller than a tic-tac and light orange in color, but I was willing to try it since sildenafil worked so well for me. It is always nice to have more than one option.My now ex-wife could barely sit down the next morning. I have had three lover's since my divorce all who were not only surprised but idolized me after my excellent performance. We &quot;completed relations&quot; from start to finish four times the first time I used it. And amazingly, I was still ready to function the next morning and evening with very minor stimulation. When I was a teeneager I never had that kind of man power. I felt like a porno star, a total stud. Now the bad news... I experienced facial flushing, an annoying stuffy nose, intense sweating(especially during the summer months). The last dose I had caused such physical misery afterwards I felt as if I was going to die before morning came. It felt like the flu. I have learned to keep drinking a lot of water as the drug seems to make me feel overheated and dehydrated very easily. The worst side effect is severe heartburn the next day unlike anything I have ever experienced. I am considering using a pill splitter for the next dosage I take because I am wondering if a 20mg pill is causing a low level overdose or at least bad reaction from too much medicine. All in all even with the side effects as long as I don't experience any severe-severe-severe trouble it's worth it since it has restored my sexual prowess and allowed me to become a mattress god once again.

Doc gave me samples of both Cialis and Levitra to try. Tried Cialis first with very minimal results. When I tried Levitra I was stunned. I was able to get an erection like I was a teenager. Had sex twice that nite and once in the morning - got a little concerned about being hard for two plus hours (but my girlfriend loved it). We both could barely walk the next day. I am getting set up for a prescription tomorrow. Only downfall is that they are expensive ($14 a pill) - thank God for insurance.
Other	NauseousChoker,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Male		12/28/2009 1:05:21 AM	I experienced thickening of saliva, blotted stomach and nausea.  During sex, I felt like vomitting.  When I went to the bathroom to spit, a trail of thick saliva oozed out of my mouth and wouldn't stop.  Definitely a buzz killer.  What seemed to help me sleep without worrying about chocking on my saliva was sucking on a lemon.  The lemon seemed to thin my saliva enough to be able to swallow.  Will this get better or should I switch?

It took a bit of experimenting to determine the best dosage size to reduce some of the side effects.  I now take about 1/3 of a 20mg tablet and the only side effect I have is a slight headache after.  However, if I get up and move around a bit the headache goes away.  My erection is certainly harder and bigger than it has been in many years and I continue to get erections with appropriate arousal for up to 18 hours.  I am sold on Levitra.

Vardenafil insures that I have a beautiful rock hard errection that my wife enjoys for at least an hour a session. My wife has a dozen orgasms and I couldn't be more satisfied as I am with Vardenafil. Make sure that you take the pill on a full stomach or you will have a headache. It also causes me to have backaches at times. Believe me; the good definatly outweighs the bad.

Inability to have an Erection	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	7/3/2009 4:12:33 PM	I tried Cialis which I found to be very expensive so I switched to Levitra with great results. I get erect within 30 minutes and have no problem doing it again up to 8 hrs later. No noticeable side effects other than slight stomach discomfort,but I have GERD so it is to be expected. Highly recommend. 
Inability to have an Erection	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/29/2009 12:39:59 PM	I recently started a new relationship and was having trouble maintaining an erection.  I visited my physician and she gave me 6 samples of Levitra 10 mg.  This past weekend I tried it on Friday night.  I chewed the pill right before we started, and within fifteen minutes was erect.  After we finished, i was able to have another one, twice in one night.  Saturday night was the same thing.  We had amazing sex about 30 minutes after I had eaten a pill.  Then after sleeping for three hours, we both woke up and had round two.  I am planning on getting a perscription of levitra soon.

Also perscribed 10mgs but 20mgs seem to work better with no side effects.

I cut the 20mg pill in half as directed on an empty stomach, and used the 10mg dose for the very first time.  It works for me, pretty hard erection, I can use some improvement, and will improve with continued self confidence.  Am so grateful for this pill.  I came 2 times within the first 8 hours of taking the medication, and I am so grateful that I have a great and willing partner to help me along.  Will post future reviews as I use it.  Some flushing of the face, no headaches, maybe some nasal congestion, but no biggie on side effects.  Thank you God.  I feel  rejuvinated, and have my self confidence back.....Rick

I took the pill at 6pm and we went to bed at 10:30pm tonight.the wife said once I started it took less than 3 minutes and it was very hard, she agreed.I used Lavitra 20mg tonight and my face got red and I had a slight head ache but not bad.With the Vardenafil 20mg my face turned red also and I got bad headaches that lasted a long time.The Lavtira also stopped up my nose but during sex it opened some.  Afterwards I blew my nose and it's ok now and the face is back to normal and no head ache at all. Just a slight one before sex but not near as bad.I take meds for PTSD, high blood pressure and others that interfere with my ED.I will try the VA pill next week and the wife and I will do the same as we did tonight and if it works then I guess I'll suffer with the headaches with Vardenafil.I went to a private urologist and he gave me some free Lavitra pills over a year ago.Hey they still work guys!hope this helps some of you..Your partner does have to help you though and work with you.  the wife gets another posting email and they told her what to do to help me and it worked with the pill great. I had an erection in 2 minutes and finished the wife said in about 3 minutes and felt very relieved and happy..I'm 57 and have lots of problems from Nam, IE pain and the PTSD issues..are very bad and this pill and the wife helped me overcome this tonight...It's been 2 months since I have been able to rise to the occasion only this time it stayed up and hard until the very end..Highly recommned using Lavitra..the doctor has me on 20 mg

Have periodic erectile difficulties (possible age-related -- 52.) After use, some congestion the next morning, but also seem to experience mild head pressure -- not a headache, per se, just a feeling of a &quot;loaded&quot; head; last about 4 hours or so. Do not have heart or any other difficulties, but this after-effect causes concern as far as whether or not the pressure is creating any sort of vascular problems in the head (possibility of strokes, etc. down the road.) Overall, satisfaction is tremendous and the ability to remain erect makes our whole sexual experience more fulfilling.

This drug works well for me with no side affects. 1/2 hr before sex is plenty of time. However, Never, Never use and drink anything with grapefruit or other citrus acids in it! This also includes sodas. Drug does not work, and you will receive a terrible headache!

Have been using for about one month and switched from Cialis after having severe nasal congestion with that drug too.  Thought a different compound would eliminate the side effect but it hasn't.  Use it about once/week.  Has anyone had nasal congestion while using ED drugs and been able to find one that doesn't cause congestion?

My wife says I'm bigger than ever! She should know. She likes it so I'm happy. Drug seems to work for 6-8 hours after taking effect. I do get a minor headache but overall, very satisfied!

I feel the urge to become erect, yet the stiffness is just not there.

I do wish that I could find a generic subsitute so as to afford more monthly.
