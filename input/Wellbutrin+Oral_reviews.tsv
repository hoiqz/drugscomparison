Bipolar Depression	prittykat, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	9/3/2012 11:05:13 AM	BEWARE, google this med along with FDA and review the dangers b4 taking it. my dr. rx'd me 75mg for 7 days then 150mg after that, i didn't make past 4 days! this med made my depression so much worse (i have bi-polar disorder-I, with hallucinations, SAD, self mutilation),but when i wud wake up in the am, i wud feel better. then within 2 hrs of taking the drug, it was like a slip-n-slide 2 hell, i looked and felt as tho i cud literally touch sum1 and suck out their soul(kinda like a reaper). i abruptly stopped the drug and my symptoms immediately stopped! 1 of the articles posted on this drug, said that the these drug co.'s kill 100,000 people per year! bcuz they change drug study/outome info 2 push meds thru and knowingly kill people, yet no 1 goes 2 jail 4 intentional murder, they simply get a slap on the wrist in the form of a fine! imagine being a gate keeper allowing people entrance knowing that all of the people u just let in will die!

Other	Wendy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/22/2012 7:47:29 PM	I had problems with muscle spasms that began as a crushing pain after a severe whiplash injury.Think I had PTSD and the muscles were very sensitive to repetative movements.After 2 wks on this drug there were additional clonic seizure like spasms starting in the neck to shoulder and down.Developed dextro-scoliolis in the neck,and now with an EEG,it confirmed a neuropathic disorder,changing the way my brain sent out signals to my muscles.I had wrapped my head on the R.side of the headrest in the MVA and bruised the lower area when the 2 trucks hit me.I also damaged the median nerve on the left side at the spinal cord and thus my left shoulder,arm &amp; neck have lost muscle.I was told it could do this after the fact,change the way my brain worked.This drug interacted badly with several others I was taking.It has been 5 yrs. and I still have them,&amp; periods of muscle rigidity,freezing and confusion. More than what I had before the Wellbutrin.

I have had nausea, Headaches, dry mouth, and I have RA and it's making my joints more painful, but I feel like I'm getting a little better and hope these side effects will soon calm down!
Depression	Sally Sue, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	7/19/2012 6:02:20 PM	I was suffering from depression.  I'm 5'3&quot; &amp; before taking this medication I weighed 129, huge for me.  10 pounds fell off in 6 weeks. My appetite is less than it was before- my mouth is dry &amp; tastes awful, &amp; my ears are ringing.  My depression isn't gone, but maybe slightly better than it was. Before this medication I tried Vybriid- it was AWFUL- stomach problems with that medicine.  
Other	Rgar2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	4	2	Female	25-34	7/16/2012 6:35:41 PM	I have ADD and anxiety and tried Wellbutrin about a year ago.  This is an amazing drug in terms of how quickly it starts working.  However, it WILL make some people lose their hair.  I am a 32 year old woman and used to have very thick hair.  In a period of 6 or 7 months I lost 1/2 of my hair, if not more.  No bald spots or anything because I discontinued.  (For those of you who are dealing with hair loss, yes it will grow back when you quit.  But it takes quite a while...  Here I am a year later and decided to try SR instead of XL.  Hair loss started once again within 2 weeks.  Decided to quit week 3 because my hair is still nowhere near as thick as it was before, even with it growing back.  This sucks!  Wellbutrin really is awesome.  It helps you lose weight and is awesome for your sex drive/orgasms.  Trying buspar now...

Other	newuser, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	6/12/2012 12:49:07 PM	I just began taking this med for stress and anxiety. I am on day 6. I started with 1/2 a dose and was told by doc if I didn't feel too jittery or have too much sleeplessness then go ahead and take the full 300 dose. I took the 1/2 dose for 4 days and didn't have any major side effects so I have upped the dose. I have been taking it around 11am and did feel a bit of restless sleep. I will start taking it when I first wake up to see if this helps. All in all, so far it seems to be working for me but from what I understand it does take a little time to feel the full benefits. Hoping it does for me what so many have said it did for them!

Even the first generic that the pharmacy/insurance had me take was okay.  It was the new generic that looked more like the name brand that had me worse than before I began treatment.  My doctor wrote for me to get name brand and I felt &quot;normal&quot; again.  However the cost was too much and insurance would not cover it so I quit taking it completely.  I miss the energy and the clearness in my mind it gave me.

Depression	cap, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	4/25/2012 6:55:39 PM	I have been on Paxil for 9 years and it has worked well.  I don't know if I have plateaued again, or if I am having some SAD, but the Dr. is boosting the Paxil with a very low dose of Buproprion - 50mg. every morning.  It has worked great.  I have been on it for about 5 weeks.  The only issue is that over the last few days I have been experiencing extreme muscle soreness/stiffness and joint pain/stiffness.  If it doesn't go away, I will have to stop the med.  Having just read a lot of the other reviews, I realize that I am a bit foggy in the morning, I experience dizziness for about 1/2 hour, an hour or so after taking it, and I am having trouble spelling!  I have lots of energy and have gotten more creative and am getting unfinished projects done.  I do notice that I am talking a lot.  My libido has improved, it wasn't great from the other med and menopause.  I am having more hot flashes, but they seem to be easing.

I definitely saw a difference in my mood fluctuations, level of stress and number of anxiety attacks I had.
Depression	anon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	4/22/2012 2:24:47 PM	I started taking Wellbutrin after visiting this website and reading all the life changing reviews. I had nearly every side effect possible. I was always nauseous, was very shaky, had ringing in the ears, and was disgusted by food. I had to force myself to eat, would eat a few bites and be full, and was hungry again in an hour, just to repeat the cycle. I was so used to not eating that much that one day I had completely forgotten to eat. By 9pm I realized it, forced some soup down, and puked it up within 2 hours. I started with 150mg and eventually up-ed it to 300mg. I wanted so much for it to work. After 5 months of no results I decided to go off of it. I had lost the weight I wanted, but was continuing to lose weight at a dangerous rate. I don't blame the drug; everyone's body is different and will have different reactions. Just wish it would have worked for me! Good luck to everyone and I hope you have better results than I did.
Depression	flipflops, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/20/2012 5:07:42 PM	It's been over a month since I began taking Bupropion along with Effexor.  I had been depressed, suffered from anxiety and general unhappiness.  Within days I could feel the fog in my brain start to lift.  Was able to go on planned vacation, which I was going to cancel, and had a wonderful time.  This drug, added to my Effexor, has allowed me to feel happy and want to do things instead of staying home and not wanting to go out.  Depression/anxiety is very cruel and unless someone has walked in our shoes they have no idea how incapacitating it can be.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	3/27/2012 11:59:00 PM	I never believed in depression... It was a label people used as a crutch and if they tried enough they would be okay. Over the course of about 2 years things in my life deteriorated in every way-mood swings, irritable, hopeless, and worse of all I had no sexual interest OR physical feeling/pleasure... it was killing my marriage. Once I admitted I needed my doctor's help she prescribed me 150mg 2x day. I have been on the generic form for almost 2 months and my husband calls it my miracle pill! I feel the way I did before the depression set it- stable moods, rational thinking, involved in myself and others, and best of all I have a libido again as well as the ability to climax, which loosing completely at 26 is terrifying. This pill has literally saved my marriage and has helped me restore myself back to the young woman I was. Though I am not taking this to quit smoking, my desire, cravings, and frequency have also decreased significantly without any negative side effects from withdrawl. The only cons I experienced were within the first 2-3 weeks and only invoked lack of appetite and nausea with eating and smoking. VERY highly recommended!

Depression	Rachelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	2	Female	35-44	2/14/2012 10:30:47 PM	1st time taking any meds. I loved it...felt great, happy and a lot less hungry throughout the day.  But, 2weeks in I began having itching all over my body and excruciating heartburn and difficulty swallowing. I was having an allergic reaction and ended up in the ER getting a steroid shot.  Know that if you start itching  you could also be allergic and at risk for anaphylaxis which is life threatening!
Stop Smoking	cmm80, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	25-34	1/26/2012 1:16:47 AM	Only day four. I've read several reviews. Obviously each person may have different side effects. I believe really wanting to quit smoking is key. These pills definitely make me unable to smoke when I freak and break down to have a Cig it is absolutely gross tasting and makes me sick. So after a few attempts its effects have made me not want one. The mental effect is weird Tho. I'm very mellow. My attention to detail is strange. I prefer a clear unmedicated state.  Can.'t sleep without sleeping aid. Also curbs my appetite so discourages me from eatting constantly in place of smoking and becoming fat. I think I'll contine a week or two at most. Keep busy and re do my routine to help my &quot;habit&quot;. I think this pill works for quitting. IF you want to quit. Good luck to me and all! Choose life! Its hell its hard its hard as hell. But its a choice. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	1/22/2012 9:34:52 AM	This med was like taking a placebo. It did absolutely nothing for me. Was put on it to help with sexual side effects due to being on another antidepressant. When I went off the anti I stayed on wellbutrin. Nothing....void....useless is my experience with this medication.
Depression	Gopher, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	1/19/2012 5:47:19 PM	I experienced depression off and on for over 30 years and have been hospitalized four times (average time - 6 weeks). In 1984 and 1996, elivil worked for me. My worst and most recent episode was in 2006. Everything was tried and nothing worked until a combination of wellbutrin (XL - 325mg) and remeron (25 mg). Since then I have not been in the least depressed. I have experienced 0 side effects with wellbutrin.

Doc said it would take at least a month to fully take effect.  Four days ago I developed pain in the back of my head which feels like a huge migraine (although, I've never had one start in the back of the head so this is an assumption).  I have nausea as well.  Nothing helps the headache.  Requesting the doctor remove me from this medication.

However, unfortunately, it caused auditory hallucinations and my doctor took me off the drug. The hallucinations were not violent in nature, but a woman reading off an inventory list of numbers. I regret having to stop the drug which was helping greatly for the depression.

I never thought I had depression or anxiety and would go everyday needing a neck massage, because my neck was so tight and hurting. Aches and Pains all over my body. My body felt bruised all the time. After taking this medication 150mg, I quit craving sweet foods, my neck muscles are all relaxed. It is an amazing feeling. I know all our bodies are not the same, but this has been a miracle solution for me. I was not really that depressed, but do have alot of stress and worry in my life. I now see myself blowing off the things I use to stress over. I am spending more time with my kids and have gotten an extreme energy boost from it. I dont take it to late in the day or I will be up at night. I have dropped 2 pounds in a week. I use to stay constipated all the time, but now its starting to change. I would however be careful mixing this medication with other meds and would recommend calling an pharmacist first. Good luck to all of you, and for those who had a bad experience with this medication, well theres other meds out there that may work for you, dont give up. Our bodies are all different!

I also am taking 1/2 tablet of Xanax at night to help me sleep.  I've been fine, feeling energetic in the morning, able to exercise and feel great during the day, side effects of dry mouth and lost 5 lbs, decreased appetite, feeling more talkative.  The last two days I've been dealing with  stress and have been crying, feeling mad, anxious, sore throat and feeling run down, just not acting like myself.  I feel very agitated and now  that I've read the other reviews, I'm going to call my doctor and find a more suitable solution.

I was prescribed Wellbutrin XL 150mg and then was supposed to go up to 300mg in a week. I took my first dose of the 150mg yesterday around 6pm and was feeling fine. This morning when I woke up and got out of bed I was dizzy and fell. I woke up at 715am. It is not 1040am and everything is still spinning. I have now fallen about 8 times. I am also having difficulty thinking. I have to think really hard to get my mouth to say what I want. I called my DR. and he told me this is definitely not normal and that I need to stop this medication immediately. He changed me over to Celexa so we will see how that goes.

It doesn't make me as anxious as some of these drugs do. Also doesn't make me zombie-like. I take 150mgs twice a day with 1-3 mg Ativan as needed.Side effects for me include feeling hot, occasional bursts of anger(rare) and having to be extremely carfeul with alcohol and caffine. I have developed a low tolerance for both while taking this medication. Some benefits are clearer skin and no medication related weight gain.

If I drink any caffinated drinks I feel alittle crazy wired, so I dont do that anymore. I do have more energy some days and others I am completely exhausted and dizzy. It also helped me quit drinking, I haven't had a drink since day one on this med, that alone makes it worth it. I did have a hard time sleeping the first couple of weeks, deal with it, it's worth it... My Dr. is starting me on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg once daily in the morning due to feeling tired, dizzy, foggy and still no focus.  I have memory loss, ringing of the ears, sensitivity to light (I now must wear a hat when going outside, and can't get sun on my skin or it stings like crazy for about an hour.  Oh well I have high hopes that this will work for me in another month or so.  No weight loss yet mabie on a higher dose. Been on this med for about 3 months.
Depression	Brainfog, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	9/6/2011 2:09:58 PM	I have been taking 200mg of buproprion for 3 weeks. I recently increased the dose to 300mg a day because I felt no reaction whatsoever to the medication. Although the very first week of taking it, I had suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. But, that has gone away. Now I am having confusion/brain fog. I continue spelling that by writing taht. I can't spell very well at all anymore, and I had a grade of A+ in all my English classes. I keep seeing things running by me, that are not there. I forgot how to walk down my steps. I also take 300mg of Trazodone to sleep at night. I am suffering from depression, ADHD, and OCD. I hope it will kick in soon, as allot of people here have said it does. But for now, I'm going a bit crazy. But, I always forget I feel that way so it's not too bad. I also suffer from Grave's Disease for the past 11 years. That is what made me go to the doctor. I have no memory at all. I think it's Grave's, my doctor thinks depression. Whatever it is, I'm hoping for at least a little improvement.

Other	ohjoyshere, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/14/2011 9:20:58 PM	I have anxiety, with occasional bouts of depression, and also suffer from IBS. Because of my sensitivity, many meds bother me. I was on Welbutrin SR 150mg once daily back in 2007-9, then slowly weaned off of it. My anxiety has returned and my new doc (accidentally) prescribed the XL... WOAH! It made me very very nauseous! However, now I am back on the SR and feeling GREAT again. It is the only thing that has ever helped me for any length of time, and it doesn't bother my stomach. Sure, the first few weeks are an adjustment (a little bit of dizziness, etc) but after that it really really works wonders for me. PS: I have tried Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac, and most recently Cymbalta - all of which either did nothing or made me feel sick or totally wacko. And the Welbutrin seems to relax me enough to where my IBS isn't as bad, and also lessens general pain (such as back pain). It's worth a try!!!

BP still high. I have intense cravings for beer, I can drink it like water and I don't usually drink alot. I also eat like I can't get enough food and not healthy food either. Something is wrong here but the doc says to keep trying.I really think it's the WB but they said I read too much about side effects, just give it time.
Depression	B-Ok, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	6/22/2011 4:50:43 AM	Started on 150mg for a week, then 300mg for most of the 19 months since then. Paxil was my 1st poison, but the mental fog was too much for me. Tried Lexapro and Celexa for relapses, but.. didn't work. They just kept me 'comfortably numb' enough to get on with my life. Wellbutrin, on the other hand, contributed to a positive change in my outlook. I'm about to finish a graduate program for a professional degree I used to think was way beyond my capabilities. In addition to the degree, I'm in a fairly stable &amp; supportive relationship (not the abusive, drunken ones of my youth), and have picked up 5K's as a recent hobby. Lost about 30 lbs within the 1st year. My major downfall is remembering to take my meds everyday at the same time. When I do forget, it takes about 48 hours for the creepy crawling feelings to start clouding my mind, and those are hard for me to shake off. About 4 months ago, I was struggling with my need to take antidepressants, and convinced myself that I could do just fine without any help from therapy + meds. Needless to say, I had a major meltdown within days that took 2 1/2 months of work to finally get ahead. Now, 5 weeks back on generic bupropion, I'm realizing the benefits I was afforded with this treatment - alert, focused, driven, confident - I felt more like the person I want to be, plus I have a healthy sex drive. Also, I never, ever want to go through withdrawal again, so I'm declining a recent Rx for Pristiq and all SSRI/SNRIs for as long as possible. I take 2 x 150mg pills everyday before 12pm, to take advantage of the elevated mood + energy boost and ability to really sleep afterwards. I still have my low moments, but I do recover with learned techniques &amp; support.

I forgot what it felt like to feel happy and normal until I went on the right dosage of Wellbutrin. Depression is GONE! More energy than ever. Working full time and taking care of kids and a house is no longer a problem. I lost 20 lbs in 4 months and have kept it off for a year. Just finished a half marathon and I'm training for a full marathon. After years of being a somewhat lazy underachiever, I feel like I am finally becoming the person I was meant to be at 40 years old.

I kept taking this for 7 yrs after quitting smoking because it made it easier to deal with the daily stresses of life.  Unfortunately I have to stop taking it because I have a meningioma ( benign ) tumor of the brain and wellbutrin may be the cause of seizures around the area of the tumor.  My doctors are weining me off of this drug to see if this is what is causing the seizures or not before prescribing anti seizure drugs.

HAD HEADACHES, TENSION AND BODY ACHES, I ALSO FEEL THAT LESS IS BETTER THAN MORE. DROPPED DOWN FROM 300 MG TO TWO 100 MG. MORNING AND EVENING...i hope the gal is is going through so much takes the brand name...Also with the larger doses I was getting real headaches- I prefer to take smaller doses several time a day when needed..As far as suicidal thoughts and anxiety, i believe under great stress we all experience those feelings -with or without drugs-as I have-but I now use this for depression and it has had a positive effect in keeping the wolf from the door....Hope this helps...

Depression	DontNo2Much, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/12/2011 2:50:25 AM	I had been taking Wellbutrin for a few weeks (maybe about 6)and I was feeling good, looking good, doing good, everything was GREAT. I was taking (at first) 1-150mg AM,  I has relayed to my doctor that I really really needed to quit smoking, so he says &quot;ok!&quot;, &quot;lets up your dose to 1-150mg AM and then 1-150 at noon. (For a few days, he says.) 4 or 5 days later, I went to 300mg AM and 150 at noon. I carried on (with life) as if nothing was happening. Then about 2 maybe 2 1/2 months into the 450mg daily, I woke up one day and started doing my 'honey do's (like always), but this time, i noticed it was almost noon and I hadn't lit a cigarette all day! Well dam, (i'm thinking) I haven't even wanted one all day. I didn't quit all at once. I went from a pack a day to 1/2 pack. THAT DAY. stayed with 1/2 pack  for about a week. Maybe.  From there, i went from 1/2pack 10 a day to 8 and then 7. From 7 to 5, then down to 4 a day. I kinda go stuck of 3 for a few more days than i thought I would but, i climbed the hill anyways and i was now at two a day. For a few days. And then 1. a day. For a few days. Then finally, I had one last cigarette in my car and i smoked it maybe 1/2 down,...and pitched it out the window.  From day one until I lit my last one was about 4 weeks.  But it wasn't the nicotine i was having to break myself from. The Wellbutrin had completely removed all urges and cravings for nicotine. The hardest part with stopping to smoke with Wellbutrin,was the 'breaking' of my old habits. I was well on my way of ridding myself of smoking, My only obstacle was &quot;what to do with my hands???&quot; For so long, if i  got on the phone, lite it up. ON the computer, lite it up. Driving down the road in my car,...lite it up. sitting on the front deck, watch the birds fly by,...lite it up! But after I got past all that 'easy' stuff, i was and AM on my way to a much healthier body. For my Grandchildren sake. It's been 5 months this past March 5th. I'm really, really proud of myself.

It is working out, I have tons of energy, I ran 13 miles today and didn't even feel tired.  I can't sleep though.

I am on Lamictal (mood stabilizer), 350mg a day and can drink on that, but moderately (3-4 drinks fri and sat night).

They were both bothered by anger troubles.  Driving with my husband was a nightmare on Wellbutrin.  My brother in law commented on this also.  Both said that things that they would normally brush off made them extremely angry and it took quite awhile for them to get over it.  Both stopped Wellbutrin because of the anger.  Just wanted you to know you weren't the only one feeling angry!

Depression	Lana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/17/2011 2:05:31 PM	Once I changed from generic (Mylan) to brandname Wellbutrin SR 150 twice a day, I'm a new woman. I feel great, can control my eating, I'm not lashing out/irritable, and am smiling and laughing again. I can't believe how well this med works for me. I've tried tricyclics and SSRIs to no avail.If you are depressed with overeating, irritability, and excess sleepiness, try this. If you have a tendency to addictive behaviors, try this.If you are anxious, can't sleep, have lost weight, or have high blood pressure - do not take this med. It will make things worse.And the generics made by MYLAN were WORTHLESS for me. Once I switched to the brand name, I started getting better.

I feel better when I am consistent with taking it and I can tell that I feel sadness or hopelessness when I haven't taken it for a few days.  I don't think I've experienced any serious side effects.  I also like welbutrin because it does not affect my sex drive the way some other antidepressants do.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/12/2011 7:09:46 AM	My nephew had depression issues for many years.  He saw a doctor who prescribed Wellbutrin a few months ago.  He committed suicide four days ago.  Since one of the side effects of this drug is suicidal thoughts, I would strongly recommend to anyone taking this drug, or thinking of taking it, that you consider all other options.  It is bad enough to lose a family member to an illness or an accident but to lose them this way is truly tragic.  My nephew was 21 years old.

I was still very depressed and felt like my life was over.  I finally did some research and found that this drug works extremely well for the frontal lobe of the brain which I had my anerysum.  I gained 25 lbs from Lexapro, and now have more energy to work out.  Only taking 150 mg, but it seems to keep my moods more even and no anxiety.

I have never had much success with other meds as this. It is the best thing that has ever happened to me and makes my life more stable and am able to function so much better. I take XL and SR has also been fine, but the 75mg &quot;instant release&quot; actually intensified any bipolar mania and in my opinion had an abuse likelihood if you have ever been addicted to any stimulants.

I used to get the blues now and then for no real reason and chalked it up to hormones - now I do not get those feelings and also do not feel like a zombie.  Have been on the drug for about a year with no serious side effects whatsoever.

Depression	life is good, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/30/2010 12:16:49 AM	I started on the generic at the end of last year. I've always struggled a little with SAD (winter blues) but last year my mom was struggling with a second bout of cancer and it was just too much. I felt life was blah, nothing to look forward to, no energy and crying at the drop of a pin. I started on 150mg. which took the edge off but 300mg. made all the difference! I now feel content and calm. I don't get agitated so easily or so stressed over kids, job or life. after 26 years of marriage our sex life is great. I've been loosing weight easily.I feel queasy if I eat a full meal. It's better to eat smaller portions more often. now I don't overeat. I do feel light headed a bit when I stand too quickly. I have more energy, feel more alert and wake up so much easier than I have my whole life.. I've never been a morning person. I had &quot;de ja vue&quot; seizures several years ago but this has not brought them back. I do have a harder time staying focused and feel a little ditzy or forgetful at times. all in all I really feel so much better and will stay on it even though mom is doing better because of the calmness and contentment and change in appetite I now have.

Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	10/25/2010 3:59:00 PM	I have major depression that disabled me for 6 years.  I am working full-time, but it is difficult due to the toll the depression and GAD has taken on my memory and concentration.  I'm taking 300 mg Wellbutrin, 100 mg Trazadone, and .05 Xanax as needed for anxiety/panic attacks.  I've tried almost every other anti-depressant - alone and in conjunction with Wellbutrin - and couldn't handle the side effects due to a medical disorder that I also have.  I thought Wellbutrin was a decent compromise - I still have bad days and crying spells, but I wasn't aware of any side effects.  HOWEVER... Wellbutrin's side effects crept up on me.  I have very, very thin hair now.  And in just the past two months I have a new side effect -- the inner tops of my ears have turned a dusky green/blue shade.  Anyone else with this side effect?  My doctor doesn't know what to make of it.  I attribute it to the Wellbutrin because my daughter also takes it, at the 450 mg level, and her ears started turning before mine did.  This is the only med we have in common.
Depression	CBC, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	2	Male	55-64	10/21/2010 2:08:40 PM	Used 150 mgs for about 6 months and then went up to 300mgs and became very dissoriented to the point I could not work or drive so after 4 days I took my self off the high dose and developed a constant ringing in the ears which has not gone away even after 6 months after being off the drug altogether.Has any one else experienced this or found a solution to this problem.

Had trouble concentrating. My doctor changed over to Buduprion and immediately I noticed a change in attitude and mental focus. I am much more outgoing, speak to strangers, and have long conversations with friends. All of which I never did before. I highly recommend Buduprion. I have been taking it for approximately 3 months.

Depression	feeling better, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	9/25/2010 5:25:19 PM	I was on zoloft for years before I realized it was preventing me from losing weight...so I swithched to wellbutrin and so far so good. I did have the headaches and crazy dream the first 2 weeks,so I reduced my dosage to 75mg once a day but nothing after that..so I started taking the 150mg a day. I haven't had anymore side effects...and OMG! during PMS I didn't have a migraine at all and I have suffered with hormonal migraines all my life it seems...so I will continue to take and give an update after taking for 6months
Depression	HulaGirl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/18/2010 2:54:01 AM	Have been on 450mg of generic Wellbutrin SR for 16 years. No noticeable side effects. It must address the correct brain chemical. All the SSRIs I tried didn't work well.Also, I take my Wellbutrin in one dosage first thing in the morning; Iknow this is not recommended, but it works for me. I have done this for 15.5 years without problems.If I take it after 12noon it keeps me up at night.I also breakout in a bad case of hives (hands, groin, feet) when I take KEFLEX while on Wellbutrin. This never happened with Keflex prior to getting on Wellbutrin...go figure.... obviously don't take Keflex anymore. I never could find any info on this interaction.Are there any studies on the ramifications of really long-term usage?

I have experienced some nausea, some dizziness, and loss of appetite. Other than that, I feel like I have finally found a medication that works well for me. I have tried zoloft, prozac, and paxil and none of them had the effects Welbutrin has given me. The loss of appetite is great for me cause I'm a bit overweight. Also I am a smoker and since I have started taking this medication, I don't want any cigs. My mouth feels like an ashtray and the cig just doesn't taste right...so all in all I like this medication.

Depression	anxiousgirl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	3	4	Female	55-64	8/27/2010 9:49:10 PM	I have chronic anxiety and panic disorder, but do not normally feel depressed. For some reason docs always prescribe anti-depressents, which usually make me VERY depressed. I hate having to choose between panic attacks and morbid depression. Finally found that tiny amounts of lorazepam (.5mg) as needed help stop most panic attacks, but anxiety was still constant. Doc thought wellbutrin might help, since SSRI's etc. just kill me with depression. She thought since I seem compulsively anxious, and wellbutrin is sometimes prescribed for OCD, it was worth a try. First two weeks I felt much better, but eventually the dose at 150mg./day made me desperately depressed. But a month after I stopped, I was back to feeling out of my skin. So now the past 3 weeks I take 1/2 of a 75 mg. pill of buproprion twice per day, morning and mid-afternoon. I feel so much better! And I've already lost 3 pounds, don't feel either anxious or depressed, just basically calm. Can't tell you what a relief that is. I am thirsty and have some constipation, but those side-effects are worth it. I am very sensitive to medications, and this small dosing is working for me. For me, reducing dosage was the key.
Depression	Meles, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	8/25/2010 12:30:11 PM	I have had no problems or side effects taking this medication.  I take 150mg twice a day for depression and have been on this medication for over 3 months.  I was on fluoxitine. I have also quit smoking during this time and no side effects. 
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	25-34	8/17/2010 6:17:57 PM	I initially used the name brand of this drug several years ago with success.  I had more energy and focus as an added bonus.  I was able to quit for almost 2 years while on the drug.  I began smoking again after a year off the drug, so I recently began taking the generic version.  For the past 3 days, I have not been able to get to sleep for 4-5 hours after laying down.  I have no appetite and I cry at the drop of a hat.  I don't remember having any of these symptoms when I last used this medication.  I have read some of the comments and I am not the only one with these issues.  I keep taking it because I figure it's better than smoking. After 3 days on the meds, the thought of a smoke makes me nauseated.  I have lit up a few times out of sheer habit in the car and have not been able to finish one without gagging.
Stop Smoking	Jake Metal, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	2	Male	35-44	8/10/2010 10:40:26 PM	Wow, I used this drug five years ago to quit smoking very successfully started smoking again and thought that it would be a good idea to get back on the wellbutrin for smoking sensation. I experienced several side effects including not being able to sleep, irrational thoughts and behavior, paranoia and severe anxiety. I was experiencing a great deal of stress in my personal and professional life and thought that these symptoms were a result of the stress i was experiencing. It took me six weeks to realize that the medication was causing my anxiety and paranoia. I had several sleepless nights, and one day following one of these nights, i went to work and had an &quot;episode&quot; with my supervisor who thought I had gone crazy. Im just hoping that my actions and behaviors wont effect my position, probably a little late for that. I can say that the medication did seriously curb my desire to smoke, but I dont feel that the benefits out-weighed the costs, I  would never recommend this drug to anyone for smoking cessation.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/8/2010 3:32:09 PM	I recommend this medication to everyone with depression and/or anxiety. Very effective, and you will not gain weight. It it very important to avoid or minimize caffeine while taking this medication. I noticed a worsening in my condition when I had too much caffeine as the medication is stimulating.

After starting the wellbutrin (within 3 days) I felt a lot more energetic and my anxiety, which was a major problem, has almost gone away. Dont need xanax anymore. Hope it stays like this as i have not felt this good in years.

I have taken several antidepressants over the years without any measurable success. I suffer from depression,anxiety and panic. I went to see my doctor because, I had been feeling exausted. He ran many tests and couldnt find anything physically wrong so he suggested I try Wellbutrin. The drug has done wonders for my mood and, helped my energy level some. I am over weight, I ate for all the wrong reasons. Also, I am a smoker. I dont eat like that anymore and smoke a lot less. I atleast have enough energy to go for a walk every day, the weight is slowly comming off and, I am working on quitting smoking. One more thing, thank heavens it comes in a generic!

Depression	3callmemom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	7/24/2010 9:51:58 PM	The generic of this medication was added to another antidepressant I had been taking for the previous 9 months.  Adding this medication has given me the first sustained relief I have had from depression.  I have been diagnosed with long-term low level depression.  I have had some sleep disturbance and some joint aches.  They have varied in intensity and if the joint aches had not improved my doctor would probably have removed me from the medication.  But I would gladly lose a little sleep in order to finally know what it feels like to not be depressed.  It is wonderful and even great to be tired because of a little loss of sleep rather than just plain tired of life and dragging through my days.  
Depression	RBJeurope, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/24/2010 3:29:41 AM	Before taking this medicine my life was a mess. Although I was seeing a psychiatrist I was drinking, smoking, gambling, mildly depressed and had constant mood swings. Within a month of taking this medicine all my addictions were gone. I just don't have the strong urges anymore and can rationalize and control my decisions. I don't look at food the same either sometimes I just don't eat at all (no hunger pains). The best thing about the medicine is that I have lost 20 pounds with exercise. The worse thing is that I have developed an addiction to sweets I didn't have before. All in all I am a better person when taking the drug even though a couple of times I have experienced a day of two of sadness but nowhere near like before. It has been seven months and I am much happier about my life. Wellbutrin is not for everyone and the side effects were very prominent for the first six weeks but went away.  Thank God for this medicine.

I have tried several different others and this one works the best for me. No sexual side effect or weight gain for me. I did make the mistake of trying to go off of it due to not being able to afford it. On about the 5th day, I got very clammy and almost blacked out. Please listen to your Dr. when they say don't stop a med. on your own. 
Depression	ameyer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	7/7/2010 12:33:31 PM	Had a horrible experience with this drug. I have been on several other antidepressants in the past and none of them have had a negative effect on me until this. As soon as I started taking 300 mg a day I had sever dizziness which I thought would go away the longer I took it..well it just got worse. My hands shook a little. I was very constipated..bloated all the time. I also felt worse than I have in years in terms of depression. I was crying at the drop of a hat and had no patience. Going back on Pristiq. I cut down to 150 mg a day to wean myself off and I am already not dizzy. I would NOT recommend this drug.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	7/1/2010 10:26:43 AM	Within one week of taking this medication I began to have involuntary muscle twitches, my eyes would dart back and forth, unknowing to me, and I became so week I could barely force myself to move. After the second week I was taken off this medication. Please, be very careful taking this med. 
Depression	Bella, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	35-44	6/28/2010 4:00:12 PM	I have suffered from panic attacks &amp; depression for over 15 years. I have been put on a lot of different meds. None seemed to work. I was so depressed one day that I sat in my recliner for 6hrs without moving. I went to a different doctor. He put me on 150mg Wellbutrin &amp; 20mg Lexapro for depression &amp; panic attacks. Within days it felt like a shield had been taken off me &amp; I felt like moving again. It was the miracle combo for me.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	6/20/2010 9:35:57 PM	I cannot take Wellbutrin because I get a migraine within 24 hours, even on the lowest dose. I was on it several years ago, with this outcome, but my doc decided to try again since I have little luch with oher types of meds. I took one dose over the weekend (half of a 75mg tab) and have a migraine again. I'm really sensitive to med side effects, so take this with a grain of salt, but I guess it's back to square one. I had the fewest side effects, and best results with Cymbalta, but it recently lost it's effectiveness.
Depression	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	6/19/2010 9:15:18 AM	have yet to begin taking the medication, want more information first
Depression	LadyJane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	6/19/2010 8:29:08 AM	I was tried on Wellbutrin alone years ago and it was not effective.  About a year ago my doc added Wellbutrin to my regular Zoloft. I had been taking Zoloft for several years and I believe she started it to add to my energy, as it was low, and also to possibly help reduce my appetite. I had been trying for several years to lose weight and still had carb cravings and no weight loss. The first month I took it I lost 10 pounds, and since then have lost ten more. I did feel much more energetic (not manic, but normal)and became more active and was able to get more things done in my home and elsewhere.  Not only have I been treated for serotonin deficiency (for many years)last year I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, which also causes fatigue. Wellbutrin has helped, but my dosage was just increased to the highest level, so I hope it remains effective as there is no where &quot;higher&quot; to go if my body becomes accustomed to this dosage and then the drug becomes less effective than before. 
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	35-44	6/17/2010 1:19:41 AM	I have been taking this for almost two years now.  The problem with most anti-depressants is that when it starts to work in my system I feel a noticble change, but later I feel it looses it's effectiveness.  Unfortunately there is no exact science to this stuff.
Depression	lisagirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/15/2010 8:15:17 AM	I take 450 mg day, have been for many years I am female, 52 about 130 lbs. It has been wonderful for depression and bulemia! When I stopped taking medication a few times over the years to see what happened the bulemia urges came back very strongly even though nothing had changed emotionally for me. This has led me to believe very strongly that bulemia is much more of a physical illness than a mental one. It has helped me more with depression than any other medication.
Depression	LivingHappyWithMeds, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/9/2010 5:42:28 PM	At the start of takingthis medication I experienced, headaches, constipation, and frequent with darker color urine. After a few weeks the headaches were gone. I have to drink plenty of fluids and watch my diet a little more to control the constipation. My doctor told me that my frequent urination and color change of my urine was a side effect. This medication has helped and I am able to live with the side effects.
Depression	rumvs2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	6/7/2010 9:52:57 AM	I have been on 450 mg for over 6 years now. I had my first husband, my brother and my dad die within 3 years. Also a SPED teacher, stress and severe DDD of the lower back.  I have had 3 major back operations.  The XL has helped me not cry on the spur of the moment. I have had no ballistic moments with daughter or students. I have been able to get thru the day, althought it has given me a &quot;I don't give a sh*t&quot; mood at times, it is bettr than high anxiety, stress and muscle pain in the back.I am now retired 6/08 due to the back and stress (30 years of SPED) is enough. I still am not lowering my daily dose right now. I am going thru menopause (just great) and have a new husband.I am also taking Cymbalta 20 at night but I want to get off of that due to weight gain.My family hid it from me that depression ran in the family. I was I had something sooner then maybe my life would have been not as stressful and muscle bound.Never had any seizure symptoms.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/29/2010 11:34:45 PM	I was put on this for anxiety.  I was put on 75mg a day for a week and bumpped up to 150mg after a week.  During the first week I noticed I was sweating much more and actually feeling more anxious.  I thought this would go away after the first week or once I bumpped up to the higher dosage.  It didn't.  I became much more irritable and anxious.  Cryed at the littlest of things and would go off over stupid things.  I think my husband thinks I have turned into a crazy woman and he doesn't know why.  Additionally I do not sleep well.  Put a call into the doc, hope she has a solution.  I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	25-34	5/23/2010 3:35:56 PM	Wellbutrin has certainly elevated my mood, making me a whole lot more functional. There's a couple side effects I don't like though. Under normal day-to-day activities I don't feel any dizziness, I'm a ballet dancer, and I've noticed that chaine turns and pique turns (basically spinning really fast across the floor) are markedly a lot more difficult, and sometimes I have to sit down in class because the dizziness is overwhelming. This of course is extremely frustrating, I'm one of the strongest dancers in my group, but this is holding me back. I also have a ringing in my ears. I take 150mg twice a day, and I don't like monitering the time so closely to be sure I take them on time. But at least for now, I feel much better than I did before, so I'm not ready to give up on it yet.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	5/22/2010 10:28:56 PM	Wellbutrin has been very effective for me in that it gives me a boost of energy, easier to get out of bed in the morning, and my social anxiety is a whole lot easier to deal with. I started taking it because my best friend died recently and I was having the most difficult time in the world getting the most basic things done, I never wanted to go out in public, it was extremely painful to do homework and go to class, etc. I've always been a bit prone to depression anyway, but this is the worst it's ever been. I used to take Zoloft, but I didn't like it for 2 reasons, firstly, it took away my sex drive, and secondly, it made me permanently in a good mood, I lost my natural range of emotion. Wellbutrin hasn't done that for me at all, I feel much more like myself, it's still possible to have a bad day and I'm ok with that, I think it's healthy. Of course I'm still grieving my friend very much, it happened only 3 months ago, so I still cry almost everyday, but now it's just for a few minutes and it doesn't completely engulf me. As for the sex drive, oh god, it's increased exponentially, sometimes I need to have sex several times a day or I go a little bit crazy, it's my boyfriend's dream come true. If I wasn't in a relationship it would be a very bad thing!! There's a couple unfortunate side effects: I've lost weight, for most people this is a much desired side effect, but I was already in perfect shape and didn't need to lose any weight. Also, I can't get to sleep at night, so my doctor also prescribed Ambien, which works just fine. The most annoying side effect is the constant ringing in my ears, most the time I can forget and not notice it, but when I do it kind of drives me crazy. And the final side effect is occasional constipation, which is always horrible for anyone. Before I go to bed I drink senna leaf tea, and that works very well, it's pretty powerful stuff.

Depression	JDR, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/20/2010 1:27:42 PM	I just started taking the generic literally a day. I was taking Prozac but that killed my libido. Doc switched me to this. Was fine for most of the morning, then all of a sudden, I just lost it. At work, was crying for no reason, got home and snapped. I felt like I just lost control. I was real irritable and felt my anxiety shoot through the roof. This is only my second day, and again, the morning has been ok but nervous about this afternoon. Seriously considering stopping, wondering if this is just temporary, no other side effects expect increase anxiety and irritability
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	priss, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	5/20/2010 2:31:16 AM	I've been taking this for about 2 weeks, i feel alot calmer and quieter than i was, i can see a big difference in how i act, the only thing i dont like are the side effects, i get dry mouth, anxiety much more than i use to, and i eat way less, and i feel like being alone most of the time i dont like people bothering me. I guess you can say im feeling a little depressed. Im the happy go lucky friendly type but lately ive just been detached. Im going to talk to my doc see what she has to say.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	5/17/2010 1:56:56 PM	Loved the energy I received and the weight loss was a bonus.  About the third week I noticed I would get angry over little things (work/home).  Then I felt like crying.  So I decided to quit taking the medication.  Miss the energy but my six year old likes me better.
Depression	HEA, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	55-64	5/16/2010 12:39:47 AM	3 weeks taking 50 mlg's of wellbutrin.Then, uped dosage to 100 mlg's. Result:stiff neck, trouble communicating with others, sweaty, head feels as if ants are crawling on it. My psychiatrist has not been helpful in monitering the amount I take. He thinks I should go off it...told me that it would be out of my system in 4 days. Why am I paying to not get professional advise on what my daily intake should be???
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	3	Female	25-34	5/15/2010 12:05:13 AM	i started out with 150 mg for 4 days then my doc started me 300mg. First couple of day i feel so good. Now 3 days into the 300 mg i feel so bad my ears are ring i have pounding headaches, dry mouth the whole nine yard. Called my doc and he lowered it back to 150. hope i go back to the way i felt the first couple of day.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	35-44	5/12/2010 2:14:23 AM	After trying pretty much every major anti-depressant under the sun (and some with the addition of Wellbutrin), I've finally found that wellbutrin alone has done the trick for me. HOWEVER, there are differences within the generic brand (Bupropion). I recently switched drug stores where my prescription is filled and received a different &quot;type&quot; of the same drug. Before I was taking 300XL of an oval-shaped white pill. The ones I just received are 300XL but round white pills. And I feel a distinct difference. In fact, I feel like I'm going through the initial first stages of taking the drug all over again (dry mouth, restlessness, jitters). I understand that different companies make the generics but I cannot find a site that states which company has better quality products.  Overall, Wellbutrin is, IMO, one of the better anti-depressants out there. 
Depression	MrD, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	5/10/2010 4:48:05 PM	I have become very irritated, more so than before.  I work in a school and have recently lost patience with my students (yelling, being short, etc.).  It got so bad that I quit today in front of a classroom full of kids.  My doctor is switching me to Pristiq.  I pray it works.
Depression	Abby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	5/5/2010 1:26:38 PM	When I got married, I started a birth control.  The birth control killed my sex drive, made me gain 30 pounds (I was tall and thin before), ruined my sleeping habits,  made me extra moody, and caused a lot of anxiety.  I felt like I couldn't think clearly any more and I couldn't reason as well - things just weren't connecting in my head.  I didn't want to go off the birth control because of awful cramps so my doctor started me on this drug.  The first few days I felt nauseous and my head felt like it was in a vice.  Within a few days I was feeling fine.  I can think clearly, my sleep has got better, I've gained a little of my sex drive back, and I lost some of the weight I had gained because of the birth control.  I am finally feeling more like myself.  I haven't really had any side affects except increased sensitivity to light.  I am very satisfied with it.
Bipolar Depression	jeb100, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	4/29/2010 7:43:37 AM	Used to treat bipolar type I depression over an extended timeframe. Effective much of the time but not lately. Due to inadequate efficacy, it's time for me to tail off this medication in favor of Nortriptyline. Side effects (mostly beneficial) included sustained weight loss, constipation, increased energy. Would recommend this medication as best antidepressant overall. After 10+ years it is not surprising that the medication is no longer adequate for my needs.

As for side effects, i actually lost weight instead of the usual weight gain that comes with many of these medications. the down side is mild temporary flushed skin and dry mouth, both of which decreased in frequency and are quite tolerable.

Generic Bupropion did not work and I have not previously had difficulty with other generics.

Bipolar Depression	breezy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/10/2010 11:01:22 PM	I am a bipolar patient and anti depressants can be quite a tricky venture for us. They tend to 'destabilize' bipolar management and throw us into mania. I have tried many of the typical SSRI's in the past with little success and did try Wellbutrin SR at 150mg with mania after the first dose. Hit the wall again and new doc suggested Wellbutrin, not the long acting kind, at a small dose, 75mg, in the am and so far i'm impressed. I did experience a little sleepiness (yeah, backwards i know, but bipolar brains don't get the same side effects often)...but I also don't feel 'numb', like other treatments...i am flushing some, but will ask the doc about that at next visit and not worth stopping...very hopeful, which is nice...if u'r bipolar and in depression ask u'r doc about buproprion not the xl or sr in the am....good luck to all!

I cannot take generic it is not the same at all I gained weight big time on the generic.

I have to say before taking the Wellbutrin I was had no energy, was depressed and the Celexa alone was not helping me. So my doctor adding Wellbutrin. I felt it working right away,more energy, focus and I feel alive again. I take it in the morning. At first I experienced some nauseous and dizzy. I did have the &quot;shakes&quot; one day but I drank some coffee that day. This overall has been a great drug. I dont eat as much and my appetite has decreased.

I just started it again and am hopeful that it will make me feel alive again. The worst side effect was insomnia, Dr. gave me trazadone to help with it.I have taken numerous SSRI's with very little success. Last time it saved my life- I believe it may do that again. Staying positive is essential. Don't give up!!

I didn't sleep for 4 days straight. I am also currently taking Trazadone and Lamictal to help me sleep. This drug was pushing me right through it. I felt hopeless, sad, depressed 10x's more than I already did. I also didn't eat for 2 out of the 4 days. This was NOT a good drug for me.
Stop Smoking	holieNY, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/30/2010 12:42:44 PM	I had begun taking wellbutrin sr to try and quit smoking. When I took it for the first 3 days it seemed ok (125mg. tab po). The 4th day I took it x2 a day per Dr.'s orders. After I took the 2nd dose. I went into work and had to be taking to the e.r. by ambulance, because I thought I was having a stroke. At 1 point my pulse dropped to 61, which is extremely low. Then my bp was 136/100, which is extremely high, as i usually run at 120/80. My arm went completely numb as if it were asleep, and it felt like pins and needles in my hand. My heart beat was also showing arythmia.  I felt like I was ready to crawl out of my skin, cause of this overwhelming panic feeling. I ended up vomiting 4 times in a period of 30 mins. It was the most terrible feeling in the world, and I seriously thought I was going to die of a stroke. I have been ordered to completely stop taking this med. And although, almost all the side effects are gone, my hand still feels like theres pins and needles kind of tingling. My doctor said that hopefully that will too go away soon as the med leaves my system

My gynec. put me on it post a very bad hysterectomy.  2 weeks later a psychiatrist wanted to switch me to pristiq.  i do not want to switch.  the wellbutrin label said it would be 3-4 wks. before effects could be felt.  i am willing to give it a try.  i was dizzy for 2 wks and my head buzzed.  it's better now.  i have more energy than before.  it has not helped with anxiety/extreme panic yet, but i have hope.  i have not lost weight with it yet but remain hopeful as all other ssri's have made me gain.  my appetite is almost zero, but no vomiting.

I had alot of side effects that you read about including tinnitus, reddening of the face, excessive sweating face and body, my blood pressure was elevated, could not sleep, and severe unbearable headaches. Definately not the medication for me. The only positive was the side effect of anorexic effect (lol)which it did drastically decreased my appetite but definately not worth the side effects.

Dr. took me off it and all that angrier is gone. I had no idea this pill would make you feel so bad. I had acid reflux real bad with it to.
Depression	Anniew61, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	3/7/2010 9:48:24 PM	Not sure if this is the medication for me. I started with 150mg and was ok but since I  started the 300mg (on my 2nd week) I have developed a rash under my breast and I have been dizzy. Today I was out with my husband and got really dizzy and had blurred vision. After I sat for a while I was ok. If anyone has had a rash with this med does it start right away or after you have been on it a few weeks. You can e-mail me @ anniew61@yahoo.com 
Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	3/7/2010 1:50:16 AM	    The effects of this drug in managing my depression are night-and-day. My constant emotional pain, fatigue, insomnia, and hopelessness have subsided into a level state of peace without my having experienced any negative side effects. I am both pleasantly surprised and pleased, and highly recommend this drug, which can be described with no more accuracy than as a &quot;pain-killer.&quot;

As long as I'm up &amp; moving I'm good. When I sit down even for a moment I get sleepy. It has evened my mood, except when it was time for my cycle. It definitely increased/worsened my PMS symptoms.  Initially it took my appetite but it has returned. I don't overeat like I used to though. I'm usually a very regular person but cant go daily like I used to. Dr. said I may not as long as I take the meds.  I have some mild ringing in my ears. It's gotten better. 1st couple of weeks I had trembling hands but it too has subsided.  I no longer have the crazy dreams and am now able to sleep through the night. If I consume too much alcohol I get the worse headache.  Overall my depression IS better.   I no longer sleep all day and am able to think a lot clearer. My creativity has returned!! Oh, also no sexual side effects.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	1/29/2010 8:22:11 PM	I struggled with depression for over 6 years before seeking out the help of a professional. I am taking 300mg 2x per day and wow, what a difference it has made in my life. As soon as I started taking it I felt a burst of energy I had not experienced in quite a while. I did not realize how depressed I truly was until I felt normal again. I still have my bad days but they are normal bad days, not suicidal bad days. For the first three weeks my side effects included heart palpitations, excess energy,  a bit of anxiety, and occasional insomnia. Now I experience a little bit of dizziness and anger issues. I am a little irritable and get angry easier. The benefits definitely outweigh the symptoms.

Then, my hands started to have minor tremors. The tremors got worse. My doctor decided to take me off Wellbutrin because tremors is one of the side effects that effects only a few people. Unfortunately, I was one of them. Even now, 4 yrs. later, I still have mild hand tremors. This has impacted me greatly as I used to do a lot of bead work with very tiny beads. I no longer have this creative outlet.

I'm not going to bash it- I'm sure it works for some people. However, I would like to warn people that in rare instances it can cause rash(mine resembled hives). I have been told it was Steven-Johnson's syndrome- a potentially fatal skin rash. If you do experience rash while taking this medication- STOP IT IMMEDIATELY AND CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR!

I have fought depression for 25 years.  It worsened with pregnancy and marriage to a very narcisstic partner.  I have taken many combinations of SSRIs most have been ineffective until I added Welbutrin.  I have found the generic versions to be much less effective and have had to switch to the Welbutrin SR and XL versions over time in order to continue with the brand name drug.  Overall, Welbutrin has kept me out of bed and functioning because it keeps the mental fog at bay and gives me much needed energy.  The Lexapro augments my symptoms be keeping the suicidal thoughts away and reduces my anxiety.  So, overall Welbutrin has helped me to keep functioning despite a very depressing marriage.  My new insurance will not allow me to continue my current dosages and I am afraid that things will slip back.  Does anyone have suggestions as to handle the insurance limitations?
Depression	justcarol, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	1/18/2010 11:49:09 AM	I have been taking the generic form of this drug to treat my depression for about three weeks now. I have to go off of it because I can not take the side effects. Dry mouth, tremors, anxiety attacks and the worst headache of my life that has not gone away in 5 days. I can not even open my right eye for more than a few seconds because the pain is so intense.I was taking 150mg for the first week and then the second week I went up to 150 mg twice a day. My skin started to crawl, I turned mean as a snake and yelled at everyone. Forget sleeping. I have had none in over a week. All I do is lay in bed and pray that this intense pounding in my head will go away.I know some people think that you need to give it more time, but before I was taking this I was just a bit down feeling. Now I am both depressed and anxious and in constant pain and I can't even leave my house.So my experience with this drug has not been a good one at all. Now I am worrying about any repercussions I may have coming off of it. Hopefully, since I was not on it but a few weeks the withdrawal will not be too bad.If you suffer from any type of anxiety disorder I would strongly suggest that you do NOT take this medication. 
Depression	GetnBetter, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	1/15/2010 2:19:07 PM	I have been depressed since i was young. I'm 18 now and am finally getting help. I've tried a few different SSRI drugs and this has seemed to work the best. But it appears that when i get mad or someone bothers me, I cant let it go. I am just so mad for the rest of the day. But a few hours later i'm ok again. And the dreams i've had are crazy. They seem so real  and scary.
Depression	xbabyx, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	1/14/2010 9:59:35 PM	I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 14. I tried various medications with little success and many negative side-effects (weight-gain, fatigue, loss of interest/listlessness, etc). For several years i tried to handle my symptoms on my own, and I tauhgt myself how to handle my anxiety attacks but the depression and general anxiety weren't improving. Shortly before I turned 18 I began cognitive behavioral therapy once a week, and a drug regimine to control my symptoms. She prescribed a few different medications along the way to try to find one that worked for me, and one of the trials was Wellbutrin. My mother had taken it with good results, so I consented. After about 3 days I was forced to stop taking the pills - my depression and anxiety had gone from distracting but not over-whelming to literally life-threatening in 72 hours. I began self-mutilating (a habit I had managed to break myself of during my pill-less years) and became incredibly paranoid, agitated, angry, depressed, and I isolated myself from everyone and everything. Again, all within 72 hours! I am not saying this medication is horrible and should never be used by anyone, I just want to share my story so everyone knows that yes it can work (like for my mother), but it might not and might actually be dangerous (like it was for me). So always be sure to discuss any concerns you have with your doctor, beginning or continuing a medication is a big decision and it could have serious effects on your health and your life both positive or negative. Be careful, and good luck!

Stop Smoking	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	1	Male	25-34	1/11/2010 4:40:58 AM	I was taking bupropion to help me quit smoking. I have also been diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar Disorder so I thought that this might be something to try. well after takeing it for about a week I had a severe allergic reaction. I personally caution all of you that are considering taking this drug for something like quitting smokeing please talk with your doctor about some of the severe side affects to this drug. For me it went well for the first week until i started feeling anxious and a feeling of impending doom. Next came the chest pain and pounding heart. The next day I awoke to find my hands and feet swollen to the point i couldn't wear my gloves or boots. I also had a rash over my entire body and hives. I have stopped taking the medication but 5 days later I am still having trouble breathing a rash and hives. I have been forced to take large doses of several drugs in order to try to combat this reaction to include Epenephrine Benedryl and Prednisone. To let you all know i was the guy that never worried about side affects. I work in the medical field and i was able to monitor my condition and take the right steps in order to treat my condition. If you have any of these side affects don't do like i did go to the ER IMMEDIATELY these are symptoms of what can be a deadly allergic reaction. but pleas don't blow off you doctor when he tells you about side affects listen to them. I will say this though I quit smoking and it works well for that and i felt great most of the time i was on it.
Depression	kinleysmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	1/9/2010 6:54:38 PM	Having been put on Welbutrin 300mg for almost 3 weeks, I thought  I was loosing my mind.  Had horrible, scary thoughts.  Felt completely out of control. Lots of anxiety. Suicidal thoughts. Never experienced anything like this in my life.  I did lose some weight which was the only positive.  Having taken this for some mild depression, I would rather feel a little down once in a while than feel like I'm going to kill myself.Someone on here said you need to give it more than a few weeks.  Honestly, if I had given it any longer I wouldn't be here to type this post.  NOT the med. for me.

I was started on Wellbutrin and have done wonderfully for many years.  Once, I was put on the generic form, and to my real surprise, I was depressed again.  I must pay the extra cost for Wellbutrin despite the fact that my psychiatrist says 20% of patients cannot tolerate the generic form.  There is not suppose to be any difference in the two, but in some cases, that assumption is simply not true.

I weened myself off (BIG mistake) and was okay for a couple years but when life wasn't so &quot;prefect&quot; anymore I realized I needed to get back on something. My doctor put me back on 20 mg in Oct 2009, I was so drowsy after the first month he upped my dose to 40mg. I'm still exhausted &amp; have absolutely NO sex drive. I just called inquiring about Wellbutrin (b/c I'm also trying to quit smoking) and he prescribed 10mg of wellbutrin with 20mg of celexa. Is anyone on both of these? Will this make my sex drive come back?

I heard that antidepressants reduced it (my father quit taking them for this reasons with disastrous consequences) and so I avoided them, but I took Wellbutrin when I felt I simply had no other alternative.I am very grateful for a primary care MD who saw the potential problem in my resistance and headed it off with Wellbutrin.

By the 3rd day I was extremely anxious and angry. Because I was not given this drug to help with quitting smoking the anxiousness cause me to smoke a lot more. My husband point out that I seemed to be reacting extreme to very average situations. It took me 4 days to figure out that it was not adverse life conditions but the Wellbutrin that was causing me such extreme anxiety and anger, and then another 24 hours for the drug to be fully out of my system. Once clear of the drug my mood is high and anxiety low.

This was exactly what my brain needed for years. Zoloft and Paxil didnt help, and had bad side effects. I belive it depends on the person (Welbutrin wont be for everyone). I considerd anti-depressants to be a joke and ineffective.This time it was completely different. And the only side effect whatsoever is that I have less appetite. If you had  bad results with other meds before, I would strongly suggest to give it another try, but with a different medication this time.

This drug helped me function in public and in group situations. But since I was laid off, I cannot afford to take the drug. Today all I do is clean my guns and look at my slides from Vietnam and remember the horrors. Someday maybe I'll get another job and have insurance and get to take the drug again.
Depression	Chickencountry, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/12/2009 7:51:22 PM	I LOVE this med.  I have been on many antidepressants for many years.  I have been taking 150mg with 10mg Prozac. I've been taking these two for about 2 months.  However, just in the last 2 weeks I've had itching and a rash which keeps getting worse.  I'll really be upset if I have to stop.  This has helped more than anything I've EVER taken.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	12/10/2009 8:25:53 PM	I have been on the generic form of Wellbutrin for 3 months now and am dissatisfied. I was prescribed for depression/A.D.D. I am discontinuing use of it this week. First off I had a horrific first month: brutal nightmares, severe irritability, nausea, short fused, angry enough to kill with my bare hands. Month 2 showed a dramatic improvement: instant energy upon intake, loss of appetite, increased interest in work/learning/hobbies.. However, I had even more social anxiety and my &quot;ocd&quot; tendencies were at an all time high. Month 3 has been an utter disapointment. I no longer feel rejuvenated upon intake. In fact i'm pretty lethargic for the most part.  I have ideas for personal entertainment but instead lay motionless on my couch or in my bed. I'm so sick of wasting time.....Two thumbs down !

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	12/1/2009 6:21:02 AM	I have been on this medication for 6 years. It really works for me. I also got swithced to the generic version of this medicine, do to insurance policy, and that medicine DID NOT work as well, I noticed (along with my husband) that with the generic version my depression symptoms were getting worse so they upped the dose, still didn't work! The doctor put me back on the name brand WellbutrinXL (after a letter sent to the insurance company, stating I responded to the namebrand drug much better) and within a month I was feeling like my old self again, too much relief to me and my husband! It worked and is still working for me.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	11/30/2009 3:41:33 PM	I have been on this medication for 3 months. I had been taking xanax for anxiety, but doc wanted me to stop taking xanax. He said welbutrin would &quot;level&quot; out my day and help me sleep. He was right. I took it a month before I realized that wow I wasnt very happy after all. I sleep better now and I feel like I did when I was younger. I am 53 and female, and I feel like as we get older life just gets harder to deal with. Kids, jobs, etc. So if we have to take meds to help, so be it.

Bipolar Depression	Whisperloudly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	11/23/2009 11:51:18 AM	Being an ex-drug addict (opiates only-lortabs, etc.), I knew I had to try this medication when the ER DR. at the psych ward called it the &quot;crack-cocaine for housewives&quot;.  So far, I've noticed a tremendous loss of apetite, which is good cuz I ballooned up to 185 on other antidepressants, and I feel more alert, less lethargic, without any cravings to get back on opiates. It's wonderful !!

I can not control my brain, including 24/7 dizziness, nausea and fainting. On top of that I called my physician and they told me they didn't have time for me to come in to control my meds. They are making me wait an extra 2 weeks because they deleted my original appointment. So here I am sick on the floor about to pass out, so I thought I would do this to pass the time. DO NOT TAKE THESE MEDS!!!!! 
Depression	Joanne, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/4/2009 10:48:46 AM	Was on 5 mg of prozac daily, a very low dose, but 10mg gave me really bad nightmares. Lowering the dosage helped. BUT... I still didn't have any motivation to actually get up and do anything. So my psychiatrist suggested this. Can I say wow?? The first day, I got the jitters, like when you've had too much coffee, that lasted a couple of hours, then I never had them again. It also has made me slightly nauseous, which increases with dosage increase. I'm currently taking half of a 75mg pill, because taking a whole one made extremely nauseous. Now, after a month on a half, the nausea is almost completely gone. It also does control my appetite. I eat way less and my usual &quot;grazing&quot; doesn't happen anymore. yay! I'm very happy on this medication. If you're  having the extreme side effects, talk to your doctor. coudl be the dosage is too high.

Depression	Astrid, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/1/2009 5:50:41 PM	Though a generally upbeat person, the back to back deaths of my mother and a close colleague put me in a real angry, depressive state.  I tried psychotherapy for 3 months without much help.  Reluctently, I told my physician about my state of mind during a routine visit and she recommened Wellbutrin.  After about 2 weeks on the med the fog lifted from my head and once again I feel joy.  Though I do experience a slight dry mouth side effect, I am also experiencing a decrease in appetite which is actually a benefit as I have always had to closely watch my calories in order to maintain my slender figure.  I plan on remaining on the drug until springtime (I live in the PacNW and the nonstop winter rain is enought to make anyone depressed!) and will slowly wean myself off.

I take one 150XL (generic) once a day at bedtime. I don't have any problem sleeping or taking afternoon naps. Thanks to Wellbutrin I feel normal again. Depression was the worst feeling I have ever had I don't wish it on anyone. Wellbutrin worked for me. Thanks

Other	too many meds, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/22/2009 2:09:29 PM	I am taking this drug a bit off label in addition to other psychotropic meds.  My starting dosage was 150mg/day. I was instructed to double that after 1 week, but wanted more info before doing so.  I have noticed only slight improvement on the higher dosage, but feel &quot;submission&quot; about me in the sense of no longer caring about standing my ground.  If the tabs could be spliced, I'd beg to take an in- between dose.

It's been 10-years since my last smoke. I still use Wellbutrin 150mgx2, which seems like a pretty light dose. Still, if I don't take it I feel many of the symptoms reported on this blog. Times are getting tougher for me now (and the rest of the world too) and I'm thinking 150mg may need to be increased. I hope I can cope with dosage and not by changing to another drug...this one really works for me.   In fact, I think if I had something like Wellbutrin when I was (much) younger, I would have had fewer problems. I've only found one thing better than Wellbutrin....membership in a gym.

Although I lost the weight I put on with Remeron, I almost completely lost my appetite &amp; I had persistent insomnia. I was more depressed than ever. I had to switch it from 300mg to 150, although I am very anxious, moody, angry &amp; tired. I am also experiencing stomach pain on a daily basis. It was the best thing for me to lower the dose. I can't wait to get off all anti-depressants, I feel that my physical health has suffered as a result of taking them.

I was suicidal and not in my right mind, my Dr. prescribed me Wellbutrin and within 2 weeks I was feeling like myself again, but I've taken it so long that maybe it's not working as great because I am feeling more depressed than ever, but fortunately not suicidal this time. I think this medicine only works for so long before you start becoming immune to it.

From what I have read about it, it takes close to 4 weeks before any change is noticed! Some of the bad reviews here state they had been on it for 3 days to a week and hate it!

I still had bouts of depression. My psychiatrist tried adjusting the Effexor dosage (up) with little effect. He next suggested that I concurrently start Wellbutrin WITH Effexor. Wow. As somebody else has said recently, I didn't remember what my old self was really like ... and I got &quot;me&quot; back. Truly, the world seemed an infinitely brighter place.  I've been on this combination since 2004. In 2008, I tried to wean off of Wellbutrin (being the easier of the two drugs to quit) but after several months I realized that I didn't like &quot;that&quot; person. Went back to the Wellbutrin and back to my happy self. I'm a huge fan.

It is being added to a cocktail of other meds (I have the fringes of a number of dxs).  I give this 4 stars because what I like, I really like.  I left a message for my provider telling her that I would like to wait till I see her next week to increase about the parts that I don't care much for (like feeling a &quot;buzz&quot; about 12 hours after taking it, making it hard to settle for and sleep through the night).

Was for A.D.D.(NOT A.D.H.D.)&amp; depression. Also had(still have it all-chronic fatigue,pain,fibro,headaches) This drug worked AMAZINGLY-for the first few months or so.(I remember thinking-and THIS is 'legal')? Hadn't felt that good since I was a kid! Was told it'd take about 3-4 wks to take effect-only took 3-4 DAYS! Then, it beagn to wane-unfortunately. It was by far the BEST antidepressant/a.d.d. drug I've ever taken. I'm on NOTHING now,tried 'em all-they work pretty o.k. for awhile, and then--nothing. (thats just MY experience though) My point is to just give Wellbutrin a TRY. Even if you get ONLY 3 months-thats 3 GREAT months that you'd have. Need to add that I noticed my smoking cut way back while on this drug-this was BEFORE they came out with it as a drug to help you quit.

Put on W. Was told it could take up to 2-3 wks. to take effect. ONLT TOOK 3 DAYS!!! It was the absolute BEST drug that I've ever taken for BOTH the depression AND the A.D.D.! I was actually a functioning, NORMAL, NO-MIND-RACING-able to focus,AGAIN-NORMAL human being! HORRIBLY- in my case-this only lasted for a little over 3 months. After that, it slowly began to go back to my old &quot;normal&quot; (abnormal)? self. I was heartbroken! My Dr. explained that this sometimes happens and that believe it or not the drug was still working. No-it wasn't. ALL of the old symptoms re-appeared. If they could only find a way to make the effects of this drug last, SO many people with the same problems could be helped. I should add that I also had (still do)chronic fatigue(it's a.d.d.-NOT a.d.h.d.)chronic pain &amp; fibro. Wellbutrin was amazing! I should also add that I took it BEFORE it was used as a smoking cessasion drug and it DID help me to cut WAY back on cigarette consumption!(Who knew)? Anyway-hope this can help someone else.I should ALSO note that this was a little over 10 yrs. ago.

I have been taking the drug for a week and am experiencing dizziness, nausia, and headaches as side effects. I am hoping that these are temporary. Otherwise I do feel that the drug is working its way to treating symptoms of depression. However, if side effects do not lessen within a couple of weeks I would not be able to continue treatment.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	9/26/2009 9:46:35 AM	I'm laughing at the other &quot;reviews&quot;. People: take the medication exactly as prescribed. If the side effects are too strong, tell the dr., but just because you get certain side effects at certain dosages, doesn't mean it doesn't work. This has been great for me! I was taking prozac before for YEARS. I have been taking Wellbutrin now for about 1-1/2 years. Don't review it if it's been 2 days or 2 weeks!! I've never known an anti-depressant that works that soon. Obviously, the major things you should report to your dr and maybe the dose needs to be decreased. I know, been there, done that. This decreased my apetite (I gained with prozac) and improved the sex drive (great for my marriage). I felt mental clarity and I felt like &quot;me&quot; which I hadn't felt in years. One of my first reactions was, &quot;Man! I missed myself.&quot; I have so much more energy (which as you know with depression is horrible). My dr initially recommended that I work my way up to 4 a day (2 am, 2pm), but that was too much and I felt some of the things others have described (suicidal thoughts-never felt that before this). I didn't like the two doses a day. I'm only taking one and it's okay. My drs told me what symptoms I may feel and were great about following up. Yes dry mouth and funny taste, but I didn't jet the &quot;jitteriness&quot; that they said I might. Do a &quot;google&quot; search for it, there's a website where people review this after more than 2 days of taking it...lol :)
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	9/22/2009 1:04:40 PM	Wellbutrin made my depression much worse.  I was taking Celexa and switched due to weight gain. Just a day or two after taking Wellbutrin I started feeling angry and suidical.  I wanted to slit my wrists, literally.  I cried more than I cried without medication.  It was horrible.  I called the dr and switched back to Celexa. It took time for the Wellbutrin to leave my system. I hated the feeling of hating my life and everything in it.
Other	Colonial, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	9/21/2009 11:50:39 AM	Wellbutrin caused me confusion and extreme blurred vision.  It really did not do anything for the condition for which I was taking it.  The doctor took me off of it and shortly thereafter, I experienced anxiety, a problem that I had not had previously.  I learned that this was a rebound effect, although the explanation and terminology were far more technical and detailed than just &quot;rebound.&quot;  The bottom line is that I am on anti-anxiety medication that I will have to take forever.  I have tried twice to reduce dosage or get off it totally but the resultant anxiety was more than I cantolerate.

However, I crash hard and get very depressed when it wears off and I can never fall asleep now. Also has decreased my appetite a LOT, which is fine with me!

Depression	Grateful1, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	9/4/2009 3:02:29 PM	In the past several months I went from nothing to several drugs. I went from not eating and losing 45lbs in 2 months to taking Pristiq which made me want to jump out of a window and was causing me to wake with extremely bad anxiety attacks(once I finally fell asleep), hyperventilate and miss work.I tried that for 2 weeks and couldn't stand it any longer. Then I was prescribed Lexapro, which after the 1st night made me feel the same way as the  Pristiq and I immediately stopped that next day. My doctor was so perplexed and gave me 150mg of Wellbutrin. I was nervous at 1st but then I made it thru 2 weeks and was feeling GREAT! My mood changed and I was actually sleeping like I haven't in YEARS!I'm now doing 300mg and can really see a difference. I think I am going to stick with this until otherwise proven different.It's all about what you can tolerate. But I've learned that if a drug like these make u feel worse... as soon as u realize it...STOP IMMEDIATELY and CALL SOMEONE WHO'S AWARE OF YOUR SITUATION!
Other	Lucia, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/3/2009 4:16:38 PM	A year ago, I decided there were several areas of my life that needed to be &quot;cleaned up&quot;. One of those areas was starting Wellbutrin for ADD and mild depression. My angel of a marriage counselor suggested I look into it. The side effects I experienced were dry mouth and a little trouble sleeping. I have also lost about 10 lbs which may not be a good thing since I was already very thin. I very rarely feel hungry. Wellbutrin has worked great for the ADD. It is very subtle but I just feel so much more competent and on top of things. I used to forget something important on a daily basis. I am no longer depressed, but it's hard to say whether it's the meds or the life changes. I wasn't sure if I was depressed until I started taking this drug. Now I know I was. I am really glad my Dr gave me this instead of a more comman ADD med. Again, it could be the life changes, but I just feel very &quot;at home&quot; in my life.

Depression	scribs, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/23/2009 7:10:28 PM	This is my 3rd day taking the generic, 100mg SR. I was stoked at first to have no side effects, but last night, I noticed what I thought was some dry mouth and when I was trying to sleep, my restless leg syndrome (which is mild) was worse, and I felt sort of like I had a mild electric current running thru my entire body. Today, the dry mouth is definitely there (bummer), and I seem to be developing a slight tremor. Also feel slightly nauseated and am having anxiety issues.  I get headaches a lot, so it's hard to tell if the headache I've got today is from the drug or just me. If this is as bad as it gets, I'll keep taking it, but the seizure thing is making me nervous, what with the feeling of an electric current running through me. I'm gonna tough it out and see if it gets better; I realize there's a period of adjustment, and I really want this drug to work, since it doesn't cause problems with weight &amp; sex drive.  I am perimenopausal, and it might be making the hot flashes worse, though. That SUCKS.

Depression	35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5		35-44	8/13/2009 10:33:30 PM	Taking 300 mg for three months now and have felt much better. My Dr. would like to up this dosage to 450, however I'm not comfortable with this dosage - have tried this higher does for a few days and could not handle it. With the 300 mg/ first few weeks my fingers twitched but this passed. My sex drive has improved , started going to yoga and pilates classes on a reg. bases. Stopped sneaking back to bed after dropping the kids off at school and smile more. Infact I sleep less and feel okay. Need to eat prior to taking and if I take the medication in the afternoon sleep is difficult that night. Have tried paxol - 3yrs ago for postpardom depression- symptoms - fell asleep while sitting up on the couch, that's more than just tired and lost my sex drive completely. Different people metabolize medication differently. My Dr. now wants to add Lexapro to the mix - not to sure about this which is why I'm doing my research. Also was prescribed clonazepam, however I have only taken three pills in the three months and only a half pill each time. They make me feel high; a little to good.

Its effects are barely noticeable to me but all my friends think im a new and improved person.  Im generally happier, more positive, and will stand up for myself more.  I finally feel like i have the strength to help those around me as much as possible because i dont need to babysit my moods anymore.

I take 150mg/2x day.
Depression	aer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/9/2009 11:17:42 AM	Wellbutrin works great for me.  Once I started to feel like it wasn't working for me so my MD told me to take 200mg twice a day; but found it to cause dizziness and  a feeling like I was going to pass out, had difficulty driving.  So I cut back to 100mg bid, and those sx immediately went away.  Funny thing was, though, my MD didn't think the Wellbutrin had anything to do with it; but I had just increased the dosage about 2 weeks prior and it went away immediately when I cut back.  I made sure my MD knew this.  Then after talking to a friend, I tried 200mg at bedtime.    This works best for me. I even lost 20 lbs. I would recommend it; just make sure you are advocating for you.  If you don't agree with your dr, tell them!!

Only after 3 days my attitude changed.  I have a lot more patience with my husband and that is what I needed.  It works wonders for me.. No side affects at all... I take two 150 mg tablets a day.. One about 8 a.m. and a 2nd one at 2:30 p.m.  It seems to wear off for me about 2:30 and this works good for the evening hours... and it doesn't keep me awake when I take in mid-day.

Other	medicationreview, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	19-24	7/27/2009 6:35:05 AM	This is the only medication that alleviated my depressive symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, and poor attention span, and it did a very good job at it too.  However, I was eventually prescribed 300mg bid and ended up having a grand mal seizure (1st seizure) at work.  This medication's seizure threshold lowering properties likely had a role in inducing this seizure, so I am no longer taking it.  It does significantly increase sex drive (which can lead to poor decisions by some...), but this wasn't too much of an issue for me.  Great medication, except for the seizure.

Not with Wellbutrin.  I love it.  My head is clear and I feel so much better.  There are two things that I have discovered.  One thing that I have noticed about it is that I really need to take it at the same time everyday.  I take 450mg, two pills in the morning and one in the evening.  If I'm an hour or so late on one of my doses, I get a little cranky, but it goes away shortly after I take my dose.  I also have noticed that I don't sleep as long.  But I seem to still be well rested most of the time, even when I only get 4 hours of sleep.  It beats the drowsiness I felt with the other meds.

I told my doctor but he said it was normal side effects, and that he was going to put me on Bipolar medication also, I dont want to keep taking them because Im only 19 so I'm kind of emberrest of admitting that I have depression.

Depression	b., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/21/2009 3:16:22 AM	I've been taking this drug off and on for over two years. In the past, I have been on Prozac and Paxil. Wellbutrin (incl. generics) has vastly exceeded the other drugs in effectivness for me. Tho there were side effects at one time, off and on for awhile, including some mild agitation and slight anxiety, and moderate or substantial agitation and irritation at higher dosages, they have gone away almost 100%. Currently, after re-engaging at the higher dose (150 mg SR 2x a day, previously was on 150mg SR 1x/day) I have had almost no side effects, certainly none that are substantially disturbing. And for probably the first time in 40 years I find my depressive symptoms dramatically reduced, well below what I had previously thought of as 'normal' or 'complete symptom elimination.' I now feel that I was not aware of what normal is. For me, I believe my body needed some time to acclimate to the drug. However I am so happy with current status I wished I had tried the higher dose again sooner.

It was effective in controlling depression most of the time.  I have never heard this from anyone else and Galaxo-Smith etc claim there is no connection with the drug but I had weird problems with my sense of smell.  Phantom smells and then loss of smell.

I'm on 300mg XL and have no side effects as a matter of fact I was even alright when I suddenly stopped taking it. (unlike Paxil) which made me crazy. Not every anti-depressant is for everyone, but this one is wonderful for me.

Depression	Shorty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	5/12/2009 3:41:05 PM	Before Wellbutrin, I had tried Zoloft, Prozac, Lexapro &amp; Cymbalta and none of them gave me the results that Wellbutrin did.  With the other antidepressants they gave no results, left me in a catatonic state or I became toxic.  It wasn't long before I noticed I wasn't rushing home just to go to bed.  My family was excited that my doctor and I had finally found something to help me get back to living my life, instead of just existing.  All I know is it really saved my life, and gave me what I needed to be able to face life head on.

Depression	Happy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	5/8/2009 5:32:47 PM	I started with Wellbutrin to stop smoking.  The impact on my depression was amazing!  When my doctor asked my reaction, I told him I was astonished when I found myself laughing.  Twice I tried the generic (once for 6 weeks; once for a month) and it did not work for me.  My cost for the Wellbutrin is four times the cost of the generic.  I do not know how much longer I can take Wellbutrin; my insurance charges are four times greater for Wellbutrin than the generic.  I wish the medical profession would limit the practice of medicine by insurance companies.

I have gained 10 lbs, my hair is falling out, and I feel no difference in mood.  I am taking this along with 2 mg of Abilify and 175 mg of Efexor.  Has anyone else had these problems?I plan to stop the Welbutrin 150 mg today but continue with the Efexor and Abilify until I can get in to see my dr.  Any thoughts on this?  Are there side effects from stopping Welbutrin cold turkey?

Wellbutrin has done a marvelous job in evening out the mood swings with half a standard dose (150mg).  I don't have any real low days anymore but generally feel optimistic all the time.  I find that I can't take a dose after 4pm or I have trouble sleeping but besides that, no other side effects.

That changed the 3rd month to one 300mg pill a day. I have taken this drug for almost 2 years now. I no longer feel depressed as I did. I was on the verge of suicide and couldn't look at myself in the mirror. That isn't a problem at all anymore. I smile all the time! co-workers and family have seen the difference. I lost +70 in the year after the first 6 months and I'm still dropping. I no longer fear going into public and I love doing active things again. Have had no negative reactions to taking this drug.

I have found that Wellbutrin helped me face things I have had difficulty handling.  I lost my insurance some time ago and had to switch to the generic form which doesn't seem as effective but I do not want to try another med because of weight issues.  I had gastric bypass surgery so it is very important the meds I take are not known for causing weight gain.I have also found that taking Wellbutrin in conjunction with Provigil helped me more than any other combination of medications.  Unfortunately I am unable to continue with Provigil because of the cost associated with it and not having insurance to assist with the cost.

Overall, it has been effective, but I have had to increase the dosage every few years.  I'm now maxxed on 450/day (and have been for about 2-3 years), and it's no longer working.  My doc and I are in search of something else.  The side effects have been minimal for me.  At first, it affected my sleep and may have caused a bit of weight loss, but that hasn't been the case for several years now.  The two biggest ones that have been consistent since day one have been decrease/loss of sex drive and occasional dry mouth.

I started out on the XL 300mg once a day but it made my stomach upset and gave me horrible headaches. So I went to my doctor after a few months and we brought it down to 200mg. I take it in the morning and it really does feel like it gives me a burst of energy. I was pretty depressed before and I had issues controlling my anger sometimes, and that is pretty much gone away now. I really like Wellbutrin. I will say though that it makes you twitch sometimes, which I don't like, but it's not noticeable most of the time.

After 20 years of experimenting with SSRIs, I have an almost ideal combo of Wellbutrin XL (generic) 150 mg each morning PLUS Lexapro 10 mg each night. Wellbutrin made me hyper at first, so I lowered the dosage. It has no negative sexual side effects, so it balances Lexapro nicely (in fact, it has the opposite effect). No weight gain, late-night munchies, sleeping all the time. It's truly different from all the rest. Effexor was awful, Paxil made me fat, Zoloft made me sleepy, Prozac made me nuts, and none of those helped my depression. Wellbutrin saved me, and its generics are so much cheaper than the alternatives. If you're not doing well with the standard Rx, try this...it's truly different, and ask your doc about combining meds.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/5/2009 2:57:05 AM	i have been using the generic wellbutrin for just a little over a week now.  the first week i took one 150 tablet a day and now i have to increase it to 2 a day.  within a few days i started feeling a little more positive and i noticed that things i would normally get peeved about were not bothering me at all.  i can still feel a little bummed when i think about the things that bother me, but it gets less and less everyday.  The side effects i've had is dry mouth, sore throat, and a weird taste in the morning and late at night.  I have also had insomnia but i suffered from that long before and my doctor has prescribed me a sleeping pill that works hand in hand with wellbutrin.  I have noticed that i have been feeling a little more jittery today since i have increased it but i will moniter and see if my amount is too much.  I believe that this will go away after a while though.  lastly i just wanted to add that i ate my feeling when i was depressed and while i am not horribly overweight i am a little and that was one of my biggest reasons for being depressed.  and slowly i am noticing my appitite and cravings going down and i think i am losing a little weight.  thank god!  but i recommend doing your homework and not settling but finding the right drug for you. before i took lexapro and it killed my sex life and i took cymbalta and it made me very dizzy and nauscious.  so i have finally found something that works FOR ME.

I had control over my own thoughts and my body again, I cant remember the last time I felt this in control of my life. I may only be 19 but Ive been depressed for as long as I can remember. Quite basically wellbutrin saved my life as I had started cutting was a step away from suicide. Ive never felt this good before.

Didn't know people could ever feel this good, or be this focused &amp; clear-minded.  DX over the past decade with PMDD, ADHD, Depression &amp; SADD.  Also have Hashimoto's, and arthritis causing chronic pain &amp; disturbed sleep.  On Wellbutrin, I didn't implode from stress over the holidays, I'm not dwelling on things or blowing them out of proportion, anxiety is down, and my self-attitude is more positive.  I feel far more connected to people &amp; interested in things, and I'm not procrastinating so much.The combo of careful monitoring &amp; tweaking my thyroid hormones, a daily progestin-only mini-pill to counter-balance high estrogen levels, a using a SADD lite box a few times a week, plus Wellbutrin, seems to be the answer for me.  I started on Wellbutrin @75 mg daily for 4 weeks, moved to 100 mg of XL daily 2 weeks ago.  Only side effect is getting a bit overheated while sleeping.  Normally I wear sweats, a nite cap &amp; blanket set on High, so this is a good thing.  Tried SSRIs - Zoloft, Prozac &amp; Lexapro, plus Atenolol for anxiety/stress symproms, &amp; Strattera for ADHD, but cardiovascular side effects were extreme, or left me feeling &quot;flat&quot; and apathetic, and had a major allergic reaction to Strattera.

Bipolar Depression	tiredofrx, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/6/2009 9:16:36 PM	best over all anti-depressant i've been on...and i've been on them all.  it works; anti-anxiety meds and sleeping pills counteract negative side effects.  only one taken that has NOT had a more than negative side effect on my sex drive!  when you're depressed, many docs don't take that into consideration. already feeling BAD and losing sex drive/ability often makes you feel even worse!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/6/2009 9:17:42 AM	I have been taking this medication for a little over a month and I do not like it at all.  I feel like I am in a haze and do not feel that I am functioning clearly and I am having problems with joint pain.  It feels like it has attacked me in every joint.  I am only 32 and I feel like my great grandmother in my fingers,back,neck,knees,elbows and feet.

Stop Smoking	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	1/2/2009 12:02:30 AM	I have bipolar and anxiety, and I smoke. My MD prescribed Wellbutrin last week at my request to help me quit smoking. Since taking Wellbutrin for about a week, it has overridden my anti-anxiety medication. I have experienced pounding heart-beat, agitation, frequent urination, inability to concentrate, and change in mood(irritable hypo-mania of my bipolar). I am calling my doctor in the morning to discuss these negative side-effects with him, and am quitting taking this Wellbutrin. I will try other methods of quitting smoking. The reason I asked for Wellbutrin is because when a person has a mood disorder like bipolar or depression, quitting smoking cold-turkey can cause severe depression and crying-spells. Just a note: this is my own personal experience with Wellbutrin. If you have an anxiety disorder and you want to quit smoking, please discuss with your MD the side-effects I have experienced. Please note that everyone reacts to meds differently, so this review I am giving is just an FYI.
Depression	 Female  (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female		1/1/2009 3:26:42 PM	I've been on Bupropion for about three weeks now. The good effect I've had so far is a clarity in dealing with depressive thoughts and the appearance of optimistic thoughts- it has given me moreso the capacity to choose among them. The side effects, though, are infuriating. I feel constantly in a haze, dizzy, and less aware. My vision is a little blurred. I have mild headaches, but not near as bad as ones I got from SSRIs (prozac, lexapro, celexa). I feel somewhat nauseous. Reading takes a little more effort and I'm having a hard time spelling, which is really strange- not being able to pull the words forward, maybe because I have blurry vision and feel hazed over. Do the side effects normally go away with time? I hope so. I want badly for this drug to work.

However, I did experience a seizure, first time, while taking 450 mg/day and i only weigh 105lbs and have not had an appetite even before Welbutrin.  Depression takes my appetite.
Depression	minnie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/28/2008 6:48:51 PM	I am a 57 year old woman who has been using wellbutrin plus celexa for 7 years.  My only regret is that I did not start taking these medications 35 years earlier.  I am much calmer and more optimistic.  I no longer have periods where I plan my suicide and force myself to get out of bed. The return of my libido has certainly helped my marriage. I simply will never stop taking these medications.

Are you supposed to feel worse before you feel better.
Depression	Bee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	12/22/2008 7:48:37 AM	After dealing with depression for probably two years I finally worked up the nerve to talk to my Dr. about it.  I really didn't want to think I had something I couldn't take care of myself.  I started taking a low dosage of Wellbutrin (actually the generic) once a day about 2 months ago and it has worked very well for me.  The first couple of weeks I felt a little dazed and loopy and I have mild headaches every now and then but those seem to be the only side effects.  I actually lost a little weight when I started but now have come to a stand still in the weight area.  My overall mood has benefited greatly and I find myself enjoying life more and I take things in stride much better. My Dr. has suggested that I only stay on it for a few more months and then go off it which I think I will try as I hate being on a medication every day.  I do think I'll wait until Spring as I live in Upstate New York and our winters always depress me!  I found this sight because I'm looking for a cold medicine with a decongestant that I can take with Wellbutrin.  I don't like having to worry about drug interactions when I just want to take a simple cold tablet.  I would recommend this medicine to anybody that is looking for some releif from depression.

Other	Susanne, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/18/2008 9:33:02 AM	I have been taking Wellbutrin for about 3 weeks now.  I was switched off of Paxil and Zoloft after SERIOUS weight gain was making me depressed (LOL).  Anyway, I take it for anxiety/OCD.  I am extremely satisfied with the effects of this drug.  I have none of the side effects that people mention.  To be honest, I have none of the side effects at ALL.  The only thing that I notice about this medication verses the others is that I have a little more energy, I don't feel like I am in a fog, and I have lost 4 pounds!  I am certainly not going to complain over THOSE side effects.  I can see where some people feel that they can't sleep.  With that in mind, I started taking my medication FIRST THING IN THE MORNING!  By evening, I have no problem sleeping at all.My biggest word of advise to everyone is to remember that statistically, when people are complaining about something, they tell 10 people, but when they are satisfied with something, they tell one or two.  Don't allow the reviews to deter you from trying this medication, or any other medication that may help you live a normal life.  Try...and try again...until you find the one that works for you.  Wellbutrin is certainly the one that works for me.  I wish you the best of health!

I like the fact that I do not feel like I am taking anything.  Many other depression medicines make you feel like you are in a fog and you look glazed over.  I handle stress much better, but have suffered a libido drop.  When I first started taking it I could not sleep at night, but I was taking it before bed.  After I started taking it in the morning that problem went away.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	12/10/2008 10:12:37 PM	I was on Wellbutrin for approx. 6 wks(switched to Wellbutrin d/t no libido) and after 2 weeks being on it started having &quot;twinges&quot; in my head whenever I moved or like little &quot;shocks&quot;. It was very annoying,thought it would go away,but at 6 weeks was getting worse. Also had horrible constipation,felt bloated due to not having normal bowel movements. Tried to go &quot;cold turkey&quot; off Wellbutrin,not a good idea. The twinges/shocks got worse after 2 days,and got very aggitated/mean for no reason, so started back on Prozac 20mg(with which I was on 40mg Prozac before starting Wellbutrin). Twinges have slowed(after 1st day of restarting Prozac)- starting to feel normal again.  Also had the side effect of &quot;heart pounding in my head&quot; while on Wellbutrin.  Going to talk to doctor about this.

It was the one and only anti-depressant I was even willing to try based on the possible side-effects. Thankfully, it worked for me because I know many people have to try several different types of meds before they find the right one (or combination) that will work for them. I do recall that it took about six weeks for many of the initial side effects to go away; tingling sensation, bad taste in mouth, mild nausea, insomnia, etc. At the time, I was severely depressed/suicidal and suffered from PTSD as well. The initial bothersome side effects were minor compared to my critical emotional state, so I didn't focus on them too much. I'm glad for that now, because I could've easily decided that the drug wasn't working and found myself getting on the medication roller coaster that many people suffer through. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't taken this drug. The other thing that helped is that I didn't rely on medication alone. At my worst, I was seeing a counselor 2-3 times per week. Eventually, I was able to go on a very light dose (100mg 1xday), just as a preventative measure. That was 6 years ago. No recurrence of depression and I couldn't identify any side effects that are problematic if I tried. Severe, chronic depression runs in my familly and my first onset of this level of clinical depression was when I was just 9 years old, (I'm 45 now). One of my brothers was even younger. The only family members that are not struggling with severe depression are the ones that are on Wellbutrin. One family member changed meds (from Well to many others) because he couldn't deal with the insomnia and he spent the next 4 years spiraling down to the pits of hell. He went back on it 6 months ago and he's doing well. Yeah, I'm a big fan of Wellbutrin and a fortunate one at that. Good luck to those of you just embarking on recovery. My heart really goes out to you.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	11/24/2008 8:22:36 PM	I was on Celexa and titrated off while starting Wellbutrin.  For one week I was on 1/2 dose of each and had 2 major meltdowns.  Now I'm on full dose of W. for 2 weeks and can't handle nausea, vomitting, and pressure in my head and neck.  I feel like I have too much spinal fluid in my head and not enough in my neck and back.  I realize that sounds bizarre.  Has anyone else had this same side effect?  
Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	45-54	11/24/2008 11:31:25 AM	I started with Wellbutrin XL, 150 mg/day. For the first two days it did help with the depression, but by day 3 I was totally wired: jittery, super anxious, unable to eat or sleep, felt like electricity was flowing to my finger tips, etc. I stopped and took an anti-anxiety med for a couple of days, just to be able to relax and sleep. Then switched to regular Wellbutrin: 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the afternoon. I think it does help with the depression but I still have ups and downs all the time. Overall feeling less gloomy and hopeless. However, it completely killed my appetite. I am never hungry. I try to eat more or less regularly, but have lost weight. The other side effect is almost constant, low grade nausea. My doc suggested increasing to 200 mg/day, but that just made the nausea worse. For now, I will stick with 150 mg/day. I also continue to take an anti-anxiety med (Clonazopan) at bedtime. I don't get more that 4 or 5 hours of sleep, but at least when I do wake up at 5 am, I feel calm and sometimes can even go back to sleep for a bit. I feel a bit tired during the day, but am not sure if it is because of lack of sleep or the Wellbutrin.

That kept me fit and trim.  Result:  gained weight and that only made it worse. My life felt out of control...with food.  I could not eat enough.  Started on this and within a week I no longer craved bad things and I lost the 10 pounds I had put on.

Since I was switched from paxil to wellbutrin I've been experiancing tingle serges all throughout my body continuosly with any body movement. The only thing I can relate it to is when administering an epideral, when first tapped into the spine, a strong tingle shoots down the left side of you. I experiance that, but all over, and kind of makes me distorted and throws me off balance. Reading the reviews, it's somewhat similar to &quot;Scrooge's&quot; symptoms. Im on another injected medication that can cause serious nervous conditions, but have had a MRI and ECG to cancel out that that medication was the cause. Anyone else besides Scrooge and myself having any nerve symptoms?

Depression	suski, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/5/2008 2:03:37 PM	I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and I have been on many different depression medications throughout the years. I started Wellbutrin about three years ago. I still become depressed, but nothing like I used to be. I no longer self-injure. It does not affect sexual functioning, as other meds do. But if your insurance will only pay for a generic, make sure you ask for BUPROPRION, not BUDAPRION. The latter does not work! During my time on it, I started hurting myself again. I thought I lost all the ground I thought I had gained. Fortunately, I looked on PublicPharmacy.com, and learned that many people have had the same problem with Budiprion. 
Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	13-18	11/3/2008 4:58:24 PM	Prior to taking WellButrin I have taken prozac, zoloft, abilify, and lexapro within the past two years. None of them seemed to work. Either I would feel absolutly horrible like I did with prozac, or I would feel nothing. WellButrin has seemed to work the best so far. I have only been on it for about a month, and I am already seeing results. HOWEVER, this drug is making me lose my hair. Im a female by the way, and in most people's opinions losing your hair is worse when youre a woman. My hair started to thin at the top of my head. My whole life I have had very thick hair. My hair is completely thin now. I have a bald spot at the top of my hair. Im on the younger side for taking this drug, and i feel that by staying on this I will lose more and more. I have talked to other people who lost their hair also. So it's not just a weird side effect for me. I really do not understand why it is not listed as a side effect. I would personally most likely not prescribe this to someone for that reason.

One problem is decreased libido.  On my last visit to my doctor we discussed adding Wellbutrin with the Effexor, but knowing it could increase anxiety level.  I've been taking this combination for over 60 days and I'm thrilled with the results.My libido has increased and I no longer have any problems with premature ejaculation.  My wife and I can remain in cotius for over 30 minutes and I have no problem maintaining an erecution or having an undesired orgasm.  I'm in full control of my destiny each time and my wife is extremely excited with the results and the extra sessions.  
Depression	megob, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	10/13/2008 5:23:15 PM	I suffered from depression for 6 years. I have tried numerous drugs but not all the drugs have worked like Wellbutrin. You have to wait a month before the drug even works so don't think it will start working right away. The side affects did hit me and I did have insomnia but I rather have that than suicidal thoughts. Overall this drug was effective but since I was under the age of 18 I had to have numerous medical tests to see if I was in danger of committing suicide. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	10/10/2008 3:15:04 PM	I had every possible side effect except for seizures.  hallucinations, tremors, suicidal thoughts, nausea-lost 30 pounds (got to 90 pounds) was not functional at all on this medication.  Ended up having to drop out of college for awhile and when I went off the drug the withdrawl symptoms were even worse.  hopefully this won't happen to someone else, but it was the worst decision of my life to start taking this medication, so be very wary.
Depression	harri, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	10/8/2008 1:07:45 PM	I started using Welbutrin 14 years ago.  Went off it gradually (very important) to see if I needed it.  Within 6 months all my depressive symptoms had gradually returned until they became very bad.  The last 5 of these 14 years I've used the generic which seems erratic or not quite as good.  I take much less now, 100 mg/day, NEVER within 6 hours of bedtime.   Also, if you have any manic state of mind consult your doctor and read the package  info.  Tapering off of it is important if you want to stop it and a very gradual build-up is important if you are starting it.  This helps avoid headache. Also, I feel that it's often hard to concentrate, comparable to a little too much caffeine and would like to know more about others' experience.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/6/2008 4:18:37 PM	I have been on Wellbutrin off and on for about five years; previously I was on Prozac but it left me feeling too flat - no lows, but no real happiness either. Wellbutrin makes me feel like the fog has lifted.  I start to feel so good, in fact, that I'll stop taking it, but I always crash 6-18 months later.  I hate being on any antidepressant, but this one (150mg 2x daily) has worked best for me.  Side effects (sleeplessness, dry mouth, decreased appetite, a general speedy feeling) have always been mild and and have worked themselves out in a couple of weeks.  Always drop a few pounds, too.

Stop Smoking	Kelley, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	10/1/2008 11:46:35 PM	(Coming from a 21 year old)I have recently went to the doctor about quitting smoking. I have been on the generic wellbutrin for a day and a half now. So far I have been smoke free that whole time. I don't think I would have done it without the help of this pill. I have felt a bit in a daze, but nothing too bad, It didnt effect my ability to drive. I have felt happier too. I didnt really even crave food either. I just hope it will stay this way! 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/29/2008 10:07:21 AM	34 yo female. I've been on the generic Wellbutrin for about 3 mths. 100 mg 2x day along with 40 mg Lexapro. The dry-mouth I experienced has subsided somewhat. Other side effects have gotten worse.Excessive sweating to the point of embarrassment even in a cool environment.   About an hour after dosage, my scalp tingles and feels like my brain is pulsating and constant headache (medium intensity). The side effects are beginning to outway the benefit to me. Will be talking to my dr soon about changing it.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/22/2008 6:48:20 PM	I was on this medication (SR) for depression. I do remember feeling &quot;weird&quot; for the first day or so while my body adjusted, after that it was a miracle drug for me. (I did not take the generic version). I lost about 15lbs, and I was as happy as a lark, the best anti-depressant I have ever tried. A few years later I tried to take the generic version after a miscarriage and it did NOTHING for me. I am a firm believer that the generics (for some) do not work or have worser side effects than the original version.

It took about 3 weeks to kick in but I have so much more energy and a drive to be active. My appetite is very unusual now though. I can go all day without eating and feel fine but late at night I get very strong cravings for junk food. Overall a wonderful medication.

I also feel the heart racing/pounding which also doesn't help my anxiety. Definately a bad choice if you have anxiety issues.

They made me sick and cloudy, confused. But it has been 6 months now and I feel amazing. I can't remember the last time I had a bad day(I do have a stressful life). I have been depressed for many long years and nothing has ever worked for me, until now with Wellbutrin. I finally feel like myself.Depression runs in my life. I told my mother and sister about my remarkable transformation and they are both taking it with astounding result. I honestly and truly recommend Wellbutrin.
Depression	sidney, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	8/26/2008 10:07:49 PM	I began taking Welbutrin about three weeks ago.  Since then, I've had a terrible, horrible taste in my mouth.  I'm constantly using mouth wash and eating mints to no avail.  I am currently taking Paxil and Welbutrin (150 2x's a day).  I haven't noticed much of a difference as I've only been taking it for a couple of weeks. I do feel aggravated/agitated more, sometimes anxious even.  It has decreased my appetite as well.  Overall I am willing to give it a try.  I am concerned a bit because I now take Ambien, Paxil and Welbutrin.  I always hear about these adverse side effects when taking numerous medications.  We shall see.

Then, 3 days ago switched to 2 pills twice a day.  Well, today, my 6th day on the meds, I thought I was having a heart attack driving home from work. Along with the shortness of breath and numb left arm.  The tightness in my chest is still there.  If it doesn't go away in the next hour, I am going to the ER. Obviously, this is not the drug for me.

It took almost a year to tie the headache to the Wellbutrin and now coming off the Wellbutrin, my headaches are subsiding.  It is not worth it to have this severe of a headache problem.
Other	Future Mrs. Beachem, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	8/13/2008 12:43:13 PM	Where do i begin? I started this drug a month ago for anxiety and anger issues rolled into a little depression. The first week was heaven! I had more energy than I've had in a long time. As a matter of fact, I couldn't stop talking and was talking really fast as if my brain couldn't keep up with my mouth. I mean it was to the point where my mother thought I had been drinking because I am not usually much of a talker. Then the side effects got worse. I couldn't sleep and went 4 nights straight without sleeping. Benadryl, Tylenol PMC and Sominex didn't help. Finally called my MD and got a prescription for some Lunesta to help me sleep. On top of that, my hands shake like crazy and people are always asking me if I'm nervous, had dry mouth, headaches, slight nausea and the WORST of it is the acne. My face, chest, neck and back are broken out worse than it ever was when I was a teen (I'm 31.) I'm going to continue taking it but me and my doc are going to have a serious talk at my next appointment. If anyone else has had problems with the acne and talking nonstop, please email me at Dawanna77@hotmail.com and let me know if it gets better or worse.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	8/8/2008 7:59:34 AM	After being on Zoloft for about 4 years, I found it was no longer working. So my doctor had me titrate down on the Zoloft from 150mg to 50mg and add Wellbutrin, 150mg twice a day. Starte at just one dose (150mg) in the morning with no bad physical symptoms, although emotionally I was going through hell. Ever since bumping up to the second dose of 150mg, I have constant shortness of breath. Mood is a little better, but not enough to justify this shortness of breath. Also constantly yawning, sleeping poorly (waking up too many times, extremely vivid dreams, waking up too early). Going to talk to my doctor about it. I've read that this drug works better with people who only have depression. Never knew I was overly anxious before Wellbutrin, but beginning to think it is causing me to be so.

I take it for depression and PMS type mood swings.Zoloft,----made me gain weight. Do not seem as hungry with wellbutrin, have lost 3 pounds. 3rd week started feeling VERY aggitated, feel like going to have a breakdown or meltdown soon. VERY restless @ nite if I have the slightest issue on my mind, previously, I could sleep thru anything--it was my safe haven. Bit concerned about the hosility and feelings of aggitation.  Will these feelings go away soon?  I am taking 150 mg. I take it b-4 I go to bed, am wondering if I should take it first thing in the a.m.---with or w/out food?  Have had increased libido, which is a huge problem since my husband is no longer &quot;needy&quot;!--go figure!  I hope this will continue to decrease major food cravings.  I wanted to eat and sleep way too much on zoloft, and gained several pounds over the last 3-4 yrs .  I also have an underactive thyroid, which may have caused me to gain a lot of the weight, but I felt STARVED all the time on zoloft..don't have the starved feeling anymore, which is nice and surely will help to drop a few pounds at least. Am concerned about the comments about seizures! anyone have any insight on my concerns or questions, please email me @ huds5@warpdriveonline.com  please put wellbutrin in the subject line or I most likely will delete as junk mail. Please please send comments/answers...am not sure what to do...stay on it, higher dosage?...just toss it all?.. is it best to take at night or in the morning?..etc

It seemed to make no difference one way of another. I was taking Effexor XR at the same time, and my doctor (specialist in psycho-pharmacology) asked me if I thought the Wellbutrin was helping me. I said no, so she took me off it. No problem discontinuing it -- I just had to take a lower dose for a week or two. This medicine didn't help my sister either. I know there are some people who find it very helpful -- I was just not one of them. No notable side effects.

Depression	ss624, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	6/4/2008 6:18:02 PM	I started on 150 mg XR, upped to 300 mg XR after a few weeks, and had terrible side effects. My heart raced and pounded, headaches were bad, had muscle twitching all the time, couldn't sleep at night, and felt nauseas at times. However, it helped me to stop being a smoker of ten years, increased my libido better than ever, and completely changed my outlook on life. I used to get agitated easily, be &quot;blue&quot; frequently, critical of others, and very insecure. It made me live for today, feel beautiful as I am and not care about other's judgements, including my own of myself and other people. The pounding heart and increased heart rate at the age of 23 scared me though, would I have my first heart attack by the age of 25? So after 8 weeks I dropped to 200 mg SR about a month ago, and already I am more agitated and have less of a libido. NEVER again will I pick up a cigarette, but I don't know how to make this drug effective without messing up my heart. I can deal with the muscle twitching and jitters, but I want to be good to my heart! Any suggestions?
Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	19-24	5/31/2008 12:51:38 PM	Wellbutrin is a wonderful medication.  I started at 150mg but then had it increased to 300mg.  It restored my libido tremendously and I express myself a lot better.  The only thing that I noticed is that I don't have the perception of being thirsty but I make sure I drink at least 8 cups of water daily.  I also have a broken sleep at night and feel the need to eat when I wake up during the night which is unusual since welbutrin is supposed to take away from your appetite.  However, it might be the side effects of the other meds that I'm on or I might need a lower dose of wellbutrin.  Other than that, no complaints.

Finally just said &quot;ENOUGH&quot; and stopped it all -- the drugs, the counselling, seeing the psychiatrist.  Nothing has helped, I've gotten no better over the years.  No major side effects other than morning nausea/vomiting, didn't do a thing in my attempt to quit smoking.  It's all a waste of time and money.

This is the second time I have used Wellbutrin.  My side affects after 3 weeks are blurred vision, shakiness, and worsened anxiety but I expect these to dissapear after a few more weeks.  It is already helping my libido and weight gain.  Give it at least 6 weeks to see if the side effects to wear off.

Depression	11tml, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	5/11/2008 9:00:02 PM	After years of struggling with it, I finally saw a psychiatrist 6 months ago and was diagnosed with major clinical depression and panic disorder.  I was put on Lexapro, and have been at a dosage of 20mg for the last 5 months.  I've felt pretty great on Lexapro, and took Clonozepam for about a month and a half to get over my panic disorder.  Over these past six months, I have had very little trouble with panic, nothing more than low level anxiety, which was easily knocked out with a Clonozepam.  Zero panic attacks though (after having them about 20 times a day).  About two weeks ago, I began to feel &quot;down&quot; again, as school came to a close, and life was about to change.  I consulted my doctor, and he placed me on Welbutrin.  150mg for a week, and then up to 300mg.  I started taking this 9 days ago, and have had more issues with anxiety and panic in those few days than in the last 6 months.  This medication should NOT be given to patients with panic/anxiety issues.  I'm calling my psychiatrist tomorrow and getting off of this stuff.

I think my dose is way too high.  Webmd says only 150mg a dose, so why do they make and prescribe 300mg doses?  
Depressed Mood Disorder Occurring Every Year at the Same Time	24yroldmale,  Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		4/25/2008 1:18:46 AM	I have been taking wellbutrin sr 150 mg for 3 months. I love that there are only a few side effects. I felt like i had ADHD, bipolar disorder more often than i liked, but mainly seasonal depression. (I sound a lot worse mentally when i type this lol, so be it) Anyway, all of those symptoms are gone, i can concentrate on the task at hand, im interested in more activities, and i have an overall great satisfaction of well-being.  Excellent prescription.
Depression	sissylou71, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/23/2008 4:29:49 PM	I started taking Wellbutrin about 2 months ago for depression and it has definately helped me.  I was DESPERATE to keep my marriage intact and to be a better mother. I walked around sad all the time with no desire or motivation for no reason at all. I also seemed angry all the time. At first, I was a little nauseus and a tiny bit dizzy, but the thing that I noticed most was that I was restless at night and my mind RACED and I could NOT shut it down! I didn't sleep much the 1st few nights so the pharamcist reduced my dosage to 150mg per day instead of 300mg (SR, not XL) and I could sleep again, felt less dizzy and less nauseus as the days went by until eventually I felt normal except for the dry mouth that I have 24/7. Recently I noticed after 2 months that it seemed to wane just a little and I felt some anxiety again. I asked the pharmacist about increasing my dosage. He put me on 200 mg per day about 3 days ago and WHAM! The nuaseusness hit full force today and I threw up and felt so dizzy that the room continued to spin and I could not function. I have been drinking a lot of water to flush it out of my system and I feel better now. He is now going to let me try 200mg per day in 2 doses 12 hours apart instead of just one big 200 mg dose all at one time.(I weigh less than 120 lbs so it was a bit much for me) Be patient, if you are taking it for less than a month, stay with it for a little longer, the side effects went away for me. My family members do not know that I am trying this. I noticed that I am much more relaxed and less obsessive about stupid little things and I think more clearly, have more energy, and am a bit more patient with my kids. It helped me to realize how today is important and to enjoy what I have now because  life is too short! I still feel anxious at times, but not like I used to be! Also, I am not so negative all the time and critical about others. I hope that it continues to work for me!I wrote a lot in hopes of helping others.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/23/2008 1:03:09 PM	My doctor prescribed wellbutrin for my horrible PMS symptoms. Also, because I am a smoker. It has helped my moods tremendously. I still get a little moody around the time of my period, but not nearly as bad as before. Although, I was not prescribed wellbutrin for smoking, it has also helped with cravings. I still like to smoke, but I do not smoke as much and I never crave a cigarette. Overall, I am very happy with wellbutrin. I do not feel as stressed as I used to be and I have a lot less anxiety than before. The only annoying side effect is dry mouth.

Other	Nan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	4/19/2008 5:16:30 PM	I've taken Zoloft (low dose) for six years but  very unhappy with the sexual side effects.  Was switched to Wellbutrin (low dose) 10 days ago and am experiencing the worst generalized severe rash I've ever seen (and I'm a pediatric RN).  Too soon to tell if the med will control my anxiety/depression, but despite the prednisone, antihistamine and calamine, I'm ready to quit.  Also think my MD should have advised me to &quot;taper&quot; from Zoloft before beginning Wellbutrin.  Anyone experience a horrible, all-over body rash from Wellbutrin?  Will the rash continue as long as I'm on the med or gradually disappear?  Thanks.  jakenancy9@verizon.net
Depression	Achey, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/16/2008 10:24:31 PM	***EXTREMELY IMPORTANT*** If you are using this drug in conjunction with Imipramine you should have your blood levels checked. Taking Wellbutrin together with Imipramine, the Wellbutrin has some kind of a reaction that does not allow the Liver to properly metabolize the Imipramine.  This happend to me.  I presented with all kinds of Neurological symptoms, but actually had VERY HIGH BLOOD LEVELS of imipramine even though my dosage had remained unchanged for over a year.  There is some actual medical research available to back this up, however, until recently this has not been a problem because these two drugs are not often prescribed together.

I attend meetings on a regular basis but i always had horrible anxiety and felt less than the other people in the meetings even though most of them had been where i had been. I didn't feel a part of and my self esteem was horrible. I use to feel like i wanted to jump out of my skin when i was asked to read something out loud. I have been on wellbutrin for about 3 weeks and tonight i went to a meeting and felt and handled it alot better. My mind wasn't racing and i could concentrate. My anxiety was still there but not as bad I didn't mentally beat myself up today at all. It feels great i hope nothing changes. Although i am going to try effexor for my anxiety and see if that helps. I almost feel guilty for feeling this good. gl

I am hoping it won't be hard to ease off the meds so I can have a baby. I am in my 30's and my libido is gone.

However, it has not caused any weight gain.  In fact, I've lost 20 pounds that I gained on other antidepressants. Also, it  has the complete opposite effect on my libido than other antidepressants.  It actually enhances my sex drive.

Mostly inattentive. Jittery for about 4 months. It buys me that extra second I need to keep from putting my foot in my mouth.   I wanted to try this as I detest the crash of the mainline ADD drugs. DR. also tells me there should be less of the dosage creep of adderal, etc.  On 300 MG and happy as a clam. It also cured my cold sleeping. Went from 5&quot; of covers in July (GA) to sheet and single blanket. A very unexpected bonus and worth the price of admission alone.  It does not do a lot for racing thoughts. It seems to give me the patience to put up with them. It does allow me to stop and remember where I put things. As a result, I can function much better out in my shop. (Less time looking for tools.) As a teacher it helps me handle the paperwork.   It won't solve all the ADD issues, but it is buying me time to ge back on track. ADD diagnosed age 8, 53 now. No drugs for last 32 years. Only script I take. Death of wife/ADD Coach knocked me out of sync. I am quite happy with things for now.

Years of cognitive therapy was not effective at all. Within weeks of beginning what was considered a sub-therapeutic dose of 100mg per day, I (and my family) saw a dramatic improvement in mood control. I now take 300mg-XL once per day, for several years, and it has completely changed my life, my family's, and help save my marriage.

It counteracts the negative sexual and tired effects of lexapro, which I take 10 mg of.  I think Wellbutrin is best as a supplement to an SSRI, especially if you have anxiety issues.  I tried it alone and started getting panic attacks again.  Also, wellbutrin gives me back sex drive and energy...I feel it complements lexapro nicely, and they have worked together for about a year for me for depression and anxiety.

Stop Smoking	Smoke free 2008, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/3/2008 5:10:43 AM	Prescribed for smoking cessation, and have been smoke-free (after 22 years) for almost one week, without severe cravings (100 mg x 3/daily). I have a previous history of GAD/SAD, and it does make me feel more agitated (not anxious--but more short-fused temper-wise), but has removed the feeling of &quot;self-consciousness&quot; associated with SAD. Cannot sleep in one stretch either--sleep is broken up in two 3-4 hour cycles. Overall, the long-term benefits of Wellbutrin/Zyban for smoking cessation outweigh the short-term risks. I'd rather deal with lack of sleep and agitation now, rather than dealing with COPD, emphysema or lung cancer in the future!

Depression	msp, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/28/2007 9:35:36 PM	I've been on this med for three weeks now, and it's already helped me.  I am sleeping on a normal schedule, I'm less panicky and obsessive, and am having fewer depressive thoughts.  I feel like it's given me my life back.  Previously, I had taken Zoloft, which made me feel spaced-out and took away my libido.  Wellbutrin has helped with my depression without taking away any of the good stuff.I've had some side effects-- nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and restlessness/aggression/sleeplessness for the first few days, but it wasn't anything I couldn't live with, and most of it has passed by now.Of course, no one med is perfect for everyone, but this one seems to be working for me.

Depression	sakura_aoki, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	13-18	12/21/2007 2:23:38 AM	I just started wellbutrin about a week and a half ago. I had issues with Lexapro because it made me sleep almost 20 hours one night a week. So far I do notice a loss of appetite, and nice as that is, I have to make sure at the end of each day that i have had enough to eat. This may have to do with taking concerta which also lowers appetite. I really don't feel jittery or anything. It defainetly gets my oversleeping under control and is great so far. I got sick during this time so it  is possible that some symptoms i had were related or lexapro withdrawal. These were headache, loss of consciousness (but i have low blood pressure), nausea, and ears popping. I don't know much else yet but so far it is working. It also has made me not need to smoke (which is great because i really shouldn't). It could be depression but i also feel like i am either over or under emotional. Don't know but it is better than oversleeping. I would take pretty much anything over that.

I started taking Lexapro because I lost the only 2 members of my family in 2005 in a matter of a week and Lexapro worked GREAT!  I was never sick or anything on it, but now that I've been on Wellbutrin for the past 4 weeks I've noticed that I get headaches, nausea and I get light headed quite a bit.  Is this normal?  Meaning does my body just have to get used to the new pill?  I have noticed a slight decrease in appetite which I love!  Other than the few symptoms I listed above it's great.  Can anyone give me some advice on what to do?  Do I keep taking Wellbutrin for my system to adjust to it or go back to the Lexapro.  Any suggestions would be great!!

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	12/9/2007 8:20:06 PM	I have struggled with depression my whole life and I am not 34. I have been one-and-off meds since 2000. In April 2007 I went back on the meds again. This time it was Zoloft, which made me feel terrific when it kicked in, but I gradually needed more and more until I (at 110 lbs) was at the maximum dosage of 200mg generic Zoloft (sertraline) by September 2007. So my psychiatrist added Wellbutrin, which seemed to help. Honestly, as someone who actually works as a license adolescent therapist and has a lot of experience with my own and treating depression.... the cycle never ends. You spend your whole life switching meds, gradually going off the meds, changing meds, and starting meds over. The best thing you can do is read a lot of books about depression and figure out what contributes to your depression. For me, I grew up with an alcoholic parents and basically walked on egg shells. You never knew if you'd be yanked out of bed by your hair in the middle of the night to wash dishes, you could never have a friend over and no matter what you did it was wrong. Research shows this actually interferes with your brain development and contributes to depression. Today, I have a busy career and I have to monitor how much I take on or I get angry and obsessive along with the depression. I can also say you need to marry someone who understands depression and is NOT depressed themselves. The spouse needs to be supportive and you need to have rules. One of our rules is that my husband will never walk away from me (because it sends me into a depressive rage). My husband also realizes that sometimes I say mean and nasty things to him that I would never say if I weren't having a depressive angry moment. It's hard. We have a toddler and my husband is an at home dad. We love our daughter and want her to have a parents at home, but it can't be me with my depression. My husband being at home help lessen my depression because it's less home-management for me. shannan2008@yahoo.com

Wellbutrin has worked very well, but recently I've had to increase my dose because its effects were waning.  I still would recommend this drug - especially in conjunction with therapy.
Depression	lmc, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/18/2007 7:05:57 PM	Wellbutrin has been a great medication for me.  Decreased my anxiety, increased my attention span, and no more &quot;blues.&quot;  Prior to Wellbutrin was taking Cellexa - happy to get rid of it.  Severe sexual side effect, and made me very sleepy.

But I still feel depressed alot and sad. So I guess in the 6 weeks that I have been taking it that it has helped in many ways. But has not truly taken away my depression. I stopped smoking completly and have not smoked since beginning wellbutrin...funny that I did not want to stop smoking but it made me not even think about smoking and I smoked for 6 years ! 
Depression	vrun, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	11/14/2007 10:13:09 PM	I started taking only 150mg..and seemed more depressed.  My doctor increased my dosage to 300mg and I felt much better.  However, I was challenged recalling details in mid-sentence. Overall it affected my short term memory.  I thought I could manage because it was only obvious to me.  But, after about 6 months on it, I realized it was not worth it.
Stop Smoking	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	1	1	Female	19-24	11/10/2007 11:13:51 PM	Doctor prescribed 300 mg.  Experiencing dilusions, cannt focus or make decisions, walking around aimlessly, can't drive.  Seeing patterns, clenching teeth. Not good.

Depression	goofy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	11/8/2007 2:39:23 PM	I am taking Wellbutrin 300mg XL for depression. I tried Celexa and Paxil, but the sexual side effects were awful.  I tired Effexor and it created severe nausea and vomiting.  The problem I have with Wellbutrin is the feeling like throwing up, nauseau, and sometimes throwing up.  This only occurs in the evening.  It feels like morning sickness in the evening without being pregnant.  Does anyone have any suggestions of how to deal with the unpleasant side effects or how to minimze/eliminate them?
Depression	Lids, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/8/2007 5:50:59 AM	I tried Paxil and the sexual side effects were unbearable. I've been taking 300mg of Wellbutrin XL daily and couldnt be more satisfied with the results. I am less depressed, my obsessive thoughts have dramatically subsided and I have a better outlook on life. My wife is also ecstatic about the changes this drug has brought about in my mood and demeanor.

Bipolar Depression	tycat17,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		11/5/2007 10:54:08 PM	This medication was an absolute nightmare for after the first month I was having suicidal thoughts, severe agitation, horrifying nightmares of being stabbed by knives, it was so awfull that I hardly slept at night and I could hardly concentrate and nothing seemed to work when I tried to focus on other things to block the horrifying nightmares and images that plagued my mind even in daytime hours. I complained to my physchiatrist about my symptoms seeming much worse on this med but she'd just smile and tell me to challenge these things and it was not the wellbutrin. I complained for 2 months. then one day I flipped out at work and began screaming like a lunatic at a co worker and then I pushed her. Needless to say 3 weeks later I was Fired! My glorious career and hard earned respect as a top assistant manager went down in a huge firey blaze. the night I was fired from work, I was considering suicide fortunately I called a friend for help. when I went to the Dr. the next day and told her what happened she refused to take me off the medication. so my mother and I told her off and I refused to take the stuff anymore. I was much better a week after I went off the med. I'd like to sue the makers of wellbutrin!!! Any side effects MAKE YOUR DOCTOR LISTEN!!!!

Bipolar Depression	jane59, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/21/2007 1:23:02 PM	Within three days of taking this medication I was experiencing a full Substance-Induced psychosis. I was very anxious, irrational, agitated, had audio and visual hallucinations, irritable, hostile, impulsive and was severely fidgety.  This medication runs this risk, but as said, the benefits outweigh the side effects.  However, in a case like mine, this medication just is not an option for me.
Bipolar Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/19/2007 8:46:38 PM	I find that Wellbutrin in the a.m. thwarts any symptoms of depressoin throughout my entire day.

Wellbutrin made me hostile and mean.  It was awful and I yelled at my kids all the time over nothing.

I am proud of those that can take this. I was on this drug and let me tell you.. I started seeing flying black dogs and people walking through walls. First sign of weird sightings, call your doctor.
Depression	KWH, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/29/2007 9:24:28 AM	I had been taking Zoloft for depression without effect.  I began taking Wellbutrin SR and within a day I was feeling great.  My wife commented that &quot;I have my old husband back.&quot;
Stop Smoking		5	5	5			9/26/2007 1:48:23 PM	I was able to stop smoking withing four weeks of taking the drug.  It suppresses appetite, so weight gain has not been an issue.  I have not craved a cigarette since I quit!

After several months of trying it, my physician switched me to Zoloft, which worked better with my body chemistry. However, I do know of others who have been helped a great deal by Wellbutrin.
Depression	Taximan, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/25/2007 11:46:33 AM	Wellbutrin worked for me on the very 1st day I took it. It totally alleviated my depression until I suffered a death in the family. But before that it made me so happy that people thought I was high. I also like that it gives me a boost of energy. I didn't need much at 1st, only 75 mg a day. Now I take 150mg SR. I only use it on days I need to be active. That's another good thing about it. I can use it as needed. I did try Wellbutrin XL and found them to NOT work. So if you try the XL tabs and it doesn't work, try the SR tabs before you give up.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	9/19/2007 7:26:08 PM	I take 3 doses of this daily.  Not good for someone with ADD.  That means that most days I only take 2 of the three!  I have had side effects such as dry mouth which has been pretty severe.  I have also had an aweful taste in my mouth - like a metallic taste.  The dry mouth has been the most inconvenient because by the end of the day, I have little voice left.  I get canker sores on my tongue because of the dry mouth as well.

Depression	SweetLatina30, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/19/2007 7:21:03 AM	Wellbutrin gave me my life back. I had been seeing a therapist for months before I told my real doctor about my depression and he gave me a prescription. I just found myself more confused by therapy, but Wellbutrin allowed me to think clear again. I never needed therapy again. Just make sure you withdraw from it slowly. Itried to just stop and it was hard. When I slowly reduced the dose I was able to get off it okay. My sister took Paxil and stayed hooked on it. It also killed her sex drive and caused her divorce. Her husband cheated on her. I didn't have any problems like that with Wellbutrin and I lost 18 pounds! God bless the people who invented this stuff.
