Emptying of the Bowel	evelyn,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female		7/25/2012 1:09:47 PM	I developed a severe headache within two hours of starting this drug. It was not a migraine or due to dehydration. I kept myself hydrated knowing it was imperative to do so. In addition, I began having muscle spasms in my legs, back and neck. I also had severe dizziness. The headache lasted for two days after my procedure and the pain was a 9 on a scale of one to 10. Nothing helped the headache, including medicine given me at the procedure nor prescription meds my dr. prescribed. The muscled spasms continued for another four-five days. I was left weak for an entire week following the use of this med and had intermittent dizziness. I looked back at the ingredients of the prep and the flavor packet which was lemon. The flavor packet included maltodextrin and natural flavors. These two ingredients contain gluten. I am gluten intolerant. I realized then that I'd had an allergic reaction to the contents of the flavor packet. I was shocked that my dr. prescribed this particular prep. I was also shocked that the product didn't state that it contained gluten. As a general rule I don't eat things that are not labeled gluten-free. However, this being a prescribed drug and my dr. knowing I have an allergy to gluten, I trusted that it was OK. I will never use this product again. I suggest that the manufacturer indicate that it contains ingredients known to cause problems for gluten-sensitive people. Better still, why not try to use flavoring packets that are gluten-free?

All of this idea of it's so much better is not true!

I had chills &amp; a severe headache by the time I went in for my colonoscopy, It's taken me 4 days to recover from dehydration, chills, vomitting, and my headache.  I will never take Golytely  again.

It's much less expensive than the pills, you drink about the same massive amounts of fluid either way and the supposed bad taste was easily overcome with a little crystal light.  Was back to normal immediately after the procedure.  I ate a light breakfast the morning before the procedure (which occured the next morning at around 9 am)and fasted until starting the Golytely around 6 pm.  Was cleaned out by bed time and slept normally that night.  Overall, not as bad a situation as I expected, this being my first colonoscopy.

I was throwing up green half way through the &quot;jug&quot; of stuff.  :o(   Other than that, it was alright.  Now I need to take the stuff again and wondering if I can mix it with Gateraid or Powerade instead of water. And yeah, it is a little better if it's cold.

He has had to have an NG tube a few times to use this medicine. It's horrible, but it definately works. Saved his life a couple of times. For people with chronic bowel and/or constipation problems, I recommend Amitiza. My son has been on it for over a year and has not required any more clean-outs.

Emptying of the Bowel	Ijustwantpeace,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female		7/23/2009 1:31:10 AM	I really needed help going to the bathroom. I am only 35. Nothing seemed to work, stool softeners, laxatives, eating more fiber, nothing. My doctor took an X-ray and found that I was severely &quot;stopped up&quot;. I have never been this stopped up in my life. Now I think that it would have been better to have stayed stopped up than go through he nightmare that is called GoLytely. First of all, there is nothing &quot;lyte&quot; or light about it. It is the strongest laxative known to man. It does not make you have regular BM's, Oh no, it gives you liquid poo instead, and LOTS OF IT! It was pretty much like peeing poo. It did clean out my bowels, but now I am experiencing extreme gassiness and cramping in my stomach that is not allowing me to sleep. I keep on eating, thinking I might be hungry, but I think it is only making it worse. I can't leave the house because I might poo in my pants while just checking the mail! My stomach is gurgling at this very moment and you can actually hear it from 10 feet away and see the flesh ripple. I took this concoction at 10:00 A.M. and it is now 12:00 at night and I am not able to sleep due to the discomfort I am experiencing. I think next time, although I pray to God that there is NOT a next time, but if there is because God is cursing me, I will try every other avenue before taking this medicine. I will even try an enema, an operation, committing myself to a convent and praying to God to release me from constipation. Am I being overly dramatic? If you have been extremely constipated and have gone through the torture that is called Golytly , you will think not. THE END.

It inflamed by upper respiratory which caused tremendous pain from shoulder to shoulder.  The severe pain went away but I had shortness of breath for the next three days.

First time for a bowel resectioning and this time for not having a BM in 11 days at 5 1/2 months pregnant.  Does have a terrible taste; however, that is the only truely negative thing about this medicine.

The tumor was almost completely blocking her colon.  When she had the colonoscopy which found the tumor the doctor was not even able to get the scope through the opening.About an hour after starting to drink the vile stuff my wife became violently ill.  She vomited repeatedly and became almost delirious.  I called 911 and she was taken by ambulance to a hospital.A couple days later as I was getting ready to throw out the remains of the GoLYTELY I found and peeled off a very well disguised &quot;package insert&quot;.  It said that &quot;GoLYTELY is contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction&quot;.I really question why she was told to use that product and why the product did not display the peel off tag with it's warning more clearly.  My wife had used GoLYTELY before her colonoscopy and while it made her nauseous she did not vomit or have the extreme reaction she did before the surgery.Emergency staff seemed to think the difference was because the blockage had become even worse since the colonoscopy and because of dehydration since my wife by that time had been on a liquid only diet for about three weeks.Under normal conditions it is probably an acceptable product.  But DO NOT USE IT if you know or have reason to believe you have an obstructed colon!

I drank 8 ozs every 15 minutes for the first hour.  It started working within 30 minutes. I was feeling very full after the first hour so I started drinking 8 ozs every 30 minutes until I had finished 10 glasses by 10:00PM. This medication worked very well for me. I was up about every 20 minutes until 1:00AM. Then it slowed down to about once an hour. The colonoscopy was at 8:30AM. Doctor said everything looked great.  The worst part about the Golytely is the taste. I used a flavor packet and it did help a little.

I was diagnosed with colon cancer last year and believe me this medication is NOTHING compared to chemotherapy.  Yes its horrible but compared to the alternative of more surgery and more chemotherapy......I will glady drink this once a year.

Unlike the explanation given on this site, liquid stools began in less than 10 minutes from first inbibing this foul liquid. It continued regularly as quickly as I could ingest it.  Supposedly it is possible that one will eventually see &quot;clear&quot; stools. My own experience was painful in the abdomen, and severely orangey yellow liquid. YUCK!!!
