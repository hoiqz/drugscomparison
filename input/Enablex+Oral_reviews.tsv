Frequent Urination	Stashiywtfv, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male		8/7/2012 8:21:20 AM	I took this drug for one week and had to go to the emergency room because I was in severe pain from not being able to go at all. Almost a quart of urine was still in my bladder. The doctor put in a catheter but I was admitted for 2 days because my kidney tests wer too high. I was not able to go after the catheter came out. This drug has really made my life worse. I would rather go often than have to live with this catheter.

Needing to Urinate Immediately	Maggieb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	7/28/2012 4:31:29 PM	I took this drug for 1 day and my mouth was so dry it was impossible to stay on it. I was more focused on my dry mouth than anything else. Water,sugar-free candy did not help. The next morning I woke up with the skin on my lips peeling fom the extreme dryness. I won't take it again. The side effect definitely rules this drug out for me.

Urologist said it would take two to three weeks for it to take the full effect.  I want it to work sooner, I don't have the patience to be pissing every 5 mintues.

It completely changed my life. No more Depends or trip planning based on bathroom availability. This stuff has totally improved my quality of life.
Overactive Bladder	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	6/1/2012 1:47:00 PM	I took Enablex several years ago. It worked and I did not feel dried out. Then I decided to stop and see if I still needed it. For two years I was doing fine. Then the urinary urgency returned. I had one unsed bottle left. I took it for 90 days. Then I tried to refill it. My insurance company (now different) refused to refill it!! So I am on my second trial of generic drugs which are more drying for me. I am a singer and it peeves me that I can't take what worked for me. As far as constipation concerns..I had this problem anyway but I find that sprinkling flax on my cereal turned me in to a &quot;regular&quot; person! I know that all drugs don't work for all people bur I liked enablex and I am peeved my insurance company won't pay for it now.

Is helping somewhat, but my eyes have gotten so dry that my contacts are sticking to my eyes and had a HARD time getting them out! And it really does dry my mouth out also. Guess will have to decide if these side effects are not as objectionable as the urinary problems...

Currently have a terrible UTI where most given meds aren't helping. My doctor told me to stop taking and I have constant cramping, aching in pelvic, bladder area. She believes my bladder isn't emptying fully. I am 56 yo female nurse and have had 2 UTIs in my life, up until now. The leaking has started again (but could be from UIT), and my back hurts so bad, I have been in bed 3 days. My urine is foul smelling, like ammonia! I guess I will be doing Kegels!

Frequent Urination	averageguy60, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	4/29/2011 10:40:06 AM	I scanned all the reviews. So here is the result. Based on the data presented here by people who have taken, and are taking this medicine, apparently this drug works better, and with less negative side effects on male individuals than females. I am leaning toward this idea, that most likely the makers of this drug had male problems on their mind than females. Don't you think so?

He takes this in the am to help control leaking. He has no bladder control and actual has an AMS 800 implant. He takes meds at night so he can pee in the am and this so he can control himslef at school. He can not void at all, just dribbles and and is having back pain. Also, can see some behavior change but not as bad as detrol. We are going to discontinue.

I take it 2 hrs before bedtime and stop all liquids before that. I still get up several times a night to pee and must pee before I do anything where a bathroom is not available or I need to stay in the room or car.It doesn't work well for everyone and I'm one of those people.

I am a 56 year old bodybuilder and during the competitive season I drink over a gallon of water a day, I know this contributes to the frequency of bathroom trips, but it's something that I have been doing since I was 14. I'm thinking I'm not sure if I should be taking this drug. Other than that I feel great.

Been on this one for about 1 1/2 yr. Worked good at first, but gradually problem has returned. Did kegals faithfully and feedback.  Now having to consider surgery (Interstim Therapy) with the little stimulator for the sacral nerve.  Medication caused extreme dry mouth which in turn make me drink more and have to urinate more.

Vesicare made me feel zonked, so I am trying Enablex, which may have the same complaint.  Vesicare is definitely more effective for controlling my urinary symptoms.  I think both cause me reflux if not taken with a substantial snack.  I think both casue drowsiness, so I take it at night.  Constipation is a serious problem with these drugs.  I take a stool softener, and that is not enough help.

I am taking the 7.5 MG pills and hoping to ask my doctor to give me the next dosage up from this. I have never been constipated while taking Enablex. Dry mouth is a side effect with most medicines and that is the only one I have gotten. I have been on several others and this one almost does the job perfectly. Concerts, Movies and trips to the mall can still be a bit of a hassle but this makes it a bit easier. Wish I could be back to perfect with out it though.

As it prevented me to take less trips to the restroom, the side effects were too much for me. It seemed to dry me out alot, my throat, nose, and I think even my ears. Now I am having problems with my ears. While I was on the med, my wax would harden extremely. Then I stopped the drug and now my ears will not stop draining. My Fam. Pract Doc said there is no infection. I am going back to see if its related as a side effect from the drug or not? Also seemed like I had weight gain. I will not take this drug again.

Overactive Bladder	You Too?, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	7/5/2009 10:09:42 AM	I just started taking Enablex 1 1/2 weeks ago.  For many years I have been on lots of anticholinergics... Ditropan XL, Detrol LA, and Vesicare.  I liked vesicare but my vision was VERY blurry and stopped after a few months.  With Enablex I got SOOOO CONSTIPATED after just 1 week and didn't even realize it was a problem until one morning I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital to void.  Worst yet, I'm getting large HIVES on various parts of my body.  They have a yellow center and are very itchy.  Some have lasted one week now, with new ones developing daily.  Is this from the Enablex???  I can't think of anything else I have changed in my routine.  It must be.  When I looked it up on webMd it said a side effect was 'Giant Hives' but they were rare and listed them as serious.  My next step is to stop taking it and see if they go away.  Anybody else having hives with Enablex?  They look like giant bug bites.

It has stopped most if not all of my leaks.  I have developed a UTI from it once and believe that it is giving me pain near my kidneys.  I want to go off of it, but I am scared of the leaks coming back.

I have been taking it for about 8 months now, but Enablex seems not to be working as well.  I am taking an anti-inflammatory drug called Mobic.  I would like to know if it is the cause.

Needing to Urinate Immediately	BHP, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	2	4	2	Male	45-54	12/30/2008 10:21:04 AM	I had biopsy in February due to uncontrolable painful and urination urges.In August I was put on Detrol LA light dosage,it did not work,more pains and every 35-1 hour, especially at night,I had to go.It took me more than 10 minutes to sit on toilet and have a few drips out.Too painful all the times.One month passed,I had more constipation,dried mouth-throat,too tired with blurry vision,and not counting pain and trips to toilet room during the day.I quit going out or shopping because of prolnlem.Tehn in September 2008,my physician switched my med to Enablex 7.5 mg to see if pain reduced and flow-frequency worked.None,the same effects and I have been up and off to toilet room hourly.I stopped for a few days,I felt at ease and less trip to toilet room.It appears I have bladder ulcer now.Pain remains but to lesser degree. My other physician suggested I stopped this drug altogether and use Flomax plus Udamin SP dose.I feel a bit better now.Hopefully I can return to my usual daily activity without looking over my shoulder where's the toilet room at.

I never had to use the bathroom at night and now i get up 2-3 times. I have also expirenced weight gain, and the smell of my urine is so stong.  I have never tried anything else, I had bladder reconstruction surgery and am worse then I was before it. My bladder also spasm's where I think the sling is to tight. But when I have the urge to go, there is no holding it. Every single time I get chilled, I have to go.  I can walk outside for 30 seconds and walk back in, void, walk back outside and have to void again. Thing is there isn't anything left.  It's like dry heaves after a really bad drunk. My back and Kidneys hurt all the time. I am at a loss as to what to do at this point... let me know if you have any idea's.

Urine Leakage When there is a Strong Desire to Void	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	55-64	12/8/2008 6:00:30 PM	I have been on 7.5 mg Enablex for 3 weeks now due to overactive bladder.  I would  get up hourly at night to empty my bladder and sometimes wet my bed or myself;  the daytime was not much better, with frequency and leakage.  Initially with Enablex, my bladder would be very full before I had the urge to void and I could sleep for 4-5 hours before waking...and no accidents.  I did have the dry mouth but it was worth it.In the last few days, I feel the old symptoms creeping back...was up 4 times last night.  My Dr. has upped the dosage to 15 mg and asked me to consult a urologist, which I am hoping will resolve the issue.In addition to dry mouth, I also find my skin and hair are dryer. I am experiencing mild constipation but have been able to increase fiber to address that, so it's no big deal.
Overactive Bladder	llmccal, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	65-74	12/1/2008 10:28:43 AM	I am a 68 year-old male that had prostate cancer surgery four years ago. Some cancer cells remained so I had 33 radiation treatments earlier this year and now have a zero PSA. I have been on 15 mg. Enablex dosage before bedtime for two years to treat frequent urination during day and night. I have had none of the serious side effects mentioned in other experiences and have had significant relief. My only complaint is that I have had a few occasions of significant leakage during the night. I do get up 1-2 times per night if I feel any degree of bladder urgency.  I would recommend that individuals with similar symptons give Enablex a try.

After problem with not making it to br on time, started on Enablex 15 mg.   After two years, I asked if there was a smaller dose that I could take and two months ago, dr reduced to 7.5 mg   It still is very effective and I can live with the side effects!

Although, my body seems to get used to it and it isn't as effective.  My urologist told me to stop taking it for 3-4 weeks, then start over as my body will 'reset' itself. Have been on it for almost 1 1/2 years....I still have to urinate ALL the time!

The urologist told me and my dad this was the first time he seen this reaction to this drug. But I must let people know what happened to my dad. It gave him Parkinson's symptoms: weight loss, confusion, stone face, walking slowly, quiet talk, and having  writing difficulties. He has now been taken off of this medication and all the symptoms of Parkinson's has gone away. Thank God for the Neurologist seeing the drug reaction.

Flu like, upset stomach (never have upset stomach before)   Joint pains in right leg and dry mouth.  I have stopped taking the pills and will add more after I see if these were caused by the pills

Should not be prescribed for oab as the more constipated you are the more incontinent you become according to the urology literature.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/11/2008 9:43:45 AM	I have been taking 15mg for approx two years now, and seem to have some relief of symptoms of over active bladder. The cramping has stopped, however, I have had considerable weight gain (about 50lbs since starting the medication), dry mouth, memory loss, depression and fatigue.  I dont seem to know I need to empty my bladder until its to the point where I am busting at the seams, then its urgent and some leakage may happen. I have also had to have a pelvic sling to help with the issue. Im starting to wonder if this medication is worth it. Last time I spoke with my urologist, she said to keep taking the medication and did not wish to change it.  Wondering what the risks are if I were to discontinue on my own.

But I still have the urgency to go and when I try to very little comes out. I hope that it will work better for me as time goes on. But I think I would prefer to have surgery done!!
Overactive Bladder	Monica, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	6/18/2008 5:42:07 PM	I used this medication for about a month.  It caused me to have SEVERE CONSTIPATION.  I told my doctor about this.  He said that Enablex was originally created for IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and not for Overactive Bladder or Incontinence. Enablex was originally a Pfizer Drug, which also has Detrol LA.  Pfizer decided to get rid of it because they didn't feel comfortable selling it for Incontinence.  As for controlling my incotinence, it didnt work for me.  My doctor put me on Vesicare 5mg and I have improved dramatically.  Vesicare works very well without the constipation.  
Overactive Bladder	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	5/23/2008 1:39:59 PM	This medication works great early in the day.  But seems to wear off by the late afternoon.  Even though I am taking the 15 mg. dose. Side effects are minimum.
Frequent Urination	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	5/1/2008 8:58:14 PM	my doctor just informed me that since I have a family history of alztheimers/demensia, i should not take this medication as it affects cognitive functions.  as a result, i am no longer taking it.  be careful if you are having memory problems, losing a word, etc.
Overactive Bladder	Adam, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	4/15/2008 2:16:52 PM	I was having consistant urinary infections. Near the end, I started having the feelings to pee all the time and was negative for a urinary infection. I started off on a perscription Detrol LA. It helped, but I could not empty my bladder fully, I was needing to go every 30 minutes, and I felt I had to go instantly under stress and the feeling would not go away. Bad for work. I went to a specialist and I was put on 15 mg Enablex. It worked wonders after a week or two. I could last through 2 hour meetings. The feelings go away most of the time. I can last one hour under normal conditions and I don't have to go to the bathroom at night. There are cons. One, your bladder is not perfect. You need to go premtive before major events. You have to control you amount of liquid consumption. I only drink about 32oz a day and only from 5-8 pm during week days. Thank God for hard candy. There are minor side effects for me. Constipation about once or twice a month for two hours or so. Also, dry eyes wich can be fixed with visine. I have been doubling my dose for events such as concerts or major events in my life. I usually have constipation because of this, but it is better than feeling like you need to go or have to go multiple times when you are wanting/needing to be there. I recommend it. I just wish I was back to normal with the pill. I feel like I am 80-85% back to normal with the help of this pill.

However, I am having issues relative to urgent need to urniate (sometimes wetting myself) and not getting enough relief over a 24 hour time period. I have considered taking the medication twice in a 24 hour period and asking my DR about a higher mg...if there is one...Has anyone, who have had similar issue tried varying the routine of usage..i.e. taking it at night or taking more than 1 pill in a 24 hour time period.
Overactive Bladder	spinal cord injured, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	10/22/2007 11:03:34 AM	I have been using 15mg Enablex for two weeks for a neurogenic bladder due to T-12 spinal cord injury. I had been on 15 mg oxybutynin xl that worked great but gave me very dry mouth so I wanted to try another drug that might not have this symptom. On Enablex, I have had lots of strong bladder spasms and feeling of bladder fulless, increasing  frequency to void, and three incidents of wetting myself due to not getting to the bathroom on time. After being on the drug for five days I thought I had a urinary infection, went to the doc and that was ruled out by a urinalysis and culture. It was suggested to give Enablex two weeks to work. At this point I see no improvement in my symptoms.

Once or twice I was eating a muffin or bread product early in the morning and I had difficulty swallowing.  it was almost like I had no saliva to wash it down and it stuck to the back of my tongue.  Also, I have developed a rash on the back of my arms.  I am checking to see if it is related to the medication.  Aside from these issues, I have had wonderful results from the medication.
