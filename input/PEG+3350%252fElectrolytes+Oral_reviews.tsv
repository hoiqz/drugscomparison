Emptying of the Bowel	Carrot Top, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	45-54	1/22/2012 11:47:06 PM	I experiencec bloating and nausea from the start.  During the process, I also experienced vomiting and had to slow down the process to every 10 minute process to 20-30 minutes.  That worked well so I will keep that in mind for the next time.After the colonscopy procedure, the doctor report iritation in my colon.  My lab work prior to the procedure showed normal labs - or remission for my Ulcerative colitis.  Now I have a flareup and need to take prednisone in addition to my UC medications.  I encourage anyone who has experienced a flareup after use of PEG3350/ electrolytes Oral for a colonscopy preparation to al rate this treatment.

Emptying of the Bowel	Livingstone, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Male	55-64	7/29/2010 3:17:14 PM	The first few glassfuls were easy, but then it got difficult to keep drinking... tasted awful until I added a few drops of stevia, then it just tasted bad. To make it worse, my stomach bloated, making it even harder to drink. And I'm a 6 foot 200 pound man! I think it'd be really difficult for a lighter individual.

Could only take half before I vomited it and could not keep it down. Took HOURS to work. I was up all night and almost missed my appointment. Start this in the morning or early afternoon. DO NOT WAIT until late afternoon/evening. It takes hours (4-6 or more to start working).
