Birth Control	rubyred, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	8/2/2012 1:46:23 PM	The most noticeable side effect that my husband I have noticed is the lack of intimacy by my part. I just seem to be missing those hormones. Also the mood swings, they are terrible. 
Birth Control	AKstudent, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	7/29/2012 6:11:23 PM	The first 3 months using this bc, I had a problem with irregular periods and acne break outs. These were both symptoms the doctor forewarned me about. Although the irregular periods were a pain...including only spotting one month to 1 1/2 week periods another month. I think about the 4th month of having implanon I had a mild-regular period for a month straight (which may have also been due to stress I was having), then nothing at all since. Not even spotting. I never had any weight gain or problem losing weight with the implanon despite the objections of my roommate who doesn't exercise or eat particularly healthy. Overall, I'm satisfied as a person who could never remember to take bc regularly every day and had weight gain and mood problems with other oral contraceptives.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	7/18/2012 11:11:32 AM	I have had Implanon for nearly a year and didn't have much trouble to begin with but the longer I had it the more issues I had. I've gained 15lbs or so, even though I lead a much healthier lifestyle than when I first got it. I also have issues with spotting almost daily and severe mood swings -- both things I've never experienced before. Every person is different, but for me it hasn't been a great experience. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	7/16/2012 6:07:10 PM	I just got my implant removed after having it in for two years. It's great that you don't have to remember to take anything and it was effective in preventing a pregnancy, but the bleeding is terrible. My periods were heavy, like a new tampon EVERY hour. Each period I had lasted a month, sometimes longer. I have developed anemia, possibly from the blood loss as well. When I had the implant removed today, my doctor told me that my skin had actually grown around the implant and it took 30 minutes to remove. I doubt this is how a normal experience with implanon is, but it didn't work for me...

I used to get periods so bad that I couldn't even get out of bed. I had surgery to lessen the bleeding but that didn't woek. Then I got the implanon. I love it.I didn't get my period for 3 years. I just had the old one taken out and another one put in. I couldn't ask for better results 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	7/11/2012 11:57:36 PM	Do not get the Implanon! Had no idea the side effects of Progesterone which is the hormone is the implant. I have gained 30 pounds literally, I bleed 20 to 23 days of each month, and now have major odor issues. I also had major problems with acne (all over my body) and increased PMS symptoms initially when the Implanon was inserted. I was told the first few months I would notice some changes, but after 4 I began calling my clinic because I knew something was wrong. I finally got someone to return my calls 6 months later, and they said I should have the implant removed immediately. The convenience was nice, but the horrible side effects were not worth it. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	13-18	6/29/2012 1:04:27 PM	I first got Implanon in March of 09. I was looking for a long term contraceptive that didn't involve me having to remember taking a pill everyday. When I came across this contraceptive I was thrilled because it seemed almost perfect. The insertion was very fast and almost painless, however I had a bruise on the insertion site and have a tiny scar but that's very minor and nothing to stress over. My periods were wonderful, something I never thouggt I'd say, I would go a month without one but when I got it it was just spotting that would last from 1-4 days. Also, I had no weight gain, if anything I lost weight. After my 3 years were up, I was so satisfied with it that I had it inserted the same day it was removed in March and let me tell you it seems to be working even better than it did the first time.

Birth Control	NoteingButTheTruth, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	6/18/2012 12:37:02 AM	I have had my Implanon since January and weighed 133 pounds on the day of insertion, as of today I weigh 150 pounds for a total weight gain of nearly 20 pounds in less than six months. In addition to that, I'll miss a period for a month, get it the next month out of nowhere and because there is no regularity EVERY time I go to the doctor complaining of any aches/pains that may even loosely be similar to that of pregnancy, I'm tested. No problems with acne while on this BC, but I am not happy with the weight gain at all. I'd almost rather be pregnant! At least THEN I'd have a reason for not being able to wear anything other than leggings. Mind you, this birth control doesn't just make you gain weight on its own, it does this by increasing your appetite. I am NOT kidding you, I have eaten 2-3 servings at dinner (more than 200 lb husband), and I'll be hungry again two hours later. I'm making an appointment to get this Implanon taken out ASAP. Wouldn't recommend this to even my worst enemy.

Birth Control	ForensicPsyDr14, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/12/2012 6:14:49 AM	I was a bit concerned about the effectiveness of this birth control because of my weight. Im 5'7 and was 250lbs when I had my Implanon inserted. I know from previous experience and pregnancy that being heavier reduces the effectiveness of birth control. Well that is not the case with Implanon. I've had it going on 2 years and have never even had a pregnancy scare. In face my periods stopped all together and have been gone since I had it inserted!! I've Ihly had light spotting twice in all the time I've had it in. The only drawback to this birth control is the weight gain. Within the first year I was up to 277 :-( thankfully I realized the problem and got the weight off (and a little more than i started with) but putting on that much weight in such a short time is scary. I'm quite sure my already poor diet and exercise habits played a role, but the amount of fatigue you experience the first few months after insertion surely don't help. As for the whole implant itself. Going in wasn't that bad as the local anesthesia numbs you up pretty good, but you will have a nasty bruise for about a week at the point of insertion. Once in your arm you barely notice anything there as it is not visible at all and you only feel it if you search for it (no one else will be able to feal it if they happen to touch your arm). Knowing what I know now, I definitely see myself getting another one when it's time to take this one out.

I do not bleed and have not since I got the stick inserted. I did bruise really bad and I have a tiny scar where it was inserted but it's been worth it for me. I am about to graduate college with a 2 year old and have no more kids because I got this. Maybe it is because I got it about 3.5 months after I had my baby instead of the normal 6 weeks but I have not had the bleeding issues. I was not skinny before but I cannot seem to lose the baby weight, that may or may not be drug related though.
Birth Control	Evie1234, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	5/4/2012 10:04:04 AM	Worst birth control I've ever used! Extremely long and frequent periods (I bled for more than 60 days), caused severe acne, and made me irritable, nervous, and excessively hormonal. Insertion was not bad, but during the removal it broke in half and it took the doctor 30 minutes of prodding me with a scalpel to remove it. I absolutely hated it. It also gave me bad cramps and very unpredictable periods. I used it for 11 months before having it removed and replaced with the Paragard IUD, which is 1000 times better! Implanon prevented pregnancy, but made me miserable. There are better options that are worth reviewing before decided on the implanon. I warn against it and tell everyone I know that it is not a good choice!
Birth Control	implanonisbad, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/2/2012 3:12:14 PM	I'm getting this removed next week because it has changed my life so much in such a negative way. Ever since I've had Implanon, I'm tired ALL the time, I've been depressed and so angry, and I'm not like that at all. I get my period every week, and that's if it even stops from the week before. I didn't gain weight or anything like that, but pyschologically it has screwed me up so much.  I never used to cry before, but I have the urge to cry all the time now.It is taking a toll on my relationship and that's not worth it to me. It does what it is supposed to, but after getting it in, I have no sex drive, so what's the point of birth control?!I do not reccomend this to anyone.

Now (18m in ) I feel like I am pregnant and going through menopause all at once. I am having it removed due to all the issues I have had. This is the worst experience with birth control I have had, so bad I opted to get tubal done. I recommend everyone to stay far away from this drug!
Birth Control	Sheila, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	4/26/2012 7:58:59 AM	I had it inserted 6 months ago. I stopped getting my period since then. I dont have mood sings etc. but I've gained weight since and I cant seem to shake it off. On top of that, I notice visible cellulites and water retention and I feel bloated everywhere. This has definitely affected my self-esteem, especially when I'm very particular about my appearance and weight. I'm thinking of having it removed, but I do like not getting my period. However, I don't feel it's worth the weight gain etc. to be honest.

I had zero bleeding or periods the whole 3 years, no mood swings, no side effects at all.  The removal was a more painful that I would have liked, but well worth it.  I guess I'm one of the lucky ones, I had an excellent experience with implanon.

It just reconfirmed my decision to have it removed!! I have had the Implanon since August 2011. I too had crazy mood swings then they went away, then a week after having it put in the bleeding started. I figured it was my regular period. Ha! WRONG!! Never in my life has my period lasted 5 months. I then went back to have it removed and the Dr. told me to take 600mg of Ibuprofen 3X a day. She wouldn't remove it for me until I kept it in for at least 6 months. I left in tears! I refused to take that amount of ibuprofen. I just stuck of the bleeding, it finally stopped for one week. After than on week, it started again! And hasn't stopped since! Not to mention the insane amount of pimples and blackheads that appeared. I have never had oily skin! I also have accrued back acne which again has never happened!! I Absolutely hate this thing!! I'm also 23, 5'10&quot; and was a size 2-4. Now I'm back in my size 6 clothes. Its a drastic change!! I too though this would be amazing to have! IT IS A NIGHTMARE!!!!! And I would really like my money back at this point for the million packages of tampons!!!
Birth Control	adelaid723, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/28/2012 9:58:49 AM	I am 14 month in on my second insertioon of the implonon. The first time i had it put in i had the 3 week periods for about 6 months and was able to make it through and had no other side effects. After having my son i had it inserted again 6 weeks after i gave birth. Since i have had 3 week periods, bad cramps, stress, no sex drive aniexty and my doctor has me on prozac for depression. I have an appoitment with my gyno monday to talk about getting my tubes tied cuase i really cant handle the side effects and i really dont think i should be on prozac just cause of birth control. I think it is a great concept and nice to not worry about a pill everyday! But ifthey could work out the bumps and side effects it would be great! I think that doctors should tell you all the side effects before inserting this drug! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/21/2012 8:42:44 PM	I just short of being on this a year. I had it removed today because of the excessive bleeding (bleeding every 2 weeks) and mood swings from the hormones.  I almost feel like I was lied to when I was talking about it w my doc bc I asked why people don't like it and the ridiculous amounts of bleeding was never brought up. ASK YOUR DOCTOR whats the most complained about aspect of this drug and why they take it out most often before you decide
Birth Control	hstabbert, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	3/20/2012 4:04:03 PM	Hey everyone, I posted an angry review earlier and I just wanted to tell you all that I had my Implant removed and ALL of my problems have gone away. My confidence is back to normal. My skin has DRASTICALLY healed within two weeks. I am finally stress and tension free. My sex drive is back to awesomeness. My energy level is high and I am once again productive. If your having problems PLEASE just go get it taken out. Looking back at the last year and a half makes me realize all the issues it caused me. Mental and physical. If your estrogen levels are normal don't get on this. I only think it works for women who have extra high estrogen levels.

I'm moody, sometimes angry, most of the time anxious, NOOOO ZERO 000 sex drive. I've lost a dramatic amount of weight. Acne everywhere and the worst part is even when I use products such as Proactive they seem to work and then the acne comes right back or never leaves to begin with. I feel like this birth control has absolutely turned me into an opposite person compared to who I used to be.  
Birth Control	ClemonsJamie , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/15/2012 7:35:53 PM	So far Ive had no problems. I went 7years every month sick as a DOG! hydrated,  not eating 7days because of my period.. I we went pill after pill, took it daily at the same time daily. Nope not a thing worked. I went onto the depo shot in nov. HAHAHA sorry that shot is A JOKE! I got put on the implanon Feb 10th, and just LOVE IT! My Doc put it before my period to hopefuly let it help, well since then no bleeding at all(: ((which IM SUPPER HAPPY ABOUT)) I had it in, no bruising after(thankfuly) but I dont regret it one bit! I know it takes few months to fully work, but its working wonders for me, because the depo shot wore off about 7weeks after I had it and mideol doesnt work well at all.. Ive had no weight gain, mood swings, acne.. anything like that.

Boy was I wrong, It is effective but the side effects from it were out of control. Mood swings, Heavy periods for 5-7 days every 2 weeks, cramping horribly, lower back pain, sore breast, anxiety attacks, depression, acne like I have never had before and a large amount of weight gain despite all my efforts to keep it off. I hate it I am absolutely the most miserable I have ever been. I can't wait to get this removed next week I am so over it!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	2/29/2012 4:56:38 PM	I got this over a year ago. I thought it would be nice not take a pill every day. I had irregular bleeding for months. I gave it a few months thinking my body would adjust to it. I started to gain weight faster than ever before. I gained over twenty pounds in a year. I had never gain weight in my before except during my pregnancy with my daughter. I lost the weight soon after. I found myself moodier than ever before after a few months of using implanon. The bleeding continued and I rarely had a day when I stopped. After a year of dealing with this I could not take it anymore and had it removed a two months ago. I am on the pill again. I fill better and I am loosing weight. My doctor told me he had not had a patient tell him they had gained that much weight before using implannon. I found that hard to believe. I am not a complainer very often and he made me fill like I was lying. I would never use this again.

About 2 weeks after I had the implant placed I started breaking out with cystic acne on my neck, jawline, chest and shoulders.  Then I began to notice my anxiety going through the roof, my sex drive taking a nosedive and vaginal dryness.  None of this is normal for me.  Then I started bleeding huge blood clots on Feb. 10, 2012 and it is showing no signs of letting up.  I cramp and I'm tired all the time.  I seriously wish I had read the reviews on here before I got the implant.I got this because my OB-GYN said it was &quot;more natural&quot; and low in hormones and wouldn't raise my blood pressure the way some BC pills can.  Well, I'm here to tell you there isn't anything &quot;natural&quot; about this drug.  I'm getting it removed and getting an IUD placed.  I want my sex drive back, this bleeding to stop and rid of these pimples darnit!
Birth Control	hstabbert, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	2/26/2012 12:50:15 PM	I am in my early twenties and have always had clear skin. After getting this put in my arm I have never regretted anything more. Before having the implanon implanted, I had started taking fluoxotine, and Adderall. My skin problems have been so bad that I've been on antibiotics a handful of times and its turned into a never ending hormonal acne story. I've given up going to my expensive dermatologist. Given up taking antibiotics and now am dealing with the worst ingrown hairs of my life...( caused by the progesterone that makes you grow hair on your FACE! Which results in clogging pores and I'm blonde and Prussian? So noticeable hair on my face, is a lot of freaking hair!)I had BEAUTIFUL skin and was envied all throughout high school and now at twenty years old have permanent cystic acne scars all over my face,chest,PUBIC area, butt, arms,and thighs! It makes me angry just typing this review. Looking back at the past year and a half I wish i would have just gone on the pill. The money i thought I was saving just went towards tampons because my period will last 2 months straight and 1 week off. Also I have spent hundreds of dollars on blood work because I have become highly anemic and potassium deficient. Everytime my doctor says I'm getting better,SURPRISE! comes my period and I have to start over again. I can sleep fourteen to eighteen hours at a time. I feel weak constantly! I no longer have the motivation to work out or do anything physical. Also remember I HAVE 97.9 above average level ADHD! ? That.is.NOT.normal. I have had no sex drive from the start of the implant and I am a very passionate person when in a monogamous relationship. Its made my hormones so bad that I I have too much progesterone and minimal estrogen. It causes Anxiety through the roof! And i was already on prozac! SO: If you suffer from anxiety or had childhood acne DONT GET IMPLANON. Especially if your twenty or so. I'm getting it removed asap, I would have earlier if i had realized.
Birth Control	ready_for_it_2B_OUT, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/24/2012 2:46:33 PM	I am a year into having my second implanon put in, and I'm currently trying to find a doctor to take it out! I am so ready for this thing to be gone. The only good thing about this birth control, is the fact that I haven't got pregnant ( which could have happened several times). Which is obviously the point of it, but I can no longer deal with the side effects. The first implanon I had, I had my period for the first 3 months straight, and then it would be gone for a month or two, and then I'll get it for about 2-3 weeks at a time. I have learned to overcome that, but since I've had the second one put it, I have gained 20-30 lbs. in a 3 month span, and I haven't changed my eating habits, or anything. Since I got on the implanon, my emotions have gone crazy! I never noticed it, until this past year, I just assumed it was just me, but I have never been this emotional, I find myself crying over silly stuff and then find myself saying I don't know why I'm crying when my husband asks. It's not only driving him crazy, but me as well. Also, my sex-drive is completely gone. I feel like I could go the rest of my life without sex, of course I don't want to, but when it comes down to it, I could care less about it. I honestly, feel like I have been pregnant for the past four years, without actually being pregnant, and getting a baby out of it. So, if you feel like you're body can overcome these issues, or you can deal with the side effects, its an amazing BIRTH CONTROL, but not hormone control. I am thankful for not getting pregnant, but not for everything else.

Birth Control	Unhappy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	2/16/2012 10:41:28 AM	I previously used the Depo shot as a form of BC, I had no problems at all with it. I wanted something that would last longer, and was told that the Implanon was similar. For the first year it wasnt to bad, I did gain about 45lbs, get really bad achne, lose my sex drive and spot. Now it is 16 months and I have been bleeding for a solid month. I am going to wait it out alittle longer to see if this gets better. I will admit it is easy by not having to remember a pill and I haven't got pregnant. 
Birth Control	kelkel28509, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/10/2012 7:28:15 PM	I answered in the effectiveness category 5 stars, because I have had no desire whatsoever to have sex, and I used to be the once a day type of person.  As far as the insertion, it was very easy, therefore the ease of use is effortless.  As far as satisfaction goes, I have been miserable, crampy, bloated, and bleeding.  I had it inserted in September, and I since  November, I can count the numbers of days I WASN'T bleeding versus the days that I was.  I am planning to have it taken out in the near future. I just can't handle this anymore!
Birth Control	ladymeowmeow, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/22/2012 8:06:16 PM	I have had my implanon for 3 months. Insertion was easy, only slight discomfort and bruising that went away within a week. I have basically had all of the symptoms you hear about. Mood swings, nausea, cramping. I have spotted for about three weeks of the 3 months I have had it (spread out for about 4-5 days at a time)In fact I have basically felt pregnant the whole time but have taken pregnancy tests that are negative. Overall the worst symptom has been the mood swings, sometimes I feel depressed or anxious, but these feelings go away and in fact I feel that the longer I have had the implanon the milder the side effects get. i AM HORRIBLE  at remembering to take pills, and I had a way worse experience with the depo shot (weight gain and horrible hormones!) this is easy and even though I am having negative side effects they are all relatively mild and are not enough to make me want to take it out yet. Also I have just had a baby so some of my symptoms may be post postpartum related. One last thing, my doctor was very thorough when putting it in and advised me that most side effects and bleeding stops after the three month mark. I think she is right as I am starting to feel more adjusted to it already. So my advice is to give it a try and stick it out until the three month mark and then make your decision, all birth controls take some time to get used to. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	12/14/2011 2:31:27 AM	I had my Implanon removed today. I had it exactly one year because I felt like I had to give it a chance. At first I though that the problems I was having were because of switching birth control, but they continued. I was on Depo provera before and hadn't had a period in 5 years, and started getting light periods, then the slowly progressed and became longer. I have now been bleeding since early august and it's mid dec. It occasionally hurt in my arm too. It would sting and itch. Removal was terrible (insertion wasn't bad) I had scar tissue build around it and it took 25 minutes of cutting and scraping to get it out and now i can barely lift my arm. I wish I had never changed. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/11/2011 7:40:36 PM	Its easy to take, because all you have to do is have your Dr put it in your arm. The only down side I can see is that I have constant headaches since on it. And my breast hurt more when I get my period. Other then that, no compliants.
Birth Control	horrible_1, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	12/1/2011 8:13:10 PM	I have not had a great experience what so ever with this type of BC. I got put in in March of 2010. the insertion was very easy and not painful. for the first year the only side effects was bleeding none stop and I got a lot of facial hair which can really lower your self-esteem and I felt more hungry. the second year still having a lot of heavy bleeding and as a result I am now anemic. now I am suffering from anxiety I have chest pains and mood swings and the arm. I have it on seems to feel numb at times. oh and my joints hurt. it has done its job because I haven't gotten pregnant. I really want it taken it out I just need the money for it. I have had a horrible experience with it but it doesn't mean its going to be the same for every women.

The majority of people using Implanon are happy so they don't bother to leave reviews online! I didn't get Implanon for years because of the negative reviews and now I wish I had talked to my doctor more and read fewer reviews. I have had my implant for 6 months now. I have no periods and no spotting and it has lifted a weight off my mind that was always there when I was on the pill. There is no possible human error once you have had the stick implanted. The implantation process was scary but not painful at all, and my arm was sore for 2 weeks or so after, but now I don't even notice it.The only side effect I have noticed is a slight decrease in my sex drive and a decrease in lubrication when I do have sex. But my sex drive has always been higher than my partner's, so he is actually happy about that! If you are a student or are going to live overseas or just don't want the day to day worry about taking a pill, I highly recommend Implanon. At least have a conversation with your doctor about it. I wish I hadn't waited so long!

At first it was great. I LOVED IT! light periods,no cramps and no worry if i took my pill or not. It was too good to be true. Yeah it really is too good to be true. After about a year in i started bleeding and havnt STOPPED! it rediculous!!!!! I hate it. All the bleeding has made me anemic and tired and feeling drained all the time..my sister is lucky though she got it and has had no periods and no side effects. ugh. i guess it works for just certain people.  I cant wait to get it removed and go back on the pill. Good luck to anyone who tried this.

Birth Control	CC, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	10/25/2011 1:02:57 AM	It's extremely effective and easy but it made my periods longer and they weren't any lighter than before. I would bleed for months straight and I gained weight. I went to get it removed but then they had me take birth control pills along with the Implanon to control my periods and I gained even more weight so now I'm planning to completely switch to another method.
Birth Control	secret, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/24/2011 2:21:27 PM	I absolutely love this! I have been using it since April 2011 and since then I have had 2 periods. I have had slight weight gain and bloating. I will take these side effects for the relief of knowing that I am not going to get pregnant.
Other	lovelylady, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/22/2011 9:01:48 PM	I have been using the implanon for 8 months now, at first i had a period for 3 months but then it stopped.I had no pain, my moods regulated a small scar similar to a pimple scar from the insertion. No acne... no issues its been wonderful!
Birth Control	chelsi15, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1		19-24	10/17/2011 7:02:50 PM	About a week after getting this birth control i started suffering from severe anxiety and depression, headaches bleeding, feeling very out of it and not myself at all. I have 2 children under 2 and felt like i couldnt take care of them. I also got high pressure while on this. My anxiety and depression is so bad the only thing i look forward to is going to bed at night. I began to think something was very wrong with me like a brain tumor, I have never been so scared in my life, Its a horrible feeling and i just want it to go away, I had it removed a few days ago and am feeling a little better but still not myself, my advice to anyone considering this is to do your research first. This was the worst decision i have made, i was fine until getting this birth control. Hopefully ill return to my normal self again soon. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/11/2011 12:47:01 AM	So far this form of birth control has been the best I have used. Since having implanon implanted I have had no cramping, spotting, or periods. My doctor warned me about bruising but it was not at all as bad as she had described. Overall I would recommend this form of birth control to anyone.

I talked to my doctor and they told me I need to get it out asap due to the birthcontrol making me so ill... unfortunately, you have to have a specialized nurse to remove it and it is extremely extremely hard to have it removed (going on 2 months of trying to find a dr/nurse to remove it)
Birth Control	kb, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/2/2011 2:35:08 AM	Can someone say amazing!!! So far, this is the best control I have ever used. I was on the pill and had horrible symptoms like spotting and weight gain. I had implanon inserted the second day of my cycle, by that night my cycle ended 3 days earlier. Later, that month I spotted for a week and a half and after that nothing!!! I will recommend this bc to everyone. I admit I was scared because of the bad reviews but I tried it and its working great for me.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	9/28/2011 7:43:36 AM	I've had Implanon for about 4 months and I got it removed today because the side effects were the ABSOLOUTE WORST I've had in 15 years of using different birth control methods.  In 4 months, I gained about 15 pounds, was hungry and moody WAAAY more than usual, had back pain/cramps almost continuously for a month.  Worst of all, I bled almost every day from August 18 through today, Sept 28.  Many days, I had clots--this was not just &quot;some minor spotting.&quot;  This effected my energy level and mood tremendously. On a scale of 10, my sex drive went from 9 to 2. I'm a newlywed, and my poor husband! Of course I didn't get pregnant--we're not having sex more than once a week. I got implanon against the advice of my college roommate, who is a doctor, and my sister, who is a nurse--I should have listened to them!! I was willing to try Implanon because the Army gave it to me for free, and they promised that I would have no problems getting it removed, even in Germany.  Well, once we got to Germany, there was no one at our post's clinic who could remove it.  I had to fight with the doctors and drive to another clinic to get it removed--that process took over a month while I was bleeding almost every day (this is why I gave it a 1 for &quot;ease of use&quot;--it's not easy to use if you can't stop it when you want to!).  The doctor who removed it told me that he's had to remove a lot of Implanons lately.

It was working perfect for me till I started not feeling like myself. Depression,Tiredness,and bleeding very very bad for almost 2 months. I figured out why i was bleeding it was caused by stress. So with the depression i was having and how much blood i lost my obgyn put me on lexpro for my depression(which I dont take anymore, it makes it worse) and iron pills. It all worked for a couple of months then it all came back AGAIN! No offense to anyone that likes it, I HATE IT WITH A PASSON!! im getting it tooken out this week sometime. It cant get out of me fast enough. I have a 2 year old and he is wild and funny, but me im just like (yeah yeah yeah whatever). That's not me. Im a funny person to hang out with and this implanon doesnt want me to have sex at all. My husband gets mad at me cause i say NO all the time. I cant help it. Thats also why im getting it out. So yea, It works on not getting pregnant, but the side effects SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!

Birth Control	Jen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/17/2011 3:20:14 PM	Doctor warned me that perhaps I would have occaisonal spotting and cramps, possibly enough to want removal. THis must really depend on the individual, because 2 days after getting it, my period has stopped now completely for several months. BRILLIANT!!!! And ease of use? Are you kidding, what use!?? I forget about it all the time-- and it's more effective than the pill because you can't forget to take it!!! Even the injection was a breeze and I felt NO THING

The first year was ok but now I am bleeding clots that are the size of a dime. Cramps are so bad, I swear I am having back labor. I have cysts and now I am on TWO birth control meds until I can get this thing out of my arm. I would NEVER use it agian. I would tell anyone to stay away form it. I have 3 friends that have it and all were like how I was the first year was great and now its the worst thing ever. I have not felt this way since I gave birth with NO pain meds.

I wason the pill before the implanon and thats why my kid was born premature Don't take the pill!!!.Anyways since i been using the implanon i onle get my period like once every 3 months and it only last like 5 or 7 days and not heavy at all. I been getting weight but not as much everybody says. This is a good birth control method if you hate to take pills and shots.
Birth Control	Mrsam, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	7/2/2011 10:00:27 AM	The insertion didnt hurt, i was numbed well. It's great that I dont have to take it everyday and its very effective. My periods are unpredicatble, my calender is all over the place. I knew not to expect normal periods though. I have spotting to a period every other week and I can spot for a week or have a period for about 8 or 9 dyas. A normal period for me is 5-7 days.It really varies on Implanon. I had depo and didnt gain weight or have any periods, and only spotted in the first couple months. Alot of gals are saying the bad smell is not a side effect AND YES IT IS especially when you are adding hormones to your body. I have the bad smell at the begining of my spotting/periods and it is very uncomfy and embarrassing. I am a very clean woman about hygeine and I have been to the doc several times and they never find any std or infection its just those dang hormones! I have been very moody and I can fell it happening. I cry and curse my husband out at the same time. I have never been this emotional and all over the place. No weight gain for me. I have got alot of headachs too. I have been on Implanon for 2 yrs &amp; 7 mnths. This year has been the worst of it for me. Im not sure if I am going to make it to Jan. We may have a child after this and for bc I'll go back to seasonique or try Mirena

IM GETTING IT REMOVED VERY SOON. I wouldnt recommend this to any woman.

I used the pill for years and due to the fact that I am over 35 and smoke, this was my only option.  I love it!  I stopped taking the pill about 4 years ago and started having the worst periods of my life.  With Implanon, I haven't had a period in about 10 months.
Birth Control	anonymous, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	6/26/2011 1:25:51 PM	HATE HATE HATE. SOOO much bleeding I was borderline anemic. Periods lasting longer than a month and only a week apart. I bleed more days than not. Depression swings. Weight gain. Lower sex drive. Acne. I got all of the bad side affects! I even occasionally have loss of feeling in the arm the implant is in. SCARY! The only good thing is being able to forget about it. The only reason I don't take it out is because it cost $1000! And I can't stand the pill. They say many women quit having their period after the first year. I am less than a month away from the one year mark and have no signs of my period stopping and there is no way I am going to make it any longer with this stupid thing in my arm. Biggest regret EVER! Don't just trust your doctor's opinion. I was told it would be fantastic. When I was showing signs of anemia I went to a new doctor and he recommended removing it and said he never would have recommended it to me in the first place. He said so many people regret getting it. Including me!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	6/23/2011 11:45:04 AM	I got Implanon August 2008 so it is time for me to get it taken out in a couple of months. The stomach cramps and irregular periods was awful at first but got better over time so now I have regualar periods. It only last 3 years so I am getting something else just because I want something to last longer, I am looking into an IUD that last 10 years. Over all the Implanon worked for me bc I never got pregnant!:)

My period started one week later and haven't stopped bleeding since then. I started to having strong headaches and I feel so tired all the time that I couldn't even wake up at night to feed my baby. The sex got so painful because of dryness and no oral sex because of bleeding! I tried to reach my doc. but every time i leave message to nurse they wouldn't call me back. It was a such a waste of money, since insur. doesn't cover! I payed $650 cash and to removed would be another $150. Such a fast and easy money to doc. who didn't even told me anything close to what I'm experiencing since, I was so frustrated... Thanks to somebody who recommended the website www.plannedparenthood.org to get it removed for free because of my low income. Thanks again! Sorry for my accent

My periods were awful at first but did get better. My complaints started a few months after i got it, I find that when looking at the side effects I have ALL of them. This includes some of the more serious ones. When I can afford my co-pay its coming out, wether I have to rip it out or not..
Birth Control	Beth, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	5/29/2011 1:19:19 PM	I had Implanon inserted in January 2009 and had it removed in March of 2011. I had no problems until I had the Lap Band surgery in October 2007. After losing about 50 lbs, I started bleeding constantly. Prior to the Lap Band surgery, I had some light spotting for about 14 days every 3-6 months.I will never use this again for one reason, though. It took my OBGYN over an hour of digging and cutting to remove the Implanon from my arm. It was very painful, and there were many complications that followed. I am finally healed (with a really dark scar on my arm that's about an inch long and 1/4 inch thick), and am not planning on using any birth control in the near future.
Birth Control	katkm, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/23/2011 1:31:50 PM	I love the implanon. I decided I wanted to try out a birth-control that would last and was worth it. I had it inserted in June 2008, So I'm just a month away to have it removed and have another one inserted. I haven't had any problems with it. No heavy bleeding like others, I can honestly say that I have had my period 5 times within these 3 years of use and each period would last about 7-8 days which that is not a problem to me. At the ends of this 3 year cycle  
Birth Control	PreciousA,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female		5/23/2011 2:35:02 AM	Ok i have been on the Implanon for going on 3 years, and let me tell you it does work but my periods are nuts! I will have one for 3 months and then it will skip like a couple weeks ,then im back on it for another 2 to 3 months. Yeah i havent got pregnant because there is never anytime to have sex what so ever. My opinion I want it out im so tired of bleeding forever. Because then I loose alot of blood then I get really tired alot. Thats the only down fall for this thing.

Like most girls I have been reading about I have been bleeding for 90% of those 6 months. I wish I would have read all of these comments before I had it placed. The first month I loved it. I had no bleeding or spotting made me feel great. Then it all went down hill from there. I have now been spotting for 2 months streight. Think twice before you get this placed. Try everything first I would never get it again.

I have been on this birth control for 3 years it is now time for me to have it removed. Although I didnt get pregnant these 3 years, I did have a lot of uncomfortable days. I maybe had 2 days out of each month that I wouldn't bleed. Then I remember one time out of the 3 years that I didnt bleed for 2-3 days. Please make sure that if you do get this birth contol that you have insurance because when it's time to have it removed, you will have to have insurance to do so. Also, I found myself having crazzzzzzy mood swings. PLEASE DO NOT GET IMPLANON PLEASSSSSSSSSE!!!
Birth Control	youngwoman, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	5/11/2011 11:08:04 AM	Ive had Implanon for almost a year now, and its had its good and bad points.  First, in terms of pregnancy prevention, it has excelled (without a condom).  But for the first 6 months, I had TWO DAYS without some form of bleeding (I am NOT exaggerating).  The only good thing about that time was that when it did come time for my &quot;normal period&quot;, there were zero side effects - no cramps, no mood swings, nothing.  During the next 5 months, I could sometimes go a week without bleeding, maybe 1-2 days here and there....but for the most part, I bled almost every day.  My private parts grew sensitive to pads from having one on every day, and so now I can only wear a pad one day before bad things start happening.  Now, I have to alternate between a pad and a tampon every other day.  I did experience a small amount of weight gain and moodiness, but nothing else major.  It did make my periods go away in the sense that I couldnt tell one bleeding day from the next (i.e. no typical symptoms of a period).  My boyfriend hates it because the bleeding really turns him off when we get physical (even though it allows him the greatest satisfaction).  Overall, it has definitely done its job as pregnancy prevention, but the nearly-constant bleeding is really making things go downhill, so I am having it removed today.

At first, I became overly moody to the point that I was placed on an antidepressant.  From the beginning, I had spotting; however, in the recent months it has gotten worse.  I now have a period for 3 weeks, then a week off ( a real pain when trying to schedule a pap smear).   My doctor has offered to put me on estrogen in order to combat the bleeding; however, being on the double dose of hormones (implanon and the antidepressant), I have decided to live with the spotting.

I'm bleeding more often than not, have gained at least 15 lbs and my skin looks like s**t. I am stuck with this piece of crap in my arm because I currently have no health insurance- good luck convincing a midwife at PP to remove one of these. I thought this would be cheaper than the pill because of not having insurance, but the money I'm saving on the pill I'm spending on tampons. I have always had heavy irregular periods with bad cramping, and I never thought they could possibly be worse - until now.

I had 2 periods but the last one I had one spot of blood and a little bit of cramping. I used to have very painful periods so this is great for me. So far my ache has gotten better. I might be gaining some weight but I don't really keep track of it. This site really eased my fears cause not having a regular period is a little scary. But so thankful that I don't. Plus, no having to use condoms with my husband is wonderful. :) 
Birth Control	Kherron, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/8/2011 3:23:12 PM	I had my Implanon inserted October of 2010. The insertion site was a little sore but nothing to write home about and I can hardly even see the tiny scar now. I had just refilled my 3-month NuvaRing when I had this inserted, so I continued to use the NuvaRing to regulate the &quot;irregular&quot; bleeding (cleared it with my NP first). Had a regular period for the first three months (don't know if this was because I was using NuvaRing too, but doesn't matter to me, was regular either way). Since I stopped using my NuvaRing, I have had NO periods. That's 3 months now and counting. I have gained just a little weight, but it just encourages me to eat right anyway. Little exercise and the right diet and it has melted back off. Mood swings? Can't say I've noticed, my husband hasn't mentioned anything. Headaches? Sure, but I've always been prone to them. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone!
Birth Control	bubbles, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	4/5/2011 8:43:05 PM	I dont find this birth control method helpful at all i have been on it for 4 months and i have gained almost 80 pounds and also i have deperssion, since i have been using the implanon my depression has gotten alot worse and i dont like the way this birth control works.
Birth Control	kristen k,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		4/3/2011 5:14:39 PM	I am getting ready to have Implanon taken out since it has been 3 years and I have really enjoyed it.  It's been 100% effective.  I would say I had some spotting and had more regular periods the last couple months but without any major cramping and no weight gain.  My Dr did an ultrasound recently and did find some very small cysts on my uterus but it is unknown whether implanon is the cause or if they have been there.  I would recommend this to anyone who has trouble with taking a pill everyday or is looking for a &quot;long term&quot; bc method!
Birth Control	Shelby, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/1/2011 12:49:29 PM	Implanon has been very effective for me, no pregnancies, no periods. I have had it for almost three years now and am about to have my second one in Aug. I would definetley say it is better than the Pill or Depo shot. they both made me gain weight, but the implanon has put me back down to my usual 125.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	3/24/2011 3:52:06 PM	I have been using Implanon for almost 2 years.  It has been effective in the sense that I have not gotten pregnant on this birth control.  However, I constantly bleed after intercourse almost every time.  The bleeding will last from either 2 or 3 days to 2 or 3 weeks(and it is heavy most of the time).  It is really frusterating, and I have been working with a few different doctors reguarding this.  They all have said that they have seen these issues with other patients using the Implanon. I am pretty sure I will have the rod removed soon.  I would rather take a pill daily than be bleeding like this.

I've gained weight since starting birth control in general, but after getting implanon I am the heaviest I've ever been, and cannot lose the weight. My sex drive is severely low and my self esteem with sex is just as low, which is putting strain on my husband and I. I never really realized implanon might be the cause until recently, and I'm going to look into taking it out. Another thing I feel is important to mention is jaw pain. I've gone to the doctor twice and a dentist once and their only explanation is tmj. I'm not ruling it out, but this pain started relatively at the same time implanon was inserted (left unnoticed) and has gotten extremely worse over the past few months to where I cannot open my mouth that wide to take a bite of food or even yawn. My husband has been suffering with that too, for obvious reasons. About three weeks after insertion I had 2 straight weeks of bleeding, but no period or spotting since. This method is easy and convenient because I cannot remember pills, but I'm starting to evaluate if these seemingly minor side effects are worth it... Increase my weight, decrease wanting sex? No thanks.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	35-44	3/12/2011 4:06:56 PM	I've been on this birth control for 10 months &amp; it has been nightmare. Every time I have sex, I start bleeding again. Not to mention after being on it for 4 months I started to bleed heavily for 4 months straight, then it stopped for a one month; only to start bleeding again for the whole following month. I'm getting this thing outta my arm ASAP, which happens to be only 4 days from now.The most annoying side effect is when ever I have sex, I start bleeding again.It seems only when my partner does NOT ejaculate inside of me, only then I won't start to bleed again. Which is BS!Oh, &amp; when I started bleeding I had the most manic mood swings ever. So much so, that I went to the psych ward to be evaluated. And they increased my anti-depressants &amp; it still didn't help.So if u have acute mental illness, this isn't the drug for you. 
Birth Control		5	5	3			3/11/2011 8:11:08 PM	The implanon in my arm is bent. Since it has been bent I have not had my period. My doctor said that it being bent is ok. I have taken pregnanacy tests which have came back negative. So what is going on?
Birth Control	Rose, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	2/18/2011 8:26:52 PM	Well, I decided to use Implanon because I am not good with remembering to take pills. I have been using it for 1 1/2 yrs. It has been very effective but has side effects that annoy me at times. I get headaches and dizziness at times. My breasts sometimes ache and have gotten a little bigger. I have been moody at times and have problems sleeping. I have always had problems sleeping though. I really dont like that I have been on my cycle on and off for 2 1/2 months. I get off my cycle, I would have sex, and then I would bleed again and it hasnt stopped yet. The only good thing is that I know when it really stops, it should be gone for a couple of months ( I hope so). But the good thing is that it works well against getting pregnant.

Birth Control	kpc08, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	2/12/2011 3:30:53 AM	This seemed like a great option for me. I'm 20 yrs old. I dont want any kids for a while, I want to wait until me and my boyfriend are married. I had this implanted in October 2010. The first two months were OUTSTANDING! I had a period for like 2 days each month. No cramping. No weight gain. Well fast forward to Jan. 2011, I get my period just like any other normal one, It seems to go away after 3 days, uh NO! It's not Feb 11, 2011. I've been on and off my cycle for over a month. Me &amp; my boyfriend can never have sex because it seems like as soon as we want to, it starts back up. UGH! I wouldnt recommend this to ANYONE. unless you want to be miserable all the time. My sex drive hasn't lowered, I just cant sastify it because of the complications with my cycle. DO NOT GET IMPLANON!!!!
Birth Control	Jess1, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/26/2011 1:43:30 PM	I thought Implanon seemed like the best route of birthcontrol I could take. I'm 22, sexually active, and very fit.  The first 2 months were fantastic, no bleeding an no obligation of remembering to take my birthcontrol.  After the first two months it became unbareable.  I became pretty depressed and extremely angry.  I would suddenly get hit with 'fits of rage'. I would be working alone, minding my own buisness, and suddenly become so angry I would start slamming things around.  It got to the point where drinking became out of question because I would not be able to control my anger.  My family thought I was hiding a traumatic event because of the severe change in my temperment.  I'm in great shape and am proud of my efforts to stay fit and I even began hating my body and self image.  I consulted a doctor and she asked about my form of birthcontrol, I had never thought of that.  I decided to have it removed, even though I didn't think it could be the case.  I was desperate.  A month of so after having it removed I returned to normal.  The hormones were too much for me.  Good luck, but I would recommend this to no one.

Upon the insertion of the implant, I spotted for a couple of weeks, then my period completely disappeared. The only issues I really have with this drug is that it makes me have a weird smelling discharge, something unlike I've ever experienced. And also, lately the site of the implant has a developing rash that itches. My sex drive seemed fine, but then again, it's hard to recall.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/13/2011 2:38:57 PM	After insertion, my period was about a month long. Then it stopped altogether. The only side effects I had was hair loss (which grew back for the most part) and loss of libido. My arm was bruised for about 2 weeks. When I got it put in, I was 1 and 1/2 months postpartem. So, when I lost my baby weight, you could definately see it from under the skin. It left a tiny scar. I haven't had it removed, yet.
Birth Control	swordandbubbles2125, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/12/2011 10:57:08 AM	I've been married for 3 years, and I've been on Implanon for over 2 years, and have had an AWFUL time with it!! my periods are insane and horrible, often lasting a month or more, and usually back to back (only a few days in between periods) not to mention the spotting...I've been fighting depression, mood swings, irritability, nervousness...none of which are normal for me.  naturally, I'm a bubbly, happy, sweet person who rarely gets upset. now I tend to get annoyed easily, I get pessimistic and depressed for no reason, am prone to fits of crying for no reason, very irritable with my husband (which has been hard for both of us- luckily he's the most patient and the most understanding man in the world :-) lucky for me) and the mood swings are killer for us both.I'm tired all the time, very little sex drive, which is sooo not fun. I feel worn out no matter how much I sleep or what I do.  I can't take much caffeine, and I try not to eat too much sugar, since I've already gained so much weight from Implanon.I've gained 40 lbs that absolutely will NOT go away, no matter what I do, and I exercise a lot and eat very healthy.  I've had non-stop pregnancy symptoms, for 2+ years!! it's awful...pregnancy symptoms without actually getting a baby...so not what I want.Implanon has completely changed me, physically and mentally, into someone I can't stand, and I regret getting it at all. I'm getting off it soon, God willing.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	1/12/2011 2:21:54 AM	I have been on the implanon for 5 months. At first I was VERY excitied about getting the implanon. Ok the first month I started bleeding for like 2 weeks but I thought that was because I had just gotten it. My period went off for like 3 days. Then it came right back on. So I let that slide. So as the months went on I would have 2 LONG periods a month. Sometimes my period wont even go off. I am complaining and so is my husband! I am going to the doctor thursday and this will be getting removed. I highly DO NO recommend this to ANYONE! Maybe I should have stayed on my depo. Well good luck to the ones that love it and are not having any problems because I am going back to my DEPO. A birth control i know about!

At the time, it was the only thing the doc recommended since i can't take estrogen.  I never had a period except some random heavy bleeding around christmas both years.  I liked I didnt have to remember to take it or anything like that.  I really enjoyed it for about the first year, no real side effects.  After the first year though, my sex drive became non-existent and i barely wanted to be around my partner anymore at all.  Thats my biggest complaint, after having it taken out, all is back to normal.
Birth Control	in doubt, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	3	Female	35-44	12/25/2010 3:35:29 PM	I had the implanon inserted only 4 days ago. The insertion was easy and painless. The next two days however, I experienced a sharp pain in my arm as if the stick was sticking me.  I had limited mobility with the use of my arm but on day four it seemed to be better. When I removed the bandage, I appear to have a brusing on the skin. I am going to go back to the doctor for a follow up. I hope that the poking doesen't return and the brusing will go away. If so, I will give it a try for the first 3 years. I have yet to experience the bleeding, mood swings, weight gain and low libido. Right now, these are the least of my concerns. 
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female		12/23/2010 11:19:35 PM	getting the implanon was a terrible decision. at first i liked how easy it was, then the problems started coming. i now have cystic acne on my face and have seen several doctors about it and they said i have no hope of getting rid of it unless it the implant taken out. my relationships have worsened. my sex drive is nonexistent and it has affected my relationship with my husband. i have insomnia and lose sleep nightly. i have exhausted 24 7. it has been horrible. unfortunately it is close to christmas and i am having to wait until the first of the new year to get it removed. I do NOT recommend it to ANYONE.

After birth I got implanon. My period was all over the place, never knowing what to expect. My period wasnt predictable before so no huge change there. Most other symptoms expected I am not really sure if it is the birth control or my own growing body. I would say a slight weight gain and faster hair growth. My biggest complaint is my almost complete lack of sex drive. I guess you could call that effective birth control; if you arent having sex you wont get pregnant.   I am at the end of my three years and I do plan to get it again...this time I would like to really sit down with the doctor and try to figure out a dosage of hormonal pills along with this to try to up my sex drive. Even if it doesnt work I will most likely stay with Implanon.

I wish I would've known all the side effects. I've gained 20 or more lbs. I'm scared to weigh myself anymore. And it is hard to find anyone to remove it. no sex drive at all, tired, moody, aggrivated all the time. Never again.

The headaches, mood swings, anxiety and being redicilously tired two weeks before my period was not worth the ease of this birth control.  I have had a rough 2 years and still am and i thought my side effects were due to stress until i read more on this birth control and saw that many others were having the same problems i was having.  I chose implanon because i had the norplant put in twice and I loved it, no side effects at all.  I figured this was gonna be the same.  for those who love this i could only wish i had the experience you did.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/9/2010 12:42:19 PM	Got this at the end of may 2010 just got it removed november 8th 2010. So I had it in about 5-6 months. I have not had any periods no spotting. I switched to this after being informed the long term effects of the depo which I had been on for the last few yrs. So no periods was what lead me to the decision. Well since I've had it inserted I've experienced terrible mood swings, headaches, extreme fatigue, gained 10lbs, acne everywhere I'm talking arms, legs, back, chest just ridiculous, depression, I have Not lost sex drive so that's good but I went ahead and waited out these past 5 months to see if all the side effects went away and when they didn't I got it removed...literally yesterday. The only positive was no period. Everything else especially the ache was too much for me and I did not want to deal with it. Doc put me on Lybrel which I will start today so we'll see if all goes back to normal. The only way for me to blame the implanon was to remove it and see if they stopped so I pray that they do. 
Birth Control	steffie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	11/8/2010 11:51:40 AM	overall i loved this form of birth control. i began on it in June of 10' its now November of 10' and the only side effect I've had was a period (the only one ive had since beginning the drug) that lasted 21 days (3 weeks) then stopped without medication needed. no weird hair no cramps no mood swings and no lack of sex-drive. i will continue on this drug and talk to a doctor to see if there is any way to control the one extensive period should it return. i would recommend this to everyone, its great and worry free.

I needed something compatible with breastfeeding and I had Medicaid during my pregnancy which I knew would end soon so I needed something that would last a while since I knew I would be without insurance for who knows how long. It has worked, my only complaint is I have had almost no desire for sex, which is the complete opposite of me before the implant.(this bothers my husband more than me! lol) I love not having to worry about birth control and that I can feel it with my hand and be sure that its there. I did bleed for a couple weeks a few weeks after insertion, but I have had NONE since then and it has been about a year and a half. I have not noticed weight gain, but I have yet to loose my baby weight, not sure if that is related or not. Overall I would definately recommend it.

The first year was great, but then I had my period for a month! My period has been very random and long! I'm getting it taken out today. I have had a week break from my period in the last two months.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	10/8/2010 8:44:08 PM	This has been the worst thing that I have ever had! I got this is in in March and my arm always hurts where it is inserted.  Lifting weights is a joke.  I am now on anxiety and depression meds and have has periods for weeks at a time and then they stop for a week and come back, the headaches are all the time and I can get angry so easily I hate it so much.  I really think that I should have researched it more than what the doctor said and I can not wait until i get it out in a year.

Im gonna wait it out and see how it goes a little longer since my doctor says the worst syptoms happen in the first 6 months and then I should be fine...I love that I dont have to worry about a pill even though I was on the pill since I was 16 and no side effects but we'll see what happens!

Now I'm bleeding off and on. Its never heavy but its super annoying! I've taken pills to stop the bleeding but its only temporary. Implanon works but I can't have sex,I'm moody.and I'm just tired of seeing blood all the time. Take at your own risk but I'm fed up.

I am totally happy with it. I was so scared of it because of the reviews but I went ahead and tried it. I'm glad I did! I've keep an updated blog about my experience to give a positive review out there! Check it out if you want to follow my experience from day one!http://implanonblog.blogspot.com/
Birth Control	Bleeding2Death, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/29/2010 3:32:44 PM	I've had Implanon for a about 16 months.  I'm fed up with the bleeding.  I was anemic BEFORE I got this thing and now I'm on so much iron just so I can crawl out of bed.  I'm depressed, I not getting sex because I can't stop bleeding.  I don't know how I'm even alive.  I've been bleeding NON-STOP for almost 12 weeks now.  I should be dead.  I'm so tired because of the bloodloss and I just don't know what to do.  The health department gave me birth control pills to stop the bleeding.  They only slowed it down to spotting.  Doxycycline (my acne medicine--because Implanon made me break out so bad) will stop my period after taking it for 4 days and then it'll stay away for about 2 weeks.  I can't afford to refill my prescription so I only use it when I just can't take it anymore.  It's horrible.  I have warned my friends and raised holy hell at the health department.  I'm seriously thinking about writing to the creator and giving them a piece of my mind...and possibly a hunk or my fist.  I want to send the receipts from all the tampons and pads I've had to buy.  I've spent at least $600 on feminine products since getting this terrible implant.  Stay away from it.  Don't take the risk.
Birth Control	sexlessss, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	9/28/2010 2:56:48 PM	I've had Implanon for almost a year now, and its caused me quite a few problems. Not long after the Implanon was inserted, I woke up covered in blood. There was so much blood it soaked into my matress and ruined it. My bed looked like someone had been murdered on it! I had large blood clots coming out of me, and was soaking through maxi pads like crazy! The bleeding slowed down after a few days and it was more like a normal period. Fortunately, nothing this extreme has happened again. Since I've had Implanon, its pretty much been a never ending period! I'll bleed 2-4 weeks straight, it will stop for about 2 or 3 weeks, but then the cycle starts all over again! When I'm bleeding, it'll range from red blood, to brown, or even black. I'm not sure why I bleed brown or black...it's definitely weird and nothing I have ever experienced before Implanon. Its also been pretty expensive having to buy so many tampons and pads! The constant bleeding has caused some other issues, also. Bleeding constantly = no sex. And no sex can definitely do some damage to a relationship, not to mention put you in a bitchy mood. Implanons website says: &quot;The most common side effect of IMPLANON&#174; is a change in your menstrual periods. In studies, about 10% women stopped using IMPLANON&#174; because of bleeding problems. Expect your menstrual periods to be irregular and unpredictable throughout the time you are using IMPLANON&#174;. &quot; &lt;--- I wish someone would have told me this before i agreed to getting it. Before I chose Implanon, I told my doctor i wanted a birth control that would give me fewer periods or at least shorter, lighter ones. She suggested Implanon. I guess I should have done my research!After reading other peoples reviews, I see that many lucky women have had positive side effects while using Implanon and some of them have even had another Implanon rod put in after the first one expires. I guess it just depends on the person, and how your body reacts to it.

I had it inserted in my left arm in January 2010 and I will never go back to taking the pill daily! I don't even notice it in my arm anymore! The best part is I don't have to remember taking a pill daily. All that needs to  be remembered is to get a new Implanon put in every three years! Yes, I have had periods last longer than usual, but after talking to my doctor, I went back onto birthcontrol pills for a few days to get it to stop! really not a big deal! My boyfriend absolutely loves not having to remind me to take my pill on a daily basis, and even likes feeling the reminder in my arm that i'm not going to get pregnant! I LOVE implanon and will stick with it in my arm until i decide that I'm ready to have a child. Having implanon has made my life easier and one less thing to worry about! I reccomend this birth control to all of my friends, but they prefer trying to remember to take a pill everyday! also, with Implanon, I don't have to worry about if I need to get a Plan B or not :)
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	9/23/2010 1:56:44 AM	I hate this ever since I got it put in I have bleeding all the time, deppressed, whole right side of my body went numb for a month and a half,anxiety and no sex drive!!! I HATE THIS ITS LIKE BEING IN HE**!! gETTING IT REMOVED SOON EVEN IF THE HEALTH DEPT. DOSEN'T WANT TO!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/20/2010 5:05:26 PM	I had Implanon inserted into my arm in January 2010 and I and not satisfied with this product. It works great for birth control but I have a low sex drive, I am always on my period they last for about 2 months and then I have a 2 week break and I am back on it, gained over 30 lbs and I can't control it. I tried many diets going to the gym and i still can't lose it. I am getting it taken out soon. It is effective but the side effects aren't worth it for me. I wouldn't recommend it if you are sensitive to horomones like myself. 
Birth Control	Lmitch, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	9/20/2010 2:26:42 PM	I received the implant in April 2010.  I have had periods that last 3-4 weeks, headaches, chest pains, moody, hot flashes and have become a person I don't want to be around!  I have made an appointment to be evaluated and I told them I want this thing removed!!!  I would definetly not recommend this product.  Not to mention the weight gain, I can't loose any weight for any lenght of time.  I can loose 5 lbs but 10 lbs are gained back.  As far as sex, not having any due to low self esteem concerning weight and appearance, tiredness and the long periods! Totally not worth it!
Birth Control	destinee, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/17/2010 2:05:57 AM	Ive been on this bc for 5 months. Ive been off my period for about 3 weeks combined in the whole 5 months. I hate it!!!My husband doesnt like having as much sex cause im always bleeding or spotting! I constantly get mood swings. I mean it works i dont get pregnant when i do have sex with my husband. Yeah i hate it! Im thinking of getting it removed.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/14/2010 3:07:33 PM	I was really excited in the beginning to get a birth control I did not have to worry about. The first month was very depressed, moody, and I gained weight. I was also bleeding for 14 days.  The second month did not get any better, but I was willing to give it a try.  I was still gaining weight, very moody and still depressed. My husband was the one who pointed out to me that he thinks I am depressed. My bleeding still continued for 18 days. The third month my husband and I decided this was not for me.  I continued to bleed this month for 16 days. I made an appointment to get it removed. The doctor that removed it out of my arm had a very hard time and it has been three weeks since the removal. I have just discovered I have a piece in my arm. I now am going back to the doctor so she can see if there is a piece in there. 9/14/2010

I'm really tired of this, and I want it out!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	8/23/2010 3:12:21 PM	Ok so I was on this thing for 3 yrs. Besides the 40 pound weight increase &amp; mood swings. I only had about 4 periods a yr they were very short only 3 to 4 days long. I did get alot of headaches while using this but it did keep me from getting pregnant so it was worth it.

I've had it in for a total of 3 months which have been HELL. I've gained weight non-stop. I eat well, live on a non-gluten diet, exercise and I am still packing on the pounds. How is this physically possible? Headaches from severe to mild every day. Heat flashes so bad I would think I was pre-menopausal! (I'm 27) Depression. I am a complete b*tch to be around. The hormones are making me crazy. Even Depo wasn't this bad!

I decided I would try implanon after removing an IUD. It was a disaster from the beginning.  My period usually lasts for 3-5 days.  Since having implanon inserted, I bleed for 3 to 4 weeks at a time.  I started to become depressed, I had these crazy mood swings, pain in my leg and my sex drive was basically in ruins.  My weight also kept climbing!! I eat well and I try excercise  walking once a day if I can. But gaining 30lbs in 8 months is not normal! My doctor suggested I  take birth control pills along with the implanon, well that did absolutely nothing accept make me cramp more.   As soon as I can get an appointment, I'm getting this thing taken out!!! Sadly Implanon is not the 'perfect all round birth control' or else every woman would be using it. If you had trouble using the pill due to heavy bleeding  WOMEN BEWARE!

EVER SINCE THE I HAVE HAD NO PERIOD OR CRAMPING. I HAVE HAD NO PERIOD FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS THAT IS THE ONLY THING I LIKE ABOUT THIS. OTHERWISE, I HAVE HAD SEVERE MIGRAINES NO SEX DRIVE AND NOW I HAVE A PROLAPSED UTERUS DUE TO NO ESTROGEN IN THIS BIRTHCONTROL. SO I AM IN VERY SEVERE PAIN.IF YOU HAVE NON OF THESE SYMPTOMS THEN I WOULD SUGGEST IT OTHERWISE BIRTHCONTROL PILLS ARE THE WAY TO GO!

Then non-stop heavy bleeding, there is no tampon to combat what is happening, i'm considering diapers here. It has been a couple month and I still cannot afford removal. I am dizzy and tired all the time, probably from the blood loss...don't get it.

I never had headachs like this or stomach pains that wakes you up.  I am frighten that this might not be worth keeping it.  Why are you all rating this so high but each of you have the same feelings.  The Headach, weight gain, low sex drive, and mood swing?
Birth Control	Rae Wiechman, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	7/13/2010 2:24:43 AM	I got the Implanon implant twice, once before I had my son; not realizing I was pregnant and then again after I had my son.  My Doctor at the time said that it was my best option because I have severe migraines, and  I was very excited that I didn't have to worry about remembering to take a pill every day and that I was set with BC for 3 years.  The implant process was very smooth, and so was the removal, and it appears to be affective.  But after that the satisfaction is gone.   My migraines have only continued to worsen, along with being very tired and lacking energy 24/7, high B/P, Raised heart rate, no sex drive, massive mood swings, severe depression, ternderness of the breasts, nausea, and stomach pain.  Basically to sum it up I feel like all the time, I dont want to move or do anything.  I have spent 1000s of $s going to the Dr. having numerous tests done checking for Thyroid disorders, Adrenal Disorders, and even brain tumors because the medications I was being given for all the health issues I was having werent working, and no cause could be determind.  Unfortunately my Dr. didnt know a whole lot about the implant when I started seeing him so it was far from our thoughts until a co-worker of mine told me about several of her friends who had been going through the same thing and were on implanon and that after having it removed they started feeling better.    Now I am going to have mine removed and looking forward to hopefully feeling better soon.  As for the effectiveness of this product.....take it with a grain of salt, I say its affective; but then it has killed my sex drive, so there hasnt been much of a chance in the past year in a half to test it.  I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone, unless they have it....then I would recommend they get it removed. 
Birth Control	i3lueyz33, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/10/2010 3:42:46 AM	First, I have to say that those reviewing this product that have only had it for a few months should just wait on reviewing it. It was great for me for about the first year (minus the irregular periods, those drove me nuts). I got it implanted Dec 2007, and once I hit the 2 year mark, it just decided to give me almost every side effect in the book!- light headed, dizzy, anxiety, depression, mood swings, even worse periods, weight gain.. it's unreal. I have constant conflicts with myself as to why I'm so angry all the time and how the smallest thing will set me off. I am totally withdrawn, tired all the time. This has been going on for about 6 months now, and I have an appt to get it taken out next week. I can't wait to be myself again.. to be HAPPY! I used to have the Depo shot and I had zero issues with it, it worked perfectly for me. But for some reason, this Implanon is just not agreeing with me. Anyone who is thinking of getting this done, I have read a lot and have my own experience, and it seems like it's hit and miss.. you'll either be 100% happy or 100% miserable with it. Like others have said, just do your research and consider carefully! 
Birth Control	Courtney, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/5/2010 3:30:17 PM	I had this inserted about two months ago after my GYN suggested I give it a try. I had been on Depo for over 4 years and she thought this would provide the same effectiveness without having to remember to go in for another shot. I am very frustrated with the weight gain! Since the inplant, I have gained 12 pounds. I have also noticed an increased number of headaches that don't seem to go away very easily. Depo had killed my sex drive, and Implanon seems to maintain that feeling. I am in the military and plan to keep it in for about three more months, so I can finish up some important training without having to worry about a period. But as soon as I get a chance it's coming out! I have been fortunate to not have a period or any other bleeding problems, but my GYN told me this would likely be the situation due to my many years using Depo prior to Implanon. The GYN sold me hook, line, and sinker on this product. Knowing what I know now, I'd never suggest this to any of my friends. The weight gain, lack of sex drive, and headaches outweigh the few benefits. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/27/2010 12:25:18 PM	I had Implanon put in 9 days ago &amp; so far, I like it. I really got sick the day i was gonna get it BEFORE i had it put in bc of reading all these stinkin bad reviews so goes to show u cant let reviews help u decide. Different birth controls works diff on diff. people. ALL birth controls say they have side effects. All the one i have used have not affected me. I have used the pill &amp; Nuvaring(liked the ring but payin $65 a mth for it for last 2 yrs) so me &amp; the hubby had to find somethin less costly to last a few yrs til we decide to have another child. my insurance pay ALL of it..but so far i do like it. Had it put in on a Friday &amp; my period stopped 2 days later on Sunday &amp; nothin started yet like i thought it might but my Dr said irregular bledding was her worse complaint but said prob should just be for a couple of months then should regulate. But i have had NO bad side effects &amp; have lost little over a pound already so hopefully ill be one of the lucky ones that i wont have side effects with it b4 i have it removed in hopefully 2 yrs. So i say if u wanna try it, be my guest..u may just like it like i do &amp; it did NOT hurt to have put in, I didnt feel a thing but a sting from needle to numb my arm &amp; it was just for a split second. no soreness in my arm or nothin from it. So if u get it, I hope u have great luck with it like i have thus far.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/22/2010 4:39:24 PM	I have only had the implant for a week so I cannot attest to the effectiveness or possible side effects (none so far,though).  My review is on the cost.  IF YOU ARE ON A HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLAN, I RECOMMEND YOU STOP AND SERIOUSLY WEIGH THE COST!!  You are looking at *at least* $700 out-of-pocket if you have not met your annual deductible.  And that is based on your provider's contracted rate with your insurance carrier so it could be even higher than that.  The bill you will receive is not for the faint of heart!
Birth Control	veryunsatisfied, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	6/18/2010 10:23:57 AM	I got implanon put in 9 days ago. the day after I started having constant, bad migraine headaches, pain in my left abdomen, insomnia and high fever (101.2 - 103.0). In the morning I can barely get out of bed because the migraine, dizziness and muscle aches are so bad. not to mention the constant back pain and the amount of sweat that has been pouring off my body over the last 9 day. Im calling my doctors office as soon as they open today and telling them if they cant get me an appointment to have it removed today then I am taking it out myself. I dont know if these are normal side effects but if they are i feel horrible for every woman that has to deal with them. I feel like death is knocking on my door. I would go back to the patch but it gives me bad craps all the time. not only when im menstruating. I dont know what else I am going to do. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	6/8/2010 10:42:15 AM	The implanon was inserted about 2 1/2 months ago and I was very excited about it. But after 2 days I got my period and have had it ever since. And it's been very heavy. My body gets irritated if I use either tampons or pads too long at one time so I switch back and forth. If my period would go away, I think I would love it!
Birth Control	emmas_mommy08, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	6/7/2010 3:32:25 AM	I got the Implanon after the birth of my daughter in 2008. It was ok at first. Then the bleeding started. Ill be on for 3 weeks off for a few days then back on for 2-3 more weeks. I have a period twice a month now and I never no when it will start or stop. I have terrible mood swings and really bad headaches. I get cramps right before I start but usually dont have anymore. I did not gain any weight, thank god, I lost like 25lbs. I break out all the time and I have really sore breasts. I will most likely keep it in for the full three years, unless I find something better, but not having to worry about it is a plus. Obvioulsy everbody is different so you will never know how it will effect you unless you try it.
Birth Control	Lacy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	6/4/2010 11:29:54 PM	I have had it for about 4 months. I got it a month after i had my daughter. I have had very irregular periods multiple ones in one month when it used to be like clockwork. I also have gained probably 30lbs and have had terrible mood swings, fits of rage, just screaming and crying for no reason and always being angry. A new development that just recently in the last 2 weeks under the skin at the injection site is itching really bad, bad enough i want to rip it out to stop from scratching my arm raw. I have been satisfied with the fact that i have not gotten pregnant while on it. I have however been thinking about getting it removed because of the extreme discomfort and irritation.
Birth Control	brittanynicole, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	6/2/2010 4:37:43 PM	I am on my 7th month with the implanon.  So far, I love it.  I almost wonder why there are so negative reviews. Although I haven't had a period for 3 months (I don't mind).  I haven't experienced any unusual weight gain. As long as you stay active and don't sit down with a bag of potato chips and watch the Office every night you should be ok.  However, I have experienced typical breakouts on my face around the time of the month when my period usually starts (if i have one).  I am much more emotional than I was before but that is about it.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a semi-permanent contraceptive. THANK YOU IMPLANON!

Birth Control	Ricasuart, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/1/2010 2:55:22 PM	I have used implanon for a year and a half. I like it because i dont have to remember to take anything. However my periods usually last from 2-5 weeks, and i hate that. I plan to take it out instead of waiting my 3 years because this is unacceptable to me. My periods are never regular anymore, ill go months without one, then get one for 5 weeks. its horrible. I dont cramp as badly as i did when i wasnt on it, and i rarely get moody. other than the periods being screwed up its an ideal birth control.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	5/25/2010 10:28:28 PM	I had mine put in just over a year ago after I had my daughter, and absolutley hate it. I have not stopped bleeding since I gave birth to my daughter. I feel like I am constently bloated. I have gained some weight that is extremely hard to get off and keep of. I have never had achne until I had the implanon put in. My sex drive has been almost non existant. My OB says to wait it out and see what happens. Insurance will not cover another form for another year so I am screwed..It is not worth it not at all! I would much rather buy box's of condoms for my husband (when I am actually in the mood) than be buying panty liners and tampons all the time!

As for me Implanon has been great. I had implanon implanted 10/2009. Just as I was told by my OB/GYN the first three months I spotted. At first I gained about 15 pounds but this is because ALL birth control trick your body into think you are pregnant. This weight gain is easily controlled by WATCHING YOUR PORTIONS AND WHAT YOU ARE EATING. Since I have stopped spotting, I haven't had a period. Which is GREAT! My mood swings have actually stabilized since I have been on Implanon. Before you make a decision talk to your OB/GYN about ALL of your options! It works great for me but may not for you. It really depends on your bodies normal about of hormones and how it reacts to those hormones. 
Birth Control	Tizzle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/18/2010 4:23:24 PM	I have had the Implanon since Nov09. I was advised the first 6mos may be crazy. Bcz the birth control had to settle. 1st month was great, period was one day long. Then month 2 period was 15 days long, Month 3, period actually lasted through month 4. MOnth 6 now and I have no period, which I must say is nice, However.... I am having fainting spells since getting the Implanon inserted. This seems odd. I have always had them, but havent had one since 07. Three days after the insert. BOOM, I blackout at work. My doctor tells me to live with it. One gyn tells me remove the Implanon(this gyn doesnt believe in this method of bc. The gyn who put the BC in says its not the BC, leave it in. Anyone else having fainting spells?
Birth Control	Jessmalt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/14/2010 1:31:22 AM	I got the Implanon inserted in September of 07. I have had it now for about 2 years I really didnt have any problems that I noticed at first. Never had a period or anything, but I had gained like 50 pounds since I have been on this and I have been trying everything I could do to get the weight off and I cant! Also severe headaches all the time, so bad sometimes I get sick, also very moody. I thought maybe my body had changed after I had my son so I blamed it on that. I am seeing the truth now its not just me. It works great for not getting pregnant and everything, but can you put up with all the side effects that comes with it?
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	5/12/2010 5:03:16 PM	I have had Implanon for 3 months now and I am getting it removed in a few days.  My friend suggested it to me because she has had great results with it.  I did not have good results. I have had constant heavy bleeding, headaches, horrible acne, no sex drive, mood swings, and 20 pounds of weight gain (in only 3 months).  I would have been willing to give it more time but the weight gain is out of control and ruining my life!  I have never had weight gain with any other forms of birth control.   
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	5/9/2010 12:19:47 PM	I got the implanon inserted in October 2008, 6 months after having my son. My experience hasn't been the best with this drug.(I just got it removed 2 days ago)I have had ALOT of spotting, headaches, mood swings, and a very low sex drive but I think I could have no problem dealing with those side effects if it wasn't for the weight gain. I've gained 20pounds in one year and a half. After actually stepping on the scale and seeing that I increase I made a call and scheduled the removal. It's $125 but well worth it to get this out of my system. Implanon did not work for me but it works different on everyone.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	5/8/2010 7:24:08 PM	I have been on this for 3 days now and I am suffering horrible side effects.  I am extremely nauseous, gassy, tired, and have had a headache everyday.  I'm going to stick it out and see what happens next, or if the side effects disepate.  But, I guess it's worth it in the long run.  Just be ready to &quot;feel pregnant&quot;.
Birth Control	Mrs. Thomas, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	5/8/2010 4:01:09 AM	I had my implant for almost a year and during that time I suffered from severe headaches everyday just about the whole time. Also my first period which started the day I got the implant didn't end for about 2 months. Then later evened out to 14 days on 14 days off which sucked and I had no sex drive for the days off. I was in the hospital several times, given pill after pill and test after test they never could prove why I was having so many problems but they did suggest to remove the implant. The only good thing I can say is I didn't get pregnant but they had trouble removing it so now I have a dime sized hole in my arm and probably will have a permanent scar from the stiches. I wouldn't recommend this form of birth control to anyone. Sorry ladies.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	25-34	5/5/2010 9:35:59 PM	I am 31 and have had Implanon inserted since 2/19/10.  I'm ususally physically active and have a great sex drive.  Since I have been on it, I have had zero sex drive, have not exercised and in turn have gained a little weight.  I do like the fact that it's inserted into my arm and the light or no periods, but not worth the negative emotional side effects and the lack of interest in sex.  Will look for yet again another method of birth control.
Birth Control	crystal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/5/2010 11:14:51 AM	I had this implant for the whole three yrs minus 10 days. I hated that I was on my period pretty much the entire three yrs painful sex, abdominal pain, no want for sex it was terrible I did not get pregnant though so it does work for that. I was always bloated it sucked. But I see there is some users who have had no prob i just wish i was one of them.
Birth Control	Victoria78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	4/29/2010 1:43:43 PM	I have been on Implanon since 04/07/2010. I am currently thinking of having it removed due to headaches, mood swings, decreased sex drive and spotting. Overall I would deal with the side effects but the mood swings and decreased sex drive are terrible. I am going to be speaking with my doctor this week. It might work for others but unfortunately it does not work for me...
Birth Control	 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		4/25/2010 7:49:31 PM	I've had implanon for about 2 months. I thought it would be a good long term birthcontrol. WRONG. Since I've had this put in I've been to the hospital 3 times with severe pain in my abdominal, had 2 MRIs and everything checked out perfectly fine (they thought it was my appendix) I'm getting it taken out APSP.I gained ten pounds, my skin &amp; emotions also went crazy. PLEASE DON'T EVER GET THISS LADIES I would rather be pregnant right now, then at least docotors would be able to give me answers.. very scary

The 1st couple of months I was on &amp; off my period, but it gradually became lighter, and now it only seems like I get my period every two months or so. I Love it now. Even tho it has some getting use to. Now my husband &amp; I dont have to use a condom, and I dont get that worried feeling after sex. One thing I didnt like.. my ache went crazy! but with a little more skin care, and overall taking care of my body the right way it's awesome.. Weight wise it was ok.. I did gain weight, &amp; it was hard to loose, but now (Joining the Air Force soon) tht my body is use to it, its easier (lost 10 lbs) I guess this BC works depending on your body.. Every woman is different. I would recommend this to anyone especially for those who are &quot;irrsponseble&quot; about taking the pill.. lol. when I have my period they are VERY light and last about 2 weeks. My mood swing arent tht badd prior, and the cramping isnt niether.. 8 1/2 out of a 10 :)
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	4/8/2010 5:05:04 AM	I am very thankful to not have any of the emotional problems like so many of you, and overall Implanon works for me. The only downside is the prolonged periods; I have probably had maybe 10 days with no period/spotting since I got it put in, (three months ago), but hopefully this will become more regular. I have also had severe menstrual cramping but did so before i got it too. Overall i would approve, i just wish they could find a way to make periods more regular!

Birth Control	Pamela, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/5/2010 8:27:38 PM	I had the Implanon inserted September 2007 after being on depo for 2 years.  my doctor told me that it was a great option for me since I have a fear of needles.  It was quick and easy to have it inserted though I was bruised for about a week at the injection site.  I have not had any bleeding since it was inserted, not even spotting.  After the first few days, I couldnt even feel it unless I was trying to find it.  I am having it removed a week from tomorrow to try to get pregnant.  When I am done having children, I will have it inserted again.
Birth Control	steph, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	3/29/2010 10:11:00 PM	I have been on this since December of 2007 (was on Depo for 7 years prior loved it no periods, a little weight gain) I am so disappointed in this but am glad to know I am not crazy. I have periods for months at a time and have to take pills to stop the bleeding. Am very moody and get upset every time anybody asks me anything. I can't even stand myself. I get this thing out in December I have gone to the Dr a few times to have it removed and always get talked out of it. I have headaches every day all day, I can gain 5 pounds in a day and always feel like a water balloon. I eat healthy and drink lots of water this is ridiculous.   
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	3/29/2010 11:23:53 AM	I had the Implanon put in on Feb, 25, 2010 and will be having it removed in the morning. I read the reviews about this birthcontrol method and was a little scared, but was insured by my doctor that the most complaints she had was the irregular bleeding. That was not it for me. I have bleed since the day it was put in. I also have severe head aches and mood swings. I cry about the wildest things. I have never been the type to have mood swings this bad or even cry about nothing. I guess it is just different for everyone, but this was not for me!!
Birth Control	Amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/27/2010 11:15:56 PM	I had IMPLANON put in about 6 weeks after my daughter was born. About three months later i received my period. For two years i had it almost constant. While this was going on i had symptoms of morning sickness, extreme anxiety, major mood swings, weight loss, severe dry skin, hair was falling out. I was tested for an overactive thyroid 3 times. Two years of this went by. I had it removed lost my mucous plug and now have severe bladder pain and uterus pain with every period. This lasts 3 weeks of every month. Now am getting a hysterectomy. Thanks IMPANON! Or should i thank my doctor for not helping me with the facts of this terrible drug! If it works for you im happy. Just know when to get it out.
Birth Control	Stevi Noelle, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	3/17/2010 5:14:39 PM	Getting it inserted is quick and painless although I did have a small bruise around the area for about a week. The day of insertion my arm was a little tender, I couldnt pick up my baby niece until the next day, but overall recovery was speedy. I cannot feel it day to day unless I am looking to touch it (I find it to feel pretty cool, I like how if you push one side down the other side pokes up(maybe Im just wired like that) lol) ()First of all, the biggest problem I had with Implanon is my weight gain; I have gained 50lbs in the last year with Implanon. I am 22 years old, I have a small frame, I am 5'4, my average weight all my life was 120lbs - 130lbs (a very healthy weight for my age and height), now I am a whopping 180lbs. It drives me crazy to not feel comfortable in my own skin, to not want to look in the mirror because I dont like what I see, to have NONE of my old or favorite cloths fit, and dont even get me started on how depressing it is now to go shopping these days when I am a self proclaimed shopaholic!   **there is no way to know for sure Implanon is the reason for my weight gain, but id bet my bottom dollar on it, the timing adds up against Implanons favor**()Secondly I had a problem with constant spotting/bleeding for the first 4 months of using Implanon. I didnt know where my spotting ended and my period began. I felt tired all the time and was spending an absurd amount on tampons. By my 6th month on Implanon I had a normal period again and have had a normal period every since.()Thirdly I absolutely love that you dont have to worry about becoming a mama for 3 years, its the most amazing feeling of relief ever and so far for me it has been extremely effective (hence; no babies) Unfortunately as much as I love this form of BC the weight gain I have experienced does me in. I have an appointment to have it removed the beginning of April 2010 
Birth Control	Leah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	3/17/2010 10:35:59 AM	I have had Implanon since 11/09, so about 4 months now.  It has been very effective at it's intended purpose, but I have not stopped bleeding pretty much since it was put in. Also, I'm having some hair loss.  Seems like everytime I brush my hair my brush is full of hair.  Now Im reading other reviews and it looks like the majority of the ladies who have reviewed this product are having significant weight gain.  I think I'll get it out while I'm still ahead.  Im not really willing to gain weight in lieu of not having to remember to take a pill (or some other form of BC)  With a new baby at home I have enough stress and dont want to add my non stop periods, hair loss and potential weight gain to the list.

I am still period free, and loving it. The only side effect that I experianced is a little weight gain, but that's just me over eating because the birth control makes you think you're pregnant, but it was only 5 pounds. I have been watching what I eat, and having portion control. When I had it put it, they gave me a shot of local pain medication, and then once I was numb they inserted it. It healed quickly, and since then I have been period free. I recommend this birth control for everyone. It is good for three years, and I don't have to worry about taking the pill everyday. I hope this is helpful when making your decision about birth control.

Birth Control	mother of 3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	3/15/2010 3:43:54 PM	I would not recommend this method of birth control to ANYONE! I have had mine in for two weeks and I am having it removed in two days! Since the day I had it put in I have had non-stop diarrhea and abdominal pain! Not to mention the terrible mood swings! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/13/2010 5:27:59 AM	I've had Implanon for 3 1/2 months and am very pleased with it. Since it was inserted, Ive experienced slight spotting, but have never had to use anything more than a panty liner. There have been a few negative side effects (heart burn, some headaches, and slight pain at the insertion sight), but the ease of not having to take a pill everyday far outweighs those slight annoyances. Originally, I was scared to try Implanon, because I had read a lot of negative reviews. In the end, I am happy I chose it and would definitely recommend it to others.
Birth Control	TalentOnStrike, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	3/9/2010 11:10:12 AM	I have had implanon since June of 2007. I had a continuous period for the first six months and now I never know when it's coming or going. I've gained about 40 pounds since I had my daughter, and have turned into a maniac. I get angry or sobby over even the littlest things! My doctor recommended this form of birth control to me, and I truly regret the decision to get it. I feel like I would rather put up with the stress of taking a pill every day rather than be a raging b**** every moment. I do not recommend this product to other women...It's just not worth the side effects. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	3/7/2010 11:30:20 PM	I've had Implanon since Sept 2007, I should be getting it removed this Sept but want it removed ASAP! I've had most of the side effects. The week I had it inserted I was crazy! I was a completely different woman. I have noticed weight gain but I've always been thin so that was actually a plus. I'll go for a few months without a period then I'll spot for a while. Once last year I had my period for almost a month, full on cramps and heavy bleeding! My dr said it was a side effect and gave me a prescription for estrogen and said it should put me back in balance. It did but once again I've been on my period for a month! Not fun! 
Birth Control	Megan , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/3/2010 5:20:45 PM	I have been on Implanon for 9 months now and have gained about 30 pounds. It was very easy to get inserted, the only thing I felt was the prick of the needle to numb your arm but other than that I didn't feel anything. Luckily, I haven't expereinced headaches or acne and I haven't had my period at all during this time. Not even in the first few months. I have, however, felt depressed and tired. I sleep a lot, take frequent naps during the day just all around feel worn down. As I mentioned earlier, I gained a considerable amount of weight. Aslo, my libido is lower. I know it effects everone differently, but had I read these reviews before and known about  some of the side effects I probably wouldn't have gotten it. The only reason I did decide to go with Implanon was because I didn't have to remember to take anything. I was really bad with remembering to take the pill. No pregnancy scares, it is very effective. I'm just not happy with some of the side effects. 
Birth Control	cuttiepie8982, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	3/2/2010 9:53:12 PM	I have had the Implanon in since April 2007 and about to get it removed. It has worked 100% for preventing pregnancy. However, I did not have a period for the 1st year during the second year i had a period every few months the 3rd and final year I will start my period for a couple of days then it will stop then start again and last for 2-3 weeks. It did not hurt to have put in at all. However I do sometimes realize pain in the area and my arm will go numb. The biggest downfall aside from crazy periods is the weight gain. The implanon is not horrible it just depends on what you are looking for. I never had regular periods before implanon so that was not a big deal for me until this last year.

Birth Control	25-34	5	5	5		25-34	2/28/2010 3:12:57 AM	I have had problems with the contraceptive pill, in the past and condoms just don't agree with my partner and i, so, after speaking to my GP, i thought about implanon as an option. I was initially a bit worried about having the implanon inserted, due to reading various horror stories online. However, after speaking to my doctor i decided to go ahead with having the implanon inserted. I've only had the implanon in for six weeks and so far i had some light spotting, for about a week, about two weeks in, but nothing since. I have not noticed any change in mood, actually, my mood is probably more stable than ever. No other changes evident, such as weight gain. I'm hoping that I'll be one of the lucky ones and only have light bleeding or none at all. If it stays this way, I would definitely recommend this method of contraception. Obviously everyone is different, but seems to be working well for me!

G., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	2/25/2010 4:01:04 PM	DO NOT GET IMPLANON IT IS NOT WORTH THE RISK!!!I got Implanon in June 09 due to inability to take estrogen and the fact depo made me bleed the entire time. I was told that it contained the same medication as Norplant but instead of 6 tubes for 5 years it was 1 tube good for 3 years. I had Norplant for 5 years with no problems other than weight gain. Later I found out this was false. Same type of medication but a different formula.It was a horror story from the get go! The mood swings started w/in the 1st week &amp; my normally clear skin broke out in HUGE blood pimples/boils that would not go away, prevented sleep because it hurt so badly to lay my cheek on the pillow, &amp; have left my face badly scared! The breakouts were so bad that children stared at me in shock and people asked me embarrassing questions. Of course depression set in and I could barely coax myself to go grocery shopping or even be intimate with my husband. Plainly, I felt ugly.The doctors told me I should give it at least 6 months to see if my body would regulate, which was an awful plan! Had I gotten it removed right away like I wanted I wouldn't have a scared face that is still out control nor would I have gained near 25 pounds! I feel like 6 months of my life were stolen by this product. DO NOT GET IMPLANON IT IS NOT WORTH THE RISK!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/18/2010 7:11:52 PM	I love the Implanon. I have been using this birth control method for 1 year and I recommend it to many of my friends.
Birth Control	ImplaNOT!, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/18/2010 6:40:16 PM	Its definitely been the most effective birth control I've ever taken. I've had my period for 6 months, EVERY DAY! Some days are light but most are moderate or heavy. I was told I might have bleeding some days more than others during the first month, but this is ridiculous. My reason for taking this b.c. was bc I didn't want all the dangerous side effects of regular birth control. To help stop the bleeding, my gyno prescribed me a daily birth control which I refuse to take. Kind of defeats the purpose, if you ask me. I've had absolutely no sex drive and I've become emotional at least a few days a month. I've gained 15 pounds in the first 3 months and pray that I don't gain more. My insurance ran out in December, but I should start a new insurance in March. I'm taking this terrible thing out of my arm as soon as possible. I do not recommend this to anyone. 
Birth Control	Noah's Mommy, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	2/16/2010 1:36:04 PM	I am not sure I would refer other women to this product. I like the first review I read here, nursed my son and had no problems while nursing, and about a month and a half after I stopped nursing him, I noticed some bleeding. It has now continued for about six or seven weeks and is getting heavier. I could be fine one minute and then feel a lot of bleeding happening the next. It scares me to the point where I am taking iron and prenatal vitamins just to help build up my blood.  But I feel like it is making me very tired and worn out. My ance also became a problem. I didn't think it was because of the implanon at first, but now after reading more about it, I am sure it is. It is almost like cronic acne. And very embarrassing. I also noticed hair growing where I did not ever have it before and weight gain. I was thinner right after giving birth than I am now. Not to mention the mood swings. Not being able to find the remote control turned me into a sobbing mess. At first, I thought it was a great product and birth control method, and for a while it was. But now I am scared and I would like to have it taken out. Condoms are not a problem and untill I find something that will work better for me, that is what my husband and I will use. Good luck to those of you thinking about using it. It is obviously different for everyone, but I think I am pretty much done with it.
Birth Control	maitufo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	2/15/2010 11:32:41 AM	Yes it kept me from getting pregnant. And while I was breastfeeding my newborn daughter (for about 1yr), it seemed great.I had no periods! HOWEVER, after stopping breastfeeding my daughter I had to deal with very intense periods for a total of 6months. Until I said &quot;no more&quot;. Before trying inplanon my periods were very regular and did not last longer than 3-4 days. I once had a period last 2 weeks while using implanon. That's when I went to my doctor's office to get checked out, and find another option. Not to mention my mood swings!!!! Horrible horrible product! I would not recomment this to anyone! I'm not the type that writes reviews on things, but I thought other women out there should know about my experience with this medicine. Once you have it inserted into your arm, it takes some courage to get it taken out. Not worth it!
Birth Control	picasso, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/14/2010 1:11:14 AM	OK Ladies, I am much like you,..I have 4 wonderful children, but was ready for a more permanent birth control. Something I would NEVER have to remember to take, even taking the Nuva Ring once a month was sometimes too much to remember! So I saw Implanon ad at my Doctor's office and asked for it. I then read all these terrifying reviews about the drug on this very site, and how the women on here were saying it has made them grow hair in weird places, caused mood swings beyond belief, weight gain,..(ugh)and horribly heavy periods! Yikes! I called my Doc on the DAY I was to have Implanon inserted and expressed my fears. Good ole Doc eased my fears and I went through with it! (I am a BABY when it comes to needles and such, and let me tell you, I didn't feel a THING!!!! Just the prick of the numbing needle in my arm- nothing more!)And wouldn't you know it has been almost SIX months and I feel completely  NORMAL!!!!! the only change I have experienced is the stress free peace of mind I have knowing I didn't forget to take my BC today, or next month! It's right there, in my arm! SOOOO EASY and no weird hair, or painful periods. All is good and I LOVE this method of BC and would recommend it to all!
Birth Control	manda5, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/13/2010 9:13:14 AM	I have had my Implanon for three years this month. I loved it! It really works. the only complication I had was excessive bleeding at the beginning but that's with any birth control. There are no real side effects. I didn't gain weight like you would on the pills. I am having it removed the end of this month and that's the partI am nervous about. But I would recommend it every girl that was looking for birth control. 
Birth Control	Salt Life, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/12/2010 7:24:50 PM	I've been on Implanon since May 2009 and love it.  I was worried with the horror stories I've heard about the irregular bleeding but decided to get it anyway and so glad I did.  My body took some time adjusting to it, about eight months or so in the way of slight cramps and some spotting (not enough to cause me to use anything however).  My biggest suggestion is go to a OB/GYN that you trust and sit down and talk to them about all of your options, there are so many to settle on one that you are too scared about!!  Luckily I found one that worked perfectly for me, but I did have to go through trying two types of BC pills that made life horrible for two months.  Stick with it ladies, you'll find the right birth control!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/10/2010 7:31:10 PM	I got mine in 5/2008. At first I thought it was great, after the third month though I now have a period for three weeks then about a week break. Also, I haven't experienced cramps at all since high school. However, after about the 13 month with implanon I started having horribly painful cramps. So, if you like horrible cramps and non stop bleeding implanon is great for you. I do not like these side effects personally and am now so fed up I am getting it out ASAP!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	2/10/2010 1:09:34 AM	I got this implant in Nov of 2007 and while it has been effective in it's intended use I have bad side effects. About a month after insertion I started gaining weight to which I have gained 65 lbs. I also had many side effects of pregnancy like tender breasts and morning sickness. In the last two weeks have started severe cramping and spotting. I don't recommend this birth control to women who like me are sensitive to hormones. I can also feel the implant which bothers me personally but as I said it has been easy and effective. 
Birth Control	akalocsa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/9/2010 7:40:18 PM	i actually use implanon to control epilepsy.  my seizures are due to fluctuating hormone levels.  i have to take carbatrol (carbamazipine) for the epilepsy and because of the carbatrol my body metabolizes most other drugs abnormally. i can not use implanon as a sole means of birth control - RATS!!!  when i read about other girls having periods for months at a time, i wonder if they could also be taking another drug to cause this.  check your meds, girls.  i think that the nuva ring is basically the same &quot;drug&quot; as implanon, so if you are weary about having it put in you and having a bad trip then try the nuva ring first. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/8/2010 10:10:56 PM	I have had the Implanon since Aug 2007 and haven't had any problems. I have only had two &quot;periods&quot; in almost 3 years and it was only mild spotting. Everyone is different so these reviews shouldn't make your decision.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	2/8/2010 8:27:00 PM	Like many others, I have had a non-stop period. This became my only option because my IUD perforated my uterus and embedded itself in my muscle. On the IUD, I never had a period which was great. Now, I have a period for 3 weeks long. I maybe get a week without one. I hope to get it removed ASAP!
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female		2/7/2010 9:08:23 PM	After having the Implanon for 17 months, I finally had it removed.  It is by far the WORST birth control that I've been on.  I would have periods 2 to 3 1/2 weeks long.  It did it's job as birth control because my spouse I never had sex due to the long periods.  Plus, it came with horrible cramps.  Ladies, think long and hard before going this route.  
Birth Control	lakya_88, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	2/7/2010 8:34:19 PM	I've had implanon since Aug. 2009. At first everything was great, but now I am disappointed.  I had no period for the first two months. Now, i have been bleeding for a month and have heavy clotting accompanied with it.  My doctor told me it should be adjusted to my body in 90 days, but here it is 6 months later and nothing has &quot;adjusted.&quot; I am getting it removed.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	2/3/2010 7:59:57 PM	I got mine inserted in june 09. insertion was no biggy. The first 3 months were fine. i had no period...but it went downhill from there. My period just went off 3 weeks ago because i switched back to the pill...with implanon i had a constant period. I never had a break from it, it wasnt bad though. it was VERy light but just annoying. The worst thing was the mood swings! They were so terrible. It effected me at work and with family, so i got it out. but i was depressed all the time. and besides that its fine. You dont have to remember anything. maybe it'll be good for you, but it wasn't for me!
Birth Control	JessicaGwyne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/27/2010 9:32:05 PM	I have had the implanon since January 2008. I have gained weight, and I had no period for over a year. This past year I have experienced periods one every other month or so, all periods are light and last up to 7 days. The thing in which bothers me the most is the weight gain and I am considering having it removed.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/27/2010 6:18:17 AM	To ALL THE NEW COMERS!!!!!!!! DO NOT READ these reviews and allow them to make your decision for you! I got the Implanon on 11/09 and my doctor did a great job! I did not feel anything when I had it inserted. After it is inserted you dont even know that its there. EVERY womans body is different some of these reviews say they have been bleeding for a year  non-stop. Umm come one ladies get rid of it if youre bleeding that much. You can not blame everything on the drug because it is common sense if you are having so many bad side effects from the drug TAKE IT OUT! Any way I didnt bleed for the first month (GREAT) I started spotting for a day or two then it will stop for a month then spot again. So I really dont have real periods. I cant say what the future has in store for me but as or right now I LOVE IT! Also when I got it inserted I was talking to my doctor and she got so upset when I told her I kept rescheduling my appointment because of Webmd. I was really scared from what others where saying up here. Im really glad that I have the Implnon. (I tried the IUD twice, DEPO, PATCH, PILLS AND NUVA RING loved the Nuva Ring but I developed clots). And one more thing if you are bleeding more then 2-4 weeks your GYN can give you meds to stop it for a little while.

The first 3 months were great, i had no period at all and felt great.  However for the past 4 months i have bled everyday.  Not heavy but more annoying and embarrasing.  My headaches have increase and i have put on some weight.  I am having mine removed this week and going back the good ole birth control pill that i had no problem with
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/23/2010 10:13:19 PM	I've have my implanon in for the past 3 months and I love it!  It didn't hurt when getting to placed, I can't even tell that it's there.  It's perfect for me because I've tried just about very birth control out there and I am the most satisfied with this method of birth control.
Birth Control	No2Implanon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	1/23/2010 1:23:22 AM	I was previously on the Depo shot, which I loved. I was forced to change because of the time limit Depo has. I got Implanon in June of 09 first two weeks of having it I was sick to my stomach, just walking would make me throw up. When I was on Depo I only had a period seven days out of three months and so far I have had a non-stop period for 8 MONTHS and still going. I also have acne on my arms and neck, I never used to have it their. I hate this product and I wish I would have known this before I got this P.O.S in my arm. Before I was ever on birth control I had really irregular periods like seven day bleeding out of 5 months. The doctors told me that because I am regularly irregular that I would be one of the girls that dont have periods on Implanon-(Dont believe that I have proven it wrong). This whole experience has ruined my sex life. NEVER GET IT
Birth Control	IansMommy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	1/14/2010 6:44:58 PM	BEWARE!  I'm one of the 5%, that experience all the VERY bad side effects. I'm having to see a Endocrinologist now, due to the hormone imbalance Implanon caused.  I used it for 8 months after the birth of my son.  I lost 2/3 of my hair, gained 50 pounds, acne, facial hair, mood swings, fatigue, slept most of the time, no libido, I was just plain MISERABLE and missed out of my son's 1st year of life.  I do NOT recommend this to anyone ever.   5% of 4.5 million women is 135,000 women suffering from this drug.
Birth Control	beccab1980, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/6/2010 3:13:22 AM	I have had Implanon for 2 months now and I love it. I have had only two days of spotting and even then I didn't need a liner. I have had a few acne breakouts, but nothing too bad. I like this so much better than the IUD I used to have and so much easier than taking a pill everyday. I also love the lack of estrogen. Great choice for me since I have one child and not too sure if we want to enlarge our family later. I appreciate having a great brith control without permanency.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	19-24	1/2/2010 1:27:31 AM	I'm a VERY think girl. The implant hurts, and when I say hurts it HURTSSSSS my arm. It's like being stabbed. My periods come every 6 weeks but haven't had one in almost 9 now. Getting kind of worried. If it wasn't the best thing available and if I could actually remember to take the pill I would not have this. I do not recommend this to anyone. It's variance in experiences is just a little too far fetched for me to recommend. 
Birth Control	talker, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	12/29/2009 11:37:23 AM	I've had Implanon for 4 months. I'm 45 years old and wanted my uncomfortable periods to stop until menopause. Periods are now heavier, longer and more painful. I called my Dr. but she told me to give it 12 months after which 80% of women's periods stop. Not sure I can afford all the extra feminine products needed until then. The birth control works because I'm not off my period long enough to want to have sex. I guess I'll give it a little more time but I'm ready to get it out. I also have headaches and weight gain.
Birth Control	mommafrye,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		12/21/2009 10:04:10 AM	I loved this product! I did not have to remember to take anything or replace anything my doctor helped me remember when it was time to remove and replace it. I did not have regular periods for the first year after that I spoted for a period and then done! for some one that FLOWED for 7 Day HEAVY before...I love the change! We have since decided to get my Hubby fixed no more children for us. I will be going off Birth Control all together soon! But I am Happy with the choice I made and would strongly advise to get all the facts for what will work for you...but for me. I could not take something at the exact same time everyday...life happens to me too often expectally when you already have a child or two. Did not want something you could feel inside while having intercourse...or he could feel either or it fall out...I hope my expericance helps someone! good luck with your choices
Birth Control	BD, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/17/2009 11:03:09 AM	I have been using Implanon for just under a year now. Overall, my experience has been a good one. For the first several months, I had no bleeding. I would get moody and break out around the time when I normally got my period, but nothing like the total raging b**** I was while taking the pill. Not to mention, my blood pressure dropped tremendously, so I have felt a lot better for the past year. About 5 months ago, I started spotting. This typically happens every 6-8 weeks and lasts anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks. It's never heavy enough to warrant a pad or tampon, and I typically don't even need a pantyliner. This month felt a little more period-like with some headaches, cramping, and slightly heavier spotting for 6 days. However, I'm getting a bit concerned because I stopped my last &quot;period&quot; on the 9th and started spotting again on the 16th. I haven't noticed any of the other symptoms. I have a very stressful job, so I suffered from hair loss before Implanon (and that has actually lessened since I had it inserted). I've always struggled with stress and hormone-induced acne (again, that's improved slightly since Implanon). I do think my sex drive has lessened a bit, but that's not necessarily a bad thing since I have an extraordinarily high sex drive. I'm actually not sure of the birth control aspect as I've only had sex without also using a condom 2 times since I began Implanon...and both times have been within the past month. I have highly recommended this birth control to several of my friends...especially those who, like me, can't take the pill because the hormones make them crazy, emotional, bitchy messes. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	12/11/2009 11:11:33 PM	I feared the insertion would be painful, it wasn't. I was on the depo which made me gain significant weight but made my breasts fuller, and I didn't get a period. I still have yet to get a period on implanon, lost weight, breasts stayed full, but I have occasional head aches and nausea. Compared to all the other bc I tried, my favorite.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	12/6/2009 1:28:03 PM	Have had the BC since August. I have not had a period since, but now I am having pregnancy symptoms. Swollen breasts, nausea/throwing up, fatigue, mood swings and frequent urination. Took a HPT, said that I'm not pregnant, but I seriously am questioning it. I have 2 kids and I feel exactly like I did when I was pregnant with both of them. Not sure if these are side effects all rolled into one or if I am sick (seeing as it is the cold/flu season). I am seriously thinking about taking out the implanon.

I have not had a period since then, very little in the way of mood swings, and no pregnancy.  I was very bad at taking the pills regularly, and the shot gave me mirgaines like no other I've ever experienced.  Worst thing in the world.  I do have acne now, and weight gain (but I would bet that's from other lifestyle changes also).  The implant itself didn't hurt at all and you can't see anything at all.  I do every once in awhile have to check to make sure it's still there but that is just my own craziness.

I love this birthcontrol. i have recomended it to my little sister who it 16.

I have had the device for 2 years.  I gained about 24 lbs right off the bat, but attributed that to stress.  Now I wonder tho if it's not the drug.  I had few periods in the last 20 months.  However, in the last 2 months I have experienced very heavy periods.  Alarmingly heavy.  I would like to have Implanon removed immediately.

It has been effective as use for birth control. It is easy to use as you do not have to remember to take anything, it is just done for you.I have overall been satisfied with my experience with Implanon. I rarely get my period anymore. I have only mild side effects and I have not gotten pregnant which is the main reason I got it in the first place.It is different for every person who takes it as some of my friends were on it and eventually got it taken out because of excess bleeding and bad side effects but I have had no problems at all, so you can see how it differs.It was not too bad being inserted as you were numbed before getting it put in.I am slightly nervous about getting it removed only because I hope it is not too painful. I am planning to put another one in after this and then start trying for a baby after that, but we will see what happens.
Birth Control	dlhill44, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/22/2009 1:36:28 AM	I'll start by saying I have a love/hate relationshipe with Implanon. I received the Implanon in October 2008 just after having my daughter. I wanted something easy and I didn't want to have to remember to take the pill everyday. I expected several months of spotting but here we are 13 months later and I have probably gone about 4 weeks total without bleeding. It started as spotting and now I'm on my period 24/7. I hate it! I love that I don't have any worries but I think I'm done with this thing. I have actually been trying to get it taken out for months but my insurance company will not cover it until I have exhausted all measures. 1st I had to use Estrogen patches for 1 month which stopped the bleeding until the second I took them off. Then I had to take Estrogen pills for 1 month...that cost $60 and didn't do anything for me. Then antibiotics, then birth control pills (both of which made me sick everyday) and another round of antibiotics. I'm calling 1st thing Monday morning to schedule an appt. to get this thing taken out but I'm sure it's still going to cost me an arm and a leg!

Overall i am satisfied with the effectiveness of the birth control method. But since using it i've had heavier and more frequent periods, hair loss, acne and weight gain. I think its a okay method besides the side effects.

Now I bleed non-stop and if I ever do stop bleeding it's for 3-5 days. I have horrible mood swings, never seemed myself since, and manic depressive. I have gained considerable weight since getting the implant and I have always had a high metabolism rate. I am very dissatisfied with this form of birth control. I'm going to wait until 12 months in to see if things even out. If not I'm getting it taken out ASAP.

I have awful cramps and long times with bleeding and long times without bleeding. I have real bad mood swings and i feel bad for my husband because i cry all the time. it is great for birth control but i can't stand the side affects. I'm dizzy all the time and have two kids to take care of i don't need this on top of all of that.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	10/26/2009 9:30:29 PM	I am a 21 year old, single mother of a two year old boy so I thought this would be a very good option for me so I could go to school first.But this has been the worst birth control I have ever taken. I have never been able to feel the implant since day one and the nurses said it was fine. So far I have had the worst side affects as well, I have depression, mood swings that are so bad I believe this has also caused mine and my boyfreind of 4yrs to end. I have an ovarian cyst, and headaches everyday. When I went to go get this implanon taken out, a couple of doctors stated that it was inserted too deep and no one would want to take it out for me, so this is stuck in me!! I do not recommend this birth control for any one.
Birth Control	Cstri08, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	10/20/2009 3:10:44 PM	I am 19 years old and have had Implanon for almost a year and half. I hate this thing!! Ever since I have had it I have had acne, which I've never had before, I have my period constantly, I feel terrible, I have no sex drive, some depression, and terrible mood swings.  The only reason that I have kept it as long as I have is because even though I have had all of these problems I have not had any pregnancy scares.  My fiance and I have set down and talked and I am defintely having it removed as soon as possible.  Even though it works great for keeping you from getting pregnant it is not worth everything that I have been through with it.  I do not recommend that anyone use this product!!
Birth Control	qtgirl04, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	10/19/2009 2:02:04 AM	I'll be completely honest, I wish I would've read all the reviews before going through with this birth control.  I as well am only 23 years old, my sex drive has gone down tremendously, i have had frequent headaches.  I loved the first month, no period and no cramps.  Now I spot every day for the past 4 months.  I don't recommend this birth control to anyone.  Not even my sisters!  I am now reconsidering this product and want it taken out immediately.  I like many others decided &quot;oh it'll get better!&quot; No, it doesn't. If you have trouble with remembering to take your medication, set a reminder on your phone or ask a friend or family member to call you and remind you.  Trust Me, this is not a birth control to mess with.  I have already gained 15lbs in the past 5 months and I exercise regularly!  Not to mention my relationship has almost gone under.

I would not recommend this for anybody, especially if they already have a stressful life!!! And of course it killed my sex drive also. I got it removed last week and no more migranes. Just waiting for my periods to go back to normal!!!!!
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/11/2009 12:23:52 AM	I decided to go with Implanon after having tried many other options to try and help with my migraines. WOW what a blessing! I have had the implant for 3 months now and only 1 migraine copared to 2 or 3 a month before. It also has the added benefit of only having had 1 period since insertion. It was definately the right choice for me. The actual insertion wasnt bad either, I didn't have any discomfort during but I was a little sore and bruised after.
Birth Control	AsomerH, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/7/2009 1:30:00 PM	I was unable to take estrogen based birth controls, they raised my blood pressure and gave me migraines.  My Nurse Practioner recommended this type of BC, I had the implanon in for almost a year and I was very pleased with the results.  Injection and removal were not too painful.  I removed the implanon, because I am planning for a baby.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	10/6/2009 10:34:10 AM	Im 21 and I had mine inserted in june of 09... My periods have been heavy and long since then. I have been experianceing extreame pain in my left are and some in my left leg. I have never had Anxiety untill i got on this birth control. I have just been having so many problems with it that I have decided to get it removed.
Birth Control	DGiusto, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	9/26/2009 5:36:25 AM	I have had mine for about 2 years now.  I loved it the first year because I never had a period, no spotting, no issues at all, but now am debating whether or not I want to keep it very much longer.  It certainly beats having to remember to take a pill everyday, but I have noticed that I have been overly emotional for a while now, and have had regular headaches and sore breasts.  I'm thinking that I will try to wait it out for another year when it is time to take it out, and then see what else is available.
Birth Control	Desert Blossom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	9/24/2009 12:37:29 AM	I wanted to try something new other than the pill, so I tried this. I gained weight and my mood changed horribly. I will just say people were telling me I wasn't very nice any more and they had never seen me act like this before. I would get angry quick and then to sadness in a heart beat, as if I was bipolar! I gave Implanon a 3 month chance, but my symptoms became worse. I started having chest pains, some days worse than others and my family doctor could find nothing physically wrong with me. Removal of it was a bad experience too. It would not come out. My gyno doctor thought the Implanon had become stuck on my scar tissue from the insertion. When she was finally able to remove it, from that small incision she made, I bleed a lot and it took awhile to stop bleeding. It must have torn something inside of me, it scared me but I got myself to stop bleeding. I don't know if I am just the 1% that all of this happened to, but I will never try it again.
Birth Control	RobinsonMomof3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	9/19/2009 1:06:43 PM	Implanon is awful. I had this inserted after I had my daughter because I needed something more effective than the pill but something that would still allow me to breastfeed. A month after I weaned my daughter I got my first period. It lasted about a moth! Since then my period comes about every 3 weeks and lasts anywhere from 2-4 weeks. I hate it. It interferes with my sex life and I am fed up. Getting it removed as soon as my doctor can see me..
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/16/2009 10:07:02 PM	I had implanon inserted over 2 months ago. It's the best so far. I have no headaches, no weight gain, no face problems, and my sex drive is up! My period is light and no complications during insertion. My arm is completely heal, no scars. I had Nuva Ring for 3 years before. That was a great birth control method, however I hated taking it out and inserting it in. I got Implanon for the simplicity of it. Everyone is different so if u had the problems while taking certain medications before taking this medication, you will have that problem while on this drug. Don't let the negative responses get to u. Everyone is different. This is excellent and I would recommend it to everyone. 
Birth Control	AL VB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/9/2009 10:39:13 PM	I had Implanon inserted in May 2009. I chose Implanon because it does not contain estrogen which, from past experience, tends to make me a bit crazy. The insertion was completely painless and I don't have any mark on my skin where it was inserted. I have gained weight (about 10-15 pounds) but it was so rapid that I am fairly certain it's water retention and bloating. My doctor told me this was common and to wait six months for my body to adjust. I'm just happy that Implanon doesn't mess with my head like other birth controls have in the past. My skins is breaking out a bit, but it's nothing I can't live with. I'll give it a few more months to see if the water weight goes away. If not, I might consider having it taken out. I haven't gotten a real period since I've had Implanon; just a little spotting here and there.
Birth Control	MG, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/9/2009 4:10:31 PM	i got Implanon about a month ago right before i got married. i absolutely LOVE it. it has been very effecive, my sex drive has not gone down as some say. i never got headaches, i havent gained weight and i recently got my period regularly (very light) for about only 4 days. but then again, before i got on birth control, i never really had any PMS problems. i would reccomend this to EVERYONE. just be aware that the insertion part is the hardest. it hurts really bad for the next few days. i am so happy with it!
Birth Control	Bmywink, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/7/2009 1:40:14 AM	Thank God my hair is not falling out or I'm having heavy periods that last for weeks on end. However my face is ALWAYS breaking out I have CONSTANT headaches, I have gained over FORTY pounds in the last year, have stretch marks EVERYWHERE. I have absolutely no SEX DRIVE. The way I am now has really affected my MARRIAGE, my husband tells me I am NOT the same woman he married. I am irritable and moody, with no energy to do anything. This product has made me totally miserable. The only good thing is I have not gotten pregnant but my husband is too damn scared to come near me or even suggest sex. I am 23 years old for crying out loud! I am getting it removed ASAP!!! I would not recommend this birth control method to anyone!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/4/2009 3:35:54 PM	I had the implant inserted in Oct 2008. At first it was ok, but the last few months it has become a huge problem. My periods are every week and a half and Im bleeding so much I now have to take Iron tablets to correct my body's balance. Yes its easy because I dont have to remember to take a pill everyday but the mood swings and cramps and the bleeding has become to much to handle. I have always had acne but now its on my face, my back and my chest and everything I have tried doesnt even touch it. I am getting it removed as soon as my doctor has an opening.
Birth Control	Bluerossiette, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/1/2009 7:41:52 PM	I have been on this medication for a little over half a year now. I'm a nineteen year old freshmen in college who was looking for a medication that would be effective, and still work with my busy schedue. Implanon has so far worked very well. I have a semi-athletic lifestyle, but even when I don't workout for a week i don't seem to gain as much weight with this medication as I had with others. Stomach Cramping has always been an issue for me, even without the medication, so I can't really claim that i have that side effect. I have not, however, gotten my period since the insertion of the drug. Prior to the Implanon, was on the Depo-Provera injection, and had not had my period then either. I would recomend this drug to anyone who is looking for a simple method that is very easy and effective. But remember, not every drug works the same on every person. 
Birth Control	researchfirst, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	9/1/2009 11:18:31 AM	I started using Implanon in November of '08.  Since then I have experienced zero desire for sex (which could explain the drugs effectiveness!).  I have bled about 85% of the time and when I'm not bleeding it feels like I should be.  Along with the depression, mood swings, and horrible abdominal pain; this drug makes me feel like death! The doctors keep pushing more hormones on me - This thing is coming out &amp; I hope there are no long term effects of sterilization.  I caution any woman who wants to use birth control to really read Consumer reviews first.  I learned my lesson the hard way.
Birth Control	kirstin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/27/2009 9:58:45 AM	I have been on this for 1 1/2 years.  I have had 2 kids &amp; am unsure if I want another.  This seemed like the perfect birth control.  Insertion wasn't bad.  The device feels kinda gross under your arm.  I went without a period for over 3 months.  However, after the 3 month period I bleed alot.  It is random - sometimes light, sometimes moderate.  But I seem to bleed off &amp; on for at least 1 1/2 weeks per month.  I just went thru a period of bleeding for 2 weeks straight.  I am visiting my doctor today to discuss other options.  I had no weight gain or other side effects that I'm aware of.  It is a great method of contraception, but I'm afraid it affects everyone differently.
Birth Control	kacy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	8/24/2009 5:54:22 PM	I have had Implanon in for over 1 year now. Had normal bleeding in the begining. Then 4 and a half weeks straight of bleeding then stopped or 3 days then another 4 and half weeks. Dr. Put me on a pill so i would not bleed all the time. SO why do i have the implanon in if i have to take a pill everyday anyway? I do not recommend it to anyone. It is a sex drive killer.
Birth Control	Jenn810, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	25-34	8/21/2009 10:48:15 AM	I had this put in in Jan 09 the first couple of months I had a normal period, As of right now Aug 09 I have been bleeding for a month and a half straight. I have had no sex drive my husband thinks i don't want him anymore. I am shooting 6 hour energy drinks every day to keep up with my son bacause i am tired all the time. I am gaining weight and have to work my butt off or starve to loose it again. I don't recommend it and as soon as I find something else that does not require a pill everyday i will change. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/20/2009 11:34:46 PM	I got on implanon in November of 2008 and I have absolutely loved it. I bled for the first month straight and it was pretty heavy, but since then I have not had a period. I have not had the side effects people have said on here in previous posts and it was the best thing for me. I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a contraceptive because of the ease of use and the effectiveness.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	8/14/2009 4:09:15 PM	I am 18 years and I had Implanon inserted in Dec 2008. I can't take estrogen so Implanon seemed like a good choice. It was almost painless and left a very tiny scar. At first, I spotted here and there. The blood is brown and dry looking. But I have yet to have a heavy enough flow to require tampons or pads. A panty liner if I'm wearing light colored undie. I was moody for awhile and a bit depressed, but that passed and I couldn't be happier! I have always had moderate acne and I haven't noticed it get worse. I'm fond of implanon, but it is definitely not for everyone
Birth Control	Me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	8/8/2009 11:55:22 PM	For the first year, Implanon was great. I can't say anything about decreased since I don't notice anything because I work at night and with twin toddlers, yeah. I had spotting for about a month. Nothing major. I gained 5 lbs, hormones were out of whack for the first month or so but finally stabilized or maybe I am just getting use to it. However, right after I hit my first yr of use, I started spotting/bleeding for almost 2 wks. I got 3 days break then it has been non-stop since end of May til today (Aug), that would be 3 months. I had my thyroid checked, awaiting results and will have a sonogram next wk to see what is going on. But is scheduled to have it removed in 2 wks. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/6/2009 2:23:31 AM	Love this because it's so convenient but I've had a pounding headache every day since I had it put in. Ibuprofen only takes it away for a few hours and then BOOM it's back!!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	8/5/2009 12:43:57 PM	I have been on this thing for 7 1/2 months. I plead with anyone who is going to or already is get off implanon. Even if you have one or five or maybe even more. Do not wait it out it does not go away it just gets worse. If your doctor will not take it out make them. Implanon has worked great as a birth control because I can't have sex it hurts to bad. I have 6 out of the 9 side effects, and things are only getting worse. so I say once again please please do not take or please take out the implanon. No one should go through what I have had to go through. I have a 9 month old son and its been really hard to take care of him and deal with me. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	13-18	8/3/2009 11:27:08 PM	I'm 16 yrs old, yeah i'm young to be on birth control but i get cyst that grow bigger than their suppose to be &amp; I'm irregular. And i am sexually active, sorry but yeah. And i'm on the dance team at my school and i feel weird dancing while on my menstrual, it may sound weird but that's how i fell. anyhow, the only difference is that with me is i had started like i usually do on some months for 3 days, then after that i spotted for 2 weeks. It's been about 2&amp; a half months I've been on it. I already had 5 side effects, i hope it slows down as i have it in. I'm going to see how it goes for a while longer. I think that's what everyone should do; wait &amp; see if you can handle the side effects &amp;tell your spouse &amp; family hey i might have this &amp; that but its the birth control, don't worry. ha ha i think that kinda makes some sense. But its like that saying, &quot;don't judge a book by its cover.&quot; meaning don't judge the birth control by what you hear, like bad things/good things, just try it out, like a sport or even food.ha ha don't be scared to try new things. I hope this helped anyone out there, my mom doesn't listen much to my opinions or when i try to help her out so i hope all of you ladies do:) 
Birth Control	cmsteed78, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/15/2009 11:06:34 PM	 can relate to the side effects, too, of Implanon. I have had it in for exactly 3 months (tomorrow) and for the first month it was wonderful. No period and no side effects at all. I haven't had a period except for minor spotting for 2 or 3 days. But the other side effects are so much that I have an appointment to have it taken out tomorrow. I have had a headache non-stop for 6 weeks, to the point of nausea and loss of apetite. I'm actually losing weight instead of gaining it. My doctor had diagnosed me with hormonal migraines - due to the lack of estrogen. Also, in the last 6 weeks I have become very withdrawn from my friends and family. I don't like to be around people anymore and I am extremely depressed and anxious now. I have started having panic attacks in the grocery store!! I think about death and serious illnesses all the time. I thought I was developing a brain tumor because of the headaches! Everything seems to be exaggerated - my mood swings, fatigue, no energy, no sex drive, no desire to date or even see my friends. In the last 6 weeks all I do is go to work and go home. That is not me at all! Usually you can't catch me at home! So before you get this please make sure the benefits out way the side effects for you - because it doesn't for me. I can't wait until my appointment in the morning to have it taken out!!

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/1/2009 4:18:53 PM	I am going on the last year of having the Implanon in. The first 8 months wwere a little crazy. i never knew when i was going to start my period.  After that i became regular, I knew when my period was going to start every month. I have not gained any  weight from this and i dont have acne because of this birth control. I have been very happy with this method and I have recommended it to many of my friends who are also using this method now and are happy with the results. I am not ready to have another kid so i will opt for this birth control next year when i have to take the old one out!!The only thing I can tell you is wait it out a little bit and give your body a chance to get used to it before you give up
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/28/2009 1:31:10 PM	I am a 21yr old caucasian female with a history of severe menstrual pain and painful ovarian cysts. I had the Implanon put in 12/08. I had no period until 3/09 which lasted about a month. I haven't had any spotting or periods since. I would recommend this for women who share my problems. No period equals no pain. I have not had any other side effects except NO SEX DRIVE. It doesn't bother me too much, but the man in my life has a different opinion. I am currently seeking answers to this problem. All in all I've had it 7 months and I would recommend it to others. Although some of the reviews I've read have me a little worried of what may happen the longer I have it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/23/2009 2:45:05 PM	I've had the birth control for a month and I am glad I did it.  It was painless to have inserted and I've had one period but other then that no spotting.  I have lost 5 lbs this month, not changing anything in my routine, and I have had no other side effects.  I read that a lot of people had severe acne, but I've never had acne so this may be why I still don't even after Implanon.  I did have some swelling for the first two weeks.  I've tried many different types of birth control, but I always gained weight and I would have severe headaches. I love this product, and hopefully my feelings wont change in the months to come.
Birth Control	bluerose26, 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	3		19-24	6/23/2009 2:38:42 PM	I have been on this for a lil over 7 months. When i first started it i didnt have a period for 3 months. That one lasted 2 weeks. then now its been over 3 months and I havent had my period again yet. I have gained almost 20lbs since i started this birth control. I get slight cramps around the time im supposed to have a period. I seem to be more moody too. So far Im not pregnant so this method works for that purpose.
Birth Control	Sarah F, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	35-44	6/23/2009 8:40:56 AM	I had the implanon inserted in May 08. I am a 39 year old woman. I am overweight by about 30lbs but in the last 3 months I've lost 14lbs by changing my diet/activity level.At first I was thrilled: after one normal period and a couple of 1 day episodes of spotting, I had no bleeding. I didn't have mood swings or weight gain. After trying the oral contraceptive pill, the Depo injection and the Mirena coil with unacceptable side-effects I thought I'd finally found a good method of contraception for me!Until now, that is...I had my smear nearly 4 weeks ago and since then I have been bleeding almost every day. I worried so called GP who said this is not unknown. My smear result has come back normal. I am to keep a record of bleeding and go see her in a month. At which point she may want to presribe an oral contraceptive pill to help control bleeding.Except I don't want to go on the pill at all. If I continue to bleed like this I will have to conclude that Implanon is a very effective form of contraception simply because it prevents one from having sex!I will have it removed and will make an appointment to have myself sterilised.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	6/18/2009 10:36:46 AM	I would definitely not recommend this birth control to anyone!! I've been on it for about 2 &amp; 1/2 months, my hair is falling out so bad, that I have two bald spots on each side of my head &amp; its only getting worse.  I've had horrible mood swings, no sex drive, depressed, chest pain, &amp; really bad migraines!! To make matters worse I'm always tired &amp; have been having horrible muscle weakness.  My muscle weakness is so bad that I can't grip my son's bottles, I can barely hold my son sometimes or even move! My hands already hurt from typing already! Another down side was that I gained 15lbs so far!! Still going up! I'm getting more stretch marks now than from when I was prego! I work out everyday &amp; do cardio for an hour everyday....so I really don't know what else to do.  I've been trying to convince my OB to take it out but he won't.  I'm going to ask one more time &amp; if he won't take it out I'm going to a different OB! Please do not take this!! I prefer the depo better!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	6/16/2009 8:47:52 PM	I have been on this birth control since Dec. 08 and its now June 09. My period cycle has been all over the place. I bleed for two-three weeks at a time. Stop for a week or two then bleed again. Sometimes its extremlly light (spotting) to moderate bleeding. I still suffer from terrible cramps.  I occasionally break out with acne on my face and chest.  I also suffered from some weight gain. Overall, I don't like it, and want to get on another type of birth control.  If you don't like pills this is perfect, but if you don't mind taking them I would advice you to continue to take them. I never know when my cycle is coming on and going off, and now that its summer I really don't like that. Make sure you always ask the doc of all the possible side effects before getting on anything. 
Birth Control	Globetrotter, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/12/2009 4:23:40 AM	Wow - my experience with Implanon seems like the polar opposite of many folks here. Due to my wacky schedule and missing pills, I looked into implants when I was living in the UK a few years ago, and Implanon is what my clinic suggested. I had it in for three years, and just got it replaced in the US recently. Never had a symptom, don't menstruate, suspect my sex drive is lower than it would be, but overall no complaints. One thing I would recommend - before my UK doctor put me on Implanon, we did a trial - using a birth control pill with the same active ingredient as Implanon, I believe, and which carries the same dose every day rather than having the &quot;week off&quot; that my previous Ovcon pills had. The trial months went well (I stopped menstruating almost immediately), so we decided to put in the implant. I never had very heavy periods or cramping, so maybe I've just been very lucky - but doing a trial with pills before putting in a three-year implant seemed and seems like a reasonable strategy.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	6/3/2009 10:30:32 AM	I'm almost 21 and last year I had the implanon implanted in June. Come August I had spotting that lasted til the end of September. Although it was so light all I needed was a panty liner I still bled for almost 2 months. Its effective in being a birth control. However, come February I began spotting again. This time around it was a little heavier and needed use of tampons. It is now June and I just stopped spotting. I gained weight in the last two months and the bleeding was affecting my sex life. I also had to get multiple tests ran to see why I was bleeding. Come to find out the lining of my cervix was roughly 2mm a normal womans lining is between 6.5-7mm. I was premenapausal at 20. I don't reccommend this birth control especially for women under the age of 20.
Birth Control	NeverAgain, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	5/27/2009 4:03:41 PM	I'm a 25yr old healthy(not overweight) African American woman. I've had the implanon for about 3months and I have to say I hate it!! I love the fact that I don't have to take a pill everyday but the irregular bleeding is just too much. I got my period 2 weeks after inserting the implanon and it lasted for over 3weeks!!! My doctor had to give me a nuva ring just to stop the bleeding and I was still spotting! Now my period is back on and it shows no signs of stopping again. Yes it's a great birth control b/c I'm always bleeding I can never have sex!! I just made an appointment to get it removed tomorrow!!!
Birth Control	samanthao2006@hotmail.com, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/26/2009 8:12:17 AM	I've only had the implanon for about a month.. But before I had it put in, my Dr. pretty much told me no complaining before the 6 month mark because the side effects and spotting are probably high. I've spotted this whole month &amp;had cramps worse than any other period..(Midol is my new best friend) but compared to birth control pills (which I can't remember to take) or Mirena (which they HAVE to put inside you while youre on your period) I think I made the best decision for me. I had my son just 4 months ago, &amp;I'm happy that I'm preventing pregnancy for 3 yrs, its the perfect amount of time to reconsider another baby.That pain is still fresh in my mind, so the side effects of the Implanon are bearable. Plus, I knew what I was getting into. I felt like I had mood swings from birth control pills, anything that puts hormones into your body can affect you, so its not like this is a shock. I definetly insist on reading the entire pamphlet that they have at the dr.'s office. I havent had it very long to make an &quot;experienced&quot; review, but overall I'm happy with it.

Expect to be very moody. For the first 3 months there was no period. And I hope you don't plan to take a home pregnacy test. You'll show positive. You have to get blood tested. Now I have alot of spotting. VERY low sex drive. And cramps seem to be worse before an actual period.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	19-24	5/19/2009 12:04:03 AM	I got the implant about 8 months ago and I spotted for 6 months straight, it has just recently stopped.  I also had a decreased sex drive for the first 6 months, this has recently changed as well.  However, now I have horrible breast tenderness, any little nudge kills me!  The implant is very effective, but I'm getting it out tomorrow, not worth it.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	5/6/2009 2:13:51 PM	have been on implanon since feb 2009.  At first loved it!  But I have been &quot;spotting&quot; consistantly for over a month now.  Very inconvienient.  Hoping it will stop soon, plan on giving it a few more months before talking about removal. 
Birth Control	unsatisfiedwithimplanon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/30/2009 1:06:51 PM	I am a 23 year old, native american/caucasian woman and have been on this since Jan. 08. The first 2-3 months were great; no spotting, no abnormal periods, no side effects at all. However, after that I started spotting every single day for about 8 months straight. It lightened up for a few weeks, but now I just have really long periods or a period every two weeks. Worse than that, I have noticed a HUGE unexplained change in my moods; I cry easily, I get angry over the tiniest things, I snap at my husband for nothing and afterwards I sit and can't figure out why I am so mad over practically nothing, because I have a wonderful and loving husband and I feel so lucky to have him. I find myself feeling irritated often, so much so that it causes headaches. I also feel anxious a lot. Before this, I never had any sort of mood problem and I've always been a positive and optimistic person and I still have the same type of outlook, but out of nowhere, my mood shifts, leaving me wondering why I feel so upset. Yesterday I even went to a pharmacy to see if I could find a mood enhancing supplement because I have been so puzzled by my sudden change in moods, but now that I have read all of these reviews, I think I have figured it out.The ease of use and effectiveness of Implanon have been great, but the side effects SUCK big time! (yes, that's the technical term for it, haha) I don't think I can recommend this to anybody who wants to keep their sanity.

I recommend it for people who have a crazy schedule and don't remember to take the pill every day at the same time. I have my card that reminds me when I need to have it replaced. It is Great! I did not have a period the first 6 months I was on it. Then I went back to once a month but the perk is I will only spot for a day maybe 2 and I am done until the next month! yeah! I like that I don't have to worry about it.
Other	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		4/24/2009 10:25:58 AM	ive been on implanon for about 6 months and i really like it. im a little bit more moody, but its something i can handle. i get my period RARELY (which is great) and my sex drive has actually increased! really no physical problems at all. i love it.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	4/19/2009 12:40:23 PM	I started this drug in July 2008. I spotted for one whole month, since then I have not had a period. I began taking sertaline &amp; hydroxyzine because I was crying so easily and very anxious that people did not like to be around me. since Ive taken the anxiety and depression pills I feel better. Then I noticed i gained ten pounds in weight in one month. I usually maintain a normal weight with diet and excercise. Im still doing everything as usual but Im now over 200 lbs and im 5'6&quot;. My back aches and I feel very heavy. I never had problems with acne and now my face is red all the time. I will take this out at my next doctor's visit. I bet I will not need that depression/anxiety pill anymore thereafter. I will go back to using the rythm method when I get implanon taken out. 
Birth Control	princessnay, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/10/2009 1:06:10 PM	Well I got it in on 03/30/09 I was scared aty first and thought about all the side effects and then I thought...All birth control has the SAME side effects...I like the implant...The only thing I didnt like was I had a longer period the first time in 6 months and I didnt like the nasty bruise that I got but thats because I have senitive skin..I would suggest this if you cant remember to take the pill everyday...You are safe for three years...My friend got ther 5 year IUD and she told me how they insert it and it seems VERY painful compared to the implant...And they say you are going to scare...You only have like a little tiny pin mark...Im going to continue this birth control...
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	2	Female	19-24	3/31/2009 3:49:02 PM	After reading all these other reviews, I feel much better knowing that I am not the only one going through all these CRAZY side effects. I got the implanon in July of 08, when I was 20, and the first few months were GREAT, i had no periods (I didnt miss them at all), the only side effect I noticed was a little moodiness, but after being pregnant, I figured it was just postpartum... normal stuff. But in the past few months I have had a period NON stop, I start BAWLING crying over the stupidest little things, I have a headache almost every day, Ive tried to break things off with my boyfriend and the father of my child at least once a month, I have food cravings as if I were pregnant... Im still on the fence whether or not I want to get it taken out, because I dont have health insurance and I dont have any other form of birthcontrol. But I definitely would not have gotten it in the first place if I had read these reviews beforehand.
Birth Control	hkn25, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	3/30/2009 1:23:43 AM	I had implanon put in in August 2008.  I had my first baby in April 2008 and my doctor informed me that 'The depot' shot was the way to go, not happy with the weight I gained from the shot, I decided I would try implanon.  It was great in the beginning, I had one period and a little bit of spotting for the first two months.  By the end of October I started to become depressed, I had these crazy mood swings and my sex drive was basically in ruins.  And my weight kept climbing!!  I eat well and I try excercise once a day if I can.  But gaining 30lbs in 8 months is not normal! My doctor suggested it was 'water weight' and put me on potassium pills that did absolutely nothing accept make me pee more, I lost no weight. As soon as I can get an appointment, I'm getting this thing taken out!!! If Implanon was the 'perfect all round birth control' every woman would be using it, but sadly, thats just not the case. WOMEN BEWARE!
Birth Control	greenstategirl, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	3/26/2009 5:36:43 PM	I got my Implanon put in on 08/08/2008. At first I thought it was great until I started spotting non stop two weeks after I go it put in, the spotting never really went way until like two weeks ago (todays date is 03/26/2009). So I thought I was pregnant but luckily the test came out negative. Also when my period stopped my breast started to hurt really bad to the point were the bra rubbing against it irritated me. I also gained about 30lbs while on the Implanon, considering I have always been fit and a healthy eater throughout my life, so gaining 30lbs out of no where was not fun nor was it a confidence booster. I would try diets and exercising but noting seemed to work, then I tried doing a body detox cleans and usually I lose from 10- 15 lbs, and this time I only lost 5. Besides that I also got really moody (and trust me that can be a relationship downer) and had very little sex drive which my boyfriend understood but all of these things made me lose who I really am. Im not some fat, moody, boring girl. I like to be fit and have fun, but with this thing in my arm it has became almost impossible. So I finally decided I'm going to take it out on Tuesday and live my life like I should, I mean I'm only 18 and I should feel confident in about my self, but the Implanon has taken that way from me, SO I REMOVING IT! Think TWICE before you get this. ITS NOT WORTH IT!

Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/19/2009 11:48:34 AM	I had mine put in July '08.  I have always ahd a very irregular cycle, and with this method I had one period in October and none since!  It was a little unnerving at first (took a pregnancy test every 2 months), but I got used to it.  I have had gas/bloating and for a while I was experiencing anxiety to the point where I thought I was going insane.  That has passed, though. I've never had PMS, and I think that makes a big difference.  PMS symptoms seem to get REALLY overblown by this medication.  I would definitely avoid this medication if you'v had any bad experiences with PMS.

The first month I had my period for 2 weeks and haven't had it since.  The only side effect that I have noticed is that I'm losing a little bit more hair than before having Implanon inserted.  I don't have to worry about taking a pill every morning and it lasts for 3 years.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/9/2009 10:30:16 PM	i am extremely pleased with the effectiveness and ease of implanon. Despite this i am having some odd symptoms such as a period one every two weeks, but that just started occuring. Also i have noticed a slight increase in acne at times, and in my weight(though other factors such as starting college a month after getting implanon may also play a factor). Other than these things it has helped so much in birth control aspects because before i would always forget to take the pill. I would definitely reccommend this as a great alternative to the pill or depo. 
Birth Control	Beth, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/9/2009 3:24:17 PM	I had Implanon inserted on 1/14/09 and have been incredibly pleased with it. I had to use it because I cannot take birth control that contains estrogen, so my options were limited. First of all, the insertion was nearly painless and I only had some moderate soreness and swelling for the first week or two. I had about 10 days of light spotting when I switched from the Ortho pill to Implanon, and have not had any bleeding since. I get a little bit moody around the normal time of my period and have some acne. However, I've had periodic problems with acne since I was young and have been under some tremendous stress lately so I'm not sure if the acne is a result of the Implanon or due to other environmental factors. I've also lost about 15 lbs since I started this birth control, which was a concern (and the reason I chose Implanon over the Depo shot) since I am already overweight. I have highly recommended this birth control to friends who have blood pressure or emotional problems while on traditional birth control. If I choose to continue birth control in the future, I will definitely choose Implanon again.
Birth Control	djordan, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	3/6/2009 2:49:27 AM	I have had, and i am still having a horrible experience with this medication. Before implanon i was thirty pounds lighter, more outgoing, and had LESS FACIAL HAIR. The mood swings and the constant torment of looking into the mirror to see what this drug has done to me is so painful. I have such bad acne that it is scarring my face, i have no self esteem, i don't want to go out into public beacause of my acne and my recent facial hair growth.I am not claiming to have ever been beautiful, but i am dark haired, and have an olive skin tone. When i was younger acne was a joke, because i may have had one or two pimples a month MAX. I was twenty when i had the implanon put in and i will be 21 in june. I have never felt so bad about myself! I excercise, and eat right and still gain weight. I retain water better than an aquarium. My arms and legs have been hit the worst by the water retention. I even went on a no salt diet and took diuretics and still only dropped about 2LBs and of course gained it all beck and then some. I have no sex drive, i am constantly snappy, and feel secluded from the things i once loved. This drug has completely ruined my life as of present, i am going to have it taken out and go back on the pill. I still have to pay for the hair removal on my face for $2 a minute! DEFINATELY STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRUG in my opinion
Birth Control	pommmiegirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/1/2009 12:55:07 PM	I knew something was up when I realized I'd gained so much weight in just a short amount of time.  I thought it was the week-long cruise I went on, adn figured I'd drop that extra 5 lbs after I got back home and ate normally again... wrong! I gained even more weight after I quit eating 24/7 and finally I realized it could be my Implanon, which I got in I think September of 08 and I'm getting it taken out Tuesday March 4th.  I HATE it! I, too, have experienced psychotic depression, horrible irritability/mood-swings (I can't believe my boyfriend didn't shoot me ever!), I wanted to cry, scream, break up, all in a matter of a few months.  I think I gained 30 lbs on this stupid thing! However, it is very effective, convenient, and I have ZERO bleeding (I was on Depo before this and that makes you gain weight too), which is awesome. If you want to keep your sanity, DO NOT go on Implanon.  Its efficacy is NOT worth the horrible side effects, including complete loss of self-esteem and sex drive!

I thought I was the only one suffering from depression, anxiety, erratic mood swings, complete loss of sex drive (Im only 20 so that was devastating for my relationship), bloating, and severe body aches. Luckily my hair is ok but my skin has been pretty bad, not sure if thats my age or the implant. I have no period at all so I dont know when the monthly PMS is starting so it feels like Im going crazy. Thank god my boyfriend is so understanding and has stuck by me even though I have tried to break it off every a month since Ive gotten this stupid thing because of the depression and being easily irritated.  I was so desperate to find out what was making me feel this way that I was prepared to do almost anything! The implant is very convenient but Im starting to think the side affects arent worth it anymore. Its nice to finally know what is causing these problems.

I haven't experienced any significant weight gain or hair loss. I do have weird hot flashes and sometimes the spot where the rod is itches but other than that I am completely happy!
Birth Control	jw, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/26/2009 12:07:29 AM	I got the implant at the end of April 2008.  The first month was great.  After that I began spotting and have only stopped for one month since then.  My doctor put me on estrogen patches to try and stop the spotting and that didn't work.  I have been on them for around 3 months now.  I started feeling really fatigued probably 6 months after I got it put in and thought it was another one of my medications but after reading these comments I think I've changed my mind.  I rarely had acne up until the last month or so and now it is on my face, neck, and back.  I have always been an eater but now I feel like I cannot control myself and just want to eat everything in sight!  I have an appointment with my doctor in a month and I think I am going to have it taken out.
Birth Control	bigred, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	2/25/2009 2:20:12 PM	I have had Implanon for a year and give or take six months.  In the beginning my bleeding was really heavy and spontaneous. Now I have a moderate to light period once a month.  I do find myself eating everything in sight and having cravings as if I were pregnant.  I have tried to start a diet or new lifestyle and it seems as if I have an addiction to food.  Before I had Implanon I was doing well on my new lifestyle. But life after Implanon has been one big binge.  I can't control myself.  Often times I wonder is it partly the Implanon at work in my fight to change my diet and lifestyle.

The spotting everyday, dizziness, appetite issues and fatigue are ridiculous! The first month was ok but it went downhill from there and from reading these reviews I don't imagine it getting ANY better. I want it out! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/18/2009 10:06:13 PM	 I am a African American female in good shape I got the bc put in on January 5th 2008 its now Feb. 18 2009 and I have yet to stop BLEEDING!, I am always hungry! And some times I feel so weak I dont even want to get up. On the rare day I do stop bleeding and try to be intimate I am so self conscious that I will start my period again while in the process I cant enjoy the moment. I want to stop bleeding so bad but I dont want to take it out because the doctor said that if I do , that might throw my body off balance agin and it might take another year for my period to become regular

There is NO pattern for bleeding. I'll bleed for months, sometimes a full on period sometimes random spotting then i'll stop for a few days and it will come back. I didn't really gain weight, maybe a pound or two. I completely lost my sex drive, had hair loss, and am always hormonal and emotional. i'm going to the doctor tomorrow to see about having it removed.

Heavy, I went threw a box of tampons in two days. Think about how much money you spen on Tampons! Doctors said this would be the best birth control for me, But 3 weeks after i got it put in i found out i have PCOS and that the birth control isn't doing nothing but sitting in my arm. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, Consider something else.
Birth Control	lexzeppelin89, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/16/2009 5:57:39 AM	I'm 19 years old and got the Implanon inserted beginning of Oct '08. The insertion was virtually painless, so that's a plus. Then I spotted for 3 months straight. I stuck with it, and now it's stopped. But my hair has been falling out in clumps and I'm hungry all the time. I haven't gained weight but I've tried healthy diets like Special K and I can't lose a single pound of my extra post partum weight. I'm moody from time to time, but who isn't? I'm considering switching to the pill after reading all these other bad reviews!
Birth Control		5	5	5			1/15/2009 11:29:11 PM	I have been on Implanon since April 2008 and I have had a great experience with it. I am a 32 year old African-American in decent shape. I got on Implanon because I was tired of taking the pill and I did not care for the Nuvaring.For the first 3 months I had very light periods during the time I was suppose to come on. For the last 6 months I have had very light spotting (just during my normal cycle, no other time) or none at all. It has been great!My only negative experience was about at month 5 I bled after sex twice, but none since then. Other then that I have had no side effects (knock on wood) and I pray that this continues to work because it has been wonderful!!

Its started out good and then I noticed I began to lose my sex drive, become very moody and aggitated, develop skin problems and MY HAIR FELL OUT!!! I do not recommmend this only any level. Much easier to just take a pill....trust me!
Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female		1/12/2009 10:16:26 AM	Did this drug contribute to my breast cancer?I had implanon inserted in June 2008 to alleviate my anxieties about forgetting to take the pill (was waking up paranoid in the middle of the night!). As far as ease of use, it is great, but that is the only good thing I have to say about it.  I was spotting 3-4 weeks out of every month with 3-4 days of heavier bleeding. I gained 15 pounds in 6 months with excellent diet and exercise habbits. Occassional pain, itching and irritation at the implant site. After 6 months I was fed up and had it removed. The next day I was diagnosed with a high grade aggressive breast cancer. I am only 35 yo with no genetic factor toward breast cancer. I know that everyone reacts differently, but until doctors start analyzing patients for the proper birth control drugs for their bodies, I believe this may be a dangerous drug to have on the market.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/10/2009 6:00:14 PM	I feel so much better after reading the reviews! I thought i was just crazy. And im not trying to give people a bad taste in their mouth because this does work for some people just not me. First of all i am a 20 year old, african american female, and im married. I got it in may of 2008 and its now jan 2009 and i have gained 40 pounds! And the funny thing is i work out and i fast for for the lord as well and i still gain!!! I am also ALWAYS depressed! i didnt think anything of it until my husband pointed it out that i act like im pregnant. I cry everyday or every other day, i gave suicidal thoughts, i am always tired but can never sleep. and im always hungry. I am going to get off of it asap, but it may work for someone else. My biggest complaint is the depression EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! If only women didnt have to take bc lol
Birth Control	brebme, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/8/2009 3:58:10 PM	I hate this thing!  I feel like crap all the time.  I have had it in for 7 months and I have gained 35lbs and am still gaining weight.  I eat super healthy and work out at least once a day.  I do not recommend this to anyone! I am getting it taken out on the 15th.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	1/1/2009 4:19:50 PM	My goodness. I thought I was the only one experiencing all these horrible side effects. My implanon was inserted July of 2008. I had it removed December 31, 2008. At first, it was great. I had a normal period for the first three months, then it stopped. I haven't seen Aunt Flow since early October. My hair was falling out by the handfuls, and my doctor said it wasn't related, but I know so many women who have experienced hair loss, as well. My moodswings are extreme, and my dpression has really been hitting hard. Sex hurts too much even with lube, cuz my personal dryness is so bad. Plus I have this irritation and discharge from my vajayjay. I kept thinking I had an infection but I have taken so much antibiotic its got to be this stupid bc! I have gained 17lbs in the past four months. My face is broken out like a teenager. Whats worse is that I didn't break out when I was a teen! I am going back to Nuva Ring. My husband and I even separated for a short time because he couldn't handle my moods and I really tried not to attack him. I am so glad I got this thing out of my arm. Now I just have to repair all the damage it has caused. 
Birth Control	penut, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	12/30/2008 5:47:51 PM	When I first recieved bc it was ok the first three days.In november I got it put in and it is now december, I want to stop bleeding. Yhea, it works because your man don't want you if you are bleeding and moody everyday. I don't like 7 days, but 7 sound better than 5 weeks. I am getting it taken out on January 9. I want to celebrate christmas, New years, and definately Valentine with my husband, plus my anniversary. Losing weight, moody, acne on face, and hair loss. The worst a whole draw of pad/tampons. My husband hate those things. But he like to see it come and go.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	12/30/2008 1:38:01 PM	The first 2 months were great. I had no period as I was nursing. However, the last 4 months have been completely crappy. My periods last anywhere from 1-4 weeks with manybe a 1 week reprieve in between...if I'm lucky. I'm moody and irritable and am interested in another method!
Birth Control	P Rast, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	12/29/2008 4:32:46 AM	I have had Implanon for a little over a year and the only thing I like about this bc is that I don't have to remember a pill everyday.  My periods don't last days, they last months and it's moderate to heavy bleeding. My side effects include:severe cramps, mood swings, NO sex drive, larger and sore breasts, more than normal acne, and severe migranes.  I chose this method because it was going to be the cheapest without insurance and i liked the idea of no pills, but as soon as I have the money to have it taken out, it's coming out.  I would choose a pill any day over this.  I have also gained about 30-40 lbs in a year from the b.c.  I am buying new clothes every two months.  So in the long run pills are cheaper cause as much money as i have spent on clothes that are now to little i could have bought a year supply of pills.  So if you want my opinion of whether you should get it or not run as far away from it as you can..... and to top it all off i have now started getting hungry in the middle of the night which is not normal for me and staying depreesed all the time.  I feel like I am pregnant but if I was the baby would be dead from all of this blood that i am putting out everyday.....
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	12/23/2008 2:43:46 PM	The first two months on Implanon were great. No periods and no troubles. The past three months I have had three periods in one month, very irregular bleeding at unknown timing and very strong periods within the last few weeks. I am meeting my OBGYN in a couple weeks to remove and switch methods. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	12/13/2008 1:07:08 AM	I have been on Implanon for about a year, and in the last three months, I have had severe periods that last weeks, mood swings, acne (not just on my face), fatigue, moderate depression, itchy-burning vajajay, constipation, pain in my back, knees, ankles, nausea, cramps, constant bloating, my hair is coming out in clumps in the shower, I either have no appetite, or I am ravenous, my skin has become rough with some dark rashes, I am in a constant state of PMS, my boyfriend is on his last nerve, and I have bought out all the local stores of their tampon supplies and midol. As a &quot;birth control&quot; it works really well. I don't particularly feel like having sex when I am having all the above symptoms, and my boyfriend doesn't particularly feel like &quot;getting intimate&quot; when I have been constantly biting his head off due to horrible mood swings. So, yes, as a contraceptive, implanon prevents babies, however, it comes at a high cost. It has wreaked havoc on my physical, mental and emotional health. My quality of life is crap, and I believe that the long term effects of implanon could be drastic, that's why I'm getting mine removed next week, and I am not looking back!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/10/2008 1:07:57 AM	At first I had my period everyday for a long time (3 mos) but now I have not had it for a while. For me it works great because I do not have to worry about taking a pill everyday since I am always busy. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	12/9/2008 9:44:29 PM	It just makes me bleed all the time I have been bleeding for three months now. Of course I have not been heavy the whole time or I would probably be dead.
Birth Control	bbaumg, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	13-18	11/25/2008 11:21:51 PM	I have a lot of dizzy spells. Im really moody and emotional. My periods last for a long time, but its only spotting and nothing heavy at all.  I get them only once a month around the time i usually did before i got the implanon. Ive gained weight already and ive only had it about 3 mo. I get sore around the implant everyonce in a while. Im scared about any other side effects. However minus all the negatives, its really effective and its semi permanent so i think its worth it. Ill stick with it a while longer to see if anything changes. Ive experienced no irregular acne or breakouts.
Birth Control	Jennette1979, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/19/2008 12:13:42 PM	The Implanon was put in my arm in January 08 and the most I can remember from the birth control is having one period that was extremely heavy with moderate cramping.  I have not had a period since June 08.  I have had some head aches but am not sure if it was the birth control.  Though I was a little worried about not having periods.  I am satisfied with the birth control.  I would recommend you discuss your birth control options with your doctor before trying any type of birth control.  I have heard some bad stories about this form of birth conrol but I would say that my experience with it has been a good one.

Birth Control	Mck_babe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	11/5/2008 12:36:51 AM	Well at least now I know I am not the only one dealing with all the negative effects. Started implant in May 2008 its now Nov 2008, first two months had heavier periods but have had nothing since then- kinda worring me. I thought I could deal with a heavier flow if thats all the side effects would be.. boy was I wrong!! After the 2 month the SEVERE ACNE started on face, chest and back; Massive hair loss- I would cry myself to sleep thinking that I would be bald before long; just within the last 2 weeks my breasts have gotten larger, severely tender- I nearly threw my 2yr old across the room when she crawled across me; along with weight going way down by 25-30 lbs and back up again to the same you can add depression, fatigue, loss of appitate, NO SEX DRIVE!! I mean come on , I am only 25 and my husband is very attractive... before the implant it was at least an everyday thing but now I am lucky if I actually want to once a week. And that one time when it does happen, its still not enjoyable for me. So that makes me want to do it even less. So LADIES, my vote would be to just go some other route. Mine is gonna come out as soon as the DR. can get me in... maybe the good ole days will return!

HOWEVER IT CAUSED EACH PERIOD TO LAST APPROX. 15-21 DAYS. I HAD TO BE PUT ON ESTROGEN TWICE. DECIDED TO HAVE IT REMOVED AFTER THE 6 MONTH POINT. FIGURED SINCE I HAD TO TAKE A PILL ALONG SIDE THE IMPLANT, IT REALLY WASN'T WORTH IT. THE ADDED JOLT OF HORMONES ON A IRREGULAR BASIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR MY BODY.

For the first 12 months i only got my period every 90 days but now my period has stopped altogether. I have started to lose hair, i've gained about 25 pounds, i grew facial hair, i have dark splotches and acne on my face, im very moody, and i have absolutely NO sex drive! which is interfering with my relationship. so be cautious before getting this!

Birth Control	Denise, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	25-34	8/1/2008 11:52:30 PM	I have had the implanon for one year on the 3rd of august. For the most part I am very satified with the product. The first months were the best! No bleeding, cramping or any kind of negative side effects and best of all no worry of pregnancy. Recently, the last couple of months I have had brown spotting almost everyday which is very annoying. The my hair started to fall out! I mean my hair is all over the house, in the food and in the car. This is very annoying also. I plan to have it removed. But it is so convenient, so Im kinda on the fence, but I do want to have a active sex life which is not possible on this birth control.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	13-18	7/22/2008 3:56:29 PM	I Was on the pill then the patch before this. i am only 18 so i do not want any children in the next 3 years, it seamed like a Perfect solution... SOOOOO WRONG!! after four months of straight spotting, HUGE hormonal headaches, SEVERE acne, and almost breaking up with me boyfriend of 2 years due to the mood swings. i would make sure you are willing to either pay to have it incerted and removed if your insurance doesnt cover it and you have my same side effects. however on the contrary it is a great semi-permenent solution for young girls.

Have been on for over a year.  They love it.  Almost no periods. No weight gain, but they exercise and swim alot and watch what they eat.I would recommend this to any mother!
Birth Control	25-34 Female 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	7/14/2008 2:49:50 PM	The drug is very effective, BUT you will have very long periods. One to two weeks with no break. I may change to a different medication after my 3 years ends.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	7/6/2008 10:21:23 PM	I have this in since July of 2007 and I thought I found the perfect birth control, until about 6 months ago. The only person I seem to like is my son, I don't want anything to with sex, and my face breaks out more. My husband says I have changed since I've been on this. Other than those things, I would have found this to be VERY satisfying.
Birth Control	nightjar, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	7/4/2008 4:31:37 PM	After several years of depo provera jabs I thought this would provide an even better solution ie no periods and no jabs!I have had about 16 months with very few symptoms but in the last few months have gained weight (not much and this could be too much chocolate!) and over the last few months my periods have returned to pre pill/depo days.  They arent heavy just after 7 years period free I would rather be that way.  Reading reviews this seems to be not abnormal.Upsides no contraception to worry about at all.Downsides: periods 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/27/2008 10:11:14 PM	I find this form of birth control to be extremely effective.  I have had it for 7 months.  My boyfriend and I are really bad about using condoms and I haven't gotten pregnant.  The only downside is that I have spotting a lot but never more than 1 panty liner per day.
Birth Control	Felicia, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/19/2008 5:26:06 PM	I was very scared of getting this because of all the experiences reported. It is the most awesome birth control I have ever been on. The insertion was painless, you forget its even there, and the worries of pregnancy are forgotten. I had an extended period that lasted approx 10 days. But that has been it for 3 months. I have had it for 3 months and it will be my next birth control should I choose to have any. There is such an ease with this product. I recommend it to all who want something easy and semi-permanent. It is AWESOME! I have actually lost weight more quickly after my second child than I did with my first. It is such an amazing product.

I kept an honest food diary and exercised but still managed to gain weight. I had my implant removed 2 weeks ago now and starting to feel much better, mood swings have stopped and a lot less emotional. Weight is down by 2lbs as well so thats something. I have friends who have the implant and have had no problems at all, but we are all different. If it dosent work for you then get it taken out and try something else.

I am not pregnant but I have pretty much been miserable the whole time. I use to have light three day periods- now I have excessively heavy ten to fourteen day periods.I go through about 100 tampons during this time because the flow is so heavy. I have been so moody that my husband is considering divorce and as I type this I have a headache that is just about to blind me. I have back pain so bad all the time that it hurts to stand up after I have been sitting. The risk of pregnancy is looking better to me than all this pain. I am having this taken out asap. 
Birth Control	galikali, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/11/2008 8:54:35 AM	Been using it for 1 year 3 months and I love it.  First, three months of light almost constant bleeding and then nothing.  Now I am sexually active again, my periods have started again.  Maybe my body is desperate to ovulate?  Since I felt nauseous and moody on oral contraceptive I think Implanon is fantastic.

My hormones have been off the charts.  My mood swings were aweful, the headaches have been bad. A little depression with anxiety.  My arm hurts on and off since I had inserted in my arm.  Shortly, after I got inserted, I came down with bronchitis that lasted for two months.

Constant break through bleeding. And i never used to be the type to cry for no reason and be moody, but since this was put in I have had all that. Im not sure how i feel about this yet, I will give it alittle time.

Cramps and tender breasts during months I dont get my period. Knew what to expect since Doctor gave me the pill form to try for 3-4 months to see how my body would react.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/1/2008 10:46:02 PM	I have been on it for about 4 months now.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/29/2007 12:00:45 AM	I have had it for 8 months, I have not had a period this entire time, I really like that however I do get cramps and moody when I normally should have it. I had problems with the pill and being nauseated and this does not cause that at all!
Other	Marisa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/21/2007 10:05:07 AM	I actually had implanon for 3 years (original inserted when living overseas) and recently had a new one put in.  I had painful periods and since I started implanon, it stopped my period, so no more pain.  It has been the best thing for me.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	12/16/2007 2:36:20 PM	It made my breast fill up with milk (then it would go away and come back), got me very depressed, and a 15 lb. increase in weight in 4 months. I had it taken out within 5 months of having it placed and all sypmtoms went away except the weight. I never got a period while on this medication. 
Birth Control	Shannon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	12/15/2007 11:57:37 PM	Extreme change in menstruation. Menstrating for months at a time and with a very heavy flow.  I used to have 3 day periods that were fairly light.  I wasn't expecting this!  Well, I shouldn't complain, I'm not pregnant!!  But, then again, when would I have a chance to get pregnant?! :)

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/29/2007 6:08:52 PM	Well I am on my 4th month. And I have had one week (combined) with NO BLEEDING. My insides become sore from tampons every day, and my exterior down there gets sore from pads every day. I alternate between the two, but this is a little ridiculus!I also have very bad adominal pain, leg pain. My face is actually breaking out! I have never had an issue with acne! I am now very quiet and don't have much to say to anybody as well. Which is not me.I have read that if you do bleed on this, then expect to have it for the long haul! I am calling the doctor and getting it removed if this isn't cleared up by Christmas! Every birth control is different for each person. If you are unsure, i would go with something less drastic.
Birth Control	shaun adams, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	11/27/2007 9:03:52 AM	I've had mine in for 6 months now. Slightly alarming breast lumpiness, but my doc says I'm okay.  Also, I haven't had any periods though I do get some depression and cramp occasionally. (I started on this after 9 years on Depo shots, so I didn't actually want to have periods.) Overall, I'm pleased.

Birth Control		4	5	4			10/12/2007 1:04:22 AM	I am just beginning my 3rd month of using implanon.  So far it has worked for birth control.  However, I have had random side effects like a rash under my left breast, abnormal acne on my face, and I had two periods during September.  Also I noted some slight symptoms of depression.  Nothing full blown, but I would cry at really random times.  Overall it has been fine, I am waiting for the next couple months to get over so I can see how my body settles in with this drug.
