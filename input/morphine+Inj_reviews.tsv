Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/13/2012 7:22:32 PM	I had major surgery in my brain stem. I was in terrible pain after the surgery so they decide to put me on continuous pump of morphine. It didn't do a damn thing for the pain, even after they increased the dose and frequency. After 2 hours of suffering in the recovery room they swapped the morphine out for dilaudid and I never looked back. Morphine is useless, I have also had it as an injection in the emergency room many times(I am a chronic pain patient) in the past and I think it relieved my pain for a half an hour the most...the emergency dept always has to give me something else. I think Advil is a better pain reliever than morphine.

(this helps, but not as much as I would like) I need to take a higher dose, but am resisting, as I want to make the additional dose requirements as infrequently as possible.  Main issue for me is that I often forget whether I have taken it or not, (7 AM is ok, 10-11 PM is ok, it is the 3:00 PM dose that I have trouble remembering if I took it (until I am in so much pain that I KNOW that I didn't).  Also, I need to take Ritalin to keep awake at work.

I looked it up on the &quot;Pill Identifier&quot; (M*100).  It showed the same pill I have (blue/gray color) yet the Review says &quot;Morphine Inj&quot;.  How could a pill be an injection?  Please respond if you can help answer this question.

Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/3/2009 2:42:18 PM	I was given Morphine in an IV when in the hopsital for severe pain. Almost immediately I had a burning feeling all over and nausea..but then it just took away all the pain and made me feel very loopy. It is definitely a great drug for pain though. I would reccomend it to take pain away

NOTHING RIDS THE PAIN TOTALLY, TEMPORARY RELIEF IS BETTER THAN NONE. I AM AT 300 MGS DAILY, WITH 45 MGS OF IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR SPASMS AND/OR FLAREUPS DAILY. IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET TO THE APPROPRIATE DOSAGE ( YEARS). IT HAS BEEN ELEVEN YEARS NOW. IF YOU CAN TOLERATE THE MEDICATION, USE IT. GOOD LUCK.
