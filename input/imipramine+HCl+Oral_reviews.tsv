Panic Disorder	curlyjoel, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		5/20/2012 7:27:47 PM	I have been on this med for 35 years and take 50 MG at bedtime. My panic attacks (fear of smothering) were so severe that I moved from NY to Florids 39 years ago. The Dr who prescribed it only would give a 1 week prescription so I went to my primary doctor and after checking, gave me a 1 month refilable prescription. When I saw him in 6 months later he was estatic and said it worked for 5 more patients who had phobias It is a godsend to me and a friend of mine who has a phobia. Her Dr said there was a newer medicine that was a good but it didn't work so he finally prescribed Imipimine and it solved her problem.

Panic Disorder	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	3/12/2012 2:42:51 PM	I began experiencing panic attacks in my late twenties.  They progressively became more frequent and stronger.  In early 1990, I finally spoke with my PCP about them.  He prescribed imipramine, and the attacks were brought completely under control after two months.  As far as I am concerned, imipramine is a miricle drug for panic disorder.
Problems with Bladder Control	Louise, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	3/8/2012 9:21:18 AM	I have been taking this medication for 3 weeks and have had hallucinations every night.  Last night was the worse.  I saw about 20 or more people in the room, I had to wake up my husband &amp; he kept telling me no one is there, but I kept seeing them. Will this side effect go away or should I stop taking it.
Other	AG, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/19/2012 7:35:33 PM	I was prescribed this medicine for Fibromyalgia and Chronic fatigue syndrome. It hasn't done much at all for my Fibro, but it has helped my CFS so much! I can sleep at night, but still wake up with my alarm and I'm alert all through the day! Honestly the fatigue was worse for my schooling than the pain from Fibro, because the fatigue prevented me from even going to class. But now even though I'm in pain, I'm not constantly exhausted and sleeping. It does cause me to yawn more than I used to, and I'm having constipation, but the benefits are worth it. Now I just have to find something to take with it for the Fibro. I recommend this medicine highly for those with CFS!

This was prescribed to me at age 16, continued taking it along with lorazapam (as needed) thru age 23. Weaned off of the drug with help of Dr. My mother passed away at age 24, severe panic attacks/PTSD returned. Tried new meds on the market, all resulted in terrible side effects. Finally I asked for a script for Imipramine, beginning to feel &quot;normal&quot; again. It's an older drug, not too many docs are familiar with it. Little tp no side effects, take at bedtime for a full night of sleep. Cant imagine why I even tried something else.

Panic Disorder	beaglelover, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/24/2011 4:10:57 AM	After being diagnosed with Panic Disorder in 2005 and going on to develop Agoraphobia years later I first went to my primary care and he prescribed me Effexor for 2 years which didn't really control the severity of my attacks.  I was then put on Paxil and had to discontinue from a bad side effect and then finally Lexapro which I took for 2 years.  It helped some but gave me nightmares and taking it before bed kept me up all night for those 2 years which was horrible!  I was then recommended to see a Psychiatrist last year for my condition which was getting worse and I was having between 30-40 panic attacks a day (yes that's not a typo unfortunately).  I was miserable, had to quit college, work and could barely function even at home!  Had attacks even if I stayed home and avoided my triggers (driving, going into stores or malls, large buildings, church and even in the shower), my life had come to a screeching halt and I had no desire to live anymore and felt I had no purpose in living!  Well, now I've been on Imipramine for 11 months and it has turned my life around and I credit this med for saving my life and the Dr who put me on it of course!!!  There are the side effects like dry mouth, nausea, stomach pain, headaches, sensitivity to sunlight, dizziness &amp; lightheaded, sweating, etc. but after a few months of slowing upping my dose my body has become use to the drug and all I can see now is how I am almost a different person and have much fewer, less severe, easier to handle panic attacks when I do have them which depends on my stress level now.  I maybe have 1 a week or less and depend much less on taking my Xanex with the 3-4 .25 mg a day before! I have gone 2-3 weeks without the Xanex now and have recently hit my highest dose of Imipramine at 100mg and that seems to work best for me. For those of you who suffer from terrifying Panic Disorder and are not getting any relief, try this...I have reacted amazingly well to this and I hope you do too!  DON&quot;T GIVE UP!!!!
Panic Disorder	ddt556, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	1/31/2011 2:00:29 AM	Started taking imipramine for frequent panic attacks (1-2/week). It has worked very well. In the last three months, I've only had one panic attack, and with cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, I was able to drown that panic attack away. In the beginning, the side effects are kind of difficult to cope with such as dry mouth, lowered libido, and tremor. But after a few weeks, the drug is quite effective.

I have tried several other medicines with rather indifferent results.  I take this medicine only when I have an episode of abnormally hight getting up at night.  It seems to be effective in reducing the episodic variation, but does not reduce getting up to less than about three times.  I do have a problem with constipation for which I take a stool softener.

Other	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	13-18	9/2/2010 11:57:28 PM	I was prescribed this medicine after suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome for two years. I went to the doctor time and time again because of my sudden diarrhea every morning going to school. It got so bad that I would wake up about an hour before school just to use the bathroom so I wouldn't have to later, limiting my sleep. I started on 25mg but quickly grew an immunity to it, and am now at 150mg with only ever experiencing severe dry mouth and constipation (expected, better not going then always having too). If I forget to the take the medicine before bed though the next morning I go through what I assume are withdraws and feel absolutely horrible to the point I just want to stay in bed. The medicine has absolutely changed my life, I no longer suffer from IBS nor my mild insomnia.

I take stool softener and drink lots of water, wear light clothing, and use breath mints/breath spray. I was very, very depressed. Imipramine has been a godsend for me.

Depression	stokcarr2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/29/2009 4:32:14 PM	My GP prescribed this for me to take at bedtime so that I would have a better night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed (and also for mild depression). As far as my sleep goes, it doesn't really help me sleep any better (doesn't make it worse either), but I do wake up feeling well-rested. The best part about it? For me, it has decreased my appetite so much that I haven't eaten a meal in 4 days (I just started taking it a week ago). I have to force myself to eat a cracker or a piece of bread just so I have something in my stomach. I have lost 7 pounds in a week!! I know it's not the best way to lose weight, but why fight it? I need to lose 25 pounds anyway! I don't know if it actually helps with depression, but if I lose 25 pounds I probably won't be so depressed anymore.

Other	Cybil, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	2/27/2009 5:54:12 PM	Imipramine was prescribed as last resort for me  when I suffered cystitis-like symptoms which often left me immobilised after urninating...I could not walk!  This medical condition was impacting upon my life in a way that left me unable to plan activities and any social occasions; often bed requirement was required following a visit to the loo! Not ideal for a teacher! Initially ...and for just under 5 years, Imipramine has been a life saver, however the side-effects , the dreadful dry mouth, the sluggish mental ability and hoarse voice, has forced me now in to recently giving up the medication. Almost immediately I have returned to a clear-thinking individual; I have rediscovered my vocabulary; my voice sounds less hoarse as the vocal tract is not dried out and most importantly of all...so far...I have not had a cystitis flare-up. I was on 75mg per night and started at 25mg per week building up over three weeks before I gained physical benefit from the medication. I have maintained this level of medication occasionally increasing it, when high levels of stressful episodes were imminent.Throughout this I have taken laxatives to maintain a bowel movement. This medication should be valued, but used with intelligence. It has side-effects which at times I thought were worse than the condition...it is a medication which has very personal side effects and it needs a user to monitor well-being versus side  effects...whatever they may be. Don't dismiss it because of the side-effects but don't let the side effects take over your life either.

Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	11/13/2008 12:06:11 PM	I was given this medication for PTSD. I have severe panic attacks and bouts of deep depression. I feel that I have evened out somewhat, but the side effects in the begining were hard to cope with. I sweated, delt with stomache cramps and dry mouth. Things seem to be good now...
Other	pieceofmind, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	45-54	6/3/2008 7:57:44 AM	2 yrs. after birthing my daughter, I began this rare form of chronic severe hives. Allergy tests showed no cause (possibly stress/trauma related) though I suffered panic attacks/anxiety yrs. before. After a rough pregnancy, with diabetes, high blood pressure, toximia, I think that started a cycle of inflammatory issues. After trying several antihistimines for the hives, I eventually tried Imipramine HCL; it made me somewhat drowsy and constipated, dry mouth, but really helped with any anxiety, especially at suppressing the hives--I couldnt work without it. within the first year of taking it, I had a minorly physical job 2 days a week, at age 33, was having sudden hot flashes, sweating, heart pounding, lasting up to 20 min. I would have to sit down at my job until it went away. Quite scary, but every time I asked a dr. if I could try something else, they would say &quot;As rare and extreme as this hives is, if you found something that WORKS, stick with it!&quot; I felt I had no choice. It affected my memory, I felt light-headed, groggy much of the time, and still struggled to work reliably. After 15 yrs., reaching age 50, more recent jobs that were more physical caused profuse sweating, and I thought it was true hot flashes. After I lost 2 jobs, I decided to cut way back on it, to see if I still had hives, which I would try to do once a yr. or so, and it was gone!! When I got off the Imipramine, the sweating and hot flashes were nearly COMPLETELY GONE, I had to get USED TO being CHILLED at times--I could actually wear sweaters again, my memory and mind was clearing, I felt like someone lifted a huge wet wool blanket off of me!! Now Im struggling with digestive problems, severe IBS; apparently my system got SO used to being stopped up and sluggish, even after my gall bladder removed, once off of it, my intestines got really sensitive, without the real drying effects slowing it down, and 3 months off the drug, still trying to change my diet and habits, taking fiber pills helps.
Panic Disorder	mgb, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/3/2008 7:39:49 PM	I was on every kind of anti-depressant there is for panic disorder and absolutely none of them worked, until I started taking this.  I've been on it for 9 years now (started it when I was 14) and it's been terrific!  Never any problems! I have very few, mild flare ups and the medication goes to work very quickly.  
Bedwetting	momofabedwetter, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	3/9/2008 3:33:21 PM	FNP put my daughter on this for bedwetting; worked great for that but she began losing weight and having terrible stomach aches, so bad that I finally took her to another doctor and they did a ct scan to see if she had a blockage. Medication had caused her to be extremely constipated thus the stomach pain. Doctor told me that this medication is good for short term (summer camp, sleep-overs, etc) but not long term. Once off the medication, she began bedwetting again but no more constipation. She eventually outgrew the bedwetting. The negative side effects were not worth the dry nights. 
Depression	onyx, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/16/2008 11:30:22 PM	My husband took this medication at the age of 10-12. He started having auditory and visual halusinations. Tremors of the hands and legs. And many other problems. He was taken off the medication. He is 29 now. But after this medication, he never lost the &quot;voices and visuals&quot; nor the tremors. Because of the voices and visuals. He is now &quot;schizophrenic&quot;. His doctor said these will never go away. Please dont put your children on this medication!

Depression	Jason, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	25-34	12/4/2007 5:32:03 PM	 I was taking 75mg a day to help with Bipolar Disorder/ADHD along with 54mg Concerta and 100mg of Seroquel. I stopped taking this medication several months ago with mixed feelings due to side effects I felt threatened my health. I do feel abit down and compulsive without it though. I delt with major constipation, excessive sweating, a strange metallic taste in my mouth, and a huge decrease in urine output. It was as if my body would no longer tell me I needed to go. It gave me a big sweet tooth. 
Neuropathic Pain	tinamri, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	11/19/2007 4:08:22 PM	This medication was prescribed for me for Chest Post-Sternotomy Nocioception Abnormality.  25 mg.  I was advised it might take two to three weeks before noticing a difference, but my pain I've had for 3 years is nearly gone.  I do feel funny though, kind of fuzzy headed.  I'm concerned about long-term use.

Dry mouth was initially a problem, but is now tolerated. Acute episodes of heat intolerance and perspiration several times daily is a relatively intolerable side effect.
