She is never hungry. When she eats she's very irratated and settles for bread, pasta and butter, and sweets.  Waking up in the middle of the night as times to eat these terrible foods.  This has gone on for two year; we just found our she has lymphoma hodgkin's cancer.  I have not done any research. It is my understanding that without the proper nutrition the body doesn't function properly and could it be possible that this medication assisted the cancer to grow. It obviously makes one lose appetite, therefore, it seems that the lymps don't function properly causing low immune system.

It makes him like a zombie he sits and stares out the door all day long until it wears off. The medication last 10-12 hours. I gave him the medication at 7am and it started wearing off at around 5 oclock pm. He would not eat or drink anything. He often complains of his stomach hurting and nausea. I feel like this is abuse to our children. That's all this country knows how to do is push and use drugs. This country should spend more money on research for curing diseases and behaviors without doping everybody up with drugs, especially our children, it's sad and pitiful.

Special Education, good diet and exercise, and A LOT of homework help at home helped, but she still required a lot of redirection and one-on-one time at school from her teachers.  We finally agreed with her doctor to try a medication.  We tried Concerta and it was terrible.  Too strong for her!  She was tearful and suffered insomnia and nightmares.  We asked the doctor what else we could try.  He prescribed the lowest dose of Focalin... 10mg.  It worked!!!  The difference in her behavior was like night and day and it didn't affect her sweet personality at all.  I didn't tell her teachers so I could really see if they noticed a difference, and they immediately saw a change in her school performance.  She was less impulsive, she stayed on task, and she actually finished assignments!  At home she was able to do more things like getting dressed on her own, cleaning her room, doing most her own homework without me prompting her every five minutes.  We found that giving her half a pill in the morning and half at lunch (the school helps us with that) worked best for her (it seems to last 5 hours).   After school homework time was a challenge since the Rx had worn off, but her Dr. prescribed a 2mg dose as needed for these days, and it works really well.  She is still able to sleep by 8PM.  She still has a good appetite too (which worried me).  It is available in generic form so it's easily affordable. The only problem with this Rx is that it isn't long-acting so you need to give a booster dose mid day.  But we haven't found this to be difficult for now.  I hope this helps someone out there!  It has been a life-saver for our sweet daughter!

He was started on clonadine at night and tenex 2x a day. He was either a zombie or bouncing off the wall.As a parent it tore me apart. He was started on Ritalin and it helped but, Dr wanted us to try Focalin XL 10mg and it was a big help after a week or so of adjusting to it...He is now 7 yrs old he takes Foclain XL 15mg with tenex 2x aday and it has made a huge difference in his life.He still has to be reminded to focus but, teachers and I agree this med has helped turn his life around. last report card was 3 B's and all S's including great behaviour. Everyone is different so it will effect some negatively.Personally I'm glad I gave my son the chance to try it.

Others made him a basket case, aggressive or too thin.  This one seemed to be working well unitl he started pulling his hair, eyebrows and eyelashes out.  Talks about voices in his head too.  He is 10 years old and has been on 20mg for about 2 years.  He was diagnosed when he was 5.  After reading some of these reviews, I'm thinking of trying another med.

There has been noticeable improvement, but it wears off as the day goes on.  In the beginning she was extermemly moody and depressed, but this has tapered off.  Now that she has been on it for awhile it does not seem to be working as well and will need to be increased periodically.  The worst side affect is that she has began pulling out all of her eyelashes.  She becomes hyperfocused and almost obsessed with some activities.

Ive been noticing a tick with his hands,like looking for small hairs, and has become very irritable,moody,extra sensitive,making relationships wuth his classmates difficult. He appears strange with the hand tick and has become sort of a loner. Im in the process of looking other alternatives or evaluating to not prescribe him at all.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	7/8/2011 2:31:07 PM	Focalin XR (20mg) is the best stimulant I've tried thus far (diagnosed at age 28 with ADHD). It has had the least negative side effects and has no &quot;afternoon crash&quot; which I experienced with other medicines we tried first. It helps me listen when someone is speaking, be more productive at work, and has helped me feel calmer overall. I do think I will be upping to 30mg soon, as it is slowly becoming slightly less effective after several months, but overall I have been pleased with the results.

We decided that his symptoms were no longer being controlled well a couple of months ago and switched him to Focalin and have kept his dosage to 10mg daily. He has been in this dosage for about 6 wks and starting this past week has had a &quot;meltdown&quot; pretty much every afternoon. Small things will set him off. Crying for up to two hours at a time! I'm calling our pediatrician tomorrow. This cannot go on. I don't know if he is overmedicated or under medicated. He was on 30mg of Ritalin LA  before and did not have this &quot;side effect&quot;. - Stressed out Mama

I had heard about focalin and how it has less side affects so decided to ask doctor to try that instead. she switched meamd my first day noticed major difference and a good one, no side affects ( racing heart, flushing ect...) and as or if not more effective than ritalin i am very pleased and so glad tried it, because it is so great having a med really work and not having all the negitive side affects that seem to go a long with so many of them!  i feel great and it does what it is suppose to wonderfully.  I would recomend it to anyone who has side affects from ritalin or any other ADHD med,  also only been few days but have not had the crashing like before on ritalin and on 20mg daily of focalin is all i need   half of what was taking of ritalin   it is well worth it !!  never will go back to ritalin!

I never realized all the side effects that came with the concentration and focus that Concerta provided (i.e. felt speeded up, hyper-attentive, easy to get to much or not enough, tunnel-vision with creative thinking). Focalin provides the focus and help with my adhd but it feels besides that you would not even know you have taken it except I am slightly more alert but no where near as noticeable as the concerta and also there is some loss in appetite, but again not as much as on concerta.

After calling his neurologist I was told to stop the drug and let it work its way out of his system by giving him a lot of fluids and OTC medicines which causes sleep, but not sleeping pills. It was a horrible 3 days later before he was back to his old narcoleptic self. We will be trying a different drug for narcolepsy soon.

I have never been so productive at both work and home in my life.  Also the quality of the work I do has dramatically increased to the point that several of my co-workers, one of which includes my supervisor have made positive comments regarding my work.  I noticed on some of the posts that side effects are bothersome for some so I feel that I should say that it took about 2 months for my body to adjust to the medicine, after that, everything has just seemed to improve for me.  My most annoying side effect has to be headaches which have decreased in both severity and frequency over the past 6 months.

In the beginning, I felt like there was no hope of her bringing home any grade above a &quot;C.&quot; She was placed on Focalin XR as part of her regimen and I'm happy to say that I have seen overwhelming improvement in her abilities to concentrate on tasks and follow through with instruction. I cannot say where she would be without her Psychiatrist and the treatment she has received, but without it she wouldn't be Student of the Month and Class Vice-President now. Her teacher stated that she was &quot;One of her Best Students&quot; during our last conference.  Her grades have sky-rocketed and I am very satisfied with what she has accomplished with the help from this medication. Being a mother and psychiatric health care professional myself, I highly recommend this medication for all of those who have tried everything else. It has made a world of difference for my daughter. Not only has her grades improved, but her self-esteem is so much better. I feel like I have a normal child now!

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	mon of ADHD, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female	3-6	11/25/2009 9:13:48 PM	My son is four years old and focalin has been the 2nd med we have tried. 45 min after being on this med he intentionally slammed his head off floor during a tantrum and ended up in ER with one staple in the head. The following 2 days after every 30 min on the dot his mood swings would fluctuate from calm and collected-to-bouncing off wall and endangering self or others. I highly do not recommend this med, as to my brother has also tried this and started hearing voices and seeing illusions after almost a month of taking this.

She was taken off Vyvanese 20 mg b/c it was too strong for her.  After the 2nd day of taking Focalin 10 mg she ended up in the floor of the principals office with dizziness, stomach pains and tremors on her right side.  Needless to say, I have taken her off this medication.  The dr now recommends Strattera 18 mg.  Hopefully that one will do better for us.

The generic version can make symptoms worse if you are taking other medications such as antidepressants or certain types of mood disorder medications.

She only takes 1 dose of 5mg per day. This is the first and only med shes ever been on. It works great to keep her focused in school. But although it can be a challenge to help her focused without it, I refuse to give her any more, I deal with her behavior the best I can, because her physical health is of great importance. I read several comments and i truely believe that the dosage that most mentioned giving their kids is crazzy. Its great for school because teachers really dont want any more work than they have to. But as parents, lets find other ways to treat our kids than with narcotics, which is what these drugs are, legal narcotics.

I am 15 years old, and i have been taking it since I was 13. There is another side effect that is not listed that I believe should be. Muscle spasms. I have them daily, but other than that it has worked for me very well. I believe that it is much less addicting than they say it is. I would advise this for people having trouble with ADHD.

He has had better focus at work and at home.  His personality is more controlled. The biggest thing we have noticed is he can't skip doses.  If he does it is harder for him when he takes the next one and his personality immediately changes from the missed dose.  It's made our lives so much easier.

I was at my witts end.  Then my Dr. Had me try Focalin--My whole world changed; I was a different person able to read a book, not get ahead of myself in speech and gather thoughts at a &quot;normal&quot; pace.  This medication was, almost, short of a miracle.  I feel like a real person again.

Now that she is going into the 7th grade, my wife an I have noticed that she forgets how to do simple task. Such as turning on the shower or flushing the toilet. We are watching and going to talk to the doctor. Just a little scared we have screwed up with this medication. She is off every weekend an every summer really no change.

I take the short acting generic version of Foclin. I can take it when needed, typically first thing in am, and then 4 hours later, with a 3rd dose if needed @4 more hours.  I like being able to control dose and not have to deal with too much wakefulness when bedtime comes around. After the dose wears off, there is a considerable feeling of fatigue, which helps promote sleep in the evening.  Very much able to concentrate and complete daily tasks with an ample amount of energy. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/6/2009 11:12:14 AM	So far I have been on Focalin 5mg twice daily for one week.  The first day I took it I felt that I actually wanted to do things,cleaning, homework, laundry.  I do all of those anyway but it's like I have to force myself.  I work full time and go to college full time. I do feel that it is helping a little.  I don't feel like I'm all amped up or anything. More like, clearer. The only side effects are very very mild.  Feeling not very hungry.  Which is fine by me, because I also take Welbutrin XL 300mg and Seroquel 400mg which made me gain like 30lbs in the last six months.  I'm still eating well. Just not allllll the time like before. I also noticed a sort of heavy feeling in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.  Not sure what that is about.  I'll be sure to ask my Dr about it though.  It usually only happens if I take it on an empty stomach.  But other than that I can't tell I'm taking it.  I was scared starting ADD medication because I hear alot of terrible things about being zombie like, mean, moody.. and so on.  So I'm going to stick with it and see how it plays out until my next appointment in a month.

I have not seen a dramatic change in his behavior but his teacher has.  He went from a 49 on the ADHD rating scale to an 8 on the rating scale.  He is able to focus at school more, complete his work at school and just function as a normal child at school.  I have never seen him as a zombie, lose his appetite, lose sleep or have any other negative side effects.  I only wish I saw more effects of his medication at home.  He is still a little wild and forgetful at home.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	10/7/2008 1:47:21 PM	My son was on this medication for 2 years. It was on a time release so by the time he got home, I saw my normal child. It wasn't until I took him out of school for a couple of days for a trip that I saw what it was doing to him. He had NO personality. He would sit and stare into space, not interested in anything going on around him. When I discussed this with his teachers, they told me that he acted like a zombie&quot; at school and never interacted with the other kids. I took him off the medication and we have tried going without meds for a year now. But now that he is in 5th grade, the teachers aren't as helpful with his problems. They tell me he needs to be punished and taught responsibility. On the way back to the dr. tomorrow.....

We saw SEVERAL doctors and they all said yes to ADHD.  I was in denial and tried so hard to help him but finally I had to help him with this because it was more than I knew how to deal with (and I have a BS in ECH EDU).  I took him to a child psychiatrist last Novemeber and he has been on 5mg of Focalin since January.  I took him off of it for a month during the summer and sometimes I don't know if I really see a difference in behavior or not.  He seems too be more calm but he is very moody.  He started Kindergarten last week and we are still getting complaints about his behavior and attention issues.  I will talk to his Dr. about this next month but I feel for all parents and children who have to live with this.  It's a lot to deal with...  I just pray it gets easier somehow for my son.

He's now going into 8th grade.  After trying numerous drugs over the past several years that had severe side effects and very little good effects, Focalin has been a blessing!  His grades have improved tremendously (almost straight A's!) and he is so happy now!  He even gets along with his peers and sister (he never had friends before).  The only side effect is his lack of appetite which is easily controlled.  We are very satisfied!

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Bert, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	4/23/2008 4:13:19 AM	I am 39 years old and was recently diagnosed with Adult ADD.  After trying Stratera for a few days, my doctor changed me to Focalin 5 mg twice daily.  The Stratera did not work for me, made me very drowsey, wicked cotton mouth, upset stomach and the ever onmious &quot;sexual side effects&quot;  but alarmingly it gave me very gruesome nightmares.  I've never had that happen before, so the doctor changed me to Focalin after only 4 days.Wow what a lifesaver.  I'm currently in school fulltime because of a career change.  With the ADD I was unable to work and go to school at the same time, to the point where my parents offered to support me while in school.  The ADD was just too much for me to do both.  After only a few weeks, I can say that this drug has saved me.  Finally I can concentrate fully and not get distracted.  This has allowed me to start working again while in school, so I am extremely happy.As for side effects, I've been pretty happy with the dose I'm on.  The only real side effect for me is loss of weight, which at my age isn't something I'm going to complain about too much! lol  I do have to remind myself to eat, and it's a weird sensation to go a whole day without eating and not be hungry.  It's amazing in that respect.  Other than that I have no complaints.One last comment is regarding sleep problems.  I have suffered through many many sleepness nights because of the ADD.  It is not unusual for me to be up until 3 or 4 am everynight because I couldn't quiet my mind enough.  I take this drug twice daily, six hours apart.  In a roundabout way, Focalin has relieved the sleep problems, because by the end of the day I seem pretty well spent.  I workout 3 times weekly and I seem to have more energy now due to the Focalin.  The workouts and the Focalin ensure that I am dead tired by 10 pm.  This is a fast acting drug and I feel it within 5 minutes of taking it on an empty stomach.  It doesn't make me feel ramped up, I do have a lot of energy when taking it.

It has already been life-changing for me.  I am able to work from home for 8-9 hours per day and finish projects I would have never completed before.  I wish I would have been diagnosed and treated a long time ago so I could have accomplished more at this point in my life.

He was originally prescribed Concerta XR.  He lost a tremendous amount of weight with Concerta and his behaviors got worse over time.  Our doctor prescribed Focalin XR 10mg a week ago today.  Our foster son is happy and excited about his accomplishments for the first time in his life.  His teacher has noticed a difference as well as our family.  He had gained some of his weight back and has an appetite again.  We are very pleased with this medication and our son is too!

I also take Cymbalta for depression.  This medication caused me to have severe mood swings.  Either I was extremely happy, extremely aggitated, extremely depressed, or I was having an over the top anxiety attack.  Dr. has now prescribed Concerta, we'll see how this one goes.

I was given Ritilan first, and the pharmacy made a mistake and filled the script with Focalin. They called two days later to tell me....but it was a blessing really. Focalin XR works much better for me and so my doctor switched me onto it. Sometimes i get muscle cramping though.....that is the only draw back for me......but Ritilan did the same thing....and it had more side affects. I like Focalin better than the other ADD drugs.

We found this med to have the least side effect of we have tried so far. it takes time to adjust. As for not eating he shared that symptom to bad at first we expressed our concerns to the dr. he reluctantly prescribed a steriod (mild) to help his appetite

The only problem we had is she was not gaining any weight so the doctor tried switching her to Adderall and it made her very violent and we decided to try Focalin again and since then she has been doing great as long as we keep her on a strict eating schedule.

I felt very anxious, sad, and self-concious while on it, and after reading teh allergic responses to it's main ingredient - Methyphenidate - I am clear now that my body does not react well with that chemical. I was even experiencing the other allergic reaction of small purple spots (like little bruises) whenever I was on Focalin. I highly, highly recommend Aderall XR - despite the minor insomnia, it is wonderful.

Considering i'm on other medications that include antidepressent's, and i'm a minor others will most likely have different side effects. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	7-12 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Male	7-12	11/26/2007 8:10:49 AM	I was great for about a year for my 11 year old son and then his body was no longer reacting to it.  It was great because he still had an appetite compared to the other ADHD drugs used in the past and it did not last as long therefore it did not keep him up all-night. Unfortunately we are at a max dose of 20 mg. and will need to try something different.

We switched to Focalin about 18 months ago.  Focalin does not give him these problems and helps him concentrate much better.  The one problem I see is that it quiets him to a point he seems shy and nervouse to people.  Focalin has given him the least amount of side effects and his grades are amazing.

Have been taking Focalin xr 5 mg in am and 5 mg pm; seemed to work for the first 2-3 weeks, now not so much. I also seem to be very sensitive to the &quot;ups and downs&quot; effect common with the use of extended release medicines. However, the best response I have is right after my morning dose; once that wears off, I pretty much fight a losing battle all day with the return of inattentiveness, distraction, and fatigue as the lower-end dosing 'xr' begins to fizzle out. My Dr. told me to wait for a while longer to see if things even out. Otherwise, he thought a higher dose of a shorter-acting medicine may be an alternate way to maximize symptom control and extend the morning's response throughout the remainder of the day.

All children need room to act out and learn from experience. Eating was much easier on Focalin than other stimulants, while they'll say they aren't hungry I can at least get them to eat something, ie fruit, cookies, cheese.
