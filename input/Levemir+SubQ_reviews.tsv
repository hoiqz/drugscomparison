Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Frank, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	55-64	7/3/2012 4:27:47 PM	Have used both Levemir and Lantus.  I find no difference in effectiveness.  I take 15 units once a day and Humalog at each meal 3-5 units.  Also take 2000 mg of metformin.  HbA1c stable at around 7.2.  Normally in the 100 to 200 range.  Only over 200 if I eat a big meal or large snack.  No problems with going too low.  Works good for me.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	tideflash, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	45-54	6/24/2012 11:09:02 PM	I have been using levimer for 8 months. I also use glimiperide and metformin pills. When I went on Levimer my blood sugar readings were as high as 390. Now they range from 114 average and as low as 85 if I have a very small meal in the evening.  My weight has only fluctuated a few pounds.  The injections using a needle and vial are usually okay but rarely will hurt if I inject into a harder muscular area of my stomach.  I experience a little bleeding about 1 out of 5 injections.

I have had the best experience by taking 20u in AM and 20u PM. as long as I DON'T EAT High carb food within 2 hrs of sleeoing (that bedtime bowl of cereal had to go) I consistantly wake up with an 80 to 100 count. My A1C has also maintained 6.7 to 6.9. Very happy with product.

It has helped me to loose a few pounds. I find that if I eat more than I should, I get nauseaus (extremely) but if I eat smaller portions I don't get that feeling. So I am eating amaller portions and dropping some weight, a good thing for me. I will continue taking it, used to use Humalog every few hours, using the Levemir 1 sometimes 2 times a day.  Made it through a whole month on just the 5 pen box--very unusal for me.  It works for me, glad I was able to try it.

Didn't like Lantus, went back on NPH. Been trying the Levemir - hate it. Site itching. Up to twice my former doses and sugars been spiking to 500 despite eating very little and no carbs other than vegetables. Definately telling the doctor to switch me back this week.
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus	Natalie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	35-44	5/17/2011 7:57:50 PM	Started taking Levemir 8 days ago.  Until reading about side effects, I could not understand why I was too weak to carry laundry upstairs, to hold the phone to my ear, became teary, light-headed, nauseated, and experienced rapid hearbeats on a couple of occasions.  I also mistook the redness on ta few injectin sites as potential infection so treated with antibiotic creams and oral medication.  I've been a T1 for 31 years and have never experienced such a plethora of general health issues at once so decided to look into Levemir side effects.  I am very relieved to learn that severe weakness, rapid heartbeat, and skin irritations are side effects of this med.  I've decided to go back to my old-school NPH and get my life back.  Will fyi the doc during my next appointment.

I had pain with every injection and developed large bruises and thickened, lumpy skin. The bruising got so severe that my doctor determined I was allergic to the drug and switched me to Humalog.

Diabetes	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	65-74	7/16/2010 12:29:08 AM	I was on 70/30 for several years.  Because my blood sugar would drop about 10:00AM if I was very active and rise again to between 150/200 in evening, my provider changed me to Levemir. 10 units twice daily, then 20, then 30 and now I am on 40 units with a fast acting on sliding scale also.  My sugar has gone up to average 355 in one month.  I think I need to go back to 70/30.

Curious to know if anyone else has experienced anything similar after starting levemir?

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	redtnt528@aol.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	11/19/2009 6:28:17 PM	Since I started taking this insulin, I have not felt the same at all. I first became very aggitated, and restless, sometimes staying up half the night into the early morning hours. Also had a fast heart rate. Then I noticed that I was having muscle weakness, feeling so tired that I could barely make myself stay awake. My Dr tells me that this is my bodies way of going through withdrawl...I have been going through withdrawl for 3 months now! I have never seen anyone go through anything like this after switching insulins before, and my whole family is diabetic! So am I crazy, or is he a quack? My A1C did drop from 8.7 to 6.9, but I keep having to up the dose of the insulins, and am bloated all the time. I am MISERABLE since Ihave been on this stuff! Is anyone else having these side affects?
Diabetes	passion84css528@yahoo.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	11/19/2009 6:11:14 PM	Since I hve been on this medication, I have experienced some very unfavorable reations. First I was extremely aggitated,and had rapid heart rate. I now find that I feel muscle weakness, and am exhausted most of the time,and could sleep most of he day. Dr says this is my body going through withdrawl from A1C being at 8.4, and coming down to 6.9. This makes no sense to me at all. I have been on this for 3 months, How long does one go through withdrawl for crying out loud!? I should be feeling better, NOT worse!

I was just given this as I have lost my health insurance.  My doctor says it is like a generic version of Lantus.  He did tell me I will need to increase my dosage. I am rather worried.  Anyone else in the same situation.  Lantus costs me $104.00 a vial.  Doc gave me 8 vials for free.  Is it worth it?  Anyone in the same boat?

A1C over three months went from 5.9 to 9.7.  From 38 units of lantus to 86 and rising with levemir.  Still can't control blood sugars.  
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	musquiz, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	8/7/2008 8:25:04 PM	Was put on this insulin by my provider to cut costs.  A1C went from 7.25 to 9.7 in 3 months.  I increased dose weekly cause my sugars stayed high all the time.  I increased dosage from 36 units to 75 units and still had problems with blood sugar.  It took about 9 months before I was able to go back to lantus.  I'm back down to 39 units.  I had no kidney problems before levemir and now have trace protein in my urine with blood.  Prior to this I've been very fortunate with no problems for 50 years of insulin dependance.  High blood sugar does kill.
