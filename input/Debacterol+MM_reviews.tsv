It takes away the pain, almost entirely, an almost eimmediately. I have found nothing alse that comes aven remotely close to the relief that debacrerol offers.

It is good for initial and/or small canker sores [i.e., those ones that might not need this drastic treatment to begin with]. For larger ones [of course it is hard to know before hand which one will become large and unbearably painful, and which one will heal relatively quickly on its own], on not so rare occasion (~10%), it could get much worse by applying this medication for it might not completely cauterize the whole lesion. Then, it will take much longer to heal while one suffer from extreme pain (unless applying the treatment again, which could be dangerous of damaging deep tissue). What if you have a cluster of canker sores or one after another continuously, you just cannot do that [i.e., applying the treatment) all over your mouth. Remember, this [its active ingredient] is just concentrated sulfuric acid, and there might be long term health hazard [e.g., oral cancer] associated with its prolong use.

My 16 year-old, very heath-conscious son suffered for years; the pediatrician, dentist, and orthodontist offered no relief beyond a rinse that really didn't work.  Finally, I decided that I wasn't going to stop until I found a remedy.  We found a dentist in Dallas who administers Debacterol, Dr. Sugg.  My son left the appointment pain free, and now, five days later, remains pain free.  WHY don't more medical professionals know about this??  TRY IT!

Canker Sore	dukegirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/10/2009 7:54:03 AM	I have suffered from canker sores for years and have never been able to find anything that would help.  My dentist gave me this medicine to try and it's fantastic!  The smell is awful and I had some intense burning when I first applied it but that was gone within seconds.  I had a large sore on one side of my mouth and a small one on the other side.  I treated them both 12 hours ago and I have no pain at all.  This product is amazing!

Canker Sore	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/22/2008 8:44:21 AM	I am a nurse in a family clinic setting. We keep Debacterol on hand to use on our patients with excellent results. Patients return stating that nothing else has ever worked as well as Debacterol.
Canker Sore	lmthomas03, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/4/2008 5:51:59 PM	I read some of the reviews on here and was really scared to use this product but had a really sore canker sore that was making eating and even talking painful.  My dentist gave me a prescription but I hadn't used it because I was afraid of how much it would hurt. I just used it for the first time about 5 minutes ago and am THRILLED with this product. First of all the pain was really not bad at all.  I think using one of those numbing agents like anbesol gel actually hurts a lot more and they are only temporary. I am definitely going to get another prescription for this. What a relief to finally have an answer for all those horrible canker sores.  I wish I had found this ages ago and highly recommend it to anyone.  My canker sore already feels a LOT better.
Canker Sore	65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	65-74	6/7/2008 1:29:12 PM	My dentist applied Debacterol to a very sore ulcer in my mouth. It hurt breifly but then no more pain or discomfort. I suffer from these ulcers frequently so this is a very welcome drug.
Canker Sore	dexterbot, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	5/13/2008 1:14:18 AM	I, like the prior reviewer, have been waiting all my life for a marvel like this.  My dentist applied the past and to my amazement, the canker sore was pain free but still visible but within 24 hours, it reduced in size and still no pain.  It's been a little over a day and it's almost completely gone!  I get real bad outbreaks 5-6 at a time and some on my tongue, inner lip, and gum.  I also get them on my throat but the dentist said that it's not a good idea to treat those but I'm glad I got rid of all the ones they were able to.  TRY THIS ONCE!!!  ASK FOR IT!!!
Canker Sore	Ooouch!, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/4/2007 10:00:22 AM	Where has this treatment been all my life?  The application of the treatment is quite painfully, but after 15-20 seconds of pain, the entire sore immediately feels great and the sore goes away.  The treatment reduces days of pain in 20 seconds of treatment.  I highly recommend this treatment!
