Other	El, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/10/2011 2:24:17 PM	I had anti-mitochondrial antibodies, which was determined to be a possible false positive, (which is present if one has PBC- primary Biliary cirrhosis), and have had Hepatitis C. Since taking the (Urso)Ursodiol, my blood tests showing my liver enzymes always come back within the normal range, which is fabulous! The only side effects I can notice is the tendency to have to urinate, and I find my eyes get dry.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/17/2009 4:12:35 AM	I use this for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.  I've been taking it for 10 years, and my currebt dosage is 2000mg a day.  Never once have I had type of side effect reaction to this medication, and I always see an improvement in my liver functions whenever my doctor increases my dosage.  It seems to be a very safe drug.
