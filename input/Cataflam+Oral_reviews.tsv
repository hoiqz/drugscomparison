Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function	Matilda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/24/2012 8:20:30 PM	I tried so many different types of pain relief before I discovered Cataflam. I've been using them when required for the last 6 years. They give me so much relief when my condition worsens. I never leave home without them. My quality of life is much better on account of Cataflam.
Pain	Susan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	4/28/2012 7:46:01 PM	I have a very bad toothache and I was prescribed to take the cataflam 50mg with ibuprofen.  However, it has been an hr and my pain has not completely stop.  I thought that if I took both, I would get instant relief but that hasn't occurred yet.  I decided to do the alcohol swab treatment on the area where the tooth is aching until I can get in to see my dentist to have my root canal. 
Painful Periods	Cynicki, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/10/2011 1:25:27 AM	800mg of ibuprofen is no longer effective in controlling the pain of my menstrual cramps so my doctor put me on a combination of 50mg of Cataflam and 50mg of Tramadol and it works great. The only downside is the inconvenience of having to take the Cataflam every 8 hrs and the Tramadol every 5 hrs for about 4 to 5 days every month. So I have to set alarms on my phone to remind me because if you don't stay ahead of the pain, you'll regret it. But it is worth waking up in the middle of the night if needed to take my meds if it means I won't be in pain.

Pain	ISABEL, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	1/28/2011 5:37:21 PM	The Medication was prescribed for pain. Ordered to be taken three times per day.On day two I developed severe GI discomfort with lower abdominal pain and weakness.I discontinued taking the medication and treated my symptoms with Maalox. After reading the side effects I think this medication should be taken off the market, as the bad outweights the effectiveness.

Without it, I can barely walk. With it I almost forget. 50mg @ 3/day. Mild stomach upset, far outweighed by being able to function. I highly recommend trying this. Try 1/day, if needed, 2 spaced morning and evening. I ended up needing 1 every 8 hours, but it WORKS.

Other	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	65-74	3/24/2009 9:49:01 AM	I was given the prescription for Osteoporosis, and a damaged spine and back. My problem is that it seems to wear off quickly, and I am only prescribed 1 two times a day. I have not figured out how to space them correctly. I am not sure if it is working, as I still have pain most of the time.

Painful Periods	purple_kismet, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/21/2009 1:54:32 AM	I started taking this medication today, as Ponstel, Naproxen Sodium, and 800 mg of Motrin aren't working anymore. This medication works wonders. I took 2 initially, followed by 1 tablet, about 7 hours later. No PAIN at all after the second dose. Only side affect was a slight headache after the first 2, but I hadn't eaten anything. My cramps were also causing nausea and diarrhea so eating was at a minimum. I ate some jello before the second dose and had no side affect at all. I am taking Diclofenac, the generic and its very inexpensive. Only $5 for 30 tablets. I must say I am impressed. I don't have the &quot;out of it&quot; feeling that Lortab and Darvovet give me and that's great. By overall it just works. Next month, I will start taking it before my period starts and see if that eliminates the cramps all together. I highly recommend this medication. To those with cramps, there is hope.

Helped the pain/swelling fast. Began feeling improvement within half and hour. However, also felt quite dizzy within 15 minutes.would have given 5 stars except for side effects: dizzy/minor nausea/reduced urine output/ and an &quot;icky feeling&quot;.Side effects lessened after a couple days use for the most part, and when I switched to using it late at night. (I didn't feel safe to drive after taking during the day)I only took one per day instead of Rx'd 3 per day due to side effects.Even so-it really helped my wrist pain, as well as arthritis pain everywhere (which is not what I was given it for)50 mg. of cataflam once a day helped all of my body pain better than 800 mg. of Motrin 3 times a day.
