Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/21/2012 11:07:39 AM	Ive been smoking for close to 14 years I wanted to quit for my daughter. My doctor told me smoke for the first week and set a quit date and I did both. I got threw 10 days without one slipped once and suffered from a major headache. It really makes you want to quit. If you keep smoking while on the product the sickness will stay..

Stop Smoking	BEE, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	3/21/2012 11:51:28 PM	My 4th week now.Smoking about 5 a day but was smoking a pack and a half a day.Nausea is everyday,all day.Lack of energy from being sick all day.Going to try the 15 minutes of eating tomorrow.Been eating with it.I would love this product if I didn't get so sick.Because every day the craving,the wanting is less.But not the sick feeling.I tried twice a day,the doc said either way,once or twice.So I tried it once a day,figured maybe atleast get relief in evening from feeling sick but either way,just sick feeling....
Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	1/26/2012 1:26:36 PM	I smoked for the 7 day that were suggested.  I had my last cigarette 16 days ago.  I have only erallyt craved one on 1 day.  it passed with out having one.  I do have vivid dreams but not nightmares.  My husband and daughter both smoke... they try not to around me but I still smell it.  So far this has not really bothered me.  I honestly have no desire to have a cigarette.  I am very tired.  Not sure if this is a side effect.  My husband thinks it is more that usual...   I will call doctor and check.  All in all I think it works.

Stop Smoking	Miss D, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	12/10/2011 12:33:33 AM	I started this medication a week and a half ago and I set my quit date for 4 days ago. So far it has been really easy to stop and I quit on the date I set. It feels like when my mind tries to think about smoking it pushes the thought right out of my head. As for the side effects, it is really hard to sleep at night because of the dreams and I've had a few bad headaches. I am also experiencing the nausea, so I make sure I eat something at least 15 minutes before I take it. Sometimes it helps, sometimes not. Although the side effects are a bit rough, I am very happy with the results and I would recommend this medication.        
Stop Smoking	newday-newlife, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	45-54	10/20/2011 2:30:03 PM	I am on day 12 of my starter pack. I have not had a cigarette today nor am I carrying any on me. I only smoked 5 on day 10, 2 1/2 on day 11 and zip for today. On Saturday the 15th, my goal was to finish the last 4 packs in a carton. But the med made me slow down so much I still have 3 unopened packs so I knew it would take forever to finish them. I gave them away. As far as not craving, this medication is excellent. I still have the mental want to but the physical craving is gone. Now, not to make this sound so flawless, it has not been. I have fought terrible nausea, it felt as if I had morning sickness all day. It was awful until I read other reviews here, took others advice and tried eating about 15 minutes before I took it. It has made a world of difference. I also having those real vivid dreams so I am not resting as well but I can deal with it to stop smoking. My concentration is a little off but nothing worrisome. I have smoked for roughly 30 years at a pack a day most of it. I started trying to jog and could not breathe so it was time. Plus I was sick of being the minority in a crowd. I feel good about this attempt and recommend this medicine. Just be sure to talk to your doctor at length. I hope this is the date I can say I quit smoking.   
Stop Smoking	TheLensGirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	10/10/2011 11:10:49 PM	On second week of start pack. The first .5mg and 1mg days were good, noticed a considerable reduction in cravings with little to no side effects. When I started the 2mg days, I get extremely nauseous after the morning pill but not the evening pill. I also have increased cravings, making it harder to not smoke. I will be calling my doctor to see if its possible to just do the .5 or 1mg a day dosage for rest of the treatment period.
Stop Smoking	I have none, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	8/29/2011 2:08:37 AM	My senses are all messed up. Especially taste and smell. Everything tastes BAD and smells are extreme, good and bad.  I finished all but the last week of the starter pack and had to quit.  I've been off chantix for 3-4 weeks and the symptoms are only getting worse. I might quit food before I quit smoking.  This stuff scares me.  Anything that messes with your well being so much should be watched very closely.
