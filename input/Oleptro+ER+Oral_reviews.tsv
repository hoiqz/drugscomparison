Major Depressive Disorder	Trazadone, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	7/31/2012 2:07:34 PM	I was very tired and disoriented. I also experienced a very fast heart beat. It scared me and I had a fever. Stopped taking after 3 days on it.
Major Depressive Disorder	Austin, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	2/5/2012 9:15:19 PM	I had been on numerous SSRI medications and was not too happy with the side effects, mostly sexual side effects. I initially tried Instant release Trazodone, and found it helped, but It always found myself in a fog in the mornings. I stumbled on Oleptro after some internet research, so I decided to give it a try(300mg), Its been much better, I wake up feeling refreshed and my depression has been much more tolerable, and I still get the great sleep I got from taking the instant release version. Id recommend this to anyone who traditional SSRI's were ineffective or who ever doesn't like the side effects.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/15/2011 10:22:50 AM	I have been taking Oleptro for 4 months.  Olepetro not only helps me with my mood, but also has eased my restless leg problems, I sleep more soundly and stay asleep through the night.  It also seems to help me with my ADHD problems of staying on task, and keeping organized.  My side effects are mild blurred vision, which has eased over time, and some constipation. Insurance won't pay, so I have to rely on samples from my DR.

The really good news for me is that I have no/minimal side effects (as compared with Cymbalta). It does a fairly good job with my depression - at least as good as Cymbalta.
Other	grace, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/22/2011 7:07:58 PM	Ive been taking this medication for sleep for 2 months now and I love it. I tried everything to help me sleep with no luck. I started on 75mg and im up to 150mg now. I take it at bedtime, and i crush the pill. Dont recoommend this to anyone but that is what i do with it. Im out like a light in 30-40 minutes. Im a little groggy in the morning but that soon wears off. For a sleep aid it is WONDERFUL. Ive had No side effects other than the groggyness in the morning. Highly reccomend it for sleep problems. 
Major Depressive Disorder	Pain4real, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	35-44	6/16/2011 11:30:22 PM	I've been on this for a week and my ankles are swollen, I'm retaining water and constantly have the chills.  I also have been light headed, my equilibrium is off and my mouth and hands tingle. As of last night, I went to bed and could not get up this morning. Have had bizarre dreams as well, but I do not wake up a bazillion times either. So far I'm on the fence with this and need to contact my DR.
Major Depressive Disorder	Quibproquo, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	5/6/2011 11:31:06 AM	I took 75mgs (half tablet) per day at first and it was so sedating I went 1/4 tablets.  After a couple weeks my body adjusted and I no longer felt tired all day.  I'm now at 150mgs per day at bedtime.It is a wonderful sleep aid and a mild anti-depressant.  It normalizes bowel movements after years of loose/irritable bowel syndrome. I love it.  It seems to have a weak anti-depressant effect.  I use it mainly for sound sleep with no hangover effect.  No sweats or aches.The only side effect is blurred vision.  No sexual side effects like cymbalta.  I'm not sure about weight gain.  It sometimes acts as an appetite suppressant but at other times, I'm ravenously hungry and overeat for 2 days at a time.  I've gained 5-7 lbs in 3 months but have done some serious binge eating.  My hope is that if I can get a get a grip on my tendency to overeat, this drug may actually suppress the appetite.    
Major Depressive Disorder	Mike, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	3/9/2011 1:54:29 PM	stopped Lexapro due to weight gain. Started Oleptro at 75 for 1 week than increased by 75mg to 300mg. Worked great with benefit of being able to fall asleep and not wake up throughout the night. Doctor was able to stop Lunesta and treat depression/sleep problems with Oleptro 300mg once daily at bedtime.
Major Depressive Disorder	try, try again, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	3/2/2011 1:13:45 PM	Caused severe night sweats and muscle aches. Disappointed because the depression went away but the muscle aches and waking up soaking wet every night made me discontinue.
Major Depressive Disorder	Margaret, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	2/27/2011 8:16:59 PM	I expected to be satisfied with the results of this drug because I'd taken and tolerated trazadone for many years in conjunction with other anti-depressants.  In fact, I failed to connect my adverse reactions to the drug for some weeks because of my favorable pre-disposition.  But by process of elimination I zeroed in on Oleptro as the cause of my severe muscle pain and hair loss. I ache worse than any flu aches I've ever had all over my body and I've lost about 40% of my hair! So disappointed. 
Major Depressive Disorder	Anon E Mous, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	2/8/2011 9:11:07 PM	Dizziness in the morning.  Sexual side effects.  Sore breasts.  Lower back pain.  Some tingling/numbness in extremities. Nasal stuffiness.  Disrupted sleep.This was prescribed in conjunction with existing Wellbutrin treatment.  I've been happy with Wellbutrin, but the doctor thought a little added antidepressant effect might be helpful and also help with sleep.  The side effects just made it too difficult to continue.  And it didn't help me sleep any better.
Major Depressive Disorder	35male, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/7/2011 11:37:47 AM	So far the experience has been wonderful.  I have previously been on Lexapro and Pristiq and had a variety of side effects with both.  I have been sleeping better than I can ever remember and have not gained weight or had any sexual side effects.  I am very satisfied at this point.

Major Depressive Disorder	User Beware, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/29/2010 4:33:50 AM	Terrible experience when only taking 75 MG...bizarre dreams, sleeping for 19 hours, blurred vision, overwhelming feeling of sadness, crying for no reason, vomiting, terrible stomach pains, nausea, feeling confused and unable to concentrate, loss for words, difficulty focusing, flu like aches over entire body, unsteady and unsure of myself, (even after I stopped taking Oleptro), and most importantly, I lost one week of work. Also, out $ for a med that I will never take again nor would I suggest this to anyone else. Scary medicine. User beware! I had all of the side effects, but at an elevated level. My doctor wanted me to gradually up my dosage to 300 MG a day! Can't imagine what this dosage would do to me.Consider all of this before taking this med.
