However, lately the stomach upset is terrible.  I am taking myself off this drug and going to an OTC medication.  It feels like I will vomit any second and the weight gain is uncontrollable- 20 + lbs. There has to be a drug to help patients without making us 'sick.'

They say that depending on how much is in your system it takes it sometime to get out of your system. 1/2 dosage takes 24 hrs and so on.

OTC ibuprofen didn't help.  I have been taking pain killers but because of my job I couldn't take it that often and when I did, it wasn't enough. I've been on Relafen 750mg twice a day for a month now.  There is a difference.  It definitely helps but I'm still in pain.  As others have stated, I can also tell when it's getting close to the time for the next dose.

I have arthritis in my lower back and hip, and in the colder months the pain becomes unbearable. This medication will probably make you a little sick at first, so take with food...but after a few weeks I have adapted to it. I seen a lot of people commenting on the drug that only took it for a day or two, hang in there if you can...I personally think the side effects are much better than the pain.

I have patellar tracking issues, mild osteoarthritis because of same, and both lateral and medial ligament sprains along with possible meniscal tear or frays. Basically, my knee is a mess and causes referred pain from ankle to hip, I await corrective surgery and am in PT. I can't take &quot;pain killers&quot; because I have two small children and a husband that travels, so drowsy/stoned is not an option. I begged for an anti-inflammatory-something OTHER than Ibuprofen which I was eating like candy. My mistake. It all went well for a quite a  days. I was careful to take with food, drink plenty of water, blah blah blah. I was a little more fatigued than usual, but the swelling under my knee subsided and the pain, overall, seemed somewhat eased and I was more mobile. Also, not waking in the night or waking TO pain was a plus. I was rx'd 500mg bid 2x but only took once, mid-day, after I felt I'd eaten something substantial. But the knee got me, and I started taking 2x a day. Then I got sick. I mean SICK  &amp; as another poster said, ENDURING. I thought I'd gotten food poisoning. But, I didn't ever connect this to the relafen. I couldn't eat with all the vomiting, went on a BRAT diet, laid off ALL meds (sorry, knee) and FIVE days later started to feel normal again, went back on the Relafen, and that's when the bleeding started. Hemorrhaghic uterine non-menstrual bleeding. I'm otherwise healthy, have had ultrasounds, labs drawn, etc., and there is no other obvious reason. So now I'm having to take meds to stop that issue AND an anti-nausea because the new meds cause vomiting, and it took three days for the bleeding to stop. Needless to say,  I'm off the Relafen. I wish Vioxx wasn't killing seniors because those were the days, weren't they?

I will be teested for this very soon, however Degen Disc Dis runs in the family as well. I will update my report in a couple of weeks. I pray it continues to help me with no damaging side effects. Im very fortunate with various medications, they do what they are suppose to do, with litte side effect from anything. I've taken so many different narcotic pain relievers. I've just been changed to the combination of Oxycontin-pain, Norflex-muscle relax, Percocet for break-thru pain during the day a needed, and now the Relafen for the inflamation. I'm praying they have found the right combination, as I want to do without another surgery as long as I can. Thank you all for your reviews. Hang in there to all of you, who's physican/pain mgmnt teams have not yet found the combination to help you.

She took one dose of it and it destroyed her liver. A donor could not be located in time and she passed away. She was on no other medication at the time.

Now after the surgery, it does help. It seems to depend on your level of pain as to how effective it is. I also take after eating something as I have to watch what it could do to my stomach (had issues with taking baby aspirin for years!). It does take a week or so before discovering if it works for you.

In a 24hr. period I can deal with my pain. It has helped to take the edge off enough that I can for the first time in 12 months clean around things and do stuff that was too hard to do because of the pain. I know it's hard to believe, but, I have been dealing with this chronic pain for 4 years. And so maybe I am sensitive to the results so quickly. But, I do know that I feel better than I have in 4 years. I also take with this drug tramadol for pain.

I have been through hell with NSAIDS and I'm finding taking 3 Aleve works the best. I know that Naproxin and Aleve are the same thing but Aleve is more effective for me.  Anyways, on to Relafen. I just started taking it today..I've taken 2 pills. I am so sick I can't think straight. My stomach hurts so bad and the thought or smell of food is sickening. It's like having a stomach virus. Like I said, I've only taken 2 pills but I've noticed NO pain relief at all. I'm more miserable now because of the stomach pain.  It's not worth it!

This drug is one of the &quot;cocktail&quot; of drugs I take but seems to be very effective.  The other effective one is Singulair.  The relafen causes stomach problems which were well controlled by Nexium until Blue Cross Blue Shield decided they no longer wanted to provide Nexium.  No other stomach medicine has been effective for me to overcome the effects of the Relafen and I really do need to take the Relafen.  Nothing else has given me the relief the Relafen has.

I took this relafen and about 2 hours later it hit and stayed with me 2 days plus. I have not been so sick from a medication, you talk about an enduring sickness too. As you can probably see, I had no benefit what-the-so-ever from this med and would not recommend it's use on any mammal past or present.

I did have some stomach upset, but not horribly bad, take with food or within 30 minutes of eating and the stomach upset didn't occur. I had to quit taking it because of the rash.

Other	Bella, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/3/2008 9:00:06 AM	Was beat until almost dead by my roommate and resulted in seriously aggravating my bad back (rollover accident fourteen years ago) from cervical to lumbar. It felt like my spine was wrung like a washcloth. Most pain relievers just make me high and I sleep, but this medication @500 mg twice a day actually worked. It doesn't make me high, but I can tell it's in my system. Since this is short term, I will miss the pain relief I also get from the arthritis in my hand. I am 45 years old and in good health, smoke and drink regularly which is bad. I take this med with food which helps. No adverse side effects to date. Eleven more days to take this one-time prescription.

I've tried several other anti-inflammatory drugs, and this keeps me pain free, and feeling &quot;normal&quot;.  There have been a few times, I've forgotten to take it.  I'm reminded that same day with pain and limping.  The only thing I don't like are the bruises that pop up for no reason. Right now, I have 5 on one arm, 2 on the other, and at least 8 between both legs.  They're no larger than a half dollar, but I look like an abused woman.  I need to let my Dr. know, but I'm afraid he'll take it away!
