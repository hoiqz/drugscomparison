High Cholesterol	goedelite, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male		12/17/2011 11:18:48 PM	A possibly serious side-effect makes me &quot;not satisfied&quot; in the star ratings.  I had been taking 20mg/day of lovastatin, prescribed for a 200mg/dl  cholesterol level.  It lowered my cholesterol to about 170.  My HD level was not been a problem.  An ultrasound of my liver reported a course textured image, which is interpreted as a &quot;fatty&quot; liver.  The ultrasound was made because my blood showed high levels of AST and ALT enzymes; also a low albumen.  The blood work-up followed a surgical procedure,  a laproscopic colon resection made necessary by a colonoscopy that punctured my colon.  The AST, ALT and albumin levels have all returned to the normal range, but now my ALK-P level is slightly above normal.  I have ceased taking lovastatin since the ultrasound.   My personal opinion is the lovastatin caused my &quot;fatty&quot; liver, and the stresses of my surgery were not causative.  They may have raised my enzymes temporarily but did not give me a coarse textured liver.

Am also having problems with other statin drugs. Will see what the doctor says on Tuesday.
High Cholesterol	redismyneutral, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	1/30/2010 1:31:14 AM	I started this medication about 6-8 weeks ago.  The muscle pains diminished over about 3-4 weeks.  What has not diminished is nausea.  I cannot be a passenger in a vehicle after taking my medication.  If I take it at night, I cannot sleep because of the rather severe nausea.  Any suggestions?

I am surprised by this effect as I am 50 yo in good general health and exercise consistently. I experience this problem with every statin I've taken, and I've tried several.

LDLs went from 94 to 70 and my Total Cholesterol went from 188 to 140.  Very effective drug but had some short term memory loss and libido went down.  Doc still wants me on it.  70 might be ideal for LDLs but when does a 140 Cholesterol or lower become a liability.  Trying to ascertain the negatives of a low Cholesterol. Not satisified with my Doc.

High Cholesterol	barsee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	3/25/2009 7:23:56 PM	I have been on a daily 20mg regime for 15months. Though I exercised regularly and vigourously for years it became clear that exercise and diet was insufficient in controlling my cholesterol level. My latest lipid results indicated a more than 30% drop in my LDL so my internist and I are very pleased with the results. And I might add that there leaves no doubt that genetics play a significant role in my particular case. I am feeling terrific! (do yoga, cardio, strength and resistance training, eat omega 3 foods and adhere to healthy eating habits)

Have been taking it for 3 years. Doctor approves! Helps me not to reach my Medicare Plan D gap and still does the job for $4.00 per month!
