Birth Control	Momtomany, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	35-44	9/17/2012 8:45:47 AM	I cannot use hormonal birth control and latex condoms. I  have been using VCF for several months. My husband And I am happy with it. Sometimes it's hard to get in and sometimes I need to add ky jelly due to vaginal dryness to make sure it desolves properly. It makes oral unpleasant so that's out when in use. It's cheap and easy best of all it works. I will keep using them as long as needed.

Birth Control	JeniB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	6/30/2012 8:49:36 PM	I have been using this product for 6 months with no problems. I tried Encare first and that burned my husband. Then I tried VCF and we love it. I had a problem at first with the film sticking to my finger, so I made sure my hands were dry and clean and folded the film again. Now I can insert the film like a pro, even in the dark. I will definately keep using this product. It's cheaper and safer than the pill.
Birth Control	Bri95, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	13-18	6/21/2012 6:43:24 PM	I tryed it for a while but didn't love it, of course i was using it with the pill I just wouldn't risk it without a backup 74% effectiveness isn't effective enough for me! In gonna stick to the pill and a condom much easier to use :)
Birth Control	WPN, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	6/21/2012 1:13:26 PM	It feels like you are not wearing anything. So far I haven't had any problems at all. I was excited to find something hormonal free and that it didn't irritate me. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/11/2012 12:30:49 AM	I though this contraceptive was the WORST i could eveer buy, it hurts to put it in and gets stuck to the vagina wall even though i folded it once or even twice..do not waste your money...
Birth Control	bblang26, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/25/2012 11:18:09 AM	Love this product!!!  I have been using this form of BC since I started having a period.  I tried other methods like the pill, IUD, and the ring. All have failed!  So I continure to come back to VCF film...its wonderful and very safe!!!  Thank god there is something effective other than sterilzation!  (and even that isnt 100%)
Birth Control	Susie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/6/2012 1:17:33 AM	I've used this product for years...I har a 13 yr old, 11 yr old and 4 year old...I also have had 5 miscarriages so I know I get pregnant easily when not using broth control. I have no idea how someone can have this stuck to their finger and it not come off. Fold it in half again after opening, make sure your hands are dry and put in up all the way. Use your cervix to help you remove from finger. More simple than A condom. I'm flabbergasted that people can't do this. I've also just put it on my husband when he is erect and he did his thing. When he is up there, it has obviously dissolved. Burning? I'm sure some people may be sensitive, I'm sensitive to latex and have condom issues. This has never once given me an issue.the review about cramping and bleeding? Yeah, that's not from this. Probably just your period. Duh. This is the BEST contraceptive out there. I've tried them ALL! (the 4 year old was a foam baby...so yeah, that didn't work for me) this stuff is awesome. If you're not a complete moron, you can use this! 
Birth Control	LeighLeigh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	3/7/2012 7:43:57 AM	I love this product i use to get rashes from condoms and we tried pretty much every kind i found this not only is it easy to put in and affective but it makes sex more enjoyable have not had any bleeding cramps nothing that has been mentioned i guess its a trial and error some people can use it some cant 
Birth Control	leao123, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	2/28/2012 11:42:11 PM	I was feeling fine before using the product, the next day worse cramps feeling very uncomfortable! Its been going on for 2 days now. I hope its nothing bad! 
Birth Control	Madness35, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/15/2012 12:15:48 PM	I have used this product for years. Never any problems, pain, bleeding as mentioned by other users. Your hands must be dry before inserting the film which I or my husband roll up before inserting. 
Birth Control	ana, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	12/30/2011 12:53:30 AM	Had a hard time using it from the very beginning! it wouldn't come off my fingers, and once it did I began feeling discomfort shortly after. I've had horrible cramps for the last week and have had trouble with my left leg and arm. I hope there is no infection. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/13/2011 10:59:24 PM	I have had no problems putting the film in and no side effects other than not getting pregnant.  My husband prefers it to condoms and I prefer it over taking the pill.  I have used this product for about six months.
Birth Control	ANNONYMOUS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/29/2011 9:23:55 AM	I am totally flabberghasted to find that other women have had ill effects from using this method...I too wasted several films trying to insert and developed a serious infection...the antibiotics are not helping with the irritation that does not seem to be going away, and I would tell anyone thinking of using this method....DON'T !!!! I only hope the damage it's caused is not permanent...UNREAL!!!!
Birth Control	Seaandra, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/25/2011 10:09:56 PM	We can never get one to stay in, stuck to my finger, my husband tried also thinking maybe a different angle would work...nothing. We have tried on many occasions, wasting a total of at least 10 of the films. I like the foam, ill just stick with  that, although we learned you have to fill the applicator in the light, sometimes it just fills with air, and thats how we have our 6 year old son (but its okay, we kinda like the kid now haha) FILM-absolutely NOT, but foam...when used properly is okay.
Birth Control	justined0414, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	9/19/2011 9:35:57 AM	I used this product for the first time this weekend in addition to my birth control and the morning after I had really painful cramping in my abdomen and down my legs. A few hours later I started bleeding heavily and was unable to get out of bed. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
Birth Control	ggg, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	9/18/2011 12:48:26 AM	Used for two monthes.  ended up pregnant.
Birth Control	JESSBELL, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	19-24	9/9/2011 4:01:28 PM	I had used the product previously without any problems, we i stopped using it for a while since my boyfriend and I prefered using condoms. Yesterday we decided to use one of the films and it was horrible! All of a sudden I started bleeding!!! As soon as i took it out the bleeding stopped but I will never use this product again!!!!!!!!!
Other	 Female 	1	1	1	Female		9/6/2011 9:49:02 PM	This product did NOT satisfy me; in fact, it created several issues and it was extremely difficult to use. 1. Difficult to insert. It stuck to my hand while I attempted to insert it. I had to go through several films before I correctly inserted it. 2. I woke up the next day with a painful, itchy, yeast infection. This yeast infection lasted for over a week. 3. I developed abrasions on my vaginal walls because after it dissolved, it ruined the natural lubrication in my vagina. I still cannot have sex as it is too painful. I am waiting for the abrasions to heal. And NO, it is not herpes; I had them checked out by the doctor and they were simply abrasions on the walls of my vagina. 4. Overall I would NEVER EVER recommend that anyone use this! Anything but this product. VCF has caused me to stay abstinente for weeks now! 
Birth Control	HATEVCF, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/11/2011 9:16:17 AM	I had to go thru three films also, finally balling the film up and shoving it inside me and it still tred to stick to my finger. After 24 hours, I woke up with a HUGE rash on my abdomen that has been driving me crazy, have vaginal pain, and my breasts are irritated also.  I am having to use lotions creams and and benedryl to keep the itching and pain at a minimum.  WILL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	7/30/2011 4:14:52 PM	I went through 3 films before one actually stuck. It was not a...pleasant experience. Not to mention the fact that I developed some kind of vaginal infaction the next day, and was sexually out-of-commission for a week. I'm assuming it was effective since I'm not pregnant, but this might be from the result of forced abstinence more than the spermacide. I threw the rest away and am switching to something else.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	6/19/2011 2:28:55 PM	I was using condoms and VCF and ended up pregnant. Ironically, while sitting in the doctors office a woman spoke of her same experience using VCF. Not effective!! I would NEVER use this product again.
Birth Control	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	45-54	3/4/2011 10:34:35 AM	Even though I had dry clean hands, the film still stuck to my finger.  I went through 2 films then by the 3rd time it worked to stay up there because I had to double fold it.  Not sure yet if I like them.  
Birth Control	effinouch, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	1/30/2011 12:18:23 PM	It's easy to put in, and possibly effective when you use it, but I wouldn't know because it practically shut down sexual functions for me. The day after, it still burns slightly. I'll be sticking with condoms from now on.
Birth Control	rose413m, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	12/7/2010 12:41:10 PM	After the first use I felt fine, until later that night. I woke up to extreme irritation &amp; itching. Thought nothing of it &amp; used VCF again, within a few hrs I was swollen, bumpy, itchy, red &amp; severely irritated!!!!! Im in alotta pain at the moment &amp; Im trying to ease the pain... 
Birth Control	Carolyn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	8/15/2009 3:55:01 PM	I've had numerous infections since starting  to use it and wondered if thecontracaptive film is irritating me. Doctors so far haven't had any pros or cons regarding its usage or possible side effects when I've asked, just have given me more and more antibiotics.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/7/2009 2:02:36 AM	I have found the VCF to be an easy and effective birth control. Condoms have caused rawness and or pain and swelling. I've been using VCF's for 5 years running. I'm 32 years old. 
Birth Control		5	4	1			3/14/2009 9:44:08 AM	After inserting VCF it caused irritation and bleeding during sex. Good idea, but maybe too strong.
Birth Control	Mirabilia, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	10/4/2008 8:50:59 PM	My fifth time using it, it caused inflammation and bleeding from within. Looks like mini-lesions. Very uncomfortable and itchy for days after.
