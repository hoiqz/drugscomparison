Sudden Recurrence/Intensity of Rapid Regular Heartbeats	nwflapoke, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	8/9/2012 4:04:32 PM	I have been on this drug, first 50mg 2x a day and now up to 150mg 2 x day for 3 yrs. In addition I take Toprol once a day. As the strength has increase so has the instances of dizziness and some nausea on occasion. But it has been mostly effective in controlling sudden rapid heartbeat. I would say that  it has controlled it 80-85 percent of the time. I am not sure I can ever get rid of it 100% so I will take this. I have this electrically problem for a decade or more but the medical community just stared controlling on me in the last 5-6 years. As anyone who has it knows when the heart takes off it is very uncomfortable and scary.

Atrial Fibrillation	energizer bunny, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	5	3	Female		3/29/2012 10:47:12 AM	I'm 78, had AFib for a year+, 2 failed ablations and 1 failed cardioversion and many changes in meds. I went on Flecainide about two weeks ago and my pulse rate remained high until 3 days ago. That evening I passed out on the couch beside my husband. Even since that episode both my blood presssure and pulse rate have been at my lifelong low normal. Today I passed out again and hit the floor while working in the kitchen. So far, myelectro-cardiologist has given no explanation.Flecainide is the only change in meds or life that my husband and I can determine. Flecainide good? bad?

As someone who has had numerous side effects with the imitation version of brand name drugs I guess its back to the drawing board. I might look into the cryo ablation at the mayo clinic to fix what 5 prior ablations have helped control but not rid me of A-fib.

Atrial Fibrillation	 Book Lady, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	5/20/2011 12:19:23 PM	I have had A-Fib for over 20 years. In my case it started with infrequent episodes once or twice a year but episodes have increased frequency as the years went by. Finally I began having them frequently and they would last for days. Recently had a 6-hour ablation but went into AFib again before I even left the hospital. It was distressing! After 2 weeks finally got the heart back in rhythm with Flecainide, Toprol XL and Atacand. Unfortunately now on Coumadin for a few months. The Ablation (6 hours) went well but the anaesthesia made me extremely anxious which lasted for several days. MOST IMPORTANT--find an experienced ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIST (a cardiologist who specializes in heart arrythmias) to work with your regular cardiologist. If he/she doesn't listen to you--find someone else who will. Side effects with Flecainide: tiredness, blurry vision, occasional breathlessness, hair thinning--not exactly a girl's dream. But the Flecainide has been better than anything else to keep the heart in rhythm. Pradaxa was awful; I had to get off of it within a week due to how much it upset my stomach. Read all you can on any drug you are asked to take and if you have a problem--tell the doctor.

Decided to have the heart cath/ablation which worked great except that one node was not able to be ablated because it was touching a &quot;main&quot; node and I would have needed a pacemaker if they attempted to ablate it. Because of this I was started on Flecainide the next day in the hospital. Started with 50 mg 2x a day and within 2 months moved up to 75mg 2x a day. At my 6 mos check the EKG showed my heart rhythym to be 100...way over my normal 65. I'm currently waiting to hear from the doctor to determine what next.

As for side effects, I have not noticed anything.  I hope it continues to work!

My doctor thinks I should now go on a blood thinner because of my age.  I'm holding out and reading about natural remedies.  I want to discuss it with the doctor at the next appointment. A-fib has seriously effected my life.  I use to enjoy red wine with my meals but it is a trigger for my A-Fib.  I take a chance when I have alcohol so I usually don't.  That's difficult because I'm single and socialize a lot and enjoy one or two drinks.
Atrial Fibrillation	JohnS, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	9/6/2009 4:26:28 PM	On 2 x 50mg/day for about 4 weeks now. After being on Sotalol for 3 years and going into AF due to Bacardi &amp; coke (Stupid combo for an AF sufferer I know). Anyway still in NSR, only the odd flutter in 4 weeks. I have been having some mild side effects, slight headache, feeling slightly short of breath, and an anxious feeling in the stomach. I take cod liver oil every day which seems to have helped with the constipation. However despite all this I don't feel so tired now I'm off the Sotalol.

Started 100mg 2x/day. after about 2yrs was having blurred vision and issues with heart racing episodes lasting 20+ minutes leaving me exhausted as well as original issue on occasion. Dosage is now 150mg 2x/day with low episodes. Blurred vision is still a problem.

Increasing frequency of breakthroughs prompted increasing dose to current 2 x 100 mg taken 12 hr apart.  Still get breakthroughs every few days to weeks.  When this happens, two 100 mg tabs taken at same time will convert me to SR in 1-6 hr.  So far I haven't had to be cardioverted. No significant side effects except maybe post nasal drip?? 
Heart Ventricle Rhythm Problem		5	5	5			8/10/2009 10:52:59 PM	I have had the radio frequecy oblation to stop the afib,10 years ago (never have had another episode)But I suffered from pvcs(irregular beats). So I have taken 150 to 200mgs twice a day for 10 years, I have been chronically fatigued since and have had periods of trouble sleeping. I would never want to go back though to the way things were.I would recommend the surgery to anyone suffering from afib. If anyone has any questions feel welcome to email me walleye123456@hotmail.com

Seem to have trouble sleeping, only manage four good hours then on and off after that if I'm lucky.  Not sure if this is a common side effect.

Seemingly effective till recently. For many, many months, now,  have been so fatigued - can hardly, barely even function most days. IT IS EXTREME! Have read that a side effect can be tiredness or fatigue.  Have not seen Dr. since end of Feb. -- she said I didn't need to see her for 6 months or so. I sometimes do feel she is not really listening ( is not really considering what I am saying to her!) Am also taking metapropol twice daily for high blood pressure.  I do need to loose weight --however with the fatigue being so extreme, I simply cannot function. 
Atrial Fibrillation	della street, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	7/4/2009 1:12:15 AM	I had undiagnosed AFib far too long before a heart attack 4 years 11 months ago.  In the treatment following the heart attack, I was put on Flecainide among a medicine chest of other drugs: Metoprolol 150x2; Plavix, Lipitor, Altace, Lasix and Protonix.  We started at 50x2 a day.  The episodes were less frequent, then started up again to the point I woke up during the night in soaking wet with sweat and 160+ heart rate.  So we increased to 100x2 a year ago.  I even went 3 months without a single flutter.  But when they came back, they now are 4-5 times a week and last for hours.  So last week, cardiologist changed dosage to 150x2 and has referred me to a Cardiac Electrophysiologist with ablation in mind.  I will continue to research treatments and new meds and adjust my meds before I have an ablation.

My pharmacy told me they were going to quit making the brand so my cardiologist said the generic was fine. I started having irregular beats within 2 weeks.  After 2 months I was having episodes of V-tach about every hour.  I have gone back on the brand name and it has been almost a month and my heart beat is getting back to normal.  Just hope they continue to manufacture the brand name.

I don't know if this drug is making a difference. My doctor says it should. Could I be at risk of other heart problems using this drug?

Atrial Fibrillation	winlou, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/20/2009 10:14:29 AM	Diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with about 7 episodes ranging from 4-15 hours each this last year.  Have been on Lopressor for last 4 years which didn't seem to help much over this last year so cardiologist added Flecainide Acetate, and directed that hospital stay was not required because of the low dose and I should take it on an outpatient basis.  Performed baseline EKG which was normal.  I then took this med in morning and at night, about 12 hours apart, for one week and had many side effects from left chest and shoulder pain, jaw pain, feeling strangulation in sides of neck, hard to breathe, lethargy, etc.  After the 3rd day I was ready to go to emergency, because I physically felt so bad, but &quot;hung in there.&quot;  Subsequently, the symptoms seemed to lessen, however, the intermittent chest discomfort remained.  Little did I know that this med was having very negative effects on my heart.  Had follow-up cardiology appointment one week later with follow-up EKG.  Thankfully, my subsequent EKG returned to normal after one week off this medication.  Now, my doctor has prescribed another drug, on an outpatient basis also, even though the manufacturer states that it should be given while in the hospital, and I have serious reservations.

It has controlled the afib  but has caused extreme constipation.  Taking stool softeners and hour after taking the tablet corrects that but creates other problems.  Can't seem to win at all.

Very effective.  The only &quot;break through&quot; was when I physically exhausted myself for about 13 hours.  After rest everything was fine.

Atrial Fibrillation	Brian J., 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	25-34	1/12/2009 2:58:33 PM	I'm on 50mg of Flecainide and have been taking it for about 1.5yrs. I am currently 27yrs old and started on it about a month before my 26th birthday. Have suffered from side effects ranging from blurry vision and constipation to trouble sleeping and  trouble getting up in the mornings after I finally do fall asleep. I feel exhausted during the middle of the day and completely drained around 7pm or so. Blurred vision and trouble focusing are the main side-effects I feel.The drug does stop the A-Fib but if you miss one dose, you feel the A-Fib coming back and takes a day or two of taking it exactly when you're supposed to take it to rid the feeling of A-Fib coming back. I do feel some symptoms of A-Fib around the 10-11hr mark after taking it though, mainly shortness of breath.
Heart Ventricle Rhythm Problem	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/30/2008 4:49:26 AM	Have had PVC's for 2 years and tried to control with Beta Blockers, Calcium Channel Blockers, and a combination of both with no relief. First took 50mgs twicw a day with no relief then increased to 100mgs twice a day and it was like day and night. After 2 years on this dose and 50mg once a day of Atenalol, still have relief of symptoms.

I would have severe episodes 10-15 times a week. I have been on Flecainide for nearly month and have had no episodes at all. This drug has been wonderful for me. The only side effect I have noticed is blurred vision... its bothersome for about an hour or so after taking the drug and then goes away.

Seems each drug I takes takes its &quot;pound of flesh&quot; in other ways.  Although I have NOT had an episode of A-Fib since taking this drug, I have had other symptoms which I can't pin down to the drug or others I take.  Overall nausea (a sick backache?) and other &quot;discomforts&quot;.  Overall I feel I am better off with this drug than without.

Atrial Fibrillation	Bobo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/26/2008 7:09:25 PM	I have had A-fib for over 30 years on an irregular basis. I averaged one episode a year until June of 2006. That is when I started having A-fib 3 times a week on average. My Cardiologist has tried many drugs to control it. Finally in September he put me on Flecainide 50mg twice a day and I haven't had a sustainable episode since. I can feel my heart wanting to start A-fib, but it goes back into normal rythym immediately. I do feel that at my next appointment we will probably try 100mg twice a day because I feel the A-fib coming on more often towards my next dosage, usually 9-10 hours after taking the dosage in the morning.  As far as side effects go, I really can't attribute anything to Flecainide. I will say that I have had very vivid dreams since taking it, but I really enjoy that,so it is a harmful side effect if at all. All in all,if you have A-fib,I highly recommend Flecainide. It has been the only drug that has worked for me. A-fib is a pian in the butt,especially when you are around people that don't understand. I avoid that conversation with everyone I can. I keep my friends informed, but everyone else is on a need to know basis.

I started taking 50mg twice a day after trying numerous other meds first.  It decreased them to half so we have increased to 100mg twice a day and my PVCs are gone unfortunately I am nauseous, sleepy and have blurred vision.  Will see if that improves before changing.  It is wonderful not to have the PVCs!

I will NOT go through any surgery as long as I can control the condition with this drug. I don't know of any side effects I can attribute to this med. I take a generic form of the medicine. Can't skip any doses or I get into trouble.

After 3 months, feel it is due to one of my medications...or combinations. Also on Aceon and Lipitor.

I just had a cardiac ablation, recovering quickly, 3rd day, up and doing some errands, no heavy lifting or extreme activities, or I can feel it at the entry site's.Less than 24 hrs after having the ablation, I went into an a-fib episode, that was close to being one of the worst ones I ever had. I had to go back on all these meds, plus increase my asprin dosage to 325 mg, and now I get to take 5 mg cummadin, and worry about the side effects of that med.But, yeah, vision problems, dizzines, fatigue, and now after reading these posts I can probably attribute the ringing in my ears to these meds as well.I am scheduled to go to Dr. in 1 month, he's gonna get an ear full if I cant get off these pills after going thru the ordeal of the ablation, I was under for 6 hrs, I dont know where they get off telling you it's 40 minute procedure and you are up and running in a day or two. Make sure you get all the facts before you sign up for an ablation, I was told it was going to be the 6 hrs so that was no surprise. The surprise was the violent a-fib episode with-in one hour of being home.I have had this infliction for over 10 yrs, I may go back to a med called rythmol or other heart rate/rythm meds.

Atrial Fibrillation	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	4/8/2008 6:47:24 PM	After experiencing fast, irregular heartbeat events, especially at night, I finally located a cardiologist known as a CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIST who used a so-called &quot;Holter Monitor&quot; to successfully diagnose my problem as chronic atrial fibrillation. He prescribed Flecainide 100mg every 12 hours. It is an effective medication. Symptoms have totally disappeared since first starting Flecainide. However, the prescribed dosage resulted in vision side effects (difficulty focusing) that I found uncomfortable. I was, through experimentation, able to find that one 100mg dose at bedtime was effective in eliminating symptoms AND minimizing visual side effects. My doctor concurred with my decision to only take one per day. I also take 2 blood pressure-controlling drugs. A triumph of modern medicine through effective pharmacology.

It seems to work keeping me in the correct rythum-however, if a dose is missed-I seem to go into A-Fib all over again. 
Life-Threatening Rapid Ventricular Heartbeat	Linda, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	4	4	Female	65-74	2/19/2008 11:20:30 AM	Before being introduced to this medication, my heartbeat was constantly out of rhythm, due to what the doctors refer to as VT's. With this medication along with Verapamil (sp?), my heart beats more in rhythm and not so many episodes of fast heart beat. When very young, maybe age 9, I was diagnosed with rheumatic heart. Maybe that had something to contribute to my condition.

October I started with Atrila fib. again and the doctor changed my medication to Flecainide. I have not felt very good since.  I am very weak and pains in my legs.  I went back into Atrial Fib. 2 months later and they increased the medicine but am still having small episodes of irregulare heart rhythym.  I am also having trouble with fluid retention after being on Flecainide.
