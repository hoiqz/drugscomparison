Tried the pills, patches and creams with no success. Now just after seven months of use I now have had significant breast development and have started puberty. Albeit thirty years late.  I have had no side effects to speak of except the first few months I had some breast tenderness.  To me this drug in this form has been a live saver for me and others who are in my same situation, who werent going though puberty as they were spose to,  Besides the breast growth I now have a very healthy sex drive, and it also help with your quality of life

Usually around the time you turn 50 or so you will want to start weening yourself slowly off. I had my uterus and ovaries removed when I was 24 and have been on the shots for 26 yrs now and this med has been a God send to me and my family. I am in control of my body 100%. But now that I am getting older I have notice I have been able to skip a month or 2 and I have reduced the amount I give my self and am getting along just fine.

It kept me sane. My hormones were all out of wack. I have been able to function with it. I had to have my ovaries and utrus surgerically remove cause of having a lot of problems. I don't cry, or feel out of control. It has just helped me so much. It patch and pills did not work on me. My body did not absorbed them. I have been on this for 18 yrs. Had the surgery at age 31 and started this medication at age 32 years old. I am thankful for this medication. I am not sure how long or what age I should take it. Do you know at what age I should stop taking it? Or do I take it for the rest of my life? Thank you for this medication. Debra
