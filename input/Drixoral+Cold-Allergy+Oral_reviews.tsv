Allergic Conjunctivitis	 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		3/8/2009 6:17:47 AM	I have many allergies and have been taking Drixoral Cold &amp; Allergy once or twice a day for almost 30 years.  It is the ONLY medicine that alleviates my symptoms, i.e., dizziness, headaches (almost feverish feeling),nausea, stuffiness, running nose, sneezing, burning eyes, etc.  I also appreciate that Drixoral doesn't make me drowsy when driving or at work.  Very disappointed when it was discontinued in the stores - no other medication comes close.

Why  was it suddenly pulled from pharmacy shelves?  I've tried claritin and allegra-D and sudafed, but they do not control my allergies.  Please bring this medication back!! I can't breathe!

I have used Drixoral for over 20 years and must have it to function. I've tried about everything else there is and nothing works as well.SHAME ON YOU, Schering-Plough, for showing your complete lack of regard for the welfare of those that depend on Drixoral!Schering-Plough has discontinue the drug with no notice or attempt at seeing that their customer needs were met. Their ethics are no better than a dope dealer peddling on the street, in for the money with no concern for the end user's suffering.I'm looking into buying shares now so that I may attend the shareholders meetings to further express my displeasure.
Non-Seasonal Allergic Runny Nose	Fabes, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/4/2008 3:43:03 PM	I just posted a long blurb about the effectiveness of Drixoral for my allergies. I got to reading the other posts and called the 800 number list in one of the posts. I called and found out that Drixoral is not being discontinued alltogether. They told me that the place that manufactures it is changing. The ingredients and doses are not going to change. The bummer is that no new shipments will be going out in 2008. It will be available in 2009. My advise is to start letting your fingers do the walking and call pharmacies in different areas. Some still have a supply. Once you find a place, hit them every couple of days and stock up. The number to call for the consumer hotline is 800-317-2165. Give them a call and voice your displeasure.
Other	Fabes, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/4/2008 3:24:26 PM	I have year round allergies. I'm allergic to things in the air; ie. dust, pollen, mold, ragweed, etc. I've been taking Drixoral for 20+ years. This is the only allergy medicine that works for me. One pill a day is all I take. Sudafed, Claritan-D, prescription meds.....none of them work as well as Drixoral. For example....I ran out of Drixoral last week and couldn't find it anywhere. The Pharmacist suggested Claritan-D. I took six Claritan-D tablets in a nine hour period. This is 12 hour medicine, mind you. My nose was running like a faucet. I'd bend over and the snot would literally pour out of my nose. My co-worker found Drixoral at a Pharmacy near her house and picked it up and brought it to work for me. Within two hours, all my allergy symptoms disappeared. Both nostrils were clear and I could breathe through my nose for the first time in days.Now I'm hearing that Drixoral is going to be discontinued. I really hope that's not the case, as I don't know what I'd do to combat my allergies.
Sneezing		5	5	5			6/2/2008 10:31:20 PM	I'm unable to find it anymore either!  The company who manufactures Drixoral is Schering-Plough.  You can call their customer service # at 1-800-317-2165.  Hopefully they have not pulled this product for good!
Stuffy Nose	tinkabell, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/2/2008 8:31:06 PM	I am a 40 year old woman who has been using Drixoral OTC since I was 15 years old.  This has been the only medicine that has worked effectively for me.  It is the most comprehensive OTC medication on the market.  It has resolved the following symptoms for me: runny &amp; stuffy nose, sinus headaches, nasal inflamation, watery eyes, sneezing, itchy throat, etc.  I have tried other OTC medications and prescription medications and they have not worked.  I have not experienced any negative side effects and my family has used this product as well.  I am devastated that this medication is beibg taken off the market.  I am an addiction counselor and understand the issue with the decongestant ingredients being used to make meth.  Please do not allow the irresponsible use of this medication to overrule those of us who use it legally.Does anyone know if we can get drixoral online?

I have had serious allergies since I was a little girl and so far this is the only medication that has worked. I am very disappointed that it is being taken off the market.  Nothing OTC or prescription wise works for me.  I have already missed several days of work because my nose is runny, my eyes are watery, itchy, and swollen, and my sinuses are draining.  Thank you pharmaceutical companies for taking the only product off the market that works, just because of the freaking drug addicted tweekers!!!!!!

I just learned that Drixoral will no longer be available. I have tried many prescriptions and over the counter pills &amp; none work. Why was this discontinued? Can all of us users let the drug company know we want it back?

Starting out as a perscription in the 1970s, then over the counter till this week when I can no longer find it anywhere. Drixoral took care of all of my sinus, itchy watery eyes, and related allergy discomforts with no side effects. Where can I get it or what else works as well, please?

Since it has gotten so hard to find lately, I've been trying other medications, but have found nothing to compare with Drixoral. I was very disappointed to find out that it has been discontinued.  Is there any way to keep it on the market?

Other	Faithful User, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/20/2008 8:05:30 AM	Drixoral works great for my sinus problem. Helps with the stuufy nose, runny nose, and most of all helps me with a dizzy feeling from my sinus problem. As of 5/19/08 I'm having a hard time finding it where I live. Pharmacy's told me the drug company is stopping the sale of Drixoral. I've tried alot of medicines and this is the best working one. KEEP DRIXORAL.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/19/2008 11:36:24 AM	Drixoral works better for me than any other product - OTC or Rx.  I know there are problems with people using such products as this for illeagal purposes but I am a faithful user of this product and have many concerns about how to go about finding another product that will even come close to the relief I feel soon after taking Drixoral.  I cannot believe that they are going to discontinue this helpful product.  I believe in Drixoral and have recommended it to many friends who comment back to me on how much relief they have felt after taking this product.

Cold Symptoms	allheart, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/14/2008 3:14:57 AM	Drixoral works very well for me. I am a heart patient and some cold meds have a negative affect and cause my heart to race. Drixoral does not and it really clears my head. Unfortunately I have just learned that the product has been discontinued and I have not been able to find it in stock at any of my local pharmacies. I'm very disappointed and now need to begin a new search for a cold med that works for me and my heart!
Other	 on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5			4/13/2008 8:25:58 PM	I started taking this years ago when it was Rx only.  It works great for me (meds without a decongestant don't work as well for me for my allergies).  I've never had any trouble with any side effects but I do have friends who say it knocks them out.

It is the only otc allergy medicine that works on me.  I use it intermittently in the fall and spring to get me through some tough cold and allergy spells, and I don't know what I would do if they stopped making it.
Stuffy Nose		5	5	3			1/17/2008 10:17:14 AM	This medicine worked very well at opening my nasal passages and allowing me to breathe better, but I experience almost of the possible side effects listed for it, drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, cold feet &amp; hands, unable to sleep, restlessness.
