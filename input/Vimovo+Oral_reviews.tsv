There was NO change. I've continued to take it since I had a prescription. I have bloating and stomach pain but thought it was something I ate in spite of dieting and juicing daily.  Now that I've read other reviews, I'll discontinue it.

However, during the second day, noticed a redness and sweeling in my lower right leg. I went to my Doctor and he said it was vasculitus and to take only one pill a day rather than twice a day. I said I will stop taking vimovo and rely on aleve which had worked in the past.

It is the only medication that has given me relief and has added some range of motion to the shoulder. It did take a few days to notice relief but now that I've been on it for about a week, I notice a big difference. The only disappointment is that it does not help me to sleep through the pain but does help tremendously to function through the day.
Other	seraphim56, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	45-54	6/24/2011 10:51:17 AM	I was prescribed this medicine for elbow pain and to reduce swelling due to minor gout.  It did reduce swelling and the pain was minimized in my elbow and knee(side issue).  It did not stop all of the pain but it did reduce the level. After taking this medicine for approximately six (6) weeks, I noticed severe swelling in my right ankle/foot and some in my left ankle/foot.  I took the medicine for about two (2) more weeks and it just got worse.  I also begin to notice that I was gaining weight.  I completely stopped taking the medicine and the swelling started to go down immediately.  After about a week my ankles/foot looked normal.  I also begin to urinate more frequently and I lost a bloated look that I was beginning to get.  After I stopped taking the medicine for the first several days my whole body ached with pain.  I have been off the medicine about a week and the pain has subsided.  When I go to my Dr. next week we'll see what's next.  But no more VIMOVO for me.  The swelling and pain in ankles/feet was scary.

History significant for prior Lap Band surgery and the lodged pill caused a severe coughing episode that nudged the Band causing GI restriction. Symptoms consistent with too tight banding. Resolved after Upper GI study and removal of 1cc saline from the band.  No other treatment and no further problem. Scary at the time.

Now I have some pain but greatly reduced and I can stand up from a chair on my own and I don't need my cane. It had really helped me.
