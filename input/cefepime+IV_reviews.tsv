Presumed Infection in Febrile Neutropenic Patient	zap02, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	3/4/2012 7:51:27 PM	My mother, who had Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, went to the hospital with a slight fever. She was admitted and put on the antibiotic cefepime.24 hours later, she fell into an encephalitic coma. She remained in this debilitating state for almost 1 month before I discovered this possible side effect of cefepime and had it withdrawn. My mother awoke 24 hours later but her body was decimated by that time and her mind was deeply affected. She died about a month and a half later.
Pneumonia caused by the Bacteria Pseudomonas Aeruginosa	bruno, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/9/2011 5:04:45 PM	Contaminated well water...thought the home had a filtration system, but home owners lied.  cefepime was the second iv medicine, and it seems to be working much better for me.  Side affects for me are: no appetite, headache to migraines, nausea, pain in joints, pressure in chest.  I started the 2nd week.  Hopefully just 2 weeks will be all I need. I starting to feel better, and not coughing as much.  Pseudomonas e.  is so hard to get under control.  Good luck to everyone, and hope you feel better soon...

Skin Infection	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/6/2009 3:56:51 PM	My brother (age 52 with CTCL) took this medication for two weeks for skin infection. He had severe nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and loss of apetite. His skin lesions did not get better. I was really concerned. If he recovers from these side effects, he will begin another round of chemo.
Infection of Bone	Floral Designer, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	8/24/2009 8:06:33 AM	I am in my 4th week of 6, the taste this drug leaves in my mouth is so medicinal and wretched that no food taste edible, it causes nausea, no amount of tooth brushing or gargling will get rid of it.  It has made me vomit, I get chills, I just started getting a sore throat and can't swallow. This drug has horrible side effects that they really  play down. I am going to ask my Dr. to prescribe something else.  It was my forehead bone that was infected and it has been removed, so I don't know why I need to suffer more by taking this nasty drug.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	6/30/2009 5:24:11 PM	i had an unusual infection of the end plates in my spine.  I have an old passed down story that I was allergic to penicillin/amoxicillin (sp)when I was a child. After approximately 3 weeks of use I developed an allergic reaction.  It would instant make my stomach upset and my upper torso feel as though it were on fire...then i would get a migraine and a rash.  It was aweful.  I couldnt sleep, was getting the hot and cold spells, would sweat terribly when I did get some sleep and felt generally very ill.  I was pulled off of it and placed an Merrem.I was taking 20 ml via syringe 2x's a day in a picc line.  Now my blood counts are a mess again and I am off spraying Lysol on everything.
