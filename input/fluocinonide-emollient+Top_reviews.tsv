Inflammation of Skin caused by an Allergy	beachgal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/28/2010 11:46:11 AM	After searching for weeks for something to cure a massive poison ivy reaction, I tried fluocinonide. This worked immediately! I have always kept some on hand since discovering it. As soon as I notice the slightest reaction from poison ivy exposure, I use fluocinonide. The ointment prevents spreading and cures within a couple of days. It does not ease itching, but is so effective in curing the outbreak that I can overlook that.

According to my family practicioner, its fairly a common allergic reaction.  As soon as I applied the cream it relieved the itching/burning, I saw improvement the next morning and by 3 days time the rash was completely gone with barely any traces that it had been there.  Which was remarkable because I wore a multi-tiered necklace and the rash created a ring around my neck in that very shape.

Because I had the rash on my stomach, it was difficult to follow the instructions that the ointment should not be covered in any way because of course I have to wear clothes! The ointment feels greasy and leaves a sticky residue on the skin. Regardless, the itching was greatly reduced and the rash was gone in about two days.

My dermatologist prescribed Fluocinonide cream. I used it twice a day and after 4 to 5 days the rash was completely gone. It's a very effective cream, I was surprised and very pleased how fast it worked.
