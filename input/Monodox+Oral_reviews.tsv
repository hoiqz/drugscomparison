Other	Vegasgranma, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/11/2012 3:47:57 AM	For the last 40 years I have had cysts on diffrent parts of my body (espicaliy bad on my underarms) and had body ordor even if I showerd 3 times a day . I asked all kinds of doctors what can I do take for this? Most would say NOTHING others would give me diffrent antibiotics some would work for 2/4 weeks then they would come right back. Then this wonderfull Dr.perscribed me Monodox 100 mg Plus some gel wash,spray and gel. whitin 5 days the b.o. was gone and no more flair ups.I have been taking this combo for 2 months now .No side effects (that are listed?) I have a script for 8 months . My question is Will the cysts come back when I stop taking them or will I have to be on them the rest of my life?

Acne	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4		19-24	4/14/2010 4:42:14 PM	I had to switch from my first prescription of Doryx becasue the pill was way too big!  It also was very expensive and a coupon the doctor gave me did not work.  I got Monodox and only had to pay $10!  I only have to pay $10 for the next 12 months too!  My pills are now tiny and I have no side effects!  My skin has gotten better by the days.  I am so glad that I can take a face medication and not go BROKE!!!  Monodox is the way!!!!

Infection due to unusual Mycobacteria	curlytoo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	8/27/2009 5:29:05 AM	To the mom who had a bad experience with your very sick 16 year old. My daughter was also very sick at 14. Two months of hospitals and dozens of doctors could not diagnose her. She had come home from summer camp with what appeard to be strep throat. Over the next two months she lost too much weight, her symptoms put her in the hospital unable to eat, drink, walk or even sit up. She was on a cocktail of many antibiotics. Her face became paralized. I would come home from the hospital each night and stay up all night looking for an answer. I came in contact with a woman in England that had a similiar experience, she told me to have the doctors look for &quot;microplasma enphefilites&quot; not sure on the spelling. And she told me about Doxycycline. She did test positive for it and she started this antibiotic. (we had tried many others first) within 3 days she was standing up and walking. She was able to return to school within two weeks.   So yes you should do your homework on a drug before you take it, but what you can not know a head of time is whether your body will react positive or negative to a drug until you try it. That is why we have so many antibiotics to begin with.  In the case of my daughter, Doxcycline saved her life.  
Lyme Disease	Kate's Mom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/6/2009 2:10:18 PM	Doxycycline HYC has been prescribed to my 16 year old daughter twice for Lyme disease.  She had BAD reactions both times when taking 100mg ibid for 21 days.  She experienced dizziness, severe headache, dyslexia, muscle tremors and shakiness throughout her body.  This drug is the treatment of choice for Lyme disease, but it should NEVER be given to minors under the age of 18 or to anyone unable to effectively communicate what symptoms might be occurring.  Also, it caused the spirochetes to morph into cysts and &quot;hide out&quot; until the doxy was out of the bloodstream, so it is only a &quot;bandaid&quot; on the infection, at best.  As with all antibiotics, it caused candida overgrowth and with probiotics AFTER the 21 days of treatment, you MIGHT clear the candida from your system....not working for her, and it has been 60 days since taking the probiotics.  I am really upset that two different doctors prescribed this poison for my child, and I will never give her ANY drug again without first researching ALL the possible side effects.
