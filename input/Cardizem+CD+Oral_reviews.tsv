Dr. raised it to 240mg which lowered D&amp;S BP by 25 points each and stopped the irregular heart beat.  Slightly lethargic as I was when first getting on it, but got adjusted to it after about six weeks. I suppose it will again take some time.  I also raised concern about label warning as I take Zocor, but Dr. assures me no conflict with the two meds.

I find this medication has only made it worse. For the last week my heart rates have been well over 120bpm daily. I personally didn't find that this medication has worked and have been taken off of it.
