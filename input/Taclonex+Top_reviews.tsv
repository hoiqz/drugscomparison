Plaque Psoriasis	elle_love, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/6/2012 1:18:33 AM	After an exhausting treatment of light therapy, medications which were damaging to my liver, and topical creams galore I switched to a doctor who prescribed Taclonex. It was costly but he assured me it was worth it; and it WAS! I went from having moderate Plaque Psoriasis from scalp to feet, to now only having the occasional flare up on ONE elbow :) I would highly recommend this ointment to anyone with moderate Plaque Psoriasis!

It's cleared up my hands and legs completely and I will continue using it until I no longer can.Do check out the $0 pay coupon available from the manufacturer. It saved me $623.46
Psoriasis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	10/14/2011 11:49:59 PM	Have had patches on my leg for 8 to 12 years and have tried many doctors and ointments.  Dermatologist put me on Taclonex once a day and Triamcinolone once a day for 2 months now.  Itching is gone and patches are fading and shrinking.  Now that my samples are running out I went to see how much it would be to fill the prescription and was surprised when the pharmacist said it would be $999.00 to fill with insurance.  I was given a coupon for 0 copay so it will be free, but if I didn't have the coupon or samples I would not be using it!

Was so relieved. It comes back every now and then, but the taclonex clears it right up.

The affected areas are still red but the skin is smooth and not itchy or burning.  My dermatologist was able to give me a coupon for a $0 copay and is good for 3 refills.

Psoriasis	Jim, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/13/2010 11:08:41 AM	My doctor and then a dermotologist tried cortisone and some other topicals. When the dermatologist gave me a sample of taclonex everything was cleared up in three weeks. I use it a couple of times a month if I get a spot. With a coupon my copay was still 55 dollars.

Psoriasis	Bigtiny, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	2/21/2010 1:54:43 AM	I have suffered from severe cracking and bleeding hands and feet for over 6 years.After a multitude of treatments, potions, lotions and pills, bags on feet gloves on hands, doctor put me on Taclonex 3 months ago.  After 1 week I could already see improvement and now am able to hold my hand out without people looking at me like I have Leporsy.  This medication is available through Canadian pharmacies for 3 - 60gram tubes for $325.00 Canadian. There are also other programs available in US that provide discounts and vouchers.  This product works better than any other treatment I have found.
Psoriasis	stan, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	12/25/2009 5:59:38 AM	i have had psoriasis for about 20 yrs...it started in my ear but wasnt to bad..eventually it went away on its own but than popped out on my elbows and side of shins..i got some exorex and it actually worked very well (smelled terrible though) and it never came back in those spots heavy.every so often i might see a lil spot start on the side of my shin or elbow and i use some other cream called dovonex (originally a friend brought it to me from s.america) and it controls it and never gets out of hand (i use as needed)..it has the same texture and color etc of talconex...well a few years ago for sum odd reason i started getting it on my fingers (middle,index and thumb)..very very stubborn spots that none of my usual creams will work..my dr gave me sum samples of talconex and it worked incredibably well..also clobex worked well but talconex seems stronger...well eventually i ran out of the samples and stopped using the product..it came back strong on my finger..i just got sum more and in 2 days it looks MUCH better...but im using it more than 1x a day..more like 2-3 but after reading this ill try to keep it to 2x a day especially since my dr told me that they have been advised that NO MORE SAMPLES will be available to patients (not because of him but because of the company or whoever is in charge of samples for this product)..i guess they see it works well and want to make as much $ as they can which is a shame really..thats the wonderful health system we live in USA....so over all great product but as stated before,if u stop using it more than likely it will come back so a steady supply is a must (also clobex is good so mayb switch it up between the 2-when it clears up with talconex use a lil clobex for maintenece etc-i still use dovonex for touchups)
Psoriasis	relieved, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	9/10/2009 6:08:58 PM	I've used many medications in attempts to relieve the itching of psoriasis on my feet and sometimes hands for 13 years and this medication has been the best so far. My dermatologist says a generic brand should be out this year.. so it should be much cheaper. If I did not have insurnace, I would not be able to afford it ($495.00 without insur. $22.00 with.
Psoriasis	angelina, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	9/7/2009 10:47:14 PM	I've had Psoriasis for the past 20 yrs...on my hands. Just recently, it came up on my right foot after a very stressful job change. I really feel this condition is stress related...as least for me. I was appling Triamcinolong on my hands when they really broke out and it would get it under control. Now, I use Eucerin cream on my hands and it keeps my hands totally in control. No more drugs on my hands. The foot is where I'm using the Taclonex for about 10 days now. It seems to be helping and I've noticed it works even better when I expose my foot to sunlight. It seems to clear it up and takes the red color away. I will continue to use it and hopefully, it will get to a point where I will be appling the Eucerin cream on my foot also. Honestly, the original Eucerin creme is great and not as expensive as all these other drugs. Try it. Hopefully it will work for you too. God bless, angelina
Psoriasis	rodg, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	6/17/2009 8:44:22 PM	I'm new to psoriasis and to Taclonex, after trying a few different ointments, this one does make a differance. Nothing goes away, but it looks a little better, so far. However... the COST?!? can anyone explain what ingredient is involved that cost so much?? It doesn't even cure anything, it only helps the symptoms.
Psoriasis	admanc, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	6/8/2009 6:39:11 PM	I have some tiny patches of psoriasis on one elbow, and on my palms and feet.  The Taclonex ointment is difficult to keep applied to these areas because it is greasy and rubs off so quickly against clothing or anything you come into contact with.  As far as effectiveness is concerned, it seems to work much better on my elbow than on my hand for some reason.  Also, I wish the effects lasted somewhat longer.  As soon as I stop using it for even a day or two, the symptoms come back immediately.
Psoriasis	JV123, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	25-34	5/6/2009 4:01:52 PM	Taclonex has worked great for me for the last 3 years. There is some skin peeling that occurs, but it's definitely better than the alternative. I treat areas on my elbow, head, back and feet. I have tried treating areas on my hands, but the result was not noticeable. I shaved my head to expose my dome to direct sunlight, which is said to help, and it really has. 
Psoriasis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/15/2009 4:28:02 PM	worked better than anything i have tried over a three year period of suffering with psoriasis. problem with the price. 375.00 with a 50.00 coupon. for peopl ewithout insurance or a deductble it is not affordable.
Psoriasis	try this, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	3/1/2009 9:15:38 AM	I have Psoriasis near my belly button which I had for a few years. I have tried over the counter products with out any help. I went to the the DR and Taclonex was prescribed. At first my insurance would not approve then after a few days they approved the $540.00 price. The Dr may also have a $50.00 co pay coupon to help. I have been using it for about three weeks and it working good with reduced size. We will see what will happen for the long term. You may be able to get this from Canada for a lower cost.
Psoriasis	petrushka, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/8/2009 11:10:26 PM	When prescribed, the PA said to use twice a day for 3 weeks  After she left the room, the tech said I should only use it once a day.  Foolishly, I listened to the tech.  Needless to say, my condition improved but did not go away as expected, and got very much worse after stopping treatment, worse than before I even went to the doctor.  Then I used it twice per day and the psoriasis patch was gone in only two weeks.

But at least this works.  i feel for those who do not have insurance though.  My pharmicist said it was $500 a tube without insurance!!!!!!!

Psoriasis	sulli55, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/24/2008 9:07:22 AM	i have had psoriasis since i've been 5 yrs. old, and am now 45. i the last year, i've found out that i've progressed to not having one type of psoriasis, but i have three types all wrapped up on one body. after long-time meds did not work, dr. put me on taclonex---within three days of use, i've never had a medicine work like this! it's amazing how i could see results so quickly!and here, my initial appointment was to go in as a last resort to see if i could try the enbrel program, that's how desperate i was...well, i think i found it in taclonex!
Psoriasis	Melissa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	5/2/2008 5:23:44 PM	I have struggled with skin diseases my entire life, over 90% of my skin...and was actually hospitalized at one point. With this particular ointment I did have fast results the only downside was that it caused my skin to peel before it cleared which was semi-easy to deal with in comparison to the psoriasis.
Psoriasis	KS, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	2/21/2008 11:20:31 PM	I fortunately have a couple of small areas that need treatment.  I have tried other topical medicine and this one is by far superior.  Saw improvement within 2 days.

It is now mid-October and I'm petrified of what lies ahead.I've been tring to find out if anyone knows of any specific foods and/or nutritional supplements that can help. Also, this drug costs around $400. a tube!!!I do not have insurance and I really don't understand why it needs to be that expensive!How much is GOLD per ounce???
