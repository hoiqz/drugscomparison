Depression	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/9/2012 7:17:23 PM	Have taken for 20+ years. Started taking after dignosed with Epstein Barr and depression. Works well. About twice a year for some reason I go through a week to ten days of mild depression, but over all it works for me. Tried the generic to save money, not as effective. Tried a newer drug some years back on new doctor's recommendation with bad experience, went back to norpramin. Old rule, &quot;If it works, stay with it.&quot;

The pain was gone in a week, after 6 months I stopped taking it, and the burning never came back. Did affect ejaculation
Other	Azelya, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/9/2011 10:12:34 PM	I was put on this for headaches. It was the first pill of five that has done any good, but only at the max dosage. So far I love it, if I don't miss any dosages. :) I seem to get sunburns easily, I'm glad someone else mentioned constipation. I do seem to have that problem for sometime, it now makes sense. I've had problems sleeping as well, which is weird since I sleep like the dead. When i first started, or went on a higher dosage, I was tired practically all day for a week or two. Can't say I'm a depressed person, but my husband has mentioned that I seem happier lately. But I've also had a long break from working too. Anyways, my point, I've had several side effects, but I think it's well worth it. 
Depression	krasi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	7/29/2011 9:01:31 PM	It works really great since I have been on almost 90% of depression meds and this it the only one that works. The down side is I sweat buckets all day. I have few choices in meds so I have to deal with the constant sweating and it is terrible.

But, I have been very constipated while being on this medicine. Im gona have to talk to the doctor about the constipation problem and hopefully it will go away as I take this longer.

Thankfully my wife was in the same room when it happened and she knew CPR.  If it wasn't for her this drug (drug class) would of killed me!!

However when he started me on Norpramin (brand version), I started seeing the first signs of improvement in almost two years. I have been taking the drug now for about twelve years, and will be on it as a measure of prevention for the rest of my life.

Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/20/2008 10:20:25 AM	Awesome Antidepressant with minimal side effects (dry mouth) so I chew alot of gum. I am a healthy 35 year old Male and have used since age 20. Would highly highly recommend this medication for depression. Not addictive or anything of that nature but I find it works for me so will probably take for life.
Depression	Jersey Girl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	1/5/2008 3:53:11 PM	Began use after family crisis and onset of menapause.  25-50 mg was beneficial in mood elevating and less depression. After 10 years of use I find it helps with mental alertness and less fatigue.
