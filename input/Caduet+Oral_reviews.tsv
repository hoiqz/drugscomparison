High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/5/2011 2:40:15 PM	Uncontrolled HBP (avg. 200/115) for years, tried everything, cut salt out, lost weight, exercised,  Ramipril, Coreg, Clonidine, Diovan, overlapped multiple meds, nothing worked.  Went for MRI to rule out blockage or blood to kidneys or adrenal gland problems...nothing.  I was taking Lipitor anyway, so doctor said lets try Caduet , honestly, 1 day, and BP was down to avg. 123/77, I had to stop taking some of the other meds because it was getting too low!  This is a miracle drug for me.  Everybody is different, and the causes are different, just so glad we finally found the one that works for me.

I previuosly took Zestril &amp; Lopid to control each problem. I was concerned about liver damage from Lopid and asked to try a combination product. So far I', very happy and have not experienced any side effects. Thank God for doctors who are willing to work with patients to solve healthcare problems!
High Cholesterol	wilson, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	65-74	3/10/2011 12:17:08 AM	no doctor here knew why or what it was but I sure felt extremely sick, had from shoulder to bellybuttonb a weeping deep purple rash with blisters which got infected! I'm forever urinating, changes in vision, fainting spells, slow and irregular heartbeat, unexplained weight gain, a nagging headache, unusual hoarseness, tighness in chest, itching and I'm forever sleeping. went to the doc this morning and he said...nothing wrong with CADUET, keep taking it. reading the reviews just now I'm amazed, so it is not me it's thoses stupid pills. called immediately another specialist and he said stop immediately you've got an allergic reaction, there are other pills which work just the same. so in other words I'm not crazy but the first &quot;quack&quot;! thank you very much for ruining my exxpensive and long awaited holiday! I'm glad there are other doctors who take their patients seriously! for all of you: listen to your body and don't be shoved aside by a doctor who thinks he&quot;s God Almighty!

I had no problems until a month ago, started having severe leg (muscle) pains, unable to sleep or walk at times. Dr. got me another type of meds and the pain has pretty much disappeared. If I didn't encounter the leg pains, I would have been satisfied with caduet.

High Cholesterol	Jo Bless, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	11/5/2009 9:31:12 AM	No problems when taking the norvasc alone. Since taking this combo product I have had  muscle/joint aches and pains, weakness, very little energy, mental confusion and fogginess. I felt very old, fatigued and depressed. I lost a great job. This medication is expensive so I quit taking it. It's been 5 days without this medicine and I am starting to feel so much better. The symptoms mentioned above are resolving. I would advise anyone to consider the possible life altering consequences before taking this medication.

It caused constant heartburn, extreme dizziness, and a very foggy brain.  From my research, the loss of being able to think is from the Lipitor.

I had two other people who were taking caduet report the same effects.....I asked my doctor to replace the caduet with regular Norvasc, which he did....and the &quot;achy&quot; joints and tired feeling disappeared.
