Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Scared sleepless, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/1/2012 1:55:33 PM	I've only taken this pill a few times, but each time it has caused sleeplessness and restless limb symptoms. Most recently, it kept me up most of the night and I felt as though I was going to have a seizure. The little sleep I did have was plagued with nightmares. I will never take this medication again.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	JB, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	2/16/2012 12:20:48 PM	After taking Advil PM for about a 4 month period for sleeping problems I started having seizures. Do not know for sure if Advil PMs are the cause. But found no other medical reason for seizures. They occur about every 20-28 days. I have never had a seizure in my life or any family history of seizures. I found seizures listed for a side effect of Advil PM on a reputable web site but did not find it listed here at WebMD.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Evelyn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	8/1/2011 11:43:13 AM	Occasionally when I have difficulty falling asleep or destressing after a long day at work on my feet, I take Advil PM.  I have taken Advil for years for occasional pain, my digestive tract doesn't respond well to Tylenol.  Therefore, when Advil PM came on the market, I preferred to take it.  Now that I know what the primary ingredients are that are in it, in the future, I will just buy that ingredient over the counter and take the same milligrams, instead of taking Advil PM if I do not need the pain reliever also in Advil PM.

Many times I have trouble in the early mornings if I awaken I can't fall back to sleep. Advil PM works great to relax me enough that I can fall asleep relatively fast.

The last couple of times, it hasn't worked as well. I could feel myself getting tired, and I'd go to sleep fairly well, but I'd wake up two hours later, wide awake and extremely hot. I'm not sure why this happened.

Instead, I woke up about 2 1/2 hours after going to sleep, ready to jump out of my skin, doubt that I will be able to get back to sleep. Horrible.

Pain	sdt, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	5/21/2010 8:26:38 AM	Though the pill allowed me to sleep which of course means Ifelt no pain, waking up was the worst experience of my life. I felt like a weight was on my entire body. I couldnt move and my head was heavy and I felt grogged out. Though I sleept very well and felt no pain, the feeling the next morning is terrible so its not worth it. I am a Advil user for years, the liquid gels, allergy sinus and have never had a problem.

Other	arnld46, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	4/1/2009 11:26:35 AM	I really like the medication for sleep; however, twice in the last two weeks I have taken two went to sleep and woke up two hours later with sweats and in severe respiratory distress requiring a trip to the ER.  I didn't realize it was caused by the Advil until the second day home from the hospital.  I took two again before going to bed and the exact same thing happened. So please be careful if you're asthmatic.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	arlean, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	3/19/2009 10:41:54 PM	i took this pill for two nights.. the first night i took two pills i woke up about 2hrs. later with alot of pain in my stomach... which i had to take pepto, to help me with the pain so i can sleep.. and in the morning i woke up so groggy and like a zombie.. i couldn't function which is bad, cause i have a 5yr.old and a 3month old..     So the next night i took only 1 pill and still woke up 2hrs. later with bad stomach pain.. and woke up like a zombie still..

Other	macajones, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/22/2008 5:33:52 PM	I started taking this medication three years ago for a throbbing pain in my leg due to a pinched nerve in my hip.  I first tried two tablets but found that one a night worked fine.  Since then the pain is gone and the nerve has healed and I sleep wonderfully; at least 7-8 hours a night. The nights that I don't take it are restless so I continue one a night w/o any side affects.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	liv019, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/5/2008 11:22:29 PM	I am totally satisfied with Advil PM.  Tylenol PM and Excedrin PM were not as effective, it didn't keep me asleep til morning and I always woke up in the morning and my eyes felt heavy. I had that feeling of only getting 2 or 3 hours of sleep.  Advil PM doesn't have any effect on me in the mornings.  I used to take Ambien but you really need at least 7 hours with that, and it's expensive.  On the weekends I take 1/2 Ambien, 1 Advil PM.  I fall asleep quickly and stay asleep until my alarm goes off.  
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	unhappy user, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	4/10/2008 8:01:08 PM	I took Advil PM twice and ended up hospitalized after losing about 4 pints of blood. Complete upper and lower GI revealed nothing. Using the PillCam determined an AVM in small bowel. These tests were done at the VA hospital in Milwaukee, WI.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	BBuckley58, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/28/2008 3:56:42 PM	I take this about an hour before I want to fall sleep and only use it during the week when I have to get up for work. On the week ends I go off it. This way I've been able to keep the dosage down to 2. I do find I wake up a little groggy on the mornings after I've taken it, but it fades pretty quickly. All in all, it is way better than the Lunesta I tried once which gave me horrible nightmares. When I went through a period of not being able to sleep and I had tried the Lunesta, my doctor recommended doubling the dose of Advil for a bit and see if that helps. It and did and now I'm back to my regular routine. I would not recommend anyone to take presciption sleep aids because they do crazy things to your brain. Just take Advil PM, its way safer.
