Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/12/2012 10:57:13 PM	I have been taking phenergan as needed (prn) for nausea when I experience migraine headaches. I am having a serious bad reaction to it!!!!!! I tried to call the on call doctor several times, to no avail. I left a couple of messages for my doc of 10 years that I did not understand why he would call in a medication for daily use; that is used for people on chemo and radiation. I induced vomiting. I am calling my attorney tomorrow morning about this. There is no excuse for the f up, and I am pursuing to take whatever is takes to stop it from happening to somebody else!!!!!!  I am very disappointed and angry!!!!
Nausea and Vomiting	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	5/22/2012 7:22:56 PM	Was taking the round pill and had some of the ones that dissolve in your mouth, both worked well. Just got a new refill and now it's oval in shape and does NOT work as well. It is probably an insurance perference. I am fed up with people who are capable of using a computer and filing claims taking charge of my health care. I hope they like the bills when I end up in er and hosp. stay because they are allowed to be doctors. It's time we all stood up to these people and demand the best available care in aspects of our health care needs.

BTW  cholestyramine powder is great for 6 mo. + for bile reflux after GB surg!  Though approved for chemo/rad. tx., this is simply the best anti-nausea/anti-emetic in general (contrasting to Compazine &amp; Phenergan) due to SE profile &amp; effectiveness!  Now less expensive, too.

I had severe hyperemesis gravidarum with both pregnancies and was completely miserable.  I was in and out of the hospital numerous times and actually ended up having a central line so that I could have this medicine by IV.  My doctors used this drug along with phenergan to alleviate my vomiting and reduce my nausea (which never went away, but was manageable in the last 2 months).  I HIGHLY recommend this product and I can assure you that both of my children (now ages 6 and 10) are very healthy and completely normal.  There were no side effects of the drug to them as far as I can see.  If I remember correctly I took a pill every 6 hours and as I said before, I took it for seven months at a time for both my pregnancies.  I was apprehensive at first about taking this medicine, but I can assure you that we (my kiddos and I) have no lasting side effects...yet.  I am hopeful that that will be the case from here on out.

Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/15/2010 8:20:41 PM	I have actually taken Zofran for two separate reasons.  The first was for the nausea that I get with my migraines.  I have taken it for years as needed and have found it very effective.  After I got pregnant, I was diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum.  Because I had been taking Zofran and everyone considers it the best, that's what I took as needed.  However, I found that it didn't combat my &quot;pregnant nausea&quot; nearly as well as my &quot;migraine nausea.&quot;  I had to be hospitalized for dehydration before trying another medicine, Fenergan, in suppository form, which took away the nausea, but put me to sleep for hours.  I have taken Fenergan orally (without the sleepy side effects) for the nausea associated with my migraines, which was not as effective as oral Zofran.  Sometimes, when I cannot take the Zofran pill because I am already quite nauseous, I take the orally dissolving tablets, which sounds horrible, but are actually relatively palatable.  All in all, a very effective medication that is safe and hasn't caused any adverse side effects for me.
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	Maelynn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/8/2010 6:24:12 PM	Was given this med at week 7 of my second pregnancy.  It has worked great for me with absolutely no side effects.  I am on the lowest dosage - 4mg once a day and it has completely changed my life from being sick all day back to a normal functioning person again.  I have tried other meds with my first pregnancy and nothing else worked for me.  Without this medication I would be in the hospital at this point.  I still get occasional nausea but it passes after a short while and I haven't thrown up in weeks.  My doc it's safe and I know she would never give me anything she even suspected caused problems with the baby.  Good stuff!  If you haven't been able to find anything that works for you, please do yourself a favor and ask for this. Started working for me in just a few hours, within 2 days I was feeling the full effects and up and out of bed.

Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/21/2010 9:36:40 AM	I used Zofran for my first pregnancy so i could make it through my day.  I would dry heave all day long (14+ times a day).  Zofran kept me employed and sane, and my daughter is a very healthy, bright 3 year old now.  This pregnancy i asked for Zofran again.  Thank goodness there is a generic, since Zofran was $23 a pill for me.  This drug has been great.  1 8mg in the morning about a 1/2 before i get out of bed and i'm usually pretty good for the day.

Plus I agree, I still have severe stomach pain, but have stopped vomiting.However, these hard round pills are not near as effective as the small 'melt in your mouth' brand name they gave me in the hospital.

Nausea and Vomiting	bree, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	1/2/2010 3:41:50 AM	I am a diabetic, and my endor prescribed me this for when I get sick to help with nausea.  It has really helped me.  It kept me from vomiting which is important if your illness is causing low blood sugars. My endo used to prescribe me a dissolvable pill, but I like this a lot more. I found that when I'm nauseous I don't want to dissolve a weird tasting peppermint pill in my mouth .  The only side effect I noticed is drowsiness,  but that also could be from being sick!  I have insurance and I think I only had to pay like $15.  This medicine really helps me.

Nausea and Vomiting	Jelly mom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/22/2009 11:13:43 PM	My 6 yr old son was dehydrated to the point of having kidney issues and running extremely high fevers due to a stomach bug.  This was a lifesaver.  It helped him to keep other meds down to reduce his fever so that he didn't have to do suppositories and allowed him to rest.
Nausea and Vomiting	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/19/2009 9:43:08 PM	I take Ondansetron 4mg. tablets 1-2 times daily and have nothing bad to say about it. Originally I was taking the Zofran tablets that melt under your tongue until my insurance company began refusing to fill my Rx for the amount written. I had to prove that it was medically necessary for me to be taking them. I was told by the ins comp that I didn't have an illness that this medication was intended for. Since 2001 I have been diagnosed with Degenerative Disc Disease,  Fibromyalgia, Chronic Pain and Osteoarthritis in my knees. I was taking over 20 medications and vomiting everyday. After several months of vomiting and losing weight from not eating (but had to eat something with pain meds), the ins comp finally allowed me to start back on the medication (generic only). It is nice to be able to eat and live life again out of bed.

Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	JJones, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/7/2009 9:51:56 PM	This has worked really great for me.  I am about 8 weeks pregnant and before I started taking it I was staying sick all day long with nausea and dizziness.  I am a school teacher and would not be able to work if I did not have this.  I didn't really make the correlation between taking this medication and trouble sleeping until I read the other reviews.  I don't seem to have a problem falling asleep just staying asleep.  It seems that I can get about 3 hours of sleep then seem to toss and turn the rest of the night.  I would rather have trouble sleeping than be sick with nausea  all day long.  I have been taking it about an hour before I actually have to get out of bed.

I finally had enough and contacted my doctor. This was prescribed and I don't know what I would do without it. Im currently 16 weeks pregnant and if I miss a dose I'm sick all day. I still do vomit occasionally during the day, but atleast I can keep the majority of my solids and liquids down.

I was switched from Zofran to Ondansetron after using Zofran for five years.  I was taking 8 to 24 mg /day of Zofran. Since switching I am taking from 16 to 40 mg/day of Ondansetron.   I do not think it works as well as brand Zofran.

I noticed another person had issues sleeping with this drug, but I was easily able to counter that side effect with OTC Benadryl before sleep. From what I understand, our bodies build anti-bodies against the side effects (Sleeplessness) so one or two nights of OTC Benadryl worked for me.
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	3/6/2008 12:37:21 PM	This medicine only works if you are not already sick, it doesn't &quot;cure&quot; nausea, only helps prevent it.  If you're going to get sick, it won't stop it.  Another apparent side effect not listed is sleeplessness.  Since I started taking 1 pill 3 times a day, I haven't been able to get my body to relax enough to fall asleep and therefore can't get more than 5 hours of sleep if I've taken a pill in the last 12 hours.  It works for many people, but not everyone.I also agree with the previous review about stomach pain.
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/14/2008 1:30:43 PM	I was given this drug for vomiting 4-5 times a day.  When I took the drug it helped, I still vomited 0-1 time a day.  The downside is my stomach hurt all the time after taking the medicine.  I even took it with food.  It is a very small pill and that is great!  Overall I think the pill did its job and got me through 6 weeks of afternoon sickness.
