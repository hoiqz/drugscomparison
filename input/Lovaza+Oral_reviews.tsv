LOVAZA is processed using ATENOL which is TOXIC to the LIVER!!! SO after finding THIS out I was glad I did my research so I NEVER TOOK this meds;Once BITTEN by METHROTREXATE,TWICE SHY. The truth is, ALL THESE DISEASES ARE JUST &quot;ONE PROBLEM&quot;-&quot;AUTOIMMUNE DIFFICIENCY&quot;;SO IF WE WANT OPTIMUM HEALTH LET'S JUST EAT NATRUAL FOOD FROM MOTHER NATRUE THE WAY GOD HAD INTENDED.

Hubby has been on it for 4 months and NO difference! His Doc now wants to put him on a statin. I'm scratching my head at this. Hubby's good cholestrol is very good and bad is 125. Are we missing something here?

Stiffness such that it takes me a full minute to stand up straight when I have been sitting any length of time. Hurts so much at night it wakes me up, that is if I can get to sleep. I haven't slept well in a long time. Nausea when drinking water, so getting very dehydrated. Problems with diarrhea and increased belly fat. I have a good diet. I have been thinking my symptoms were related to arthritis, but realize now it is the Lovaza. I believe it has increased inflamation and in my body big time. I just read the reviews, wish I had a long time ago, and am going to stop taking this drug and report back. Other effects: foggy thinking, inability to focus and get anything done, lethargy. Anyone else have similar effects? donnasmithdance@hotmail.com.

Decided to go an check side effects on internet and chest pains was considered a very serious problem. Stopped taking now 3 days and my chest pains have gone away. Very disappointed in my doctors knowledge, and the print out you get from the pharmacy. There is no info about severe side effects just basic ones. To I never get headaches and I was getting them daily to the point I would go to sleep with it and wake up with one. Now I want to find out if any damage has been done. For now on I will check into all prescription given to me just to be aware of all signs my body is going thru!

This can be a VERY dangerous drug

It has drastically reduced my triglycerides. On occasion I had a fishy taste but solved that by taking a cinnamon capsule with each Lovaza. Works great. Dr. said that was a good idea and was going to pass that suggestion on to other patients. My insurance company raised my copay to $95 per quarter. I would switch to OTC fish oil, but they do not work as good.

Not much change in blood work.  Also, I was having a lot of bloating, burping, taste problems and feeling just plain awful.  Finally a week or so ago I decided to see if my problems were from the lovaza. I stopped it and with 3 days had no more stomach problems.  I also had a lot of problems with bleeding hemmoroids and no longer have that.  I would not take this drug again.

Lovaza is a wonder drug however can also be taken as an over the counter med by way of an OMEGA 3 Fish Oil. I have seen that Costco sells a large bottle of it and the dose is almost as high as RX Lovaza. If you don't have Insurance get yourself on a high dose of Omega 3 Fish oil.  The best part of all of this is that my sex drive has increased on these medications. Lovaza lifts your spirit, drive and I no longer will you want to lay around the house all day. Good Luck!

Lately I am having leg pain and between that and the cost, I think I will go to omega 3 over the counter. Every body is different. Pay heed to your own needs.

I'd rather take 6 smaller pills than take those behemoths.  I got an odd sensation of having eaten fish.  It wasn't a fishy taste but it was very unpleasant.I don't know if it was effective because I quit taking it.  That sensation of having eaten fish and a bit of nausea were too much for me.  Both are gone now.

I went on pravastatin for 6 months and rechecked with only minimal results and an increase in trig and decrease in hdl. I asked for Lovaza to be added to my regimen. A month a half later I had my numbers checked again... my cholesterol has come down to 177 my ldl to 104 and my hdl has gone up to 40 but most impressive to me is that my trig has decreased to 166. I was already doing the diet thing because of issues with digestion and weight loss so this has been what I will consider a life changer. I am only 40 and my mother, brother and grandfather all has history of high blood pressure and hear disease. My mother had her first heart attack at 53 and my grandfather had quadruple bypass in his 60's. I know cholesterol isn't the sole predictor but I will do what I can to prevent issues. I tried Krill oil for a few years as well as niacin, red yeast rice and other things but none worked so well. No burp and besides being a huge pill it works for me.

I immediatly stopped the medication and sent the company a message requeting information concerning cures for the itching.  They sent me a message back requesting the name of my physician.  I had already spoken with my physician and he prescribed XYZAL which made the condition worse.  In fact, within an hour, a rash appeared throughout my body.  All athis occurred two months ago.  I was unable to sleep due to the itching and within a week, I became very weak and tired from loss of sleep.  I went to the Emergency Room and the physician on duty gave me some medication (steriods) and sleeping pills which helped.  The medicatioin was very helpful as the rash and itching disappeared.  Now, two months later, the itching has reappeared.  My pharmacist recommended that I use Hydrocortisone which helps but it takes a lot of time for it to be helpful.  The itching and rash disappeared again, but within a week, it reappeared.  I do not recommend this medication to anyone as people using it may expereince the terrible itching problem I am currently suffering.  If you use  it, plan on losing a lot of sleep.

I was rushed to the emergency room and had started to turn blue.  After this happened and I was taken off the med, I realized that I had been feeling horrible.  I feel so much better now.  My advice is to be very careful with this medication.

When I don't take the recommended dosage, I am fine.  I reduced it down to two days, and after 2 bouts of diarrhea in one day, I am concerned.  I will meet with my doctor, but will stop until that time.  I am wondering why i have to take medicine that is recommended for people who numbers are over 500??  i normally take flaxseed which has the same Omega-3 nutrients--go figure.

I now take Ocean Blue Professional 2100 it has over 2100mg of Omega-3 in 2 capsules and it has a product that includes B vitmains. Hands down Ocean Blue Professional 2100 is a better product and you do not need to take supplemental products with it.

This medication is taken along with zetia 10mg.  However for the last 3-weeks I have experienced a severe depression, and do not like the way it makes me feel.  There are crying spells for no apparent reason, and I sleep alot when not working. I have no energy, and feel sad all the time.  These are the only two medecines I take, plus two aleve when muscles ache.  I am a 61 year old female, and walk three or four times per week for l/hour.  No diabetes no high blood pressure just high cholesterol.  This is the very first time ever, that I've had to take any medication.  Could you please help?

I have noticed my legs feeling very nervous especially at night and it is so bad I can't sleep.  I quit taking it for about 4 days and my legs were feeling better, however I took my dosage last night and woke up at 4:00 AM and could not get back to sleep because of the feeling in my legs.  I will stop taking it for a week and see how it goes.  I also have had an unusually loud ringing in my ears constantly.

I started Lovaza over a year ago and my hemmoroids would flare up more often and bleeding would last on and off for a couple of weeks.  Until I read the potential side effect of bleeding with the example of bloody noses, I didn't make the connection.  I stopped Lovaza last month during a flare up and within a few days it cleared up and has not repeated itself.  Before this, it was happening on a regular basis and I can clearly attribute it to the Lovaza.

At that time, I expressed concerns to my doctor because the Lovaza patient information sheet had changed, indicating strongly that Lovaza was to be used only for patients with triglyceride levels of 500 and above (mine had never been above 450)and stating that Lovaza might cause elevated LDL levels in some patients, as, indeed, my LDLs had shown an increase at a check-up in November, 2009. We cut the dosage to two grams a day. Lab work done in February indicated that two liver enzynmes had increased to abnormal levels.A routine test at my gynecologist's office in April revealed that there was sugar in my urine (later confirmed by blood tests). I stopped taking the Lovaza. Two weeks later, I was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rapid, irregular heartbeat. I had never had liver, diabetic, or heart troubles before. I attribute all of these new symptoms to the Lovaza.

The last week, the pains happened every day and were so severe, we thought he was having a heart attack and went to the ER for tests. His heart checked out fine. Friday, the pains were so severe that Saturday, his stomach was sore. Funny thing is, he burped a LOT every time he hurt and kept saying he thought it was something related to his stomach. We talked about the fact it might be this medicine so he hasn't taken it for 3 days, and guess what? He feels great!  I WOULD NOT RECCMEND THIS.

Last August,09, I was refered to the emergency room due to severe diarehha and bloating. Gas is definately a problem, at times I thought my gut would come out my ears. A CT scan, blood tests and other work ups revealed nothing. Was put on antibiotics, and a diarehha medication. It took a month before I was somewhat back to normal. The same symptoms started again this month, Jan 10. Finding this site and the comments concerning Lovaza convinced me that Lovaza is the problem. I have stopped the drug as of today. Will update after next blood test and doctors consult next month. I also lost my taste for maany of the foods that I enjoyed  prior to taking this medication. I no longer like coffee and my appitite has diminished greatly.

However, it'll cost you gaining weight, bloating, and gas.  Essentially it's a fat, and your body will have to store it somewhere unless you compensate by either eating less or exercising more.

Got the results from my first blood test, cholesterol down from 254 to 212, HDL up from 63 to 75, and LDL down from 161 to 114, and triglicerides down from 200 to 126.  I feel fantastic and of course, my doctor is pleased.  I did start Crestor, but only took a few pills and it made my legs swell, and not just a little.   My doctor wasn't convinced that it was Crestor, but I am and didn't want to try it again, so this was the alternative.   Next test in January 2010 (nuclear stress test and anothe blood test).   So stay tuned.

I have been taking this for the last 3 years. It has worked in bringing my very high trigs down to normal. But now from reading all your reviews I know now what all the side effects I am having are now caused by this drug. bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhea, gout, cramps, and the worst one, I have gained 30 pounds since taking this , and I could not figure out what was causing the weight gain, since i have always worked out every other day and have not changed my diet. So there is the answer everyone. I am telling my doctor to take me off this now.

I started with one capsule a day and then increased it to one in the morning and one at night.  I did not want to take four capsules as prescribed because it was/is a new medicine.  I will let my body dictate the amount I will take.

I had severe pain in my left side of the body. Two weeks of diaharria and vomiting putting me in the hosiptal. Lovaza is supoose to lower triglycerides it does but with high cost of illness. My doctor took me off and said it is just fish oil. It also has alpha-tocopherol which is harmful. I won't take this medication again. I'm done feeling sick.

Lovaza has lowed my level to 332. I've just realized (after reading some of these reviews) that this med is causing some inconveniences I have (gas #1). I read these reviews because of a sudden onset of a smelly odor and taste of fish. I guess it's to be expected from fish oil but it's just begun to happen. I started smelling it on my hands last week and in my mouth now. I'm gonna stay on the meds as long as possible. It's a life saver for me.

Since taking the medicine I have now gained back almost all of the weight, although I still eat healthy &amp; exercise, besides feeling like I'm going to blow up! I don't care what he says, I'm not going to take it anymore.

After 3 months, trigs had dropped to 170 - the lowest I've ever had. BUT, I'm beginning to think that the back pain (shoulders, arms, neck, shoulder blades, center of back, lower back) I started to have (after starting Lovaza) is related to this drug.  My entire body aches - every joint and muscle.  I want to stop taking it to see if the pain goes away, but I also want to wait til my next bloodwork to see how my trigs are.  I suspect that I will have to stop it - I'm having trouble sleeping - the pain wakes me up.

I have thought I ripped something inside of my stomach. This has to be the worst of the worst (expensive) hiped medication on the market. Talk about &quot;gas&quot;, gas here, gas there, everywhere you go, gas, gas, gas. Feels like your inside organs just want to gas out. If anything, eat fish. At least it tastes a lot better.

On the 3rd day I had chills/fever, very tired.  On the 4th day I had sudden diarreah which lasted for 2 hours followed by chills/fever, exhaustion, muscle pain and cold hands &amp; feet.  I stopped taking today and feel much better.  As a note my triglycerides were only 157.  My cholesterol is 175, LDL 87 HDL 57.  After reading all these reviews I'm actually at a loss as to why my Dr. wanted me on this drug.  She indicated my triglycerides were too high. I found this drug way to severe.

Temperature would range from my normal of 97.3 up to 103. Felt like my brain was being BBQ'd. Called pharmacy to see if it could be another med I had just started and he said no. Stop taking the LOVAZA. I have taken my last one yesterday and pray I don't have another fever tonite.

After 6 weeks of use (so in all honesty there is no way to determine effectiveness), I have stopped taking it due to its causing debilitating gas pains 24/7. There is no information on how one can help themselves through this issue, and since I've been unable to get a good night's sleep in 3 weeks (this problem increased over time) I'm taking a break from it. Medicines are not supposed to be painful to take.

Lovaza is the reason that my husband has been going a living death the last two months. Due to him taking several different meds {350 pills weekly}, it took me a while to make the connect. The doctors were of no help but we have finally figured it out. My husband has been suffering with an overall body rash that has kept him from sleeping, leaving the house, or having any peace at all. He has gotten to the point that he has brought blood due to the itch. The med. may have some useful benefits but for my husband at least, it's not worth what it has caused his body to suffer through. Please keep notes of when you start a new med {we didn't} and what if any new things happen with your body....that way hopefully you won't have to suffer as long as my husband has. Lovaza is very costly, has awful side effects, and there has to be other meds that can help without taking away the most basic enjoyment of life.

So I suggested to his doctor to use Lovaza, they didn't even know it existed!.  But it does, and   it is much better than STORE brand, because it is a pharmacutical Grade oil, unlike others.  I work in a pharmacy and have had experience with this drug.  It's has the Least amount of side effects for those who cannot take statins.

Trigs before at 310, trigs now at 320. No side effects. Doc switched me to Tricor and now I have some reservations. Note: Prescription Lovaza 900 mg contains active ingredients of 465mg of EPA and 375mg of DHA. My old container of Omega 3 Fish Oil from Sam's Club 1000mg contains active ingredients of 180mg EPA and 120mg of DHA. May be of benefit to ask your Doctor to use the over the counter versus paid prescription (may be cheaper.)

Now the Dr put me on Lovaza (tri-269) and I think this is doing ths same thing with body aches.From my head to my toes I ache. I really don't know how effective this is yet since I just started taking it.If I start with hives and other symtons I will stop taking.

At 4 months, it had already lowered my triglycerides by 50%.  I have lost 20 pounds and I was struggling to lose weight before taking this drug.  The only negetive is the cost. I keep doing it because I am a diabetic and have had two types of cancer. It will actually save me money in the long run if I take the weight off and decrease or eliminate the other medications that I take for diabetes.

I couldn't even take Zetia; so my doctor tried this and so far we are seeing results....I do have some cramping at times..but it passes..I reccommend this to anyone with high levels of anything..and especially any circulation problems...

Then I told him about the switch, he cleared his throat and said &quot;You have come a long way with diet.&quot; He also said &quot;Lets see next month.&quot; Will post in 30days again. I have made many changes in lifestyle and diet. Please ask your Doc. if its okay. I have Diabetes, Back nerve problems, high blood pressure, and kidney problems.

After 4 years on 4 different drugs (Gemfibrozil, Lipitor, Tricor and combo) to lower my high triglycerides w/ varying effectiveness and side effects I ask my doctor to let me try this &quot;natural&quot; solution.  Triglycerides and cholesterol plummeted to lowest levels since I had my first blood test 20 years ago (and lower than any of the other drugs my doctor and I tried).  All w/ 0 (zero) side effects!  And the best bonus?  I lost 30# in 7 weeks (4 weeks after I started taking Lovaza) w/o changing a thing in my diet or exercise routine!  I generally feel better too!  Could not be happier and wonder why I didn't switch the day Lovaza (then called Omacor) came on the market.  If it works for your conditions try it, its truly a miracle.

The stomach and bowel side effects lessened shortly after obtaining full-strength dose, but occassionally reoccur.  Reliant Pharmaceuticals should look into reducing the size of these huge capsules, enabling a one-pill dose taken twice a day instead of the current tw0-pill dose taken twice a day.

When I started my level was off the scale and now it's below 300.  That's the best it's been in over ten yrs. The only side effect has been an occasional burp with bad taste like old tuna fish.
