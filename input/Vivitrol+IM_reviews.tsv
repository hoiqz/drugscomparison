It tasted weird, I felt weird and poured it out. don't know yet if insurance will pay for it but it is a life saver. Do be careful when anesthetics are used by Dr, or Dentist. Make sure they know you are on the drug.My face went numb once from an injection in my hip. My Dr. told me to wear a medical alert tag. I didn't and I should have.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	Wrhvivitrol, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/11/2012 8:45:41 AM	I was a frequent &quot;slip-er&quot; regarding alcohol use. I asked my Dr. about a drug possibility and he recommended Vivitrol. After some wrangling to get my insurance to cover it (which they do) I took it for 3 months (3 injections) along with counseling and involvement in AA and I am feeling great with very little craving. My craving happens when I am in unhealthy places, there are no cravings at other times. No side effects except for a little ache at injection site which lasts a couple hours.
Other	NoToVivitrol!!!, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	19-24	12/12/2011 12:55:19 AM	First and foremost, use extreme caution and examine the pros/cons of taking this drug!!I got a DUI while home on break from college and was court-ordered to attend an IOP program.  While in the program, Vivitrol was explained to us as &quot;the best treatment option&quot;.  As I had just turned 21, I really didn't believe I had a problem with drinking.  I would go out on a friday, and maybe a saturday, to the bars with some friends.  I rarely got sloppy drunk (unlike most of the other college students).  I would got to restaurants or sit down for dinner and have a beer or a glass of wine and that's it.But somehow my family found out about Vivitrol from my IOP instructor and suggested I get the shot.  I said no problem, as I couldn't drink on probation anyways.  I couldn't tell if it did anything since I never experienced &quot;cravings&quot;.  I'm still not sure what they are and the only thing I can compare it to is nicotine craving since I'm a smoker, but was told they are different.  I never drank on it either so I can't say if it helps with that either.Now for the very serious part.  2 weeks after my 2nd month injection, I was seriously burned in a house fire.  It was the worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life!!  I've severely broken bones (i.e. arm cracked and was at a 30 degree angle or so instead of straight), had my wisdom teeth pulled, dislocated shoulders from sports, etc.  While in the ambulance they asked me to rate my pain from 1 to 10.  I've rated my pain before and even when I snapped my arm I still didn't say 10.  I said, and I quote, &quot;F'ing 20!!&quot; while crying my eyes out.  They injected my IV with Fentanyl.  No relief.  At the ER they saw I was in so much pain, they injected another, larger, dose of fentanyl.  Nothing.  10 minutes later, they injected another dose of Fentanyl.  Pain went from 20 to a 15 (still on a scale of 10...).  After 1 more shot of fentanyl, and an addition shot of Dilaudid, I finally stopped crying (pain rated at 10).  HORRIBLE!!!
Prevention of Opiate Drug Abuse	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/16/2011 8:26:54 PM	I am in my twenties and have been an opiate addict particularly oxycontin and roxicodone for over ten years turning this typical all-american girl into your average everyday criminal. I've been through inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, in-patient again suboxone...you name it. Vivitrol has saved my life!! I went in to take my first injection using( I thought I had been through this withdrawal thing before) within a half-hour I was violently vomiting every couple minutes there is no other sick, withdrawal, childbirth that could even parallel. I ended up in the ER several hours later which I should have went directly. I had several medications administered by IV, including a large dose of ativan. The Dr. Would not even tell my family for sure if I was even going to make it. The next month was a complete blur lost 20 pounds. (I was a size 8 when I took the injection) eventually I gained back strength and was honestly angry that I could no longer use (I tried) then realizing...this really is INSANE. After around my second injection I was in agreement not rolling my eyes when it's said that it's a gift from God. After 4 injections I don't know if I will ever stop taking it. I'm not sure if it is the injection but I have experienced much nausea, headache, dry mouth, increased anxiety which is so minimal compared to any day using. Any addicts skeptical? Just try it and work a program even if it's one month. It has changed my life!!!

This would lead to a binge.  I sought out Vivitrol since it would not allow me to have the choice.  The shot was almost painless!  I didn't have any nausea just a little drowsiness.  I haven't had any desire for a drink just yet!

No desire to drink, no side-effects and a very happy LIFE!. Strange thing, when a craving for drink enters my mind, it's swept away instantly. I'm part of survey, hope it helps someone else. Incredible.

Only complaint is the golf ball in my ass for four days after injection.

I have not had any problems for the past fifteen years up until I recieved this injection. Is it possible that the vivitrol IM is interfering with the same area of my brian that is dysfunctioning as far as my dystonia is concerned?

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/3/2009 2:46:26 PM	Shot barely hurts if done right - it's only once a month anyways.  Totally amazing results with me.  It's usually only given for a year.  I strongly suggest getting counseling/AA support to supplement Vivitrol.  People don't drink too much for no reason, the only way to stop forever is to fix your head as well.

This is why I gave it two stars for ease of use.  However, you only have to get the shot once a month which is good.  It is a pain in the ass...literally!However, it WORKS which is the important thing.  The first day I came home, I had no urge to drink.  I had been drinking daily about 10 beers a night and I came home after the shot and could literally take or leave the been that was in the fridge...I left it!

But when you first get the shot, it's hell. It will IMMEDIEATELY dump the rest of the opiates and put you through detox. I started treatment in the hospital and wished I could have stayed until I was through (5-9) days. Make sure you have a great support system when you start this program.
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	cheree, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/31/2009 6:34:11 PM	The drug was almost impossible to get approved by my insurance then to get administered by my Doctor!!!  The injection site swelled up and has gotten bigger, harder, and wider every week for the last 5 weeks. Worse, the medication does not seem to be working at all! The only reason I stopped taking Naltrexone orally was due to serious stomach irritation. But at least that form of the drug was effective. Additionally, I am more depressed, experiencing violent episodes of anger, my sleep has been more disturbed than in years, and my appetite has increased. My lower back pain and all over joint pain is increased. I wish I could get this stuff out of me!  I strongly caution anyone thinking to use this medication!!!!!
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	she ra, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/4/2009 9:54:11 AM	I am an alcoholic. I am also a healthcare worker and it was time to stop the insanity and gain control of my life. If you are serious about sobriety, get on your knees and pray to God.  Reduce your drinking starting today, go to every AA meeting you can, call your physician and &quot;come clean&quot; about your addiction, get the necessary bloodwork to determine if you are a candidate for this treatment. Within a week, you will feel as if you have gone to heaven and come back reborn. This is a life changing committment and if you intend to continue drinking, don't pursue it.  This treatment has incredible potential to save lives and change our society.  If you don't have the insurance coverage or money to pay for it, ask your physician about other options.  Godspeed!
Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	free again, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/28/2008 5:47:13 PM	from 12-14 beers atleast every other day, from the first day of the shot I went 8 days before having another drink. The first time I drank 5 beers (that really didn't taste as good as it used to) and on the fifth beer I dumped it out cause I just didn't want anymore. In 3 1/2 weeks after the shot I may have had a total of 10 beers which before would'nt be enough for one night..the side affects on me were very minimal nothng I couldn't handle. I am truely amazed of the effectiveness of this shot. I hoped it would work this good, but still had my doubts. I was wrong! It's the best choice I have made for me and my family.

At 27 I haven'y gone without a drink for more than a few days at a time since I was 15. I manage a bar and its just always been there.This injection is amazing. I get a drink sent to me and it tastes funny. Before it tasted like heaven! (And would turn into 10 too many!)This is a miracle drug! I have no desire to drink and even if i find myself with a drink I can NOT finish. I've tried AA, counseling, groups, multiple DUI's and lawyer fees. NOTHING worked till now. I am around alcohol 50 hours a week and now remember those hours! I have no cravings or desire to drink. TRULY A MIRACLE DRUG!!!!!!
