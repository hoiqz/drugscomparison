Emptying of the Bowel	clwhite, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	9/21/2012 2:38:21 AM	Had to go to traffic court in the later part of the day. Tried to reschedule procedure ahead of time with my doctor. Doctor said it would be fine to start taking the medication later than he originally prescribed. Took the pill at 4pm. Mix the solution at 5pm. Slight BM  around 5:30pm. Started taking the mixture with the pineapple flavor pack at 10pm. Realized it would probably be easier to bear if refrigerated after the 1st cup. Felt nauseated. The mixture was very hard to take. I was cold and just feeling bad the whole time. At 12:00 am. I stopped taking it. I did not finish 2 cups of the 8. My prescription said consume nothing after midnight. Did not hurt my feelings at all. Around 12:30am started having very liquified movements. Fell asleep and around 1:45 woke up for another movement and realized my arms were itching all over bad. Had what I assume is the hives. Checked this site for side effects. to see hives is one of them. Hopefully I will be empty enough to go through with the test, because if not I will not be doing this again. Don't ever want to feel this bad never ever again.  
Other	par, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/21/2012 11:04:25 PM	Having my 1st Colonoscopy, my Dr. gave me a script for the Halflytely.  I had heard horror stories from several people about the medication and thought the worst.  Wrong.In  the a.m, I added the lemon lime flavor packet to the powder, shook it up, added the water and put it in the fridge.  At noon, I took the little pink pill.  It worked within 30 minutes.  At 4 p.m, I dreaded the liquid.  I used a straw to drink it and I was extremely suprised that it was not thick or salty.  It had a slight lemon lime taste and like the other reviewer it had a consistency just like water. It was no problem to drink the 8 8oz glasses.  Believe me, it works!Had the colonscopy the following day and it was a breeze.  Good luck with yours!
Emptying of the Bowel	jacky, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	5/31/2012 2:26:09 PM	Took the one pill plus the full container.Started at noon day before colonoscopy.By 8:45 a.m. day of exam only half was clean.I am  115 lbs with IBS and constant diarrea, I followed instructions.How in the world if I haven't eat much for 5 days before, I am not clean enough. Waste of time, money, pain and is 2:21 p.m and I'm still running to the trone w/o beeing really clear yet.My first colonoscopy was in 2008 I was unable to leave the trone until 10 minutes before the procedure, clear as water. This product is ineffective.
Emptying of the Bowel	gianni, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	25-34	4/26/2012 7:54:37 PM	it's kind of difficult to give 5 stats to something that doesn't taste great. but overall, as i sit on the toilet as i type it's working.  the laxative pill did nothing but the solution,  it started working after about 4 glasses. i did the math and was dreading the 8 glasses but somehow managed to do it I'm 7 so i was happy.  the taste wasn't great but 10x better than phosphorous soda i took few years ago. i plugged my nose whole chugging it and it helped, esp if chilled.   not sure why many reviews said it was too thick and slimy.  it was clear and same consistancy as water for me.  maybe they didn't shake it well enough?
Emptying of the Bowel	gmtigger, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	4/3/2012 7:53:02 PM	Took the tablet at 9am. Mixed up Halflytely with lemon lime flavor &amp; put in fridge to chill. About 30 min. before drinking I took it out to warm up a bit. Discovered if I took deep breath and long drink it went down pretty easy. I was able to get it all down without to much difficulty.  Not the most pleasant experience but it could be worse. I did keep a book in the bathroom to help pass all the time spent in there.
Emptying of the Bowel	Texas patient, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	1/21/2012 2:02:07 PM	Don't use this prep.  I folowed the instructions to the letter and did everything I was supposed to do, but my doctor couldn't complete my colonoscopy because there was so much stool left in my bowel.  Sounded too good to be true, and it was (just having to drink 1/2 the amount but only did half the job.  An expensive mistake.  Now my insurance company won't cover the second colonoscopy my doctor has to do and I will be out thousands of dollars.  In addition, I still can't eat for another 24 hours.  This should never be prescribed.  Beware.

Started drinking the stuff with the orange flavor, could kind of tell it have an orange flavor.  First glass was ok, choked down next glass, started gettig bloated and sick. Gagging as I sipped another glass and nothing was happening. Finally after2hours of trying to get this horrible stuff down I had to go to the bathroom but after that I got sick and was throwing up more that was coming out of the other end.  I drank about 3/4 of it but threw up a lot.  This stuff is horrible, taste terrible and made me very sick. I threw up for 15 minutes and I know it didn't clean me out.  NEVER AGAIN! There must be something else!

STARTED DRINKING THAT NASTY STUFF. COULDN'T STAND THE TASTE AND THE THICKNESS OF IT. DRINKING WITH A STRAW HELP ALOT. FINALLY FINISHED IT. GOT REALLY SICK. FELT LIKE I HAD THE FLU.THIS IS TO MUCH TO DRINK. NEED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING EASIER. WON'T USE THIS STUFF AGAIN.
Emptying of the Bowel		1	1	1			8/28/2011 10:01:28 PM	As prescribed - took the pill at 4 and started the solution at 6 - at 8:30 still no bowel movement but vomited.  Caled the doctor who said wait 30 mintues then finish.  !0 pm - still not bowel movement.  The flavor packets are worthless.  This stuff is awful.
Emptying of the Bowel	Curiouskait, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	5/16/2011 10:20:17 PM	The only bad part of this experience was the waste of my day. I took the pill at noon, had a BM at 130 and was drinking  8 oz of the liquid at ten minute intervals for 70 minutes. Lemon and lime flavor tasted good but the fatigue and stomach cramps started immediately and didn't pass until 8 pm when I finally had my BMs. It took four trips to the bathroom but since I was able to take the day off of work not incredibly inconvenient. After the BMs I was comfortable albeit wide awake from rested all day.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/17/2011 10:22:55 PM	I had to use this treatment because of a colonoscopy at the age of 50. I had no problems using halflytely and the taste didn't bother me at all. I just felt tired at the end of the day that's all. Nothing to worry about the reviews are more frightening then the treatment itself. Piece of cake!!!

Emptying of the Bowel	 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female		1/4/2011 9:20:31 PM	Added cherry, pineapple, and orange flavor packets and it became tolerable.  Tried cherry just at first and it was nasty!!
Other	CharlieBW, 65-74 (Patient) 	1	4	1		65-74	10/15/2010 2:56:18 PM	This was my 5th colonoscopy over 20+ years. The other 4 which involved other laxatives and in 2 cases, enemas, successfully cleansed my colon. Halflytely did not. As a result I have to repeat the colonoscopy next year.
Emptying of the Bowel	D, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	8/27/2010 2:28:44 AM	Just finished my 4th cup of the stuff and still no bowel movement.  My stomach is so bloated from the liquid.  Feeling cold.  Just urinated to make room for more fluid.  Looks like I have one cup left to down. I swallowed the two pills about 7pm.  Started drinking the liquid about 10pm.  It is now 11:30pm.  Still no diarrhea.I chose the lemon lime. I refrigerated it for several hours.  Tastes ok.  Gave it one star because I still have no BM.
Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	7/20/2010 1:29:46 AM	The most awful drink I ever have had. Didn't finish and I too was so cold and couldn't get warm. I am worried that they will not get a good look. I would never prep again with this.
Emptying of the Bowel	jeseniaparks04, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	19-24	6/24/2010 5:28:53 PM	I said not satisfied because I was highly against this whole thing from the get go, but the doctor said it was neccesary, and what do I know? It tastes awful and I'm overwhelmed, wondering if I'll be able to choke down 2 liters of this stuff. i dont even think my stomach has that much of a capacity! Anyway, I took the two tablets at exactly 12pm, and then had the bright idea to go run an errand or two. Don't do that. About an hour later, on my way home, I was beset with horrendous cramping, the kind that put me in the hospital a month ago (and hence the colonoscopy to check for crohn's), and I was turning green from the nausea. I had a few BMs, all various stages of solid to watery, until the last one was just pretty much yucky liquid something or other.I get home and I start the liquid stuff. I'm still drinking it, and using a three part system. I take a swig of ginger ale, then grab my cup of liquid stuff and my water bottle of crystal light sunrise orange ( the same kind of stuff in my liquid ) and then took a large swig of the liquid followed by my water bottle as i just finish swallowing the nasty stuff. I'm halfway through and so far so good, I'm just full, and I haven't eaten since yesterday or so. don't use the flavor packets. i dipped my pinkie in the orange and was repulsed to my core, hence the crystal light. in summation: its terrible, but its gotta be done. make sure you have plenty of TP and water and ginger ale, since ginger is good for nausea anyway. the medication works, but its difficult to deal with in that you can't work on this medication, don't even try! 
Emptying of the Bowel	lore132, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	55-64	6/4/2010 3:02:23 AM	Three hours after taking the pills still no BM.  Started the liquid and had one or two watery BMs but nothing extraordinary.  A little more than half way through I felt bloated and could hardly swallow another mouthful.  I became nauseous and slowed the process down a bit.  After a while, I drank only half a glass when I vomited.  I still had one and a half doses left.  I was feeling sick and cold so I went to bed.  After a while I drank the rest of the solution and had another watery BM that looked mostly clear.  I hope it's good enough because I am not going to reschedule.  My last experience with bowel prep was not as bad.
Emptying of the Bowel	Barb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	55-64	5/4/2010 11:18:32 PM	Took the 2 pills at noon. 1/2 hour later had a bm and then was instucted to start the liquid. Liquid was dreadful and I have survived banana barium!!! Felt nauseous but didn't get ill. Had the runs for hours and hours and it is now 11PM at night. When taking the mixture noticed I got very cold, to the bone kind of cold. I got into bed and even a blanket and fully dressed I  couldn't get warm. I'm sure that the colon is fully clean at this point, however, I will not do this again. Felt like I had been poisoned and I haven't had the colonoscopy yet - have that fun in the AM
Emptying of the Bowel	healyh4earl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	3/29/2010 7:54:26 PM	The most horrific experience, almost just said F it, I cannot do this!  No way.  From the first cup, felt dizzy, had had absolutely no bm with the pills yet so started the liquid as required in 6 hrs.  With the first cup felt slightly dizzy but chugged it down.  Thought hmmm, do feel light headed.  2nd cup, extremely dizzy light headed and started shaking.  Started feel cold and shivering.  Right before the 3rd cup, took my first watery bm.  Then as I sat there, threw up with a trash can on the other end.  Felt soooooooooo awful.  Then the alarm went off for the 3rd cup, was incredibly cold, shakey hands and breathing &quot;lamaze&quot; style to endure.  Chugged it down and then thought, no way no way, this is not normal.  Felt extremely ill.  Thought I would faint from the intense discomfort.  I had my 2nd and last watery bm.  Somehow someway finished the liter.  Couldn't do 10 minute intervals because I had such a recovery time from one to the other.  I was like 15 to 17 min. apart.  Finally I was done.  Collapsed feeling horrid and could not warm up under a flannel blanket and quilt.  I finally started to feel human again.  Went to the bathroom maybe 6 more times with clear to yellow clear water, gushing out of me.  Done and slept thru the night without interruption.  But never never will I recommend this.  My boyfriend said he took 1 small bottle of something when he had his.  It was a breeze for him.  I wanted to die from the distress.  That's the word.  DISTRESS

Emptying of the Bowel	 Female  (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female		12/21/2009 5:41:34 PM	I took the 2 pills.  Had very mild cramping-- not a big problem.  However, I drank the liquid at 6 oz every 20 minutes as directed by my doctor.  After about 5 drinks I was very bloated and got sick and vomited.  Had about 1/2 of the liquid left.Waited about 45 minutes, then drank 3 oz of liquid every 15 minutes and had NO problems.  Thus, I wish I would have done this to begin with.  Also, I used the lemon-lime pack, but if I had it to over again, I would not use any flavorings as they don't help.  I used a straw and drank by placing the straw at the back of my tongue and it really was not a problem and I avoided a lot of the taste.  Just wish I would have known about the smaller drinks to begin with.  By the way, I called the nurse, and it was ok with just using the solution that was left.

Have done the liquid yet, but I drank some organic chicken bullion, helped a bit.  Going to put Stevia to sweeten, and organic Lemon Sunrider tea in the bottle to ward off the bad taste.  Hoping I can make it through it without loosing it.............

It is stll horrible,but tolerable. I would rub saltine crackers on my tonuge after each drink and would sip on gingerale in between glasses. I was able to drink all of the soultion.

However, so far soo good! I took the 2 Bisacodyl tablets at 12 pm, only had one BM within a few minutes, and that was it.  No cramping, or pain.  Ok, now it's 3pm.  Time to start the solution.  Mixed 1/2 solution with apple juice.  Used the cherry flavoring.  NOT BAD!!! I can drink this stuff.  Well I'm saying this now, but I havent finished the whole 2 liters.   I'll update you later.

Emptying of the Bowel	Laura, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	6/18/2009 1:24:31 PM	I was surprised that it wasn't worse, though I was thankful that I didn't have to do the kind where you have to drink a whole gallon.  The Crystal Light suggestion is much appreciated (I have read that some doctors let you add powdered Gatorade).  Although it doesn't turn the stuff into a delightful beverage, I didn't have any trouble getting it down, nor do I have an aversion to lemonade following. I was surprised, also, that there was no cramping.  Just the urge, and the liquid coming out.  However, the number of seconds between the two was in the single digits -- don't be far from the bathroom!Also, for me, the &quot;purge&quot; kept going on intermittently all night and right up until the procedure, which alarmed me, but the nurse assured me that it is normal and expected, and that they have suction machines and all for the liquid during the procedure.  Sorry to be gross, but I was relieved to find that out so I thought I'd pass that on.Another unexpected thing -- drinking that much cold liquid so quickly makes you cold!  I was shivering and needed to bundle up.It's never going to be pleasant, but I feared it would be much worse.
Emptying of the Bowel	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/15/2009 1:37:59 AM	Honestly, it wasn't that bad. I mean, let's be honest, it's supposed to suck... not something I wanted to do... but if you have to do it, it wasn't that bad. The pills were the worst part for me... they caused some pretty uncomfortable cramping but it eventually subsided. The drinking of the liquid... not fun, obviously, but my doctor told me to mix it into Gatorade, which helped with the taste, and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. You do feel full and nauseous from drinking it all so fast... and do not stray far from the bathroom for the next six to eight hours. But it wasn't unbearable or untolerable. I just rented a whole bunch of movies and spent the day in my pajamas in bed. The next morning I went and had my colonoscopy and the doctor said my colon was completely clean so I guess it worked! A couple suggestions, definitely drink it cold! It tastes like bitter salt water... even when mixed in Gatorade. And drink plenty of liquids throughout the day or you will get a really bad headache from dehydration. I took the pills at noon... had my first bowel movement at 1:30... had pretty bad cramping until about 4 PM. Started drinking the liquid at 6... started having bowel movements at about 7:30... and they kept coming until about 3 AM. After my colonoscopy everything went back to normal. Really can't complain! Hope this helps and good luck!!
Emptying of the Bowel	Catherine, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	4/13/2008 11:45:21 PM	I had to use halflytel to empty out my system for a bowel resection the next morning. I hadn't eaten anything at all the previous 4 days so there wasn't much to do.The taste wasn't as bad as i though it would be. It tastes like salt water. I would highly recommend chilling it in the fridge for a few hours before drinking. I didn't use the flavor packets included. Salty oranges and cherries just don't sound appetizing to me.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	2/7/2008 1:18:37 AM	This is a much better option than the other PEG solutions (Colyte, Golytely, etc.) that require you to drink a whole gallon (4 liters). Colon prep is never fun, but insist that your doctor prescribe HalfLytely instead of the others.

I started taking the HalfLytely @ 4:30 pm it tastes horrible! However, it is doing the job and I am going to the bathroom like crazy. This is not an easy preparation.

I had to go to ER, by ambulance because the adverse effects were so severe.  BM/nausea and seizure like conditions.  my legs would not be still and I could not control them.  terrible experience.  will never use that or have colonoscopy again.  my electrolytes and potassium levels were out of site and by blood pressure went through the ceiling and also a headache to die for...
