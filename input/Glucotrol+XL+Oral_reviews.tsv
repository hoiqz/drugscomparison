I use the Carb. counting method.  I take the medication in the morning with my breakfast.  I have even lost some weight.  No side effects experienced.  I do eat three times a day with snacks in between and a bedtime snack also.

It must not be breaking down in my system. the 5XL works better than the ten XL. I take the tens 3x a day and the 5XL 3 x a dayPlus I take the regular 5's if I need to bring my insulin level down more.I'm trying to see another doctor to see if I require another medication as I don't think the 10's are breaking down in my system.
