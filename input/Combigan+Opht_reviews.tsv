Increased Pressure in the Eye	shopper, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	11/12/2011 1:52:35 AM	Combigan completely knocks me out within 40 minutes. I have switched to taking it at night, because Isaac unable to function.  I try to take it at 9pm. Then at midnight. Then if I wake up, once more no later than  4am. I take the lumigan in the late morning.  This is better than taking connivance in the day. However I wake up hungover. But it's better than falling asleep in my office.

Wide-Angle Glaucoma	eternal perspective, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	55-64	2/24/2011 4:01:04 PM	I have been taking Xalatan and Alphagan for over 15 yrs. I recently changed doctors and because the pressure was at 30, Azopt and Combigan were started. It's been two months and I've felt terrible. On the positive side the pressure came down to 20. In the past, medication would bring it down to 24. I'm experiencing severe fatigue through the day. There is muscle weakness that I've never had before. I get very thirsty. My eye is sore and feels like something is it and the vision more blurred. At my last visit I was able to discontinue the Azopt thinking that was the one causing the problems. I don't feel any better and have a month before I go back for a pressure check. I'm at the place now that I would rather risk losing my sight than to put up with these side effects. I am becoming much more of a recluse because of lack or energy and motivation since being on these medications.
Increased Pressure in the Eye	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/15/2011 9:13:43 PM	Detached Retina resulting in 3 surgeries and increased pressure in eye. Multiple surgeries resulted in development of cataract within 7 months of detached retina. Cataract surgery and lens replacement. I found combigan to be a great help. My pressure has been as high as 44 and has been averaging 14 at this time.  I can not identify any side affects that could be specific to combigan because I also have hypo-thyroid. Possible side affects I have been experiencing: depression, anxiety, hair loss.

My doctor recently ordered blood tests to rule out other illness and to help him make a conclusive decision that it is really Combigan's side effects.

The drops burn on application and give me red eyes. Pros: There is no more migraine pain, even though I get all of the symptoms. It lowered my eye pressure greatly, but I have lost quite a bit of weight even though already thin. I worry that the stomach is getting worse, or causing a new problem.

I have thin hair to begin with, but my today my husband even commented how thin my hair has gotten. My doctor has suggested lazer surgery. Haven't decided what to do.

Increased Pressure in the Eye	Usingmac1, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male		10/12/2009 4:06:12 PM	I have a heart condition. The drug was causing my eyes to get &quot;pink&quot; and very watery. Also I could not walk 1/5th mile before I got a slight, funny feeling in my lower throat and I didn't want to continue my walk. Saw my cardiologist and he arranged for a nuclear test which was abnormal. He prescribed nitro pills to take when I had that feeling. (Also catherization to which I said No.) After 4 months my eyes were getting more &quot;pink&quot; so I stopped taking Combigan for 4 days and I could walk OK for 2 miles. I think there is a causation beween Combigan and  irritation of heart problem. Seeing my Cardiologist tomorrow. (As an aside, I was instructed to place one drop in each eye before blocking teat duct area. I can see how that would allow part of first drop to enter one tear duct and get into my system before I applied a drop to the second eye.)  J.M. 
Increased Pressure in the Eye	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	9/17/2009 4:55:10 PM	After two days on Combigan, I had shortness of breath, dry mouth, was extremely tired and felt &quot;drugged&quot; - then I realized it was the eye drops making me feel so bad.  I had no idea an eye drop could affect a person in such a serious way.   
Increased Pressure in the Eye	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	55-64	7/8/2009 10:27:08 PM	About 1 hour after putting drops in the eyes, I fall asleep for about 2 hours if I am sitting in a chair.  If I am not home, I feel an overwhelming fatigue.  Also my mouth and throat are extremely dry and I have had laryngitis ever since beginning this drug 9 months ago.  I am going to ask my doctor to prescribe something else - the side effects have made me so tired I can't function.  My eye pressures, however, have gone from 48 to 16.
