Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	metronidazole, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	55-64	9/3/2012 6:09:54 AM	Dizziness, confusion and flu like symptoms. Yellowing of eyes and nausea. Symptoms went away after finishing prescription but returned a few days later. I am hoping there will be an alternative drug and that I won't have to go back on this one. It was pretty miserable.
Other	nicoley, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	8/11/2012 6:44:16 PM	I was prescribed this medicine for a recurrence of a C. Diff infection following strep treatment. I had the first infection 10 months ago following Ceftin. Flagyl makes me insanely dizzy and a little nauseated. It makes me really sleepy too and my appetite is totally gone. Gets ride of the infection though (or at least it did when I had C. Diff the first time). Cutting back the dose from 3x/day to 2x/day seems to help. If you have to take it, plan on feeling crappy for the few weeks you're on it.
Diverticulitis	Barf, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	8/9/2012 10:12:57 PM	While in the hospital I was taking two 500 mg tablets three times a day.  It was given to me on an empty stomach.  I had an awful taste in my mouth, nausea, loss of appetite, nothing -- not even water -- tasted good, headaches.  I was to be on this for 10 days but had to stop after 9.  Diverticulitis sypmtoms (fever, cramping, loose bowels) recurred after two weeks.  I am taking 1 tablet three times a day only I take it with food and lots of water and have the same results before -- awful taste, nausea, headache, loss of appetite!  It seems there should be something a person could take with less terrible symptoms. I've also found after I ate an acidic meal (Italian dish with tomatoe sauce base) that I ate while taking with it made the nausea worse!  This is the absolutely worse drug I have EVER taken.  It truly is a drug from Hell! 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	spaxxxxx, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/7/2012 6:23:09 PM	it is great and worked quick
Diverticulitis	Metronidazole, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	65-74	8/2/2012 9:01:44 AM	Dreadful! There has to be another antibiotic for treatment of diverticulosis.  I will NEVER take this again if I am conscious.  The lingering bitter taste, nausea, lethargy, lack of appetite are constant, even with Cipro. I have no energy and feel like I am in a fog.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Lisette, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	45-54	7/26/2012 10:49:43 PM	This medication was extremely difficult for me to take because of the awful taste.  It is bitter and horrid!  It caused me to vomit more than once which made it hard to continue taking.  I found a comment here that suggested taking it with a teaspoon of jelly and swallowing with a glass of milk.  THANK YOU!!!  Finally I can take it until finished as prescribed without gagging and puking.  I haven't experienced any other side effects except headache.  Will be glad to take the last one!  
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	7/20/2012 4:01:57 PM	I took this medication about a year ago for bacterial vaginosis. It worked really well for me but I did have extreme nausea after taking this medication. Recently, I got diagnosed with BV again &amp; was given Flagyl again. I am on day 2 have not experienced any negative side effects. No nausea, headaches, dizziness, etc. I am usually one of these people that has a horrible experience but I guess this medication is different for me. It just reminds us that everyone reacts differently to medicines so don't get too freaked out by the reviews.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	7/17/2012 11:47:09 PM	I took a full course of Flagyl tablets for bacterial vaginosis in June.  It was a hellish week.  Severe depression, dizziness, nausea, weakness, tiredness, loss of appetite.  My symptoms returned and I was prescribed the vaginal gel form of the drug.  Same side effects!  Now, my symptoms are back again!  I will NEVER take this drug again!  Please tell your gynecologist if you are being treated for depression if you are prescribed this drug.  It made my depression much worse, which I thought I could live with if it cured my BV.  Unfortunately, it did not cure it!
Other	Kelly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/17/2012 8:36:25 PM	For the past 6 years I have had diarrhea alternating with constipation. Finally got tired of it and went to the dr. Was diagnosed with IBS and put on meds. Meds didn't work so he sent me to a specialist. He did a small bowel x-ray=came back normal; and a colonoscopy (gags) which also came back normal. All the blood work came back normal as well, no bacteria or anything he could see that would cause the diarrhea. He prescribe Flagyl @250mg 3 times a day for 7 days. I have one pill left for tomorrow morning. I have had none of the horrible symptoms that everyone else has seemed to have, just some heartburn and still some diarrhea, but no where near as bad as it usually is. Hopefully this will take care of my problem.
Infection Within the Abdomen caused by Clostridium Bacteria	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	7/16/2012 11:53:56 AM	I was in the hospital for 5 days with C. Diff. I was given Flagyl once it was diagnosed. I had to take it an additional 10 days, 3x/day, after I was discharged.This stuff is pretty horrendous, so just hang in there and get through the course of treatment. I experienced fatigue, unbelievably putrid-smelling gas (because the infection was dying off and rotting on its way out of meGas-X helped a lot, but it took a couple of days), loss of appetite, metallic taste in the mouth, fatigue, and general aches and pains. Was advised to eat yogurt and to use probiotics to re-stock &quot;good&quot; bacteria into intestinal tract.Flagyl is the nastiest antibiotic I have ever taken (WAY worse than, say, Keflex), but, compared with what I went through for the 20 hours prior to driving myself to the emergency room, its the lesser of the two evils.

Mine came in a package with 3 strips of pills in the foil that you pop out and I threw out the cardboard container that had the instructions. 
Sexual Transmitted Disease Exposure from Sexual Assault	Turkeyfeaster, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Male	19-24	7/10/2012 10:54:52 PM	Why are so many people weak?  Im currently taking this drug because i got trichomoniasis.  It says you can't drink, but you really can... I mean I got black out last night.  Pills in general require more water from your body.  It is also very hot out, put 2 and 2 together and its probably one thing.... You gotta push water.  I feel a little noxious for like 3 minutes after I take it, but chug a glass of water and your good.  Women... lol
Crohn's Disease	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	7/9/2012 1:27:21 PM	BE CAUTIOUS TAKING THIS MEDICATION. It is very powerful. I have had the bad taste that others describe, but most scary had very bad neuropathy. I have taken it on and off for years to treat fistulas, but this last time I started having joint pain, stabbing pain, and numbness. I could only walk about a block before my feet hurt too much. These side effects are finally going away (6 weeks after stopping), but I already have one chronic illness (Crohn's) - I do not want to develop another (neuropathy). I have to say it really scared me, and seeing so many other comments on here makes me very wary. I know that I will never take this drug again.
Diverticulitis	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	65-74	7/3/2012 7:36:57 AM	makes me nausea
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	7/2/2012 3:07:20 PM	I had to comment because after reading several of the reviews I almost didn't take this medication. I was really concerned! I made sure to eat a full meal before taking the medication and avoided anything containing alcohol. I am very happy to say today is my last day of taking this and I didn't have any of the horrible symptoms others reported. I have had a persistant headache since starting it but tylenol took care of that. No cramps, nausea or sick feeling of any kind. Everyone reacts different and that is why I decided to give it a try. I did pay attention to the serious warnings of others. It does taste horrible but you can take it with cranberry juice or something that has a strong flavor to kill the taste, after a few minutes it does go away. I hope this helps. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	6/27/2012 8:40:05 PM	OH I am so happy to be done with this nightmare! Nausea, dizziness, stomach cramps, vaginal cramps, bad breath, awful taste, constant headache, no appetite... just awful. I no longer have BV, but that was a week from HELL
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	allykat, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	13-18	6/24/2012 3:39:43 AM	The first couple of days were symptom-free, I read reviews and felt incredibly lucky to have only nausea and slight depression...but it wasn't until day three when everything changed. I felt stomach cramps on top of the nausea I was already experiencing as well as mood swings, head aches, loss of appetite, I was more lethargic than usual and beyond bloated. On to day four, and though my BV has subsided, I can only hope the side effects lighten. 
Crohn's Disease	SJPCROHNS, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	6/22/2012 1:26:27 AM	I was on this medication for 6 months 4 x daily for a major Crohn's flare.  Since I was so miserable from Crohn's I blamed some of the problems on that and am now realizing that part of the problems were from this medication.  My side effects have been severe joint pain, upset stomach and cramping, dizziness (sort of felt like I was having an out of body experience) AND  vivid nightmares, dark urine, bad taste in my mouth.  I kept thinking if I ate something it would help, but just added weight gain.  I definitely think this medication causes more problems than it helps.  I have only have been off of it for 24 hours now and am already feeling better.  I am going to try probiotics and yogurt to see if it will help Crohns before going on IV meds.  I did not drink much alcohol anyway but did not even try to have a drink of anything during this time due to warnings from pharmacy and doctor. I just wanted to post what side effects I felt I experienced in case it would help someone else.  
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	mawmaw, 65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3		65-74	6/11/2012 2:02:04 PM	Both hubby &amp; I were treated with this drug - each with different 'issues'. While I noticed a decrease of the symptoms within 36 hrs of taking the drug, I had a continual metal (tinny) taste in my mouth along with decreased appetitie, mild nausea and constipation.  Hubby had none of those issues but suffered severe abdominal and urogenital pain. i read that I may also end up with a yeast infection.  Great...just what a wanted/needed - NOT! It appears to me that sometimes my overall problems with this drug are actually worse than the reason for which I was taking the meds. (UG!)

Headache, nausea, aching, no energy, mood swings.  I've tried to play golf and fish, but the exercise and heat make me dizzy-flushed and makes the side effects worse.  6 days to go and I'll be glad when this is over.  Gastro problem seems better.   
Diverticulitis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/7/2012 8:49:40 PM	Worse medication I have ever taken! This medication was administered to me via IV in ER and hospital.  The oral and IV use caused nausea, dizziness, metallic taste and a constant feeling of lethargy and fatigue. I was prescribed 3x oral daily after leaving the hospital, and was only able to take a single dose a day, due to nausea, etc. I also wonder why this medication is prescribed, especially at such high doses. Medical providers should reconsider prescribing this; I literally felt poisoned!

Diverticulitis	PardonMyFrench, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Male	45-54	5/21/2012 9:55:45 AM	The previous reviews were very helpful when my diverticulitis showed up again after being gone for 10 months.  I had NO side effects.  However, please watch the warnings.  You must take this with food.  Not a glass of milk or a cracker.  When you take a dose with Cipro you can feel awful without real food in your stomach.  I tried getting away with a cookie and was miserable until I ate a small sandwich late at night.
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	5/14/2012 11:56:52 AM	This is a wonderful antibiotic but it does not mix with all medications.  I had a very rare side affect when taken with Apriso for the treatment of a serious Colitis infection.

I took it once before but my infection came back so I had to take it again. I had no problems the first time I took it but for this reason all went to hell. I was hospitalized last night because of it. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling nauseas and I started violently throwing up. I also started shaking and I collapsed. Ive been throwing up all day.I ended up having to stop taking the medication all together. 
Diverticulitis	banjopkr, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	65-74	4/22/2012 12:07:39 AM	Kept looking for drug interactions.....none were given!
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	4/9/2012 10:43:28 AM	Keep away not only from alcoholic beverages but anything that contains alcohol in it, like mouthwash. I complained of severe stomach pain and my doctor told me to deal with it but didn't come to any alternatives. I had to find out on my own. Also, take 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and mix it with sweet tea and take it once or twice a week to kill any bacteria. It worked for me.
Infection Within the Abdomen	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	4/5/2012 2:55:02 PM	I took this for amoebas and after the first day had dry mouth and bitter taste. After the third day I had nausea and dizziness along with moving floaters in the eyes. The fourth day I had a severe allergic reaction with nausea, dizziness, instability, weakness,confusion, warmth/tingling/numbness of the hands/feet/face, movement in the eyes, and trouble breathing.My friends sought medical attention immediately.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Jeeeneee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	3/31/2012 12:54:18 AM	I was so worried about taking this medicine because of the terrible side effects so many seemed to have, that I actually put it off for a few weeks. I am allergic to everything from Cipro to antidepressants to aspirin. I had to take 500mg twice a day for a week. I made sure I did not have alcohol for 3 days prior to starting it and 3 days after I finished. I took it with orange juice and didn't have any trouble with the taste. One time I didn't and I almost gagged because it was so terrible and the taste lingered for awhile. Yuk. Take it with something like OJ or a smoothie like someone else advised. Thankfully I didn't get nauseous or ill like a lot of others did. My only complaint is that after all is said and done, I don't feel like it completely got rid of my BV. I even used tea tree oil vaginal suppositories and took a probiotic twice a day to try to nip it in the bud. I hope I don't have to take it again just because I hate antibiotics. Good luck to all who need to take it :)
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/22/2012 11:10:11 PM	I am taking this medication for BV, and I haven't actually had any side effects at all with this medicine.  I am wondering if it is because of the things I am doing to avoid getting another yeast infection from an antibiotic - taking acidophilus twice a day, eating yogurt, and completely cutting out sugar.  I dont know for sure if those things would help to prevent side effects, but it is the only thing I can think of that I'm doing differently - every other reviewer seems to have experienced terrible side effects.
Infection Within the Abdomen	lutehof88, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	3/8/2012 7:22:03 PM	Have had chronic infections in my colon for just over three years, colonoscopy and CAT scans have all been inconclusive to this point. This is the second time I have been prescribed this medication, and I have not found the side effects to be at the &quot;severe&quot; level. There is some distaste, but no upset stomach or flu like symptoms. The main side effect I have experienced has been some moderate heart palpitations, and these are sporadic. I cannot argue with the effectiveness of the drug, as I began feeling better on day two, and the improvement in my symptoms continued from there. Highly recommend this medication for this type of infection and hope you don't experience what so many others seem to have. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	2/29/2012 5:59:11 PM	I am allergice to everything out there, including cipro. Following a medical prodecure, I had 4 serious infections, and was given Flagyl for 7 day treatment. Yes, there are side effects. I advise taking this with a smoothie, food, juice, pop and food. It works wonders on side effects and taste. I first took it on an empty stomach and it felt like I was having a major hangover. The side effects decreased greatly after taking it with food and thick smoothies and drinks.

I drove my loving boyfriend absolutely insane as I rode the roller coaster of boo-hoos.  As for the infected tooth, it is gradually going away.  Thanks to all the folks who posted, it sure did help.  
Infection Within the Abdomen caused by Clostridium Bacteria	Donkey, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	35-44	2/24/2012 11:37:33 PM	Went to hospital for appendicitis a little over two weeks ago, had it removed, surgery was a breeze.  Fever, chills, and horrible diarrhea a few days later. Diagnosed with C. diff five days after surgery.  Started 14-day script of flagyl (500mg 3x/day) ten days ago with little side effeects until this eve.  Slight fever, chills, a bit dizzy.  Could be b/c I forgot to take this a.m. Took flagyl at 1:30p and again at 6p.  Symptoms started about 8p, maybe because I took two doses too close together.  Was quite concerned but posts here make me feel a bit better...seems to be par for the course.  
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	heidisfire, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	25-34	2/6/2012 1:35:32 AM	Just started taking meds for BV.  Taste is discusting.  Side effects are horrible.  Trying to not call in sick for work but side effects are basically like having the flu.  Nausea, diarrhea, stomach upset, headache, and being really sleepy.  Meds work great but would be greater if this was a liquid gel cap so you didn't have to taste it.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/4/2012 11:14:08 AM	I HAVE TAKEN THIS MEDICATION FOR TWO DAYS NOW AND I HAVE NOTICED A CHANGE ALREADY. I WAS WARNED BY MY DOCTOR TO EAT BEFORE I TAKE IT CAUSE IT WILL MESS YOUR STOMACH UP. I WAS PRESCRIBED 500MG.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	25-34	1/25/2012 1:32:28 PM	This medicine will clear up the infection caused by BV; however, it can cause extreme nausea/upset stomach.  Over the last 15 years, I have had to take this medicine three times and have had the same experience.  It feels like I have a severe hangover for the 7 days of treatment.  If any of you have the same side effects, there is a gel you can use instead.  It is five days of using a vaginal gel which is not always pleasant but hopefully you won't have to deal with the nausea.  If you do opt for the pill, keep crackers and ginger ale on hand throughout the day to help with the nausea.  I hope this helps
Crohn's Disease	dmwest, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	1/20/2012 2:27:41 PM	while it is effective in doing it's job, I was told to discontinue use after day 8 of a 3x day schedule due to joint stiffness and tingling on arms and upper chest/throat. like others I also had the constant metalic taste that wouldn't go away plus I had a general feeling of weakness like you get right after having the flu. good antibiotic but I wish there weren't so many side effects.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	45-54	1/10/2012 1:07:04 PM	The mild metallic taste and chalkiness of the pill was the LEAST of my worries with this medicine.  I developed such a severe case of hives with this medication that it took almost 2 weeks of steriods, benadryl, allegra and zyrtec to get rid of them.  Will never take this again but it did cure the infection.  
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Kymme, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/9/2012 3:03:05 PM	Ok.. before taking this medication I read all the reviews, side effects and precautions. After that I was so nervous about taking it, the reviews were horrible. I was prescribed 1000 mg for 7 days. I had minimal side effects, I was tired, had a dull headache for 5 days out of the 7, a little GI upset and moody (sensitive). My overall experience with this medication is definitely an A+. I ate the pill twice a day with yogurt, I suggest you do the same. I had the unpleasant experience of tasting it only once and it is awful. The medication absolutely did it's job. I also avoided alcohol as pointed out by the Dr. and the Pharmacist, I did not want to take a chance.

The taste of the pill is horible and I have to take it 4 times a day but it is working wonders. I was having horrible stomach pains and bloody diarrhea and after 3 days and a stay in the hospital for severe dehydration and blood loss I feel much better with no side effects. I have also take this when I was 14 after contracting a parasite call giardia and had the same experiance as this time. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Muggy, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3		25-34	12/13/2011 10:33:15 PM	The medicine works--- but &quot;getting there&quot; is a bumpy road as the medicine is horrible to taste if not swallowed properly.  The horrible taste makes you cringe at the thought of having to take another dose, but you know you must.   Headache and stomach upset are common side effects of the antibiotics, but taking a half pill instead of a while (as suggested by my PCP) seems to have helped slightly.

(Like to have a beer w/friends about once a week).  Put it off for so long, but in last 9 months vag odor was absolutly disgusting to the point I thought there was something dead in my cars engine, because I could smell it as I drove in new clean clothes, having bathed etc.  Started this medication a week ago and by day 4 odor was so much diminished I was jumping around the bathroom.  Took last one this morning and said &quot;Thank you, Flagyl&quot; before I happily swallowed it.  Odor free for the first time in over a year.  Funny thing is that I had been experiencing awful, man-powered body odor (armpits) for about that long too, it was odd, tried a dozen deoderants, natural remedies, etc.  And my feces smelled horrible.  Never put it all together and don't know if medically it makes sense, but all of these odors are GONE now.  Flagyl is superior in my opinion.  I experienced no side-effects whatsoever.  Was slightly dizzy for a couple minutes one day, who knows for sure why.  That was it.  As for the tastee -- I don't know if I'm a pro pill taker or what, but yes, it was icky, but no worse than some others I've had in my life.  No bigger than a standard calcium pill, yes chalky like that too, but a glass of water is more than enough to wash it down.  If I felt like some of the taste was still in my mouth, on occasion, I just had a few more sips of water.  So I give this medicine 2 big thumbs up as I kick myself for being afraid to try it a year or so ago.  Very happy right now.

This pill was very hard to swallow because of how chalky it is and its horrible taste. Also, I've had every single side effect including extreme stomach pain, headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, loss of appetite, a change in vision, etc. I dread taking this every day, both times. I even missed a day of school because I almost passed out. I'm definitely going to avoid ever taking this medicine again, even though it helped me with my problem.

In all of the medicines I have ever taken in my life, this one is hands down the absolute worst.  While I was on it, I experienced nausea at ALL times, especially in the night I would wake up and sometimes throw up.  The taste was disgusting and I lost my appetite and had diarrhea.  ALSO it gave me a yeast infection and thrush.  Why would I be given a medicine to help one problem with my body if it creates multiple others in its wake? SURELY there has to be another medicine.  I will never take this again and feel bad for anyone who has to  
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	10/18/2011 6:02:45 PM	Just a quick note of warning so nobody reading up about this drug makes the same stupid mistake I did. I went to lunch over the weekend with my husband. Forgetting about the strong warnings about mixing alcohol with Flagyl, I forgot and ordered a Margarita. I have a pretty strong system, so I kid you not when I say the mixture knocked me on my arse. To the point that I was very rattled at how sick I became, and how quickly it hit me. Luckily the effects did not last long. Bad time to have a senior moment! Anyhow, the warning is no joke. Just hope this post helps imprint others.
Diverticulitis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	10/18/2011 1:59:55 PM	I can't stand being on this medication. I can handle the bad taste in my mouth and the nausea, but what I can't take is the vertigo (my head constantly feels like it's going to roll off of my shoulders), the lack of coordination and motor skills it produces, the foggy thoughts, and the depression. This is the worst medication I've ever taken in my life and I almost think I felt better when I was sick than when I'm on Flagyl.

Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	4	Female	55-64	10/2/2011 7:35:23 PM	I was prescribed Flagyl 500mg 3 X day (along with Avelox) for 1 week for a Cat Bite. Because of allergies, I wasn't able to take the usual anti-biotic prescribed for cat bites.  I did receive Leviquin intravenously in ER d/t severe cellulitis in hand. With Flagyl, I've experienced many of same side-effects as other reviewers here (metallic taste, nauseau, diarrhea, light-headedness, dizziness, weakness, etc)and have been unable to work. My mother and a MD on-call at my clinic did offer the following advice which has helped considerably.  1) Coat pill completely with butter/margarine prior to taking (Brown and Brummel works really well)and take with other food and plenty of water. This minimized/eliminated metallic taste and made taking pill (and keeping it down) possible for me. Another reviewer here recommends using honey which seems to me would coat pill equally well. 2) Eat a bland/anti-diarrhea diet only - white bread, white rice, white noodles, plain chicken, plain eggs, chicken broth, applesauce, cooked carrots, etc. and don't &quot;force feed&quot; yourself, i.e. keep amounts down. 3) Eat good quality yogurt (like Stonyfield) 3 X day to replenish Probiotic cultures. # 2 &amp; 3 have helped my stomach churning, nausea and stopped the diarrhea in the last few days.   The MD on-call also told me that because side effects are so difficult for most to cope with (she had to take it and had severe problems tolerating), Flagyl should only be prescribed when absolutely necessary, which it was in my case.  I am praying that today will be my last dose as swelling in my hand down 90%.  I see my MD tomorrow and I'll find out then. I wish that PCP has thought to share some of above helpful hints with me.  Good luck- hope this helps.  
Infection that causes Diarrhea - Giardiasis	halfbreed88, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Male	35-44	9/24/2011 2:32:35 PM	This drug will probably kill whatever is making you sick, but it could also kill you in the process!!  The extreme nausea and headaches in the first few days were barely tolerable, but went away after about day 4.  However, on day 7, I woke up in the middle of the night with EXTREME pains in my upper abdomen.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  I called 911 and had to be taken to the emergency room in an ambulance.  I couldn't breathe and could barely talk.  The pain was excruciating.  After 45 minutes, the pain went away.  The doctors couldn't tell me what it was.  They did tons of tests but the only thing that was abnormal was my liver function.  I was discharged and told to stop taking the antibiotics.  3 days later I had two more attacks.  I went to see a gastroenterologist and she did an endoscopy, which costs a fortune.  She found gastritis, but otherwise all else was normal.  We suspect it was side effects from the medicine.  My unknown GI infection seems to be gone, so the medicine did its job on that, but at what cost???  I went through the scariest experience in my life because of this drug and although I am better, I would not take this drug again, ever.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	nonblonde10, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	9/23/2011 12:08:39 PM	I am 46 and had started having an odor a for about 9 months and thought it was from my Mirena which I had been told (old blood discharge=odor). Well enough of that, then I developed extreme pelvic pain and went to gyn. I was diagnosed with BV; this was the second time in my life. I was told that you can get it various ways and orally and that full teeth brushing and rinsing with antiseptic mouthwash prior to oral sex or any sex is a must; the mouth is the dirtiest place of our bodies. Well I thought back and it hit me; each time I have had this diagnosis, each partner had a habit of using saliva for &quot;lubricant&quot;...BAD IDEA and I had my misgivings. Doc confirmed this was possibly a cause. Felt extremely tired, bad taste in mouth, some depression, headache, and some dizziness and sweating. Med has worked great; no pain or odor anymore after about 3 days. On a course of 14 days at 2 pill/day plus Levaquin. I am no longer letting &quot;saliva lover&quot; &quot;feast&quot; on me; sorry for the wording. Was really worried of the cause; all test for std's came back clean. Funny thing, just found out bf of 2 1/2 had been cheating for at least 2 months; we hadn't had sex for over 2 months due to a chronic health issue I had been having. Boy, last two weeks have been no fun and sad but &quot;downstairs&quot; is A+.
Diverticulitis	Pick, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	45-54	9/17/2011 1:38:58 PM	I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis with an abscess.  I was prescribed a 20 day regimen of Cipro and Flagyl, 3 times a day.  The Flagyl is almost impossible to swallow by itself. I have found it to be easier if you bury the pill in a teaspoon of honey and drink apple juice behind it, however the metallic taste is almost always there throughout the day. Water is absolutely horrible right now. I feel very tired all the time. No energy at all. I have had some hip pain and overall achiness. I am on day 19. I have to say that I think the combination of these drugs are effective as my pain subsided within 4 days of treatment. 
Diverticulitis	Needsabetterdiet, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	35-44	9/1/2011 7:09:56 PM	Same as everyone else. This medication leaves a horrible taste in my mouth and makes me constantly sick to my stomach. I have found that if I brush my tongue with toothpaste and rinse with mouth wash about 1/2 hour to 1 hour after taking, it seems to take some of it away. I have to take this medication 4 times per day, so every 6 hours for 14 days (I'm on day 4). I have also found that if I eat with it, even if I'm not hungry, it seems to help the nausea for a little while. Haven't had any of the sadness/depression symptoms. Can't wait for the yeast infection that I'll have to treat as this has happened in past takings of this medication.

I never had the smell.  The best thing is after 4 days the med did it's job and got rid of the infection in my uterus.  However I had an allergic reaction, which included a fever for day, my tongue swelling, throat felt like it was lined with mucus, headache so bad that everything was blurry, the room was spinning.  When my DR advised me to quit taking the med she told me there may be a fluid build up in my lungs but after a few days it would go away.  A week later I am in the ER because I am having difficultly breathing because I can't quit coughing.  So I get a breathing treatment, and now have a pill to suppress the coughing, an inhalor to help me breath and cough syrup with codine to take at night so I can sleep.  I am glad the pain I was living with is gone, but the aftermath of this drug is worse than the allergic reaction! It's been 7 days since I quit taking the Flagyl and I still have the metallic taste in my mouth and every time I cough up phlegm in my lungs it taste like metal.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	trl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	25-34	8/11/2011 5:18:10 PM	Horrible taste like everyone else. Better to take with a milk-based shake with flavor to wash out that taste.  Vaginosis seems to be going away after the positive test, but I also had a cyst...not sure how this helps that, but we'll see. I still have a few days to go and another few days to get it out of my system.  Horrible upset stomach. I feel like I'm nauseous all the time due to taking it 2x a day even with food and a full stomach.  I force to eat something to take the pill, but I have lost my appetite.

I've found that if I take a chunk out of a piece of sandwich bread and wrap it tightly around the pill, so that the pill is wearing a thin bread jacket, it is tasteless.  Again, mush the bread tightly around the pill so that it is not difficult to swallow and still retains the pills initial shape.  You're welcome!
Other	Elvie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/29/2011 12:45:26 PM	My spouse and I are on day 5 (of 7) of the 500mg 2/day tablet.  We have had NO negative effects whatsoever--except for after taking the first pill which we put in our mouth first before liquid.  I even had about 8 oz of wine last night with no side effect.  My husband had about 3 beers and the same--no effect.  I must admit I was nervous taking this medication after reading all the negative reviews but after five days I realize that usually the people who review only do so when it is a negative.  That is why I wanted to put in a positive review.
Diverticulitis	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/22/2011 6:41:41 PM	I Took 2 pills a day for 10 days. Seemed to work very good for me. I did not have any side effects. I did have a little bad taste in my mouth, but not like I have read about others having. I was also on a clear liquid diet. Did not have any alcohol. Wondering how long I should wait before I do have alcohol.

BUT, MY GOODNESS, the effects are the same!  I've had a HORRIBLE taste in my mouth for the past week and a half.  I finished the 7 day course about 4 days ago.  It is just starting to go away.  It was so bad and I was scared I had terrible breath.  I was brushing and using Listerine, gum, and sugar free mints all the time.  I also had stomach upset and loss of appetite, and generally felt lousy while taking this medicine.  I also noticed a lot more depressive moods.  I cannot wait for this medicine to be completely out of my system.  I'm scared to have a drink of alcohol, even though I'm more than 3 days past my last pill, because I am worried that if I still have the awful taste in my mouth, then the drug is still in my system.  I will avoid this medicine at all costs in the future.

The first night on it, my body began to swell up all over.  By the 2nd day, I felt like my skin was going to split!  This is a HORRIBLE and dangerous medication!  All my doctor's nurse said when I reported it was, &quot;Well, that shouldn't happen.&quot;  Maybe not, but it DID!  Watch out!

I'm on day 5 and have continued getting sicker and sicker. I'm very dizzy, headache, neck ache, swollen lips and tongue, feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen, and exhausted. From looking at the side affects, I think I'm now allergic to this medication (swollen lips and tongue, breathing difficulties). Today is a holiday, so no doctor to call. I am not going to take the 2nd dose today.

A 7-day supply was $1200.00 after my co-pay. That is why I am on this god-awful drug again. 1500 milligrams for 10 days cost $7.47. No way can I justify spending that much on meds. I hate, hate, hate this medication for all the bad side effects (burnt tongue, copper taste in my nouth, nausea, etc...) but at least I can afford to take it. My sympathies to anyone who has Colitis or Crohns as I have only had a tiny glimpse into what they have to endure on a daily basis. You think our Food &amp; Drug Admin. could intervene to make sure the meds we need (without horrible side effects) are available at a reasonable price.

Symptoms went away after a few days on medication.**Important** This medication gave me Thrush and a yeast infection (weird I know). Now I have to take an anti-fungal for 7 days for it to clear up.

I'm glad I am getting better - so I guess I'm &quot;satisfied&quot;.  But I'm on day 8 of this medicine and on my way to work this morning I thought I was going to faint or have a seizure.  My brain felt like it was on water.  I couldn't focus on the road.  VERY DANGEROUS and VERY SCARY.  Luckily I could see my office when this happened...I was able to stop and let the episode pass.  Be careful when taking this medicine.  I've had dry mouth, loss of appetite, irritibility, fatigue...you name it - if its unpleasant.

I dread every time I take this pill, and for good reason. The taste is so completely terrible, and it lingers with you throughout the day. Only moments ago, it got caught in my throat, and I got a full blast of the taste. I immediately vomited into the sink. Would it be too much to ask for a capsule? This is ridiculous.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	1/9/2011 3:41:32 AM	I rated this medication low for several different reasons. First of all, I've only been on the medication for 2 days. My dose is once 2 times a day for 7 days. I rated it ineffective because not only has the infection not even eased up, it's actually gotten WORSE! It's not easy to use (especially when you compare it to other typical oral medications) because it has a taste that could make you vomit in itself. Obviously I'm not satisfied at all. Would have been nice for the doctor to have warned me of the coming depression and sadness. At least I would have understood that it was a side effect to the medication. I really hope it works after all I've been through. And so far, I've read about 50 other reviews and haven't seen where anyone has complained about lower back pain which is another annoyance I have developed since starting this medication.

Side effects were awful: nausea, loss of appetite, stomach pain. I was sleeping horrible, sometimes i had nightmares. I didnt drink any alcohol, didnt have any contact with boyfriend( he had to take some pills as well), and when i went to make final test-it was the same positive. Pills helped with NOTHING!!! After all i experienced-nothing!! My doctor adviced to have them the 2nd course..im dissapointed..
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Mziz Tee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/3/2010 3:20:39 AM	I started this medicine yesterday. Oddly from the rest of the post I read, my doctor ordered me to take this medication in one dose--4 pills at once. He's very good in his field and has 3 GYN offices he works in every week. He also advised me to abstain from sex for a week and no alcohol and ...that I vaginosis is SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED in the form of traditional, anal and oral sex (if your partner has an infection in his mouth. Since I used condoms the only way I could have contracted it was through ORAL SEX! Scary...you have to be careful of whom you let perform oral sex on you. You can catch it through traditional sex if your partner either attempts or performs anal sex with you (or someone else) and then penetrate your vagina, if you are not wiping FRONT TO BACK after urinating or sitting in your own filth while taking a bath. ALWAYS SHOWER FIRST AND THEN ENJOY YOUR BATH! :) Hopes this helps.
Diverticulitis	magnolia, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	11/23/2010 11:23:51 PM	I have taken Flagyl more than once for recurrent bouts of diverticulitis, and it seems to have worked well overall, although I do tend to have some unpleasant issues with stomach upset and nausea from it. This usually starts around the 4th or 5th day, and lasts until I finish the prescription. If this med didn't work as well as it has, I would likely resist taking it, but it does do a good job treating diverticulitis, so I just put up with it...The diverticultits is far worse.

Crohn's Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	11/10/2010 10:56:06 PM	I have taken Flagyl several different times for my crohns and fistulas.  It really does seem to work to get an infection under control, but the taste it leaves in my mouth is awful, makes me want to vomit.  the only other symptom I've had from it is my tongue turning green...kinda like I've eaten something green, but I didn't...
Diverticulitis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/9/2010 2:17:23 PM	I was on this drug for 4 weeks and the only bad thing aobut it is the aftertaste.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Dee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	11/4/2010 12:40:18 PM	I am taking this medicine and this is my first time.  I have had sever dizziness and the head aches.   I am hoping once this dosage is done I am done with this.  I have missed one day of work due to it.  But the head aches are here every day!

I have been on this medication several times and symptoms always clear up within the first few days and I have had no side effects at all. The only problem is that my infection is recurring which isn't the medication's fault but it's annoying.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	whitneybuns, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	10/24/2010 3:36:32 AM	I've been taking this medication for 2 days now and so far so good.  I know it's strange but within 24 hrs my symptoms got allot better.  The itching was the worse.  Now on day 2 and almost all symptoms are gone.  I had no bad odor to begin with but had pain in that area big time.  I take one pill x 2 a day.  I haven't noticed a bad taste yet.  I do take with something to eat and so far no nausea or dizziness.  I have seemed kinda moody and depressed though slightly.  A girl in the ER told me a house hold remedy she does faithfully and hasn't had any yeast or anything like this in years is to get vinegar..white or apple cider and mix about 2 tablespoons in a glass of sweet tea and drink about once a week or twice a week she said vinegar automatically kills bacteria in the body.  She swears by it.  I thought it's worth a try and cheap enough what can it hurt.  Also she said you can put some on a wash cloth and wipe down there to help with the itching.  I was afraid of the burn being everything was all inflamed so I haven't done that.  LOL  I just thought I'd pass this on.. I think it's worth a try.  So far this medicine has helped and was 9.99 at Walgreens with no insurance.  I do have the Walgreens card though... I am 45 and have only one partner for the past 7 years.  Makes me wonder what he's been up to though..He better be glad it vaganosis and not Trick....

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	10/19/2010 1:45:24 PM	Yesterday was my last day of taking this medicine (1 pill, 2 x per day for 7 days).  I am so glad to be off this medicine.  As with everyone else, the taste is the first thing I noticed.  Not just when taking the pill but for hours afterward.  Everything tasted bitter.  Around day 2 or 3 I started having panic attacks (which I've had before but not for the last 2 years).  I thought I was just having a relapse but then I noticed that some other people on here have experienced depression and other mood problems so I am hopeful that now that I am done taking the Flagyl that the anxiety and panic attacks will go away.  I also experienced the naseousness and the loss of appetite.

Infection Within the Abdomen	ccnyc, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	35-44	10/4/2010 6:10:43 PM	I was given this in combination with Levaquin by the doctor in the ER I visited 4 days ago, due to extreme pain following a colonoscopy (they believed I had a bowel infection). While the original pain has lessened considerably, the side effects are making me completely miserable. Nausea, total fatigue and dizziness. After speaking to my G.I. doc, he told me I could stop taking it and remain on the Levaquin or the remainder of the course (6 more days). I don't want the infection to return, but don't think I can handle the side effects anymore. Has anyone stopped this med before the end of the course?  A little nervous (even though doc told me it would be fine)...
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	9/28/2010 8:23:41 PM	I had to take 4 pills at once and i only had a slight headache and dizziness after taking them, the after taste is the only thing that i hate. overall so far so good.
Diverticulitis	Mom of 2, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	55-64	9/26/2010 2:00:35 PM	I've taken flagyl in combination with Cipro for diverculitis on 3 separate occasions over a two-year period. I too have experienced stomach upset, tiredness, and unpleasant taste.Why doesn't it come in capsules???
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	9/11/2010 11:20:49 PM	The pill started to dissolve as soon as I placed it on my tongue and tastes horrible. I have had a metallic taste in my mouth for the 7-day duration of treatment and so far 3 days afterward. I think that I also have a case of thrush now, which is more bothersome than the vaginal itching I was having before I took the Flagyl.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	SpinninLizzy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	45-54	9/6/2010 2:05:49 AM	This medication seems to be effective for me, but the headaches, dizziness, and nausea are really bad. I woke up this morning to the ceiling spinning above me (and seeing images of two cats when I only have one!). I am thankful that I'll only have to take it for 7 days, and that the infection will be gone by then. Everyone must weigh the pro's and con's of taking the medication for their individual cases. For myself, getting rid of this infection is important, so I can put up with the uncomfortable side effects for 7 days. My only suggestion for those reading this is to swallow the pill fast, because it tastes terrible, and take with food.
Other	HEDB9304, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	25-34	8/31/2010 11:24:58 PM	First of all I have to say that this medication did serve it's purpose. I had diverticulitis which in turn absessed &amp; burst in my intestines. But, I do believe I had EVERY since side effect you can get.  I had to take 4 times a day for 2 weeks &amp; it was awful.  I was always dizzy, everything I ate tasted hot &amp; spicy (which toook around a month to clear up and change), my urine was dark brown &amp; strong smelling, &amp; I hardly had any kind of appetite. Only &quot;good&quot; thing I got out of takng this med besides helping clear up my infection is a very nice &amp; dark suntan after being outside due to increased sensitivity to the sun. My side effects may have been a little worse because I also received this in an IV 6 times a day for a week while in the hospital. Did it's job just no fun whatsoever to take.

Infection caused by Trichomoniasis Protozoa	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/10/2010 12:48:07 AM	I started to feel better after the third day. I noticed the symptoms during my monthly cycle, i.e. itching and odor. I drank PLENTY of water while on this medication and I didn't have any side effects. The only complaint, the LOUD fishy odor that is very difficult to mask. The was spragmatic.

Progressively has worsened.  I have spent a week in Hell.  Associated it w/this drug when my inner thighs became very red and inflammed.  I finished the drug Wed and this is Fri.  Hope the rash clears up soon.  If you get diarrhea-don't wait to call your DR.
Diverticulitis	katahay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	7/13/2010 2:39:52 PM	I took a combination of Levaquin and Flagyl for one dose. I have never been so sick. I had muscle pain and stiffness and the pain was so intense I could not walk. Upon returning to the doctor, they discontenued both and diagnosed me with RA on top of diverticulitis. It has been months now and I still feel terrible...have pain throughout my body and am generally ill.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	SCAATY, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/13/2010 9:05:35 AM	I have been on this medicine going on my 4th day, and I have to say I was scared to death after reading all of the past post.  I actually had the medicine a full week pryor to taking it.  I decided to take the medicine, and boy am I glad I did.  I have only had one side effect, and it is very mild.  I feel a bit tired as the day goes on.  By the first day I could already tell a difference.  My biggest complaint of course was the smell, as I have never had anything like that before.  I have been with a new partner for now over 8 months and actually noticed a slight smell about 3 months into the relationship.  But being that I have never had this problem, I just thought it was from all the sweating...lol sorry :)  But as with any women, we know its not suppose to have that type of stinch.  So again after reading almost every post, I have only one comment to make.  Each person is different, what works for you may not work for me and vise versa.  I feel like a fool for not taking this soon after the DR prescribed it. So again, I will have to say that, sometimes reading too much about something is not a good thing.  Oh and by the way, the drinking while on this MUST be true as, Dr told me not to drink, and when I picked the pills up, 2 different Pharmist told me the same, thing.  So guess what no 99 cent Margaritti for me for a while!  But it is so worth it by not having that smell!  I hope this helps someone out there.

Severe Intestinal Infection due to Entamoeba Histolytica	Dani, 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4		35-44	7/2/2010 6:38:23 PM	Severe stomach bug for over 2 &amp; a half weeks with nausea and severe diarreah.Given the 4 tabs at once treatment worked for a day then infection came back. Am now on a 5 day course and its my 3rd day starting to feel better.Doctor said initial treating doctor did not treat quickly enough therefore infection terribly strong plus weak body due to little nutrition. Only side effects have been a bit of nausea slight headache and heart palpitations from time to time but think that is because Im so weak.  Happy with results so far

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	6/27/2010 2:14:29 PM	On my 3rd day and so far no side effects, other than being a bit more tired than usual. This medication does have a nasty taste, so I took it with milk which seemed to wash away the bad taste. I drank half the glass upon swallowing the pill, then chugged the rest after a short breather. I also made sure I ate when taking this medication to avoid an upset stomach. I haven't had any alcohol while taking this medication as advised by my doctor, due to the fact that if you drink while taking this medication you will vomit, so I stayed away.

I took Flagyl once for a Bladder Infection and another time for Vaginosos. RX was 2X Daily for 7 days. Both times on the 8th or 9th day after taking, I broke out into severe hives all over my body. My Doctor said this was impossible to have hives AFTER using a medicine, He said normally hives would occur at the ONSET of taking the medication. But I'm living proof that this can happen. I didn't make the connection that it was Flagyl causing Hives until I reviewed my Medical Records.  The first time I broke out into Hives was a couple of days after finishing Flagyl for the prescribed 7 days.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	immichelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/14/2010 9:51:27 AM	I was a little reluctant about taking this medication because I have IBS. I'm currently taking Citrucel as directed by my doctor. The nurse suggested that I take this medication with yogurt.  I took it with the Activia drinkable yogurt. I had no problems at all.  From time to time, I did feel dizzy and nauseous.  The hardest part for me was not being able to &quot;cocktail&quot;.  I do hope they come up with another alternative to this medicine.  There has got to be a better way!
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	aplwh, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3		45-54	6/1/2010 9:42:05 AM	When I first started this drug, I felt sick to my stomach, and fatigue.  I felt lousy.  At the recommendation of the pharmacist, on the third day, I began to take probiotics.  What a difference that made.  My side effects diminished greatly! My infection symptoms began to clear on the 2nd day of taking medication.

Must take with food and milk to keep the taste from bouncing back. Caused enough dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue to be unable to work/drive. Dark urine.  It seems to have done the job, but at a cost.

I have taken this medication for 3 week intervals 8 or so times in my life.

I has beendoing its work, but it is hard to tell because of the side effects, loss of appetite,bad sense of taste and loose stools(which is from the infection also).Four more days of treatment.  Must have hada real bad infestation. Had it ten days before got results of stool test(so the parasite had quite a grip I guess.

It worked the first two times but has been entirely ineffective this time. The taste is always terrible and you should hope you never get one stuck in your throat; the taste will haunt you for hours! I have had constant nausea, sudden ravenous hunger, loose stool, dizziness, and fatigue. Not to mention that you can't even use mouthwash (which would be nice when you consider the bad taste it causes in your mouth constantly) due to the no alcohol condition. Does anyone want side effects just as bad or worse than their symptoms? 
Diverticulitis	charleeb, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	65-74	5/5/2010 3:47:50 PM	Still taking for 10 days, 3 times a day. Very bitter. I am extremely tired, feel totally drugged and many times have that sea sickness feeling.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Aida, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	4/27/2010 9:20:36 PM	This medication was prescribed to treat a severe yest infection, 2x/day for 7 days. At first, I felt much better and symptoms went away. However, after the third day I started feeling very tired, dizzling, constant nausea, metalic mouth taste, and I can't concentrate at work. I really want to stop taking this tablets. Even the thought of having to take it makes me feel sick. I never experienced something like this with an antibiotic. Reading through the posts here helped me to understand that these are common side effects. I hope I don't get any reverse effects or more yeast infections. This treatment has been difficult. Too much of a pain for just a yeast infection.
Infection that causes Diarrhea - Giardiasis	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	3	Male	25-34	4/25/2010 2:00:56 PM	Flagyl exhausted me. While on this drug, I ended up sleeping roughly 10 hrs/night, and waking up with fevers and bizarre dreams throughout the night. I was constantly tired. It does the job though, since it cured my horrible traveler's diarrhea quickly. I just wish I knew it was the cause of my other ailments so I could have stopped taking it sooner.
Infection Around a Tooth	jms, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	4/18/2010 6:13:53 PM	Am now on the fifth day taking this medication for enlarged lymph nodes under the jaw line that had to be drained and an infected toothe that was root canalled 6 mos.ago.I had no other indication of infected toothe other than the enlarged lymph nodes.The toothe was removed but I'm wondering about another source of infection since there wasn't any infection actually around the toothe.Have experienced bad taste in mouth,dizzines,nausea,general fatigue,general ill feeling . This drug has a large array of conditions it's used for. Can't believe there isn't another that will do the job but without the endless  side affects.
Diverticulitis	Goyum,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male		4/17/2010 11:42:55 PM	I took the ucombination of Flagyl/Cipro for Diverticulitis with 10 days 4X per day for the Flayl generic. Had to stop the Flagyl due to constant pains in stomach that radiates.  Doctor change me from Flagyl to Amox. Was advsed by Pharmacy that Flagyl is terrible on the stomach. No idea if the pain was caused by Flagyl or Cipro. 
Infection Within the Abdomen caused by Clostridium Bacteria	c.diff victim, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	2	Male	25-34	4/11/2010 12:43:11 AM	Was diagnosed with C.Diff of the intestine after taking antibiotic. I have had to take it for 30 days 3 time a day with a probiotic med. It makes you feel horrible. Its almost like you are always on the verge of getting the flu but never happens. Ive had fevers with it and just feel totally fatigued. It is rough but you have to do what you have to do.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	3/31/2010 9:15:35 PM	Taking this drug for a week twice a day cured the bacterial infection, then I had four years of hell. I didn't know what yeast infections were because I'd never had one. This drug resulted in one and initial vaginal creams allowed a drug resistant strain to take advantage of the common yeast strain being killed. If you get a yeast infection, it's worth asking for ketaconozole, rather than accepting other anti fungals which are effective for only the most common candida strains. After a course of an anti fungal, buy both vaginal and systemic probiotics. Hopefully you won't have the four years of sheer misery it took me to get rid of Candida clobarta. The drug also wiped out my immune system and I suffered bronchitis and conjunctivitis within three weeks. Some years later I needed a d&amp;c and guess what? This wonderful antibiotic was going to be prescribed post op. Over my dead body! The surgeon got in touch with the immunologist who treated the yeast infection and agreed an antiseptic wash would be better.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	SunnyInFlorida, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	3/26/2010 10:23:12 PM	I started the meds on Tuesday and have 3 days left. This medication has made my feel extremely tired. Also, I normally have coffee in the morning and since taking this medication I have been using the bathroom every 10 minutes. I feel the urge to pee constantly and it is very annoying. I thought it was the coffee, but its everything I drink. I even called my doctor to see if it could be a UTI and since there are no UTI symptoms it is just from my meds. It is my first time taking this and I really do not want it again. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Mel163, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/26/2010 7:06:27 PM	I wanted to respond to NEEDADVISEBAD &quot;cry for help&quot;. I totally know what your going through. I've had this problem for years but I never knew what it was. I just found out today! I always thought I just had yeast allergens, but come to find out that's not the case. Since I started noticing  symptoms I kept going to the doctor and they would always treat me for a yeast infection. Right after I got done with the medication it would get even worse. So I gave up with the doctors and started doing my own research. And I found a site that talk about bacterial infections and they said that studies  have shown that taking antibiotics makes the infection worse. They had mentioned a natural supplement called Acidophilus. So I started taking it every day. With in a couple of weeks I started to notice a change in my skin and how I felt over all. I felt better. That was almost 10 years ago. Granted I have to live on the pills to stay &quot;healthy&quot;, other wise, like now, I havent been taking it for a couple of months and now I have an infection again.   
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	35-44	3/26/2010 8:13:29 AM	I have been taking the med for 3 days now. i was prescribed it 2X a day for 7 days. I cant believe I didnt go on here sooner. I m very tired, dizzy and my headaches are aweful. At first I thought it was my allergies. Now reading the comments I know its not. My symptoms are gone already but concerned when I can have a alcoholic drink. I  really dont want to take this anymore considering the side effects. 
Infection Within the Abdomen	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	1	1	Female	55-64	3/25/2010 5:08:49 PM	The nausea was difficult-I vomited two of the doses as soon as they hit my stomach, even with food prior to ingestion.  The metallic taste that lingers in my mouth is incredibly disgusting. I am also taking cipro-maybe the combo?  But that's what was prescribed.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	3/20/2010 11:13:48 AM	I was diagnosed with clostridium difficile following a &quot;stomach bug,&quot; which was causing severe diarrhea.  So I'm on a 10-day course of Flagyl, and the side effects are horrible!  Nausea, abdominal cramps, a feeling of the entire digestive tract spasming/burning, awful taste at all times, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, and anxiety.  And now the diarrhea is back, though not severe.  The anxiety is the worst side effect; it makes it soooo hard to deal with the nausea and weakness.  I can't even go for a walk, either, without gasping for breath. I don't know yet if this drug has cured my c. diff., since I'm on day nine of the treatment.  I'm sticking it out, but it's very difficult to continue taking this medicine.  Interestingly, I took this as a vaginal gel before with NO side effects.

Infection that causes Diarrhea - Giardiasis	LaniBoBonnie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	55-64	3/16/2010 2:35:04 AM	You must not take the generic version, only Flagyl brand has a coating on it and it is the worse tasting pill I have ever taken and impossible to take without tasting it. I have used it 3 times but the downside is that if it is not taken long enough the infection comes back and then you are back to square one. this may not happen for 3-6 mos and you might think that you have another infectuon when in reality the original one was never entirely gone. I take a probiotic in between dosages in hopes of warding off overgrowth of bad critters because the good ones have been killed off. When I finish this drug I will repopulate my intestines with a couple of kinds of probiotics. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	flagylsucks, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	45-54	3/15/2010 11:41:44 AM	I'm super happy that the BV is gone--for now, as I know it will return in a couple months.  I am actively seeking more natural treatments for sure.  I've taken the Flagyl a few times in my life, and I'm 45.  This time, I experienced fatigue, upset stomach, bloating, constant headache, and the worst--depression.  I cried over everything for a few days, became paranoid about my relationship, and was emotionally so miserable I'd almost rather have the BV!!!  WHY is there no other treatment for this condition?  Today, off the medication after stopping at day 9 of 10, am feeling gradually more normal.  It's been more than 24 hours since the last dose.  I'm just shocked that there isn't a better treatment.  SERIOUSLY????  I am appreciative that people posted here, telling of their experience so I realized I wasn't really going off the deep end, and it was being caused by a medication.  Man am I irritated!
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	5	Female	35-44	3/11/2010 10:31:31 AM	3x daily/week, had some blurred vision and it tasted terrible, but other than that cleared everything up for me. No other side effects. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	needadvicebad, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	3/8/2010 10:34:06 AM	I have took the medicine off on for 8 years. It does not work for me. I can't stand the medicine. I have now started probitics and a detoxify herbal supplement. Which seem to help after taking antibiotics for so long. Of course eventually I will have to start taking metro. again but I really hate the medicine. After having this for so long it seems imposible to finish the medicine. I am so fead up with the whole thing. Now I do believe men carry some tret of the bacteria after 8 years now my husband has the same side effects I have he has been treated numerous times. I don't think the bacteria ever really stops growing. It may go away for a week but comes right back. I would love advice because I am really very fed up.

Crohn's Disease	65-74 (Patient) 	3	1	1		65-74	3/4/2010 5:14:16 PM	By the 5th day of taking Flagyl I experienced severe pain in my legs and ended up in the ER at 2am.  I was barely able to walk and needed help to sit and to rise.  I was unable to get out of bed without help.  I stopped the med but it took almost 4 months to recover.  MD, neurologist, rheumatologist could find nothing wrong.  I know it was the flagyl and will never take it again. My husband was prescribed this medicine for diverticulitis and developed severe stomach aches and a rash across his mid-section.  These symtoms took a long time to go away.  we believe this is a very dangerous medicine.
Infection Within the Abdomen	farmer2, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	55-64	3/4/2010 2:45:36 PM	I have taking this medication over the years for different reasons and it has always worked for me. The reviews are enlighten however, they are individualize. I feel there should be another alternative offered in this new age of medicines.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	newfie60, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/3/2010 1:33:54 PM	This is the worst medication ever.   This is the second time I had to take it and will never take it again.   It makes you very very sick and I felt that my throat swelled.  I was going to go the ER but decided not to.    It is an absolute disgrace that after 20 years they have not come up with a better medication to treat Bacterial Vaginitis.    The cream form is no better.  If a male doctor had to take this they would never describe it.   I am so disgusted because my infection went away and then came back and I will never take this again.   Be careful when taking.

The flagyl gave me thrush, and a vaginal infection which made my skin on vaginal feel like it was going to fall off. It cleared my stomach pain, but the side effects were horrible. 
Infection caused by the Bacteria Anaerobes	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	2/25/2010 11:30:49 AM	Side effect: insomnia. Effects the cerebral fluids. Since I have a sleeping disorder, this is very important to me. Having trouble thinking clearly. It took me several days to realize what was happening. 
Ulcer of Duodenum caused by Bacteria Helicobacter Pylori	none, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/23/2010 1:43:57 AM	This drug has worked for me if you use it as prescribed. It tastes terrible, but most drugs do. Respect the drug and what it can do for you to make you better.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	2/20/2010 11:28:45 AM	This is day two of treatment. I have a horrible taste in my mouth that doesn't go away, a persistant headache, and very little relief of original symptoms, if any. The vomitting has stopped, mostly due to not eating since the start of treatment. The diarhea has continued even though I'm unable to eat. (Must be the liquid diet) Generally I am in less pain, as the shooting stomach pains have stopped. But I am in far more discomfort then ever, and hope to never have to take this medication again. Abdominal discomfort is worse, chest pains persist, night sweats, poor circualtion, and horrible back pains.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	2/19/2010 5:04:59 PM	Flagyl worked immediately for me which was great. However I have had to deal with the side effects of nausea and vomiting which is horrible. Im not used to dealing with side effects so it has been a bad experience. I was told to continue to take with food, but that didnt always stop the effects. Overall, it works just be aware of the side effects. 
Diverticulitis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	2/19/2010 9:11:49 AM	Have had diverticulitis for years.  Flareups seem to be more frequent.  Flagyl/Cipro has worked good in the past with few side effects.  Have been on Augmentin for throat infection which, after googling, found that other antibiotics can cause flareups of diverticulitis because they kill the &quot;good&quot; bacteria in the colon.  Am still on Augmentin so I'm not on Cipro this time around.  (Have a refillable prescription for Flagyl so I did not see doctor for this flareup.)  Will see if Flagyl will work without Cipro.  Anyone else had this problem when taking another antibiotic that caused a flareup?
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	ah0780, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	2/19/2010 3:43:58 AM	Just finished 7 day 2x day treatment yesterday and have felt worse all week on meds then before.

Diverticulitis	msg31147, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	55-64	2/14/2010 8:24:43 AM	This is the second time I have been on this drug in combination with Levaquin, the first time I could not finish the Rx due to continuous stomach discomfort. This go around I cannot again tell if my stomach pain is being caused by the drug or my condition. I have experienced the same symptoms as others have reported. Bad taste, dizziness, fever, etc.  Next time ( I hope there isn't one, and I am considering laparoscopic surgery) I will ask for another drug.  
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	tobie007, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	2/11/2010 3:22:26 AM	I was prescribed this med for 2 times daily for 7 days. The first pill I took made my face look like I layed in a tanning bed for an hour or two. I just thought it was fever from the infection and went to bed. By the second pill I knew something was wrong. I had no fever. I can't think or see straight. Today my doctor sent me to the ER for treatment. I will not take this again. If your mouth hurts or is dry, try some sherbert. The cold feels good on your mouth and throat.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	2/4/2010 6:24:43 PM	I have been on the medication for 4 days now and I've gotten a little better but still having discharge. This medicine sucks and I don't know how it's legal! After reading reviews online I now understand that I'm not the only one going insane on this drug. I haven't felt like myself since I started it. Neausea, blurred vision, no appetite, anxiety AND fatique, rapid heart beat and the worse part is the depression! I've been miserable and very sick mentally and physically. I'm generally a very happy person but this is making me irritable and sad. I'm on the verge of tears all day. This stuff better work or it won't be worth what I've gone through all week!
Sexual Transmitted Disease Exposure from Sexual Assault	Protect Yourself, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	35-44	1/27/2010 10:00:00 PM	I contracted the STD-Trich but it was not thru assault.  My prescription was 4pills/ 5 days and yes you have to take all 4 pills at the same time.  On the second day,I noticed a rash on my left bicep and disregarded it which was a bad mistake.  The very last day- 5th day- after taking meds, instantly i broke out in hives all over my body.  Itching like crazy and went to ER where they gave me a shot of the Steroid- Depomedrol and Epinephrine.  The rash started to disappear within 30 mins.  Approx 2 hours later the itching started again and the doctor suggested Benadryl to relieve the itch until I could fill the prescription.  However I did get a prescription for Atarax and Predisone for 5 days.  So please inform your dr right away if you notice any signs of allergic reactions.  Now the Trich infection has been cleared.  Also Flagyl will cause you to have severe vaginal itching... please do not rub, instead treat the itch with cream.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease	alapama, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	35-44	1/26/2010 12:29:16 PM	This medication leaves a bad taste in your mouth and causes nausea.  Definitely take with food and definitely do not drink.  It is an antibuse type of drug.
Diverticulitis	nanad, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	1/23/2010 9:22:08 PM	Horrible taste in mouth.  Nothing helps make it better.  Listlessness and achiness. Diarrhea and what feels like a yeast infection throughout entire private area. First time I had diverticulitis the MD used a different drug combo and I had no side effects.  With Flagyl I can't tell if the problem is gone because of the side effects.  When I read in the brochure it has caused cancer in lab animals, was really upset.  I'm already worried about developing colon cancer.  Will definitely ask MD for a different drug if diverticulitis returns.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	1/22/2010 12:41:45 AM	After reading these reviews Im getting worried!!  This is the end of my first day of treatment.  I have had no side effects what-so-ever, and didnt notice any taste in my mouth either.  Hope it continues...  Idk if I can go a week w/o alcohol though- and tomorrow is Friday- uh-oh!!

Diverticulitis	miamiblue, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/19/2010 6:43:21 AM	I have been on this for 6 1/2 days and I've never felt worse! I have made a good faith effort to follow the doctor's recommendation and finish this prescription of antibiotics, but just &quot;can't take it anymore!&quot; The nausea is intense, can't eat or sleep, am dehydrated because even the taste of water is horrible, feel listless and depressed... In this case, the treatment is worse than the disease... 
Diverticulitis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	1/18/2010 6:03:43 PM	Was prescibed this in combination with cypro.  500mg 4 times a day.  Stopped taking it after 1 day.  Nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, headache, metallic taste.  Stomach pain came back on day 4.  Resumed medicine but cut the dosage.  Hope this works.  I will not take this again.
Infection of a Woman's Reproductive Organs	Shimmer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	1/17/2010 3:31:04 PM	Was given this antibiotic along with doxycycline and a rocephin injection, so I am on 3 antibiotics and not sure which is actually helping but I do feel alot better after recently being diagnosed with severe cervicitis (cause unknown). I was in tremendous, unbearable pain but after 4 days on the flagyl I went for a checkup and there was no improvement in my cervix so I got the antibiotic injection rocephin and a script for doxycycline and now I'm feeling better. I guess from the combo of all 3 antibiotics. Flagyl is a little hard to swallow as it dissolves when it hits your tongue and tastes horribly. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	dmfod, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	1/17/2010 9:35:14 AM	Whatever you do don't drink alcohol with this drug - even after finishing the course. I was on 3 tablets a day for a week &amp; had some wine 30 hours after last dose. Simultaneous vomiting and diarrhea, faintness, exhaustion, aching all over, high temperature, shivering for almost 24 hours now. And even before that I had awful weepiness, bloating and stomach aches. Hope it actually works after all this!
Infection Around a Tooth	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	1/16/2010 4:56:20 PM	Took this after having a root canal to try and remove a tooth abscess. Horrible tasting, had nausea off and on for 4 days even though I did not drink alcohol and took this after a meal as recommended by the  pharmacist.  Once the pill completely dissolved in my mouth when taking with warm tea - avoid using warm water to swallow this, it was disgusting! This medicine partially but not completely resolved the infection.  Tolerated it for 4 days, but then I had diarrhea and vomiting.  Called endodontist and luckily he is going to use an alternate procedure to try and remove the infection so I can stop taking this horrible medicine.
Severe Intestinal Infection due to Entamoeba Histolytica	nadialexis, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	1/10/2010 6:55:30 PM	The doctor at the emergency room where I was treated prescribed Flagyl and Cipro which naturally freaked me out because Cipro is prescribed for anthrax poisoning. I still don't have the exact bacterial culprit as I have not recieved the lab reports yet. My stomach is still upset yet I have finished the course of meds.It's been 3 days since I finished the course of meds but I am still very sick to my stomach all the time. My stool is dark and powdery I'm wondering if it's the meds or the illness.

Yesterday was my last day and my lasting side effect is fatigue. But it's more like exhaustion. I'm so tired it's unbelievable. It does leave a bad taste in your mouth if you leave it on your tongue. I didn't get sick or lose my appetite. But I did feel dizzy and a bit disoriented at times. Also, I got sores on the roof of my mouth.

Although i took Flagyl and Cipro during my last diverticulitis attack and it apparently did not work because I ended up in the hospital on an IV drip. I hate the way it makes me feel...actually i feel awful on it. But, it can work and my doctor seems to feel it is the only drug that works..of course in combo with Cipro. Any advice?
Infection Around a Tooth	TheWeen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	45-54	11/21/2009 7:19:40 PM	I had a root canal and was given this for a week afterward in case of infection along with penicillan. I've never used this before and I never will again. I took it every 6 hours. At first it was just the bad taste in my mouth and throat almost continously, then on day 5 I became nauseated, dizzy and just all around felt rotten. I am in perimenepause and it caused those symptoms to come back on me. I haven't been on it for a week now and I still have an upset stomach and nasty taste in my mouth, kinda like mild heartburn. If it doesn't get any better I'm going to my doctor. I talked to a nurse friend of mine who said there is a better alternative to this but it's more expensive so it's rarely given. If you are told you need this, ask for something else that does the same. There are too many people who have trouble with this. I hate it and I'm afraid it has caused me stomach or gall bladder problems. I got dizzy and my BP dropped last night and I've been sick to my stomach all day. I burp and pass gas all the time and my abdomen makes all kinds of noises. It has really messed up my GI tract. Sorry for rambling but it's just very upsetting. It works for sure, but proceed with caution!

I guess it's better than the awful stomach pains i was feeling.

None of the metallic aftertaste.  Bread did the trick and kept the powder from touching anything until it hit where it was supposed to go.  Great tip, great nurse!

I've had migraines, but nothing close to last night.  I have only been on Flagyl for 2 days and I will NEVER take it again.  After the headache and nausea finally went away I was left feeling like I had been run over.  I am also feeling depressed, probably because the pain was so severe.

I am on my second complete day and I have to say that the first was the worse. Today I have felt alot better. I did figure out that you dont want to take this with anything with carboniation. I have been taking it with tea and the taste is not there. But other then that everything has been good.

My GI doc (he's great!) put me on Flagyl 3Xday long term due to recurring pouchitis. After about 7 or so months, I started to get neuropathy of the toes and feet (bilateral). It got worse. My neorologist tested for nerve pinch (no) then for vitamin deficiency. (not that, either). Seems it might very well be an uncommon side effect of Flagyl use long term. I've been off it for 5 days and see my GI doc next week. Anyone else get neuropathy (numbness) while taking Flagyl?My pharmacist suggested coating pill with a little butter or margerine. No bad taste!

It worked well treating the condition, but for 10 days straight I had nausea, gas, headaches, diarhea after eating, body aches and it was wicked. i forced myself to finish taking it, I hope I never have another bout of diverticulitis, but I would definitely ask for something else to take that wouldn't make me feel so sick to my stomach.

Horrible taste, and disolves immediately. Wondering why drug company couldn't use capusles or coating?  Also, nasea became more and more severe.  By fourth day got sick thinking about taking it.  I guess if you need it you need it, but definitely the most troublesome medication I've ever taken.
Crohn's Disease	mtuttob, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	19-24	9/5/2009 3:55:19 PM	After having a Crohns flareup I was put on Flagyl.  After taking this medication for more than 3 months I started noticing numbness of the fingertips and feet.  The numbness in my feet makes it painful to walk and sleep at night.  I reported this to my physician, we discussed B12 deficiency, but my B12 levels were normal.   A week later I complained again and my physician advised me to stop the Flagyl.  I was told that this side effect usually occured in a small percentage, but now I'm concerned if this numbness that continues weeks after stopping the drug if it is going to be permanent.

It did help clear up the pneumonia that I was fighting at the time.As for the HORRIBLE taste I did what we used to do for the dog meds...I covered it in peanut butter and was finally able to take the pill without feeling like vomiting before even getting it to my mouth!

Luckily, I didn't have as many. I did take the medication with milk each day to reduce the bad taste. The first two days, I was more tired than usual, but after two days I was fine. The medication did seem to work, but I did get a yeast infection from the medication.

I have had an intestinal infection (either bacteria or parasites - wide range of tests all negative) for 3 months with diarrhea, blood in the stool, cramping and general yucky feeling.  Four days into Flagyl, and my symptoms have disappeared.  Side effects small- a little dizzyness. (My infection may have been brought on by long term use of Oracea - ironic!)  Do take a probiotic with your antibiotics!

The side effects were a disaster. My doctor refused to switch me, and if she ever prescribes it again, I will be tempted to switch physicians! It was prescribed b/c of abdominal pain. I would rather put up with the pain than take it again. Bitter pill indeed! Plus, it didn't work. Avoid this pill!

I fist was only taking penicillin and it was not working very well so they gave me the flagyl,within one day the pain and swelling was going away. The only down side is the BAD TASTE it leaves thank goodness it is a short time.

I did have some fatigue and metallic taste in my mouth. It took 3-4days to work for me. But it did completely clear up.

I was prescribed Cipro and Flagyl.  Cipro was fine.  Flagyl had many side effects.  The metallic taste was the worst for me.  Along with the taste I had headaches, exhaustion, listlessness.  I couldn't finish the prescription.  The sight of the pill make me queezy.
Other	sdavislpn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	19-24	7/15/2009 10:04:28 AM	I was prescribed this medication for an antibiotic-related CDIFF infection (Clindamycin). I was told to take the Flagyl 500mg three times a day for 10 days. I am on my 9th day, and I am MISERABLE! The side effects of this drug are very unpleasant. The first few days of taking it, I noticed the metallic taste in my mouth- constantly., then came the dark urine (looked almost green and brown colored), then about the 4th day I started getting sooooo tired, and fatigued with the simplest of tasks (and by the way, I am a HEALTHY 24 year old woman who is VERY active).  by the fifth day, I started noticing a few mouth ulcers, blister-like in appearance and white coloration on my tongue, but no pain in my mouth. I do have slight nausea if i take the pill on an empty stomach.  Also, not to mention, while on this drug (day 5) I acqured an ear infection and viral laryngitis which resolved with azithromycin... this later moved to my sinus, and resulted in a severe head cold which lead me dependent on Afrin and Pseudoephedrine to be able to breathe normally through my nose. I'm not sure if this secondary infection of my respiratory system (and ear and larynx) is realted to having been on the Flagyl, but I think it is.... I did not have any of the symptoms of being sick before I was on this drug... Over all, It seems to have worked for me (my last day of taking it is tomorrow) but i would HIGHLY urge my Dr to prescribe me something else if I need this drug again in the future.  OH, and by the way, I would STRONGLY URGE ANYONE WHO TAKES THIS DRUG TO TAKE IT WITH LACTOBACILUS ACIDOPHILIOUS tablets (the active normal bacteria found in the colon)- it is in yogurt too., it helps fight off the bad bacteria and prevent yeast infections. Hope this helps!  Good luck.  
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	2	Female	19-24	7/14/2009 9:57:38 PM	I'm really glad that it worked, but the side effects were awful.  Halfway through, I developed a severe aversity to the pill.  Just looking at it, or thinking I'd have to take it, and I'd feel nauseous.  Was feeling nausea and loss of appetite early on, realized it might be associated with the meds, and looked it up just tonight.  Uggh.  Wish I'd been prescribed an alternative.
Diverticulitis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	35-44	7/13/2009 2:01:45 PM	OMG - I was glad to get on here and read other reviews because I thought it was just me.  I have been sick to my stomach the entire time I have been on this.  I actually feel worse than my original symptoms made me feel.  I am so tired, nauseous and listless I have taken time off work which is very rare for me.  I would definitely reqest something different if there is a next time.  And like everyone else mentioned the taste is horrific.

I had not symptoms from the infection.  I didn't realize I was having side effects until I was almost finished with the pills. I went online to read about side effects and then it started making sense.  I had a really bad headache all the time. I had horrible sores in my mouth. I had that nauseous feeling, too.  I would ask for a different med next time.

The good thing about this med is that i started taking it Monday night and its now Thursday and my infection is pretty much cleared up so it works fast. However, this time around (this is my 2nd time taking it) my side effects are more noticeable. The taste is absolutely awful and i find myself having and upset stomach and terrible headaches. The good thing is i don't have an appetite so maybe i'll lose a couple of pounds

I was even able to eat just a cereal bar or take it an hour after a large meal and my stomach was fine.  I experienced no side effects.  You MUST take with with soda, juice, or something else flavored to avoid the AWFUL taste.  The pill cleared up my infection within a couple days of starting.

Although this time around I am having more side effects then the other two times. My urine is darker, I'm a bit fatigued and my appitite is gone. I think it's worth it though, the medication only has to be taken 2x a day for a week.

At first I had terrible nausea and vomiting. Stuck with it and it has helped my diarrhea.I am still having a raw sore throat due to swallowing the pills and dizziness. I have to take them 3x a day for 10 days. But the other side effects went away. I would say take with a meal. Eat half of what you are eating and then take the pill then finish your meal. Helped me a lot. Also lots of water or gatorade.

They put me on a course of flagyl to distroy the c-diff infection. I took the horrific course of it with atleast ten aweful side effects. Nausea, feelings of doom, headaches, stuufy nose, body aches, mood swings, etc... just to name a few. I have been off of it now for 4 days and all of my symptoms have come back. They said the next course of action is vancomycin because this is common to happen. Why not skip this aweful drug and go straight to a med that actually helps. I will never take this drug again. Did you know it had been removed from the market several years back for being carcinogenic. That is scary to me.

I now have it and their is no cure for it, it is a horrible disease, so please be aware of this disease while on flagyl. on the up side it did clear up the intestinal infection, but if I had been aware of the side effects I would have asked for another type of antibiotic.

Either an infection within the abdomen and or a parasite we thought.  I like this idea of sharing ideas, others can compare notes.

I finished 2 days ago after taking 3 500mg pills a day for 5 days, then 2 a day for 5 days. I had clostridium dificile. That developed after taking Keflex for 10 days. It was the worst diarrhea ever. Lost 5% of my weight. No problem staking the pills except the taste.

I'm on day 3 and still have symptoms, again unlike the other reviews that stated they were clearing up after 2+ days.  The metallic taste doesn't really bother me as I've taken a medication that has had a similar taste and it can easily be dealt with.  I would say if it hasn't cleared by medication day 5, I'm callin the doc.

It turns out I don't have giardia and my doc told me to quit taking the med because I have been feeling awful! Since starting it, I've been dizzy, headachy and nauseated. I hate this medication and am SO happy I don't have to take it anymore. The diarrhea is subsiding, but I think that's because the virus is running its course. Flagyl stinks (and tastes horrible)!

Cause severe fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion and anxiety.  Numbness and tingling in legs and hands.  I was unable to function mentally, physically until I stopped medication.

However, I have had the worst side affects ever, and talking to a few friends that have been prescribed this before, they have said the same. Nausea, dizzyness, acheing, headache, sore throat, metallic tastes, other stomach upset, no appetite, and overall just feeling horrible. I've not even completed half my prescribed amount. Definantly calling my doctor about it.

Infection Within the Abdomen	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	4	Male	65-74	5/4/2009 4:44:42 PM	Am on day 5 of 10 day treatment.  Side effects get worse daily.  Dizziness, headache, loss of stamina, shortness of breath.  Drug may be working but side effects are terrible.  You'd think they could coat the drug so as not to dissolve in mouth leaving bad taste.
Crohn's Disease	las,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		5/4/2009 11:03:52 AM	I experienced burning, spoke with the doctor, apparently a side effect is burning in the nerve endings...I would not recommend taking this drug..I know I won't ever again....This experience was in November 2001....The burning sensation was on the face, back, legs all over experienced....I'd say be very cautious..

Anyone out there that has found that to be true?

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	4/19/2009 12:49:19 PM	I was put on flagyl for a bacterial infection. I was on it for only 7 days.I got really sick while on flagyl. I was sick mostly in the morning with nausea and could not eat without vomiting. I also had bad headaches, was very dizzy. I went to my doctor because I was out of work because of this stuff. She had me finish the medicine. The infection did go way and worked. It also tasted horrible no matter what I did I could not get the taste off my tongue. I would never take this stuff again. I felt worse while on it. I did some research and found out why i was getting so sick in the morning.The doctor told me not to have alcohol while taking this but she forgot to tell me that everything has some form of alcohol, including shampoo,condtioner,shaving cream,toothpaste,and deorderen, pretty much any hair protects. When i limited using these products I felt better. I was not as sick. I used johnson johnsons head to toe wash and used kids crest toothpaste. I also stayed away from foods contaning any viniger, and alcohol. I used google to look up ingridents in foods and I learned alot. I hope this helps.
Diverticulitis	Lesson Learned, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	4/18/2009 4:37:09 PM	The first time I took this was in 2005. I recall the metallic taste and maybe a little stomach discomfort. This month (April 2009) taking it was WORSE THAN THE CONDITION being treated. It made me so queasy and feverish-feeling that I rarely left my bed. I walked bent over and had to be driven to the doctor's office by the end of the seven days! AVOID FLAGYL LIKE THE PLAGUE. I'll never, ever take this again!

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Allergic?, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	25-34	3/31/2009 8:23:25 PM	I took this medication for Bacterial Vaginosis.  After 2 days, odor and discharge is gone, however I have to stop taking because both hands and left foot have gone numb.  I have not taken for three days, and still my fingers are numb.  Also the same day that I stopped the medication, I have developed what resembles an upper respiratory infection.  This is weird because usually before I have any kind of chest cold it starts in my sinuses and I know that it is progressing.  I stopped taking the medication on Sunday morning (did not take Sunday's dose because numbness occurred during night on Saturday) and had Upper Respiratory problem by Sunday evening. I had no cold before taking this medication.  Could be unrelated, doctor is not sure.  Will start a different medication tomorrow.  I have never had a reaction to any medication that I have taken except for this one.

It has caused me to have headaches, loss of appitite, full feeling for hours after eating, feels like an increase of body temp without a fever. I found it easier to take the pill if I coated it in honey and COLD water. That way there is no horrid taste.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	25-34	3/18/2009 9:45:44 AM	The taste is awful, easier to take with yogurt or pudding. It dissolves after a second on your tongue and no matter how far back i put it, the taste makes me shiver and lasts for a few seconds. Also gives me a massive headache the first 24 hrs, with nausea and dizziness. I had my boyfriend pick me up from work bc I was afraid to drive. Have been a little tired also. It absolutely worked to clear my infection and I am now on it for possible Chrohn's disease and have had the same effects. I skipped one day bc I wasnt on a normal schedule and forgot, and when i started it again i had the terrible headache again for the first day. I called the pharmacist and he said it is fine to take pain meds 30 min after taking the flagyl. My recommendation: start on a weekend so in case you are dizzy, nausous, or get a headache you wont be trapped at work like I was. Take with meals, and use pudding or yogurt to swallow, and drink a lot of water (I have been parched).
Infection Around a Tooth	Shay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/18/2009 8:43:53 AM	I have never in my life taken any medicine that caused mental/emotional problems as a side effect. I wasn't even able to finish the second day of medicine. I was screaming and yelling at everyone. I felt depressed. I was in the process of kicking my husband out of the house. When I stopped taking the medicine the infection was still here but I was happy to have my sanity. The medicine caused me to have allot of nausea also. Drinking milk helps with that.
Diverticulitis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	55-64	3/14/2009 2:07:10 PM	I've also taken Flagyl for bacterial vaginosis, but this time with an increased dosage dor diverticulitis I developed tinlging sensations in my hands and feet.  I continued to take the drug and awoke one morning with a terrible headache at the base of my skull.  I became extremely dizzy and then I realized that my symptoms were an allergic reaction to the drug.  I called my doctor who advised me to never take this drug again.

Severe Bloody Diarrhea from Antibiotics	toni, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/9/2009 12:41:03 PM	I'm taking this med along with Cipro, the Dr is unsure what's really wrong with me~how nice is that. This med has a horrible metallic taste that just lingers on your tongue! No matter how I've tried tricking it by taking it with liquid in my mouth then popping the pill &amp; downing with more liquid it doesn't get the taste gone, it's awful. The diarrhea did bulk up a lot, but I'm still not solid. It's ok other than the taste &amp; after taste. 
Diverticulitis	Freedom1960, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	3/1/2009 7:16:32 PM	I took the usual combination of Flagyl/Cipro for Diverticulitis and it worked fine with little side effects....WHILE I took it. The day I finished off the Flagyl, started the day after the cipro as I never start two meds at once in case I need to know which caused the allergic reaction. The day I stopped Flagyl started diahrrea for a full week, but made me feel much better. 4 days later something is coming back after the 7 day course of treatment. I'm hoping this is merely an intestinal bug,but......

My experience with the medication was not all satisfying because my symptoms came back within a few months, and it seems as my symptoms were worse than before(talking about a nerve-wrecking situation)!
Infection of a Woman's Reproductive Organs	 Female 	3	1	1	Female		2/26/2009 3:48:16 PM	Re: the Cipro/Vagyl combo. Cipro is the one antibiotic I cannot tolerate, as it causes me to itch all over, sometimes breaking out in boils around the neck and head. So that's probably the half of the combo causing the patient's itching.

I hate the taste but realized on my second go around of the drug that it is all about technique in swallowing.  It does make me tired and somehow, I actually get to go #2 which is normally a problem. I do hate the drug but it works.  So I'll take it.

Other	Sharon, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	45-54	2/20/2009 5:19:08 PM	I am currently taking Flagyl/Cipro combination for Urinary Tract Infection that got into my baldder.  I was not sure which medication was causing this nasty, bitter taste that I have had in my mouth since I started taking these medications, but after reading these reviews, I am sure it is the flagyl.  I am having a side effect thhat no one else has mentioned; after taking the medications for three days, I began to itch all over my body; not severe enough to stop the medication, but just enough to irritate me.  The severe pain I was having did get better after one day of taking the medication, this is the fifth day, and I still have some pain, but it is/did work. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/7/2009 12:04:57 AM	I really have not noticed any metallic taste? I'm not as hungry as usual, but what's wrong with that? I have had no N/V or anything nearly compared to the other post. Medicine works differently for each person. Been on med for 3 days and things have already got better. 
Other	DES, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	2/5/2009 11:18:01 PM	I've taken the last pill 24 hours ago and feel better. The mild pain I had prior had gone away. I would advise anyone to take this with a glass of milk as it has a HORRID taste as it disolves really quick. Definatly keep your stomach full, even throughout the day as I had a stomach ache if I didn't have enough to eat when I took the medication. Keep gum or mints on hand as I experienced a strong metalic taste in my mouth about 1/2 way through my perscription. I also became really thirsty and needed a class of juice or something close to my bedside because I woke up parched in the night. Overall, side effects were tollerable knowing that I would be feeling better. I hope this helps others.

In addition, it has caused me to be nauseous on occasion. Will not take it again.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	ijb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	1/4/2009 2:08:56 PM	Used the 0.75% gel for 5 days to clear up Bacterial Vaginosis. Symptoms did not start until after I was done taking it. Severe anxiety and feeling of unease, jittery, dizziness, nausea, tingling in feet, muscle twitches, loose stools, hot flashes. Three weeks later still have tingling and twitches. Did not drink alcohol, but used mouthwash (did not realize it had alcohol in it). Who knew gel would cause these symptoms. The BV went away but I would never take this medicine again, who knows how long I will deal with these side effects.

The only problems I am having are joint pain in my left arm from the shoulder to my fingers and I find myself confused and unsteady for the first hour or so after taking it. Joint pain lasts.

Our PH or something in our body does not agree. The result of this is a fishy, whitish colored discharge~Bacterial Vaginosis. The medicine is the worst tasting pill there is. But if you put it in the middle of your tongue and take it down with milk it's not so bad. It did relieve the problem. I only took mines for 3 1/2 days instead of the full 7, and it still worked. The gel vaginal form of this drug was $80 here in Florida. So it is more cost efficient/cheap.

After vaginal hysterectomy I developed an infection. Prior to Flagyl I felt good except for infection discharge. By the second dose I had a migraine and couldn't tolerate light, nausea, exhaustion.....days later while finishing prescription continued stomach pains and cramps...like uterine but I no longer have a uterus, back ache, joint and muscle pain, can't get out of the recliner, dizziness, nearly faint if I walk, woke up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. When I got up in the AM my heart rate shot up again and I could feel it beating...creepy, felt like I just went for a run I was breathing so hard and heart pounding. Have had constant bouts of chills and sweats but no fever, my temp is perfect every time I check it. Plus I have been so depressed and sometimes just break down in tears...I thought I was losing my mind. When I called the nurses line one told me to go immediately to the emergency room for heart tests but I started researching instead and found this wonderful site where all my awful symptoms are described in detail over and over. Very relieved I am not alone! I am a very fit 32 yr old not the 85 yr old I have felt like since starting Flagyl. NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN

However, the taste is horrible and I have been having heart palpatations this entire week I've been on it.  I also have had some nausea and dizziness, but the palpatations are the most irritating! AND, palpatations is not on the side effect list.  I have never had them THIS BAD before, until I started taking Flagyl.

I felt worse on the medication and after 7 days, I am still in the same condition, possibly worse.  I now have clumps of blood instead of diarrhea.  I stayed nauseated the entire time, which I did not have a problem with prior to taking the med.
Other	nothappy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	10/14/2008 10:43:05 AM	I experienced severe side effects w/cramping, dizziness, chills, sweats, joint pain.  By day 3, had to have CT scan due to feeling of appendicitis.  Joint pain made me think I had arthritis.  I felt worse with it than without it.  Not recommended.  Now I have a cancer risk due to CT scan w/contrast.  Just stop taking it.  Not worth the risk.
Infection Within the Abdomen caused by Clostridium Bacteria	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	35-44	10/13/2008 7:15:33 PM	I had surgery, and the incision got infected.  I took an antibiotic that cleared up that infection, but it got rid of the good bacteria, leaving me open to another infection.  I have the same side effects as listed above.  I talked to my doctor today, and he cut the dose in half. He told me there is no alternative. It has helped, but I am still miserable.  The dry heaves in the middle of the night are the worst.

It helps a little but I cannot wait for these last 3 pills to be done. I had severe vomiting on the 3rd day.Feel tired all the time and bloated and I am a very active person. Hope I never have to take this again. Good thing I read thisI knew about not having a drink for 3 daysbut I did not know the consequeneces, last thing I want to do is be sick ince I am done with this.

Doesn't make it any better but at least I know what's causing it.  Also is causing bloating, stomach cramps, flatulance, dizziness, headache, insomnia and some palpitations.  This is only day 4 of a 14 day prescription, I am not having fun, however the nasty vaginal discharge has gone away so I shall continue to the bitter (and I DO mean bitter end). I don't want to create a super bug.

I have stomach problems so they give me drugs that give me worse stomach problems. I have felt terrible throughout this course including dizziness, nausea, lose stool, sleeplessness and loss of appetite. These better work because I feel worse on them than I do without.

It worsened my diarrhea and made me incredibly dizzy. I kept falling over and losing my balance and having strange moments where I would just black out for a millisecond. Though it may have cleared up the infection in my intestines I really regret taking this medication. From now on I am going to tell doctors that I am allergic to it.

I hate the metallic taste.  It makes you feel sick and nauseated.  I noticed this time that I have strong dark urine, loss of appetite and sleeplessness.  I read one person review were they mentioned have swollen ankles and feet, which I experienced this time, but I am not sure if it was due the medicine or the fact that I just started a new work out regimen.  The medicine works, so if you can bare it should complete the dose, but one thing I hate most is that is causes a yeast infection.  So now I am treating myself for yeast!

I have been on flagyl for 5 days, I forgot to take it on time this morning, and it is the best I have felt in weeks.  Nausea, I don't want to eat or drink anything or get out of bed, I think that I was taking pain pills to cover up the symptoms of flagyl, not my condition, b/c I haven't needed any.  I want to stop taking it but am apprehensive that the original pain will return.  Today they told me they were unsure of my diagnosis, but all the possibilities are treated with flagyl....

Had bloating, pain with pressure, and loose bowels.  Took this and felt better after just one pill.  I am on 3X/day for 10 days.  Have had no side effects at all and FEEL BETTER THAN I HAVE FOR YEARS.  Bitter to swallow but I take it with and without food and once I swallow it I had had nothing but better guts and no bloating.  Surprised about all the problems others are having, maybe you only feel moved to write a review if you have bad results.

On the downside, I have severe swelling in my feet and knees and cannot wear shoes and struggle to walk. My doctor prescribed Predisone to decrease the swelling because she wanted me to stay on Flagyl. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/8/2008 2:38:49 PM	I've used this drug many times. I've no nausea. I have BMs more frequent, but not actual diarhea as described. It tastes bad, so don't drink it with an acidic beverage. Remember no alcohol even in mouthwash. This usually clears up any vaginal infection I've taken it for, and lasts several months before a reoccurance. I've noticed some hair loss---just more shedding than usual---but I don't see that as a side effect. I do have a thirst.I'm very happy I can take this antibiotic. I am allergic to amoxicillan.

The first 3 to 4 days on cipro/flagyl combo, while on liquid diet, I find it helps to drink LOTS of water with it, and to drink with apple juice, coke or something else with some flavor to drown the foul taste.

The drug has had terrible side effects.  Rapid Heart beat and trouble breathing.  Stomach cramping and contractions.  Numbness in limbs and severe back pain.  She was having a such a hard time breathing, we had to call an ambulance and she was admitted to the hospital.  Also, the severity went in waves so she would recover and then worsen again.  We were not told of the side effects

Infection caused by Trichomoniasis Protozoa	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	4/3/2008 3:12:12 AM	This is my second round of this medication,(7days 2x) I had to take it last year and had a relapse. Last year I remember the side effects being much worse, this time hasnt been so bad only slight nausea, the metalic taste isnt as bad this time around either.originaly taking it i didnt want to eat anything because the nausea was so severe.Be sure to eat plunty before taking the this medication along with drinking lots of fluids, i recommend taking it with tea or something flavored because it disapates quickly, and will leave a nasty taste in your mouth. My Husband had to take just 4 pills of 500mg being 2grams at once.

Immediately I went to the doctor where she perscribed flagyl for me. I had to take this pill 7 days 2x a day-first day i had a headache and stomach cramps. Second day only pm diarrhea! Other than that no other side effects-the pills taste horrible! Ive found that if I take them with juice its ok-also i take them with food-that helps alot! I would highly recommend this medication. The results speak for themselves.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	3/12/2008 6:22:36 PM	Thi medicine is horrible to be on. I hear it's suppossed to work wonderful, but honestly the infection I had was not as bad as this treatment. I have been vomiting, dizzy had a headache and aches the entire time I have been on it. My neuropothy has also worsened and, being diabetic, it has sent my blood sugars on a roller-coaster. I will go to great lengths to avoid EVER taking this again!!!! Ask your Dr. for another choice.

Other	65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	65-74	3/8/2008 6:06:27 PM	DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG FOR ANY EXTENDED PERIOD! I have permanent, irreversible, very painful nerve damage from metronidazole. I was not warned about the peripheral polyneuropathy (loss of sensation in feet, legs, and hands, constant pain, plus shooting shock-like pains)that started after 10 months on Flagl and forced me to retire on disability after 12 months because I couldn't even type or write.   The condition got progressively worse as I innocently continued to take it 3 times a day and, in fact, it was given to me 3 times a day during the week I was an inpatient at Mass. General Hospital on the Neurology Service as they tried in vain to figure out the cause of the worsening peripheral polyneuropathy.  By the time I found information about this side effect on the Web, I had been taking Flagyl for about 22 months.  The nerve damage is permanent.

This medication IS toxic tasting, especially with water. So I've taken to downing it with iced coffee, followed by a chocolate chip cookie - no problem ! The bellyaching about the taste is ridiculous, since it started reducing my bellyache on day 2 !!! We all react to medications differently, but in my case the cost/ benefit is no contest for the 2 weeks I'm to be on this. I hope that your results are as dramatic.
Infection caused by the Parasite Balantidium		5	2	3			2/28/2008 2:40:11 PM	I had intense stomach pain due to a bacterial infection. With in a couple of days, the pain was gone, but the side effects of the drug are horrid.

I will avoid this drug if possible, however, it has gotten rid of my  infection.

I am considering calling the dr. tomorrow and getting something else (today is Sunday).  Will have them put on my chart not to give me this medicine again.
Other	midwaybrit, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	3	Male	45-54	2/13/2008 1:38:52 AM	It's all been said before. Was given this to clear up a C-Diff issue caused by Clyndamiacin which was taken to clear MRSA infection. Even though the stool samples tested negative twice for C-Diff after one day of taking this the symptoms eased.Don't even smell alcohol, not that you'd want to !! The metallic taste in my mouth has put me off eating, some foods taste worse than others. It has helped a tad to drink Pro Biotic drinks and Yoghourts.Never take this medication on an empty stomach.I also have Periphial Neuropathy, which this drugs seems to aggravate. Plus I have had bad flu'ish body aches, especially at night.Overall the drug is effective, my worry is..at what cost ?

Made me gag and left a terrible taste in my mouth.  But in 7 days my infection was gone.  I did take alcohol while using and noticed no side effects.  After my 7 days, the taste stayed in my mouth for another 3-4 days.  Also had trouble sleeping despite being dead tired.  Stared at the ceiling all night.  Asked my doctor to find another medicine for my next attack and he prescribed Avelox.

It has made my discharge change colors, but I just got off my period, so it could be excess blood exiting.  I have had a loss in my appitite, headaches, stomach pain, and nausea.  I DO NOT like the taste.  I can taste it for hours after taking it.  I couldn't harly sleep at night because my stomach would feel like jello, and then the stomach pain.  i'm not sure if it cured the infection or not.  Today is the 6th day on it.  I have one more day, then going back to the doctor to see if it helped.  I was reading and you are not supposed to see a difference in your discharge, so it kinda worries me.  But I guess I will see.
Crohn's Disease	nahant, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	45-54	1/23/2008 11:29:47 AM	I dont know if its the Flagyl or not, but I have been experiencing severe joint/muscle pain.  Almost as if I badly sprained my wrists, ankles and knees.  I do agree with the metallic taste.  The medicine does work, but I now feel like I am 90 years old.  Everything hurts.  Does anyone else have this problem with Flagyl?

Diverticulitis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/21/2008 7:51:16 PM	i just finished a 10 Flagyl/Cippro combo and had NO adverse side effects. The pain diminished after 2 days and was gone after 5 days. I drank nothing but a couple cups of coffee in the morning and nothing but water the rest of the day. I did notice the metalic taste to the water but no effect on food. I am glad i didn't read all the bad reviews b4 hand or i possibly would've asked for something else
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	babyz1225, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	19-24	1/20/2008 4:55:24 PM	OMG this medicine is horrible. It treated the infection but it caused so many other problems that it wasn't worth taking. Severe nausea, metalic taste for hours after taking, bad taste while swallowing pill, vomitting...truly horrible. It made functioning normally very difficult and that is a huge problem with an infant son. I will refuse to take this medication again ever and deffinately never recommend it.

HATE TAKING IT.  Hard to swallow, horrible taste, awful heartburn but I understand its a great drug.  I agree with all negative comments already posted.

Didn't know that was an issue until I reviewed drug on Webmd...very dizzy, nauseated and not pleased! still have vaginosis

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	25-34	12/17/2007 11:30:58 AM	This medicine is hard to swallow.  It gets stuck in my throat and leaves an awful chalky taste in my mouth.  Since starting this drug I have had a yeast infection, which has since cleared up, and heartburn.  I have also experienced sleeplessness.
Diverticulitis	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Male	35-44	12/12/2007 8:08:12 PM	This is the second time I have used the flagyl/cipro combination and have had good results. I haven't had any alcohol, so that hasn't been an issue and I haven't experienced the other side effects that I've seen listed here. 
Infection that causes Diarrhea - Giardiasis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	12/10/2007 6:22:50 PM	Quick, steady improvement of long-standing symptoms.  Inexpensive.  Some reflux with this drug.
Infection caused by Trichomoniasis Protozoa	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	12/9/2007 11:34:38 AM	I was 7w5d pregnant when my doctor prescribed this to me and 3 days after starting it, I experienced a miscarriage. Personally, I think that is the worst side effect

Infection that causes Diarrhea - Giardiasis	Chip, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	55-64	12/4/2007 10:09:59 AM	I have been taking Flagyl for two months and I, like other reviewers, consider it the most unpleasant drug I have ever taken.  I'm at the point now of diminishing benefits, where the side effects of the drug are at least as bad as those associated with the underlying condition.  Among the side effects - sour/slimy taste in mouth, fatigue, occasional queasiness, change in food/drink preferences.  As for alcohol consumption, I have been a beer lover for many years.  Now I not only can't stomach the taste, but have no desire to drink it.  As I understand it, the warning against alcohol consumption is because some individuals, while taking the drug, will have a violent reaction if they drink alcohol.  With others, such as myself, this is not a problem.  The problem is that you no longer have any desire to drink.  Not altogether a bad thing, as the &quot;cocktail hour&quot; is now open for other activities, like contemplating how much longer you might have to take this awful medication.

This occured 3days after I completed the flagyl. I was hospitalized for 5days. A very rare and nearly fatal reaction!
Other	Mel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	25-34	11/28/2007 10:15:59 PM	I was prescribed flagyl and cipro for a bowel infection- Flagyl was the worst drug i have ever taken! for me at least, the side effects were severe- I had the most severe heart burn i have ever experienced, i could hardly eat or drink, i felt nauseous, headaches. In all the drug made me feel worse than the infection, it worked to clear up my infection, but if i am ever prescribed flagyl again i will request an alternate drug due to my side effects
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	11/22/2007 12:18:58 PM	My Dr. gave me this in combination with Cipro for what he suspects was rotavirus (severe vomiting and diarrhea).  After a day and a half on it I've had no problems and am feeling much better.  Not having any of the bad taste side effects that others are reporting.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	11/17/2007 12:38:07 PM	When the doctor first prescribed the medicine, she warned me that I would not be able to drink alcohol while on it.  That was fine.  When I picked it up from the pharmacy, though, the pharmacist told me of the multiple other side effects it had.  It was absolutely disgusting to take.  It was very powdery and tasted horrible.  It made my mouth and throat very dry and my saliva taste bad, especially in the morning.  It also gave me some stomach aches and made me moody.  Hopefully it fully cleared up my infection because if not, it would not be worth it at all.  I would probably request I different drug if possible next time.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Taylor1970, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	35-44	11/12/2007 2:51:16 PM	The medicine is horrible, tastes bad and makes you feel very sick. Can not drink any alcohol while taking this medicine because it is a antibuse drug.  I have had this bacteria off and on for over 7 years and I am getting very tired of taking the same medicine to just have to take again.  But you can tell a big difference after just one day of taking it, but there has to be something else out there that works!!!

Other	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	10/28/2007 11:54:33 AM	I experienced jittery feelings while on this medicine; almost palpitation-like. Also, my urine became very dark.

I was glad when the medication was over but I think it did what it was suppose to do, although if I ever have this same problem I would like to be recommended a different prescription.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	joie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	10/25/2007 6:01:23 PM	I was given this med in the past and I became very Ill after taking it, so when my Dr gave it to me again, I informed him of this problem. I was told that it could have been caused by my perfume. I took the pills again and the problem was worse. I vomited after 10 min. and continued to do so for the next hour. The pills came up as well. I called my doctor and they said that because I had a rum with coke two days prior was the reason this happened. I will never take this drug again, but am still dealing with the vaginosis and cant take it any more. My Dr said there is no other alternative for me, but I cant help but think that he is wrong. Please tell me there is a choice.Thank you Jo

On a 3x daily / 10 day dosage. I already have intense abdominal pain and Flagyl creates nausea. Taking Viccodine for pain but can't while working. Half way done, hope I never have to take this stuff again. The cure is almost as bad as the symptoms.
