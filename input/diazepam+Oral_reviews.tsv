I was able to controll it and function in my daily routines. Thank you for the discovery.. I am now able to keep it under control by focusing on a specific direction, stay calm and take my meds, count to 20 and move slowly until Im certain its passed. I carry my Diazepam with me where ever I go, just incase because this condition can occur whenever it wants. Scary, but managable. I DO recommend for anyone with this awful condition. J

Anxious	BarneyFife, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	3/5/2012 6:04:12 PM	Years ago I was prescribed 5mg 3 times per day for acute anxiety and depression related to 'adjustment to adult life'.  I took Valium for about 3 months, then weened myself off.  It was as if a switch had been thrown, turning off my panic and turning on simple normalcy.  I credit Valium for saving my life.  In recent years I have used it during episodes of acute lower back spasm, and once again it has come to the rescue.  I use it only for the purpose intended and for the minimum length of time required for resolution of the problem.  Haven't noticed any negative side effects other than a mild sedation which is a good thing during a panic attack.  In my experience, this is one of those rare chemicals I can call a 'wonder drug', but it must be used appropriately, following the recommendations of a doctor or WebMD or the PDR.  Don't take it lightly.

Yes it has helped somewhat but it makes me depressed/crying spells. I only take half of a 5mg 3x,s day because 5mg puts me to sleep.I've taken this for 1 month now and it has helped me somewhat.I sure know when its about time to take another because I get depressed and cry over nothing. I told the doctor and he keeps telling me to take a whole one 3 times aday.I say I sleep too much to do that. I'm hoping soon this goes away or does it? I wonder...

Because I took it for a couple of years I need to taper off slowly..and diazepam is preferred for that. I'm slowly tapering down and it will take another 6 months until I'm done. CAution to all who take benzoid drugs. They are extremely habit forming and affect the nervous system. If you've taken them for an extended time do not abruptly quit them as it could lead to seziures.

I would caution anyone to speak with their doc about an exit strategy prior to starting, unless they WANT a life-long committment.  It does not appear to have negative impacts on my day-to-day functioning (I can drive, work, go to school, etc.).  The only other thing is that at times undue stress causes increased dosage requirements (my prescribed dose is 5 mg 3 times/day).

I've been on it for just under 10 yrs. 10mgx4 daily. It's been used mostly to help with sleep and muscle spasms along with other musclerelaxors. I've also needed it for anxiety once in awhile. For the most part I would say it's by far the best of the benzodiazepines. I'm lucky in a way that if I decide to take a holiday away from my prescriptions, I don't have any withdrawal symptoms. I have a strange tolerance to most pills, I feel that also has to do with my ADHD. It's longer acting than most benzos, but you need to be aware that it has a pretty long half life which if you're not familiar with the term, it stays in your system for about2-3 days, which is why it can be addicting cause the longer you take it, the longer it's half life is, which just stays in your system and builds a tolerance. That's the downside of the med, but it's been around for years, and I've been on many different types of benzos, and I always go back to the diazepam. I hope this may educate some a bit more than they were.

I have major muscle spasms from a spinal cord injury and the drug of choice back then (lioresal) did not agree with my system. About 9 months ago I was having problems with being tired in the afternoon. As diazepam haas a long half life my doc felt maybe it was bogging me down causing my fatigue symptoms. Switched to baclofen (generic lioresal)and after some initial problems have been taking that drug since. I am going to speak with my doctor about going back to diazepam. Since going off the diazepam I can't sleep, have more pain and far fewer &quot;good days&quot;.

Starting with heroin,  and years of pill popping, and I finally ended up in a methadone clinic. After a year in the clinic, my detox was complete. The withdrawl I experienced from methadone was like no other. I missed work for almost a month, and didnt sleep for 7-10 days. Not a wink. By the time I saw a doctor, I was a nervous wreck, losing my mind. He prescribed Valium for sleep, the trembling, and the anxiety. Having a history of panic attacks and anxiety, I never had taken anything that actually relieved me of those symptoms.

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/9/2010 11:41:35 PM	I used to get stressed out easily, get mad and stay in a bad mood sometimes for hours. I have been taking 5 mg as needed under doctor's orders for a couple of months now. When I feel really stressed I will take 1 pill and within 15 to 20 minutes these feelings subside and I can function without dwelling on the irritants. Lately I do not have to take this medication as much, it has truly helped me cope with daily functions. I may only take it a couple times a week now, as opposed to a couple times a day in the beginning. I had been given anti-depressants in the past and they made me not care about anything, and my life went down hill. When I was on and As I was trying to get off the a-d's I became depressed, which I was not depressed to begin with. Everyone is different, but Diazepam has helped me tremendously.

I prefer Ativan, but I believe that Ativan is more addictive, so diazepam is a great compromise. I'm also on DEXEDRINE (dextro-amphetamine), Cialis (tadalafil), Lexapro (for depression), and Abilify (which supplements the Lexapro wonderfully for my depression. Yea I'm 26 but I take more meds than my grandparents combined lol.

I can take them when I have to drive or deal with rude people and they do not hinder me at all.

Other	Charlie, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	3/8/2010 6:10:44 PM	Reason for Taking This: M&#233;ni&#232;re's Disease.I have been using this for 15 months to treat acute vertigo associated with M&#233;ni&#232;re's Disease.  It has been very useful in treating symptoms of the strong vertigo attacks that I experience 1 to 5 times per month. When I have a severe case of vertigo I use 10 to 30 mg per day for 1-3 days until the symptoms subside.  Sometimes I use 5 to 10 mg to help with a mild vertigo attack with a short duration (4-6 hours). This drug has helped me manage my symptoms and has 'given me my life back' compared to the time I spent prior to being prescribed diazepam.  It doesn't totally eliminate the veritigo but it does reduce it and helps me to endure the attacks of dizziness.Side Effects: I sometimes feel drowsy or not as mentally sharp as I'd like to be. My experience with this drug is that it often causes mild constipation. Recommend eating lots of fruits and vegetables when taking.

Other	mitchb, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	11/14/2009 10:35:34 AM	I've been on 10 mg per day for 40 years. Being on a low dosage for years I thought withdrawal would be relatively easy as I only take one pill a day. Last week I tried going without and I went completely out of my head after 4 days without. I gave in and took one and when I told my Dr about it she was understanding but told me I will probably be better just to continue my once a day pill forever as no one  should go through benzodiazepine withdrawal. I must agree. The point is that if you use this medication for too long you may develope an addiction which may appear to be next to impossible to break. It can be done but must be done painfully slow and tapered off until one takes a very low dose every second day etc. If using this medication be prepared to possibly be on it for  a while. If your using this medication on a short term basis(2 weeks) then you will be fine. It is when using this med for a month or more that the addiction is hard and can be dangerous. All that said if using this mediocation on a longer term then you will be OK as long as you don't overuse or underuse. Also remember that if your Dr puts you on this med that he or she knows the consequences and deems the use more important than the possible side effects including possible true addiction. After my attempt to quit last week I now have accepted the fact I will probably be taking my one pill a day forever. If I do reattempt withdrawal from diazepam I would get to the point where I would cut it down to a mg once evey two days and then maybe I might stand a chance. An addiction specialist explained to me that since I only take one pill a day and have been doing so for almost 40 years that I should just continue to take it as long as I do not increase my dose without approval. On the positive side this benzo may be good because of it's long half life in the body. It's benzos like Xanax one may best be avoiding as they can induce withdrawal much faster having a short half life in the body.Goodluck

I tried to come off of Clonazepam three times unsuccessfully. I experienced hallucinations, panic attacks, and I lost total control. My Doctor suggested a low dosage of diazepam. This medication has given me my life back. I no longer suffer from full blown terrifying panic attacks. My Doctor and I agreed to do a very slow and systematic tapper and I want to become benzo free. My Doctor and I feel it is OK to take in acute situations but I do not want to take this every day.

Symptoms from Stopping Treatment with Opioid Drugs	DocXYZM, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	5/18/2009 1:15:45 PM	Methadone withdrawal actually is my diagnosed use.  I am downing my dosage to get off the Methadone.  Valium 10 mg. helps me with the muslce restlessness, the inability to sleep, the anhedonia from lack of dopamine production, the dysphoria, from same lack of natural opiate production, and it generally calms the anxiety that goes with the horrible effects of coming off of precription narcotic analgesic.  I would not advise people to use Valium long term, or the withdrawal is very dangerous.  The only 2 meds that most insurance will pay for inpatient detox from are alcohol and benzodiazepines.  The seizures with both are very serious, potentially fatal with the right circumstances.  Used correctly, however, Valium makes the withdrawal from Morphine/Methadone/Codiene/Oxy or hydrocodone tolerable - but incomplete alone.  They treat the symptoms, but not the condition, so to speak.  Also, Valium is helpful for panic attacks, but not so much after an attack is mid-episode.  Good preventative for panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder.  If you TRULY are suffering with anxiety, and you REALLY want to get better, you need to mix the Valium with counseling.  Look for a counselor who does (Brief) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, aka C.B.T.  They use techniques like Systematic Desensitization if you can identify some situations that cause your attacks, but most ppl cannot.  So they teach you Relaxation Techniques, to sort of put yourself into a self-hynotic state of calmness.  It is basically a good diversion while the episode passes on its on.  Well, I hope this helps someone out.  I studied pharmacology as a requirement for my undergrad degree, and I am in grad school now, working on a degree in MPH (Public Health), in an area called Epidemiology, so I am not completely &quot;full of it.&quot;  I also have some obvious personal experience with addiction, stemming from military service in the sandbox.

Other	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	2/25/2009 2:57:31 AM	I recently dislocated my jaw at work. The Dr. Gave me Vicodin and Diazepam(Valium) for pain and discomfort. Of course I started with the Vicodin, but it made me sick to my stomach,did little for the pain and wired me so I could not sleep. So I started taking the Diazepam with a half of Vicodin. After about 30min. the pain was almost gone and I could sleep comfortably. Very good drug. 10mg 3 times a day, but I was usually ok with just taking one in the morning on an empty stomach and then one before bed.

At times, I'll take 1 tablet (2mg) a day and it helps me to calm down without feeling like going to sleep. Excellent med and would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel relaxed without being groggy.

And the only one that really affected me was, the 10mg none generic Valium. The cut out v's 10mg. Because I think I'm allergick to the generick Diazapam. And the 5mg tablets even if they where the cut out v's wouldnt help, cause the 5mg never helped me. Even it was the cut out v's. But the 10mg cut out v's always work for me. I used to get 50 at a time, takein two of them three times a day.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	9/27/2008 11:59:26 PM	I was prescribed this in place of meds specifically for sleep because I lost my insurance and had to pay cash. This is less than $10 for 30 days compared to well over $100.I've found these work just as well if not even a little better in some ways. I do fall asleep quickly enough. I stay asleep all night.My only complaints are (1) I do not feel as rested as I did when on the meds specifically designed to aid sleep and (2) I can have a little trouble some mornings with a feeling of grogginess. But I've experienced the groggy issue on other meds too.If you have trouble falling asleep - staying asleep or - like me - are often awakened throughout the night by something out of your control - pain wakes me up - and if you don't have insurance this is a great option. I do suggest trying it on a night when you don't have to drive the next morning so as to see if it causes a problem in the morning.Good luck and God bless.
Anxious	19-24 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4		19-24	9/27/2008 11:47:49 PM	I've used this for minor anxiety off and on for about a decade. It keeps me from slipping into full-blown panic attacks and allows a general feeling of control back to my life.I hate to say it like this, but after taking this it feels - to me - like I felt back in the days when I drank like I'd had one or two beers. I am calm but not loopy. I feel good but not in an artificial way. I'm still alert enough to function - on one 5mg.I've used Xanax before and either one works fine. If you start to feel one is not working as well as before you may want to discuss alternating between the two with your doctor to keep your body from becoming too used to either one.I only gave 4 stars for satisfaction because my only issue with the medication is that it can make me sleepy if I'm already predisposed to feeling tired, e.g. late at night, hard day at work, etc..
Muscle Spasm	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	9/27/2008 11:34:57 PM	I am currently being treated for lymphedema in the lower legs (both). The treatment started causing what felt like every muscle from below the knee down to start cramping. The top of my feet, the calf, the shin all started tightening relentlessly.  It was not like a simple &quot;charley horse.&quot;  It was many times more painful and, it would not work itself out by standing or walking. I was nearly brought to tears because both legs were locking up and there was nothing I could do.I now take one 10mg before bed each night and this seems to keep everything relaxed.I also recommend drinking lots of water, increasing your potassium intake and doing light stretching. You may even want to look into cutting-down on your dairy because this can cause muscle spasms for some people.Another &quot;trick&quot; I've tried is drinking pickle juice. I can not say for sure it works in and of itself because I've used it in conjunction with the other tips mentioned here. But on the rare occasion that the cramps feel like they might come back I drink a small glass just to have the added benefit. Even if it's only psychological that's a plus because stress can be a catalyst to some degree.Good luck to all of you and may God bless.

I suffer from anxiety disorder as well as not being able to sleep and severe neck and back issues. It helps it all I was taking 4 pills now I take one. I take 10mg every 4-6 hrs. during the day I usually only take 5mg if needed at all. Thank god for a doctor who is not afraid to give meds like out to those who really need them! Its those who don't I have found that makes it tough on a women like me. I now have been on this med for 3 years and it has improved my quality of life.

Anxious	Lisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/6/2008 8:48:26 PM	 I LOVE this drug.  I have been using it sparingly and only &quot;as needed&quot; for almost 20 years.  It is just as effective today as it was back then, and at the same dosage.  If I feel very anxious I take 2.5mg and I am calmer within a very short time.  If I need a good night's sleep and feel anxious, I take 2.5mg to 5mg and sleep happily for a good 6 hours. ( I need 8 hours, but this med lasts for 6 hours ).  I am 5'8 and weigh 128lbs. yet those dosages work great for me.  The greatest benefit I found was that having taken this med off &amp; on and sparingly &quot;as needed&quot;, I was able to mimick (without the drug) the CALM feeling that it gave me.  The mind is a powerful thing! It takes years of working on, but I couldn't have done it alone (without this drug).  I am at relative peace now because I am older and wiser AND because I have a great store of this drug incase I need it.  If you suffer severe Panic Attacks or severe Anxiety that you can't calm down by yourself, I highly recommend careful use of this drug. Others sware by Xanax... never tried that one.     Hang in there.

It has improved my life greatly!

Other	Tony S, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	3/4/2008 1:14:48 PM	I was prescribed diazepam for treatment of chronic dizziness and vertigo.  After over 2 years of searching for an answer, a very low dose (1 mg, 3 times per day) has relieved my dizziness without sedating me. In fact, I actually have MORE energy than less on this drug at this dosage level. This is an &quot;off-label&quot; use of this drug according to the neurologist that prescribed it.  It has allowed me to go back to a normal or near-normal life.  Seems odd that a medication that can make you &quot;dizzy&quot; can, in very low doses, relieve vertigo and unsteadiness.  My non-medical theory is that it calms down what I would describe as an electrical storm in my brain.  Moving scenes on TV or bright lights in a store would trigger my vertigo - no longer.I previously tried meclizine, but even at low doses it just knocked me out and all I did was sleep the day away.I cut 2 mg tabs in half to create my 1 mg doses.  The plan is to cut back to 2 mg/day after a couple of months and see how it goes.

The therapeutic benefits of these meds have deteriorated over the years and have been overridden by debilitating side-effects.  Diazepam is the only medication that has been consistently efective over the years for allieviating anxiety and panic without the negative aspects.  I take 5mg tabs 3-4 times daily.
