Acne	 (Patient) 	2	3	2			5/25/2011 11:55:03 PM	This medicine made me feel extremely depressed. I can't explain it very well, but I just felt lethargic and apathetic when I was taking this. If I could go back in time and never have taken this drug/medicine I would. It wasn't very helpful at all and actually created some other problems in the future.

Acne	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/8/2010 11:22:50 AM	I was in my late 30's and early 40's and developed a severe case of acne.  My dermatologist put me on this medication along with the topical medication Benzaclin.  It took a good month or so to start working and then I took it for a few years.  It worked wonders.  When it was time to try to get off, I did ok.  I believe it was from some type of infection going on in my body.  I don't need anything anymore.

Acne	Tyler, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	55-64	10/1/2009 12:21:06 PM	I've had acne for nearly 50 years. In my early twenties (1971-1976) I went on this drug for several years. It helped the acne, but I developed severe allergies... Hay fever, grass and weed allergies, animal fur, etc. I never connected the drug with my sudden allergic condition until years later. I have since read that this can happen with this family of drugs.  I've been off of all drugs for several years and my allergic condition has left, but it took several years.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/2/2009 12:30:57 AM	I am a 26 female with severe adult cystic acne. tetracycline clears my acne completely within a month and a half. I have been on and off of this med for 8 years. SE I've encountered are recurring yeast inf and sensitivity to the sun. It is not a med to be on during pregnancy, this I found was the only down side. It is a severe teratogen, that at about the 10th week of pregnancy effects the developement of a fetus. Overall I would recomend this treatment if topicals have no effect and before drastic decisions are made about potent alternatives with serious SE.

However a month in it broke me out in humongous clusters of whelts over my entire body. I was forced to take steroids to counteract the reaction. I would reccomend you take it at your own risk.

I had to take this pill 3 times a day, not within an hour of dairy or 30 min of laying down.  At first I thought this medication was helping but then my body got use to the drug and started breaking out again.

Acne	number5, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	9/30/2008 3:46:22 PM	I first took tetracycline when I was 14 and it worked perfectly but my parents made me cease taking it due to a significant loss of weight (have to take it on an empty stomach plus it made me lose my appetite). I gained my weight back really slowly and the acne came back within 6 months.So now I'm 19 and have decided to take it again.  In the beginning I took it on an empty stomach and my acne cleared up again (YAY!) quickly but I have a pretty high metabolism so I eat a lot and am always hungry, so taking it on an empty stomach was difficult for me and I literally watched the clock for when I could eat again.  So for the past like 6 months I have been taking two twice a day regardless of whether I've eaten or not and it still works like a charm!  But I still have lots of water with it because it does make my throat burn somewhat (especially if I lie down right after taking it) and avoid calcium and iron within 2 hours of taking it.  My doctor also prescribed me a topical cream called Differin (also available in a gel for oily skin types) which has improved my skin even more.  I have dry, freckly skin which flushes easily and there is (was!) acne wherever it was the driest (cheeks, jaw-line). Now there's rarely a pimple and my face doesn't even go red as much anymore (unless I'm sunburnt) plus my skin-tone looks more even and just overall healthier.  Whenever a pimple does show it's ugly face, I just apply differin to it and it's usually gone that same day! or at most the next night!side affects I experienced:-loss of appetite-rapid weight loss-weakness and dizziness due to weight loss (not severe)-mild to medium upset stomach with little adjustment-sunburn easier-sore throat (only when taken w/o lots of water and only lasts for a few hours)It's worth it though for my skin has never looked better!
Acne	effected by acne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	9/28/2008 3:54:05 PM	My dermatologist stated that it may take up to 3 months for this medication to be effective.  However, I began getting these large and painful sores on my face after about 5 weeks.  I tried to keep taking it hoping that it would go away (I really wanted something to help my acne)  and it did not go away.  Since stopping this medication they are gone but I still have bumps in my skin where they where they are just not red and irritated.  I have yet to find an effective regimin for my acne????

Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	19-24	4/3/2008 10:21:43 PM	Was taking 500 mg by mouth twice a day. (morning and night). After 2 weeks, I noticed a dramatic change in my acne, and how much less break outs took place. I was on the medication before, and took the full month script as perscribed above and then limited the pills to one a day and I still had the same result as though I were Taking the normal Dose. As far as side effects. I noticed nothing except maybe slight upset stomach, that passed with in minutes. 
Acne Rosacea	Neko, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	3/30/2008 2:13:34 PM	I was on this drug for 2 1/2 years and it worked well, but after all that time it gave me another medical problem! I now have LPR Laryngopharyngeal Reflux that was caused by the Tetracycline drug! I have been on 3 different prescription acid reducers and none of them are helping much but now I'm on Nexium and its only helping a little. I cant eat choclate, fatty foods, soda or diary or any of the good stuff I like taking this drug has made my life a living hell now! DONT TAKE TETRACYCLINE!
Acne	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	3/3/2008 2:06:15 AM	I have been using tetracycline oral for over ten years. I only use it during outbreaks. My facial oil is very heavy. I wipe my facial oil off my face several times a day. It is related somewhat to what I eat and drink but not all. I am prescribed the medication (500mg) twice a day when these outbreaks occur. Usually I use Tetracycline only for a few days, sometimes a week or so until the flare of acne stops and begin to go away. If I catch it early as soon as I begin to feel or notice the out breaks I can use the medication for less days. I think I have used most types of topical, peels, and oral medication but a good professional facial on a regular basis (every 6 months) along with good cleansing practice, with tetracycline kept as a back-up for outbreaks have been very effective treatment.

Acne	jason98, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	4	Male	25-34	1/16/2008 2:16:24 AM	Okay, from my experience it works great, been on it for about 2 to 3 years, face is cleared up.  i haven't noticed any sensitivity to sun but I dont' usually go out in the sun too often.  it is difficult to time up the pills especially b/c I like to eat several small meals throughout the day.I stopped taking this medication twice and a few days after noticed my face getting oily again and acne coming back.I do take them sometimes with food eaten recently but try to take it on an empty stomach.  In the first few weeks I noticed stomach aches but now I am adjusted.Overall I recommend this drug but it is a pain not only to take two pills a day but to take it on an empty stomach twice a day is difficult but if you have had a lifelong acne problem like me its worth the sacrifice. By far better than any acne topical cream and I have used many.  by the way its generic and shouldn't cost much...
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	19-24	12/18/2007 4:10:23 PM	It is a bit inconvenient to take the pills while avoiding dairy products, but I noticed a change in my acne within a 24 hours of taking tetracycline. My dermatologist also paired this drug with a topical solution called Sulfatol Lotion, I do not know exactly what it does but it is contains 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide and 5% Sulfur.  
Acne	andrewcarter, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Male	25-34	11/24/2007 7:47:16 PM	Tetracycline does a great job of cleaning up your skin.  But if you have a weak stomach, ask for another treatment.  Your stomach will adjust, but the first couple weeks you will notice aches and a upset stomach 30 minutes to 2 hours after taking the medication.  But over time your stomach will adjust and will get back to normal.  You must take the medication on a empty stomach.        
Acne	friend, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	1	3	Female	35-44	11/11/2007 10:07:22 PM	very hard to time doses, take on an empty stomach, or 2-3 hours after eating, no calcium within 2-3 hours, and you can't lie down after taking it for 30 mins, you have stick to a strict schedule to follow directions exactly.
