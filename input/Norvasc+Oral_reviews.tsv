Without the walking...150/70's to 160/80's. I resumed walking 30 minutes 4/5 times a week and it's back in the 120/60's range. Meditating also helps. I'm curious if other's have developed hypothyroism since being on the drug?

High Blood Pressure	Elaine309, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	2/18/2012 3:42:21 PM	After taking Norvasc 5 mg. for approx. 2 weeks, my blood pressure was not going down at all.  I seemed to be allergic to it and my eyes were itchy and swollen, my throat seemed swollen and my ankles and legs were so swollen that they ached and I could hardly walk.  I was given this drug to take along with Bystolic to lower my b.p. to get ready for back surgery.  My pharmacist advised me not to take it, but Dr. insisted I keep taking it.  Finally Dr. switched it after 2 weeks to lisinopril.

I dont want to kill myself anymore, cant even understand why i was thinking about it.  I will NEVER go on these pills again.  The doctor has since changed my medication for my blood pressure, and its well under control.  as far as nightmares and depression, they seems to have stopped as fast as i stopped the pills.

I take all three now and finally BP is down to a dull roar. I can't afford regular docs so I rely on Clinics but all is well now and no real side affects. I think. Some like fatigue and coughing after an hour or so from taking(I don't smoke). Some urinating changes since the Norvasc but no side affects worth mentioning. BP down, so I'm down with it. I'm 51.

Now years later I have lost 35 lbs and my BP has gone down.  With the knowledge of my physician I dropped Diovan (proscribed at the same time), when I continued to drop weight and my BP was low I dropped amlodipine two months later my BP is still stabilized but my esophagus 1) is again spasmatic but worst my acid reflux is so aggravated I have to sit in a recliner to avoid acid in my mouth, throat and esophagus when I sleep.   When I realized the aggravated reflux coincided with stopping the amlodipine I resumed it.  I am uncomfortable taking a BP med. when my BP is already stabilized.   I am 74, I have maintained my weight loss for a year and I exercise regularly (swimming and pilates).   Has anyone else had such an effect from amlodipine?

It's the only BP med that doesn't let all my blood rush to my head when I bend over to pick something off the floor.
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	5/22/2011 6:24:33 AM	I was on Norvasc for years with no problems. I suddenly started experiencing swelling, painful and bleeding gums. Thinking that I had something wrong with my teeth, I went to my dentist. My dentist told me that the problem I was having was a result of the loing term Norvasc use! The treatment for repairing my gums was to have them burned, which was not fun (and expensive!). When I told my doctor what the dentist had said, he told me that Norvasc would not cause this problem. It wasn't until my periodontist wrote him a letter stating that it WAS the Norvasc, that he finally took me off of it. Just because you've never heard of something being a side effect from a medication doesn't mean it isn't so.
High Blood Pressure	Pugrsq, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	55-64	5/18/2011 7:21:16 PM	I have always had a problem with extra heart beats.  After my dr raised me from 5 mg to 10 mg of this medicine......my heart began to race and the extra beats were really bad.  Not one time did I think it was the Norvasc.  My BP went really low, and I stopped taking it.  Called my dr and he told me to not take it anymore.  It has taken almost 2 weeks for the extra beats to subside.  Just felt as though I should share this rare side effect.  It can and does happen sometimes, and it is not fun.
High Blood Pressure	gracefulnot, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	5/14/2011 9:10:01 PM	I am taking 20mg a day. Started at 5mg and it has been raised over a period of 3 weeks and have stayed with 20 mg for a month. My hbp is a side effect of Avastin which inhibits tumor growth. It has lowered my bp with few side effects. Still having headache problems but had them before taking Norvasc. I have been shocked at how many people have had so many side effects. My hair is just now coming back from chemo I hope I don't loose it again.

High Blood Pressure	mwp, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	45-54	5/9/2011 7:18:32 AM	Norvasc took about 3 days to start working and about 3 days to stop working. I'm dealing with ASVD, which covers your complete body. The problem I have with Norvasc is it works to well taking 5MG per day. I could not get 2.5 MG to work at all. I was also treating angina, which it did not help with that. It was keeping me from taking my other medications because I would bottom out. It does work to control Blood Pressure but it didn't help Angina. It caused swelling in my lower legs and feet, which I had to take other medication to clear that up. In Fact it seemed like it cause more chest pains.

I've always had a good grade of hair but no matter what kind of treatments I use to help it along it do not work . It use to be long and thick, but now it's thin and lifeless and it only turned that way after taking these pills for my blood pressure. That's the only thing I've noticed besides the swelling of my ankles.

I am amazed at some of the comments on here about extremes sweelling of legs etc. Not one person went to their doctor before it got this bad! People doctors are not mind readers YOU have to participate in YOUR OWN care, and do the research on the drugs before you let your doctor prescribe them! Speak Up!!  Why would anyone keep taking this drug or any other with the symptoms getting worse each day?? I research everything that goes into my body so I can have an intelligent conversation with my doctor!

The med has moved the migrains to my whole head, increased the muscle pains, and caused muscle weakness. I am going to give this a few more days, and if nothing else, I will quit this drug on my own.
High Blood Pressure	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	1	5	1	Female	65-74	3/6/2011 12:52:27 PM	Norvasc has not lowered my blood pressure after over one week. I am on 5mg daily. Sometimes my blood pressure is higher AFTER I take the norvasc! It starts up my gastric reflux big time and I have constant burping (never had before) and stomach discomfort. I was on metoprolol 50mg daily before the norvasc. The metoprolol did not lower my blood pressure, but I had no side effects from it. It is an arduous journey trying to find the right blood pressure medicine that works for you.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	2/2/2011 1:03:22 PM	Was on Norvasc for high blood pressure for many years. I then started noticing that mu gums were swelling and bleeding. After a visit to my dentist, she told me that the Norvasc was causing this problem. It was very painful. I then had to have 4 sessions with a priodontist to actually burn my gums down to their normal size-very painful and expensive. When I told my doctor what the dentist said about the Norvasc, he said that isn't what was causing the swelling. My periodontist then sent him a letter explaining that it WAS the Norvasc, the doc finally took me off of it. Hopefully, this information may help someone who may experience the same thhing!

It worked very well and no side effects to start except vivid dreams, which gradually went away. Now I'm having extreme lethargy and hair loss that I didn't immediately connect to the drug, but after reading these reviews I know why. The side effects are apparently delayed. Feel zonked out and have no motivation to do anything. Going to cut the pills in half. Very disappointed that there doesn't seem to be a bp med that doesn't have annoying side effects.

Pressure is ok most of the time but once in a while it will spike, very high. When I have a spike 197/99 it takes a few days to go back down.This upsets me since I am taking four different meds! I also have another problem, it is hair loss ! I am starting to lose a great dealof hair and am trying to cover it up with hair pieces. I am a woman and this is very disturbing to me. Is anyone else having a hair loss problem with these meds?
High Blood Pressure	MYSTERY ILLNESS, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/25/2010 5:02:07 PM	I've taken Norvasc 5mg since 9/07/2010.It's now 09/25/2010.On 09/10/10 Dr told me to double to 10mg.Still no change in bp.Avg 150/95.I don't believe they know what they're treating.I've always struggled with way too low BP avg 70/55. 08/19/2010, awoke with extremely swollen ankles &amp; legs..4x in size. I went to the ER, they inverted my bed I peed a lot &amp; my bp returned to 84/63 &amp; swelling subsided without any meds so I went home.Drs thought it was bec I'd been sun all day drinking Gatorade doing a campaign for the prev 2wks.On 9/7/10, I felt like I was having a heart attack &amp; my legs were again swollen.Went to ER, got admitted for 4days.Given Norvasc &amp; inverted my bed.BP reduced to avg 130/70 @ discharge.They think it's the Norvasc that reduced it,I disagree. I think it was the lying down &amp; inversion. Now I've been home Norvasc doesn't work. My bp avg is 150/98.I think we need to find out what's causing the spike from basement to penthouse. Only reduces when I lay &amp; invert.Now Drs say swelling is because of Norvasc..I think it makes it worse but doesn't cause it. I tried telling idiot I came to ER bec of legs swollen 4x size b4 Norvasc It  increased my heartrate like it's about to beat out of my chest. It isn't helping, I intend to stop taking &amp; research for natural ways to reduce bp.Unfortunately I believe there's some other reason bp spiked.I was also diagnosed with Hyponatremia &amp; SIADH.I eat extremely healthy when I do eat, I have almost zero appetite. No salts, drink tons of water, no sodas, make my own fruit juices no processed foods, no high fructose corn syrup etc.I think doctors are treating the symptom without finding the cause for no appetite &amp; swelIing I'm somewhat overweight from tons of steroids given after a recent car accident, but that didn't alter my unusually low bp.It's this sudden swelling &amp; spiked bp that worries me.It never goes to moderate..from xtreme high to xtreme low. Today it averages 160/110 hrt rate 105.Now Dr wants to give betablockers?

This is the 4th med. prescribed and all previous have caused problems.  I think I may be having a reaction to the sulfa base.  Anyone else having similar reactions?  Anyone know if there is a BP med. that does not contain any form of sulfa base?

I have been taking it for about 6 mos and on BP medicine for over a year. It made me dizzy and light headed at first. Now the bottom of my feet and legs feel tight when I wake up in the morning. I have light neck and back pain. Its a tingling numb feeling. I was having hot flashes anyway and this medication may be making it worst. It seemed my flashes had subsided before I started this medication. My doctor have me taking it at night because she claims it may make you sleepy during the day. Ofcourse with me this is not an issue because it does not help me sleep. It may be helping me to stay awake. Sometimes my pressure is low. It was so stessful taking my pressure daily I just stopped and wished for the best. I just do not know what to do.

It has worked beautifully and is still working today - still at the 5 mg level.  My cardiologist raised me to 10 mg and it caused ankle swelling - so I kept a chart of my blood pressure 3 weeks with the 10 mg and 3 wks changing back to 5 mg .. there was no change, so I remain on 5 mg.  My husband was prescribed Norvasc, but was unable to take it.

However I had  also gained about 20 lbs. I have lost 12 lbs by strict dieting and bp has gotten low now 95/77-114/78) but I feel terrible. I am tired, some days just exhausted and feel like I'm in a fog. I am  not able to sleep enough- I wake up too early and have to take a big nap or at least lie down every day.Also the  past 2 weeks I had have nausea, stomach pains, bloating, burping and maybe reflux. Also my heart rate remains very high (113 or so even when bp is low at 114/77). I have also had light- headedness and memory problems. Vision seems  worse too. After reading alot of these posts, I think all my probs are from the med. Stopping it today and seeing my dr tomorrow.

High Blood Pressure	askaimee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/30/2010 5:45:46 PM	I had a terrible experience with this drug. I am not usually very sensitive or reactive to new prescriptions, but after four days on this medication I started having chest chest and back pains. I thought I was having a heart attack so I went to my Dr. and she checked me out and every thing was ok, but the pains continued. I thought maybe the pain would go away after I acclimated to the drug but after two weeks it did not go away. I advised my Dr. that I could no longer take this medication, and I started to feel better soon after I stopped but it took a full week before all the chest pains went away. I had other symptoms as well, some of which are mentioned here by others, but the chest and back pains really freaked me out! My Dr. did not acknowledge that these pains might have been caused by the drug and never mentioned possible side effects when prescribing this. My advise is to try it if you have to but be aware of the possibility that a drug that is prescribed to help prevent Heart Attack may make you feel like you are having one!

Thank God I recovered from the acute kidney disorder. My nephro prescribed 5Mg daily since then and really worked well with me.Since I had no hypertension history before I had the renal problem, I decided to stop taking it late last year as I was confident I am well enough and had recovered from the kidney disease. But after less than a month it proved me wrong because I had kidney trigger and bp rising up. It was a stupid decision. I Now I am into this thing maybe for life.

I take 2.5 mg daily along with 50mg Atenolol and have had good luck and no side effects that I have noticed.  I go back soon for a recheck of potassium and blood pressure and hope everything is still okay.  These reviews are scary, I hope the happy patients are just keeping quiet...

In 4 day, I've had an bloated abdomine, pain in the left arm and left leg, face and a terrible headache. I've had tightening in the chest and pain on the left side of my face.  I've also had to urinate a lot more then usual, blurred vision,  and constipation, All this after 4 days of use.  I believe it should be taken off the market due to the dangerous side effects.

High Blood Pressure	HappyHeartDay, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/14/2010 5:36:21 PM	It's only been 6 days that I'm on Almodipine - so far, so good - it's lowered my bp.  Only thing that might be attributed to it is blurriness yesterday morn. Cut my pill in half today and nothing bad happened.  Before this I was on Coreg(s), ToprolXL, and Lisinopril and had reactions like others mentioned here, as chest pressure, irreg hrt beat after lying on sides, no lowering of bp. Coincidentally, I think I'm experienceing claudication (heaviness and poor circulation in legs, but no swelling) but it started BEFORE Almodipine.  Stopped hydroxyzine, thinking it was cause, after 6 mos use, as something similar happened 18 mos ago, after 6 mos use.  It's confusing to know what's going on, isn't it!?!!?

High Blood Pressure	rbg, 75 or over Female  (Caregiver) 	3	4	1	Female		2/10/2010 1:57:26 AM	My mom has been on this in the combo drug Azor and this is the worst side effect she had from it &quot;Loss of One's Own Sense of Reality or Identity&quot;  Now she's off Azor, but I just discovered he left her on norvasc, which she reacted to in the past and now is struggling with her mind a lot. She was as described above and almost totally lost control of her mind. It has been very difficult to go through for her and us. She recently had her synthroid reduced and has come back around quite a bit, but seems to be heading down again. She has many of the side effects listed for it.Her BP went up after going on synthroid 15 years ago, but they just put her on BP meds instead of taking her off the thyroid. She has gone downhill ever since, but the docs would never listen to me and now she lost all quality of life while on this drug. I want her off all meds myself, but I don't know if her doc would agree. She's 84 and I've read that people over 80 tend to have more problems with drugs. She hasn't tolerated any BP meds. It's such a crime. I hope this will save another elderly person from suffering needlessly. It's very hard to see it happen.

I was treated for Sciatica, but with no improvement. However, my cardiologist, on learning that I was taking this medication directed that it be stopped immediately. Within several days I was pain free. I consider myself very lucky.
High Blood Pressure	sailor1, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1		45-54	1/29/2010 1:51:35 AM	Started taking Norvasc 5mg along with Lopressor 50mgx2, 1 month ago. Changed from Benicar and Catapress, which I had been on for 3 years due to extreme joint pain and headaches. After 1 month B/P was running around 140/90, so Dr. increased Norvasc to 7.5mg. Several days later, both feet/ankles swelled up like balloons. Couldn't walk on them. Chest pounding. Hands also swelled and face became red and flushed. Worst part was my ears became clogged like I had a head cold and I developed a ringing in one ear. Took hours to fall asleep. I freeked out and stopped taking the med for 1 day until I could get in contact with my DR. He had me go back to 5mg and see what happens. SCREW THAT!, I went to 2.5 on my own. 3 days later the swelling has gone down all the way, but I'm still stuck with a ringing, clogged ear, that is driving me insane. I have to sleep with a floor fan running next to the bed, just to block out the ringing. (wife has moved to the second bedroom) Dr. says I must have allerigies. Never had ear problems or ringing in my life until now. B/P 130/86. Dr. wants me to start on Diovan to lower B/P. Seems like a numbers game. More meds. I'm 51, ride my bike 3 miles, 4 X week, fast walk with the dog on weekends and eat real well now. Have an active job. No salt diet and have lost 22 lbs. I'm not sure I want to go back on any more meds. Hoping that my ear will clear up quickly. It seems like we have to indure all these side affects, just to lower our B/P. I hope you all can find your &quot;magic&quot; med.  Good luck to all.

I am tired all the time.  The only other thing I noticed was it seems to effect my vision, not all the time but sometimes I see spots in front of me and then I have a hard time seeing, almost like there is a glare.

My bp was close to 200 and wasn't going down so I was placed on this immediately after delivery.  Within a week my bp was down to borderline high and normal and then every appt since it has been normal.  I haven't really noticed anything side effect wise other than my teeth and gums being very sensitive.  Anything other than that, I'm not sure if it was medication or post partum.  As of a couple days ago, I was told I was able to go off the medicine but am not sure how to do so without having any side effects from doing so.

The first one made me cough until I wretched.  The second one cause a growth on my upper gum (seriously) but this one was the WORST.  It bothered my joints so badly, I felt like I was 100 years old.  I am a teacher, so when my ankles, knees, hips and lower back ache it affects my performance in the classroom. I am a reading specialist who travels between 15 classrooms each week.  That's a lot of walking on marble floors.  My p.a. switched me to Metroprolol, and I've had NO problems since.

Calcium channel blockers like Norvasc are not for me either (s/e: lathargic, shortness of breath, and just felt &quot;weird&quot;). Threw the bottle away and went off cold turkey (NOT a good idea). Trying my third type of med (clonidine). Side effects look like all of the other bp meds reviewed (terrible). Are there any meds out there that work well w/out s/e?

My ankles are bigger than the bottoms of my feet right now. I feel as if I am walking on balloons and it burns with each step I take. Hopefully we'll find a drug to control my blood pressure without these awful side effects!!
Type of Angina Where Chest Pain Occurs at Rest	Claire, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/3/2009 6:52:41 PM	In my 20's I was given a dieretic for my episodic hypertention.  I never could adjust the proper doseage all these years and Dr's put me on an aceinhibitor/dieretic and that seemed to help but I was not getting rid of enough fluids.I was always fatigued, pain levels high in joints, and suffered from ibs/constipation, dry eyes and mouth. They even thought I had mixed connective tissue disease but test proved that wrong.Well enter my new PCP and she decides to try this drug for a two week time trial.I am a totally different person today. For years I was told I had arthritis or fibromyalgia. Well on Amlodipine I am urinating better than I have ever done before, no constipation, hardly any fatigue and the pain in my joints is minimal!!!!! for the first time in 13 years!  My husband is shocked! I am assuming that all this time I had fluid in those joints.  You couldn't even hug me!The only side effect is that I only get 4 or 5 hours sleep but when I awake I'm not fatigued and get up and start my day with energy and enthusiasm.I'd like to get my regular 7 hrs. of sleep in but maybe that will happen the longer I'm on the medication. I have just been given a new lease on life and at 63 it feels so good.I realize this won't happen to everyone, the changes it has given me with my medical conditions but I was so disabled any change for the good is a blessing.If this helps just one person like me how wonderful that would be.

High Blood Pressure	Surf rider, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	65-74	11/26/2009 5:35:14 PM	I have had continuing problems with adjusting to ANY hp meds. Thus, my evaluation is biased. Unfortunately my experience with this drug has been the following: Severe dizziness, severe nauseau (vomiting over the course of many hours), swelling in the ankles and feet, itching on the palms of my hands and bottoms of my feet, shortness of breath, severe shivering, headache, and overall weakness. These various symptoms are most likely due to a severe allergic reaction to the drug. Undoubtedly, I am one of the rare exceptions to the &quot;side effects&quot; described as very infrequently occurring. I will be seeking immediate consultation from my physician. 
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	10/27/2009 1:51:28 AM	My BP was over 200/160. Norvasc has helped to get it down to 140/84. So it works. The key is finding the right dosage for each person. I FEEL the best on 2.5 mg with minimal side effects but 5mgs/day works better. At first 5mgs made me dizzy! Hence, I took 1/2 at lunch, 1/2 in eve so I could work during the day. I've noticed I get tired faster but sleep pretty good. Some constipation and a little swelling in legs.Be careful of too high doses of this stuffIf you feel dizzy, your dose maybe too high.I weigh 138lbs and 5mg/day is max for me.

I've been on it for about 4 mths now and the only side effects I notice is a LOT of heartburn/burping and very low libido. Otherwise it's really helped with the BP and I've noticed that the fibrillation I used to experience (wake up from a sound sleep with it) is practically nonexistent.

I've gone from 5 to 10 to 15 mg to get b.p. reduced.  Lately I've been having swelling of the feet, ankles and legs.  My cardiologist says amlodopine won't cause that.  I guess he doesn't read medical reports because I'm finding from many sources that the amlodopine causes leg swelling.  I've reduced my dosage to 10 mg without adversely affecting my b.p. and it has helped reduce the swelling somewhat.  My family doctor also said that this product won't cause swelling of the legs.  You sure would think these guys would check this out rather than shooting from the hip.

I could not sleep more than 2-3hrs a night and would wake up with rapid heart beat.  After a week started getting red blotches with small hives that were extremely itchy they would appear on my back, stomach and thighs and disappear within a few minutes very strange.  Had no appetite and lost 10 pounds and it made me feel anxious.  Also made my feet and hands hurt.  After 1 month couldn't stand all of the side effects and stopped taking the med.  It has now been almost a month since I stopped taking the medication and all of the side effects are now just starting to go away.

Whatever will be will be. Eat right a balance diet check your pressure and keep away from the doctors. Only absolutely necessary see a doctor.Think wisely. I had prostate cancer was treated with ultra beam radiation and I was seeing a Urologist every six monts and he could not see it coming although I had two biopsies. Then I was told by the oncologist that I should only have seen him once a year. What the hell he didn't do me any good.Think for yourself and stay to hell from the doctors office. Be healthy. Don't be a fool. Be wise.

I started with 10mg and was able to scale back to 7.5mg.  One thing to note, it took about a week to control my blood pressure - I guess it takes a little time to maintain the drug levels.  I also experienced some very vivid and disturbing dreams, but after a couple of months they have diminished and have pretty much gone away.  I have been on these two drugs for about a year.

I will be asking my doctor to try something else. Other than that Norvasc is working fine for me.  Less side effects than the others I tried.

Felt very anxious like I was on the verge of a panic attach. Feet and ankles burned and itched all night. Quit taking after around a month - heart rate returned to normal within a few days - panicky feeling left- and burning and itching left my feet and ankles - Dr. said symptoms did not come from drug - Hah! Why did they leave when I quit taking it then? Will never take this drug again!

Cat is a large breed and weighs just over 10kg &amp; his dose is around 2mg a day (smaller half of 5mg oral tablet). Cat has taken this for two and a half years and is 5yrs old. He is healthy on this and if he has been off the tablets for over 3 days he doesn't seem so well. The vet himself has medication for high blood pressure that is hereditary. As the vet is a fit middle aged man I suspect he'd researched medications for hypertension coming up with norvasc for himself and cat.Norvasc has the advantage of being a tablet able to be broken and a low dose option. Cat shows no side affects aside from a bit if stuff in his eye corners that is easily wiped off once a day. Vet said his eyes were fine, it was just a response to the Norvasc.Cat accepts his daily dosing well over the last year, earlier he was fairly co-operative with occasions of pretending to swollow with spitting it out when I wasn't looking. There was a time when in a month I hadn't given him the tablets regularily and he actually seemed eager to take them after a second period of missing them for 3 days.It looks like cat has associated feeling well with the daily ritual of being given the tablet.As the humans in cat's life cannot see any other observable side affects and cat isn't describing any it seems Norvasc is effective and safe.

I've never experienced anything like this before. I acknowledge that combining Alcohol with any medication is not the best policy but this seems a bit extreme.Has anyone else experienced a problem similar to this?

He said my gums were puffy and they were noticing this with patients taking Norvasc. I started reading reviews and realized it may be the reason for my leg and foot cramps.  I have been going to a chiropractor which is helping but I still get cramps for no reason at all.  I also started getting rapid heart beats during the night.  It almost feels like an allergy attack or an adrenaline rush.  Sometimes it last for quite some time. I am going to get off of this med and try something else.

It's been pretty effective in combination with Hydrochlorothiazide. However, I have experienced some side effects, namely: blurred vision, weight gain (outside of my sedentary lifestyle), hair loss (mild), dizziness at times and also rapid heart beat at times.I didn't realize any except the dizziness were associates with the drug, until I researched the side effects.  Also, studies show that those who take calcium/beta blockers are 2 1/2 times more likely to contract Type 2 diabetes! Basically, I'm in a weight/lifestyle management program now, including Curves gym, racquetball and fencing.  It's just not worth it to have HBP.  Lose the weight (if that is the cause of your HBP) and then God willing, you can lose the medication.  The risks associates with HBP are heart disease, diabetes and increasingly for women, breast cancer.

It was running as high as 170/110 and now it is running 110/76.  That is incredible! The only bad thing about this that I have experienced is slight bit of fatigue in the afternoon and the feet cramps at night. They are horrible!!!  I have never experienced cramps like this. They are to  the point that my legs are sore the next day because all the cramping, not to mention the interrupted sleep.  Does anyone know anything that will help?

Only problem I really have with this medicine is my hair is starting to break off really bad.  I normally have strong hair (I'm a hair stylist).  A pharmacist told me this was due to it being a calcium blocker.  Has anyone else had this problem.

I recently developed a itchy feeling around the neck and back. I took a class, CHIPS, which promoted a diet with high fiber and low fat.  My blood pressure(dropped 17) and cholestrol level dropped 71.  I went to the doctor today and advised him of my readings.  He wanted to double my dosage of Norvasc or change to another drug.  I advised him that I was quitting the drug and will stick to my diet.  Rx everyone check out the CHIPS program in your area.  Our foods are the cause of major illnesses today. Take charge of your own health.

It has effecively lowered my blood pressure. I take it early in the morning. One to 2 hours after taking it you will probably feel a little tired for maybe an hour. My suggestion is if you have a high strees job take it before you go to work, I'm in Law Enforcement, it seems to help with the mental stress a little. Slight Ankle swelling does occur occasionally but is not a problem. Norvasc does what is supposed to do. Good Drug.
High Blood Pressure	jlanerose, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/4/2009 3:37:34 PM	I have taken Norvasc 10 mg for about 15 years.  Does great job keeping BP normal.  I do experience swelling of ankles but no longer have migraine head aches or any kind of head ache.  I consider swollen ankles a good trade off because I am not getting migraines.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	1/21/2009 1:04:27 PM	I am in the second month taking the generic.  I had extreme drowsiness the first two weeks and didn't have much motivation.  I seem back to normal now but I don't sleep as well at night.  I take the medicine at dinner time so don't know if I change to the morning it would be better.  I didn't get headaches with this medication but another medication I tried gave me headaches daily.  I'm on 5 mg and after reading the reviews I hope I don't have to take anything higher.  I am on the generic which I'm leary about.  I don't know if the brand name would be better if I needed this drug for years.  The swelling I read about scares me.  If I see that happening I will tell the doctor to take me off of it.  I will not take medication that causes headaches or a lot of swelling. The flushing of my face has intensified while being on this drug also.  And lastly my blood pressure has went down - the bottom number is still 85 which I would like to be lower.

I did have some swelling in my ankles. I asked my doctor if I could get off this med as I had lost 60 lbs and felt my blood pressure was steady. He wouldn't take me off the med, said I needed it as a preventive measure. I started experiencing shortness of breath which over the last four years has gotton extremely worse especially when I eat or I am stressed. I can't take in a deep breath. Has anyone else experienced this? I started 6 months ago to take myself off the med to see if that would make any difference for my breathing which it hasn't,my blood pressure is normal now, but no doctor can find out what is causing this shortness of breath. I am just wondering if any one else has experienced anything like this that has been on this med for a long period of time. Any ideas would be so greatful.I gave this 2 stars because as I said it did regulate my blood pressure.

I can tolerate  5 MG, have a bad reaction if I take 10 MG, because I am allergic to sulphur=  It does have sulphur. Also folks be aware that it can give false reading of diabetes. I was taken to the hospital, they insisted on testing me for diabetes, even although I told them no. After all the tests I had no diabetes.
High Blood Pressure	two of us, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	12/27/2008 7:37:27 PM	I started taking Norvasc 5mg January 2008. It worked fine.  On December 11, 2008(two weeks ago), the dose was increased to 10mg.  My ankles are swelling.      I am worried because my husband took 10mg of Norvasc for 2 3/4 years.  His doctor took him off of Norvasc in October 2008 because it could be the cause of his legs swelling, oozing, and bleeding.  My husband is going thru lymphedema treatments, which has reduced his legs swelling.  He will be wearing compression socks from now on.  (Those socks are hard to put on.)  I don't want to go thru the swelling or the socks.       With my ankles just starting to swell and my left one significantly in the past week, I believe the increase dose of Norvasc is the cause.

It had gotten to the point where I was getting one everyday.  I have been on this medication for about 4 months now and I have only gotten 2.  And they were triggered by a food (pecans) that I have now eliminated from my diet.  At first I was on 5mg but I could feel my heart beating all the time.  I am now on 2.5 and the side effects have subsided.  I do occassionally feel my heart beat when sleeping but the benifit of eliminating my migraines out weighs this minor inconvinience.

I take 2 1/2 mgs per and sometimes 5.  I am very sensitive to most meds and the side effects usually do me in so I take half the dose prescribed for Norvasc.I was started on the Norvasc generic months ago too and had an awful time with it for three weeks.  I had angina pain, my blood pressure was up and I found the generic almost impossible to break in half it was packed so hard.  I toughed it out and going in to week 4 the chest pain stopped.  I called Medco that we get our Rx's from and was told it was exactly the same with exactly the same ingredients and fillers.  Yeah right then why is it a generic?  So there is hope for the generic if you can tough it out.  Also I have had a terrible time with weight gain since I've been on this medication.  I looked it up in several areas and that is a side effect.  NOT WATER WEIGHT...continuous hungry feeling.  I do have constant pain in the legs but I have Fibro too so not sure.  I can tolerate that as long as Norvasc keeps the chest pain controlled.  Hope this info helps.

Together this drug along with Lisinopril and lifestyle changes, my bp reading yesterday was down to 135/80, which is much better than the 180/140 it was 18 months ago. My doc wanted it lower, though, so she doubled the Norvasc. I am quite dizzy today and very lethargic. All I feel comfortable doing today is laying around. I hate this, but the 5mg level was okay. I have been out of breath upon exertion since beginning this script and my hair has gotten thinner, but I can deal with those side-effects. I think I will start cutting the pills in half and take it morning and night and see if that helps. I swear, I almost feel drunk.

All was find until I was switched to the generic brand of each drug. Now Im searching for something that works for me. Even though I take the medicine as directed, it's like I'm taking sugar pill. Not effective at all.

I now fall asleep as soon as I sit down and feel mildly depressed and tired all the time.  Everything is too much effort to do.I have to go to my doctor to have my prescription renewed and will discuss these problems with him.  I hope it is the medication I am on that is causing all this.

Condition was confirmed via an angiogram, however have never had high blood pressure or angina. Been taking 5mg for over one month and started feeling dizzy, listless and having moderate chest pain almost immediatly. Also starting feeling slightly depressed for the first time in my life. I'm going to talk to my doctor regarding alternatives if necessary but regardless I am quitting this drug. My health seems to have gotton worse since taking it. Cardiologist never recommened a high blood pressure drug of calcium channel blocker. The doctor who prescribed this is not a cardiologist and I believe over reacted to a premlinary, non definitive diagnosis using only drug manufactures general suggestions without taking all facts into account.

High Blood Pressure	Drew, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Male	35-44	10/13/2008 3:49:37 AM	First time using high blood pressure medication. I had bad side effects. Head pain,dizzy,heart throbbing, drowsiness, low engery, dry mouth, muscle weakness,some twitching, feel week. I would rather have high blood pressure than to feel this bad. At time my mind is mush can not think, can not keep eyes open. This was on the 10mg dose. I will never take this medication again!

I've had trememdous palpitations and fatigue, an increased in BUN per a blood test. I'm a nurse but will discuss stopping this medication with my doctor as the results aren't good enough to justify the side effects.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	55-64	9/21/2008 8:14:49 PM	Dr. switched me from Procardi XL due to swelling of the feet, ankles and legs. The Norvasc showed some improvement until 3 weeks in when I developed swelling and rash on inside of both forearms and knees. I've had the rash for a week thinking it was an allergy but found the symptom on this website and have stopped immediately. Dr. visit tomorrow. I will demand a change or change doctors.

For weeks I was in and out of the doctor's office trying to find out why the swelling. Truly don't think it much for my unstable angina since I relied on and needed the Nirto Quick Tabs. After stopping the Norvasc my swelling went away within days. The Dr has since put me on a daily Nitrate called Isosorbide Mono. This works great!! Have had less unstable angina attacks in the 3 mos I've taken it and no side effects.

I'm a nurse and take my BP 2x's a day and always get a high reading yet I went to the Dr this week and he said my BP is improving. I went to work and had another nurse take my BP and she also got a high reading. Also my feet and legs are swelling and this hasnt happened to me even when i was working and on my feet for 10 hours. I am giving this med one more week and then telling my DR to take me off it. If he doesnt I will change Dr's.

High Blood Pressure	applefarmer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	35-44	8/16/2008 4:21:39 PM	Worked great for my high blood pressure and the generic is cheap, but it made me so exhausted I slept all the time and could not drive or hold a job while on it. If there is anything for high blood pressure that does not make you exhausted, I would like to know what it is. Beta blockers also made me groggy, but it took being on them 1-2 months before it built up enough in my body for the beta blocker (Inderal) to make me tired, so at first I did not attribute it to the Inderal. I also was very groggy on Diovan and Hydralazine. I quit eating at restaurants and fast food places and quit cooking with salt and although my BP is still high (134 over 84) it is much better than the 160 over 100 that it was before I changed my diet. So if BP meds make you feel drowsy, try cooking with seasonings like McCormicks Salt Free Herb mixes (in the Spice section at the grocery store) and check the mg of sodium on sauces you buy and use low salt or salt free bouillon (Wylers makes a good one that is a powder in a glass jar that you measure by the spoonful).

High Blood Pressure	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female		8/1/2008 9:54:17 PM	I had no problems with Norvasc for a year.  The insurance company then changed my prescription to the generic form and I started having extreme (very painful)swelling of the legs and ankles for several months.  My (former) doctor did not know why I was swelling.  Thank God I went to another doctor who immediate diagnosed the problem and change my prescription.  Swelling went away immediately but a year later I still have darkness around my ankles from the swelling. I wish I had read the reviews before I started taking the medication. Also wished by former doctor had also.  
High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	7/27/2008 8:36:50 AM	I was switched to this drug because previous med caused swelling, and dr started me out on 10mg-highest dose- which caused extreme swelling and pitting in my legs,ankles,even feet. I was out of country when syptoms worsened and was scared. took 2x dose lasix per dr,helped some but not enough. Returned home and different dr in practice told me it was norvasc causing problem. Had to take 3x dose lasix,plus booster to get rid of all fluid. Better now.

Photographed my leg at three stages and send them with a complaint to the FDA, Insurance CO., Pharmaceutical Co., and the Medical Director of the Institution, then I contacted a Lawyer.

I had severe edema in my lower legs and ankles.  This went on for several months. My doctor even had a therapist treat my legs with massage &amp; tight wraps for months, to no avail. The swelling was so bad it caused blisters (which I still have, and always will, even after the swelling is gone). Sometimes my legs were so swollen &amp; tight I was unable to stop the fluid from leaking &amp; runing down my leg. Finally, my doctor had an 'idea' to change my blood pressure medicine - the swelling instantly stopped! So, just a warning to all, doctors can't know everything - sometimes we have to be our own advocates!

My sleep was very shallow, and I would awake every two hours.  I never (not once) was able to sleep past 4:30 AM. Maybe I should've given this drug longer, but I'm a teacher who absolutely requires sleep!

I think my urine output is worse, over active bladder, and I see no lowering of my BP.  Away with this....also, my edema seems worse. I suppose I will have to stop this one and be lab rat for another one!!!

High Blood Pressure		3	5	3			5/20/2008 8:58:31 PM	The difference between generic and brand name is mostly in the binders used in manufacturing the drug. Each maker uses their own brand of binder(s), but is mandated to use the prescribed amounts of the actual medicine. That is the ONLY thing that is regulated. Some binders can inhibit the absorption of the medicine. FYI

I know have trouble breathing, major head pressure, dizziness, and what feels like a heart that is 5 sizes too big for my chest.  Doc wanted to up the dosage, but could not because of my low blood pressure.  I HATE this drug.  I feel worst with than without it. 
High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	2/19/2008 9:16:58 PM	I take this along with Micardis 80mg which was not working alone. When I started this my blood pressure was 156/104 and it is now 119/79 after over a month on the Norvasc. The only side effect I have is a fast heart rate. I am going to mention that to my doctor when I go in next time. Over all it has worked well on controlling my blood pressure.

And guys, it causes extremerelaxation (dilation) of blood vessels.Guess what that means when you try to keepit ready for performance. Forget about it.The blood won't keep it up.

Also, in the morning before taking it (2 hours or so before taking it) he gets a strange feeling of &quot;withdrawal&quot; which goes away after taking the pill.

BP not really affected that much, still varies from 122 - 155 daily.  Ankles have become swollen, nurse says approaching +1 w/ pitting.  Awaiting call from cardiologist's office, as I want to be weaned from this med. and put on something else.  Swollen ankles very uncomfortable.  And, have experienced hair loss and more frequent urination.  Not a good med. for me.

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	2/4/2008 8:49:43 PM	Was on 10MG for 6 mths. Started having severe reactions, nightmares, shortness of breath, quickening heartbeat, extreme fatigue, extra heartbeat, sleeplessness. Talked to dr., kept notebook of BP &amp; side effects, Was told to stay on meds. Developed heart attack type symptoms, went to emergency room, had stress test, blood work, etc. Cardiologist registered my severe reaction to Norvasc &amp; took me off immediately. My suggestion...keep a notebook, do your own research, be persistent with your dr. &amp; follow your instinct.

This maintains my pressure at moderately high (around 165 over 87 usually, which is better than any other I have tried) The worst side effect is heartburn, that has gotten increasingly severe over the years.  I experimented with lowering my dose, and the hearburn lessened...but in the whole scheme of things...heartburn...or heart attack...you gotta weigh the options...

My strength has deminished and I've had this stinging burning feeling in my feet and ankles. The only reason that I gave it two(2) stars for satisfaction is because it did lower my blood pressure, but I'm not satisfied at the overall experience.

Norvas did bring his blood pressure under control; however, his ankles became so swollen that they hung over the side of his shoes.  The he has developed a mass in both breast and is having surgery tomorrow.  This is very scary.
