Birth Control	Linda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	9/14/2012 1:51:27 PM	Got pregnant while on this pill and never missed a dose. Had a horrible miscarriage. Hate this pill. 
Birth Control	leahsmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/5/2012 5:10:09 PM	Its effective and I'm not even the best at taking it (I know, I know). Periods are always on time and regular. But I do get on and off nausiation, especially the past few months, which is odd, because Ive been on it for over a year now. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	1	Female	25-34	7/14/2012 9:38:30 PM	I started taking this medication because I was experiencing very long periods... 3 months long.. started this drug and boom, periods were back on track... However, 6 weeks into taking medication I wanted to kill the entire world.. I had no sex drive, was always tired and depressed... I would rather bleed for 3 months straight than feel like that again... stopped taking the pill 2 weeks ago, and finally feeling back to normal... bad experience for me... wish you all better luck!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/28/2012 11:57:28 PM	Got pregnant while on Balziva. No antibiotics. Took exactly as directed.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/17/2012 12:18:14 PM	I had very painful periods which caused severe pain before I started taking this pill.  My periods would be very heavy at times and would last anywhere from a half a day to two and a half days.  On Balziva, I have no pain whatsoever, and my periods are extremely light (light enough for panty liners), lasting only 1 day. I do not have any mood swings, and my high sex drive is greater than ever.

Endometriosis	Desireesmiles, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	4/21/2012 5:24:37 PM	I started this medicine about 3 months ago. This is the first birth control pill I have had success with. I formed clots with the other three I tried, so because I am able to stay on this one so far, it's a big plus for me. However, I have noticed I am moodier than I was before, and I feel bloated, but overall, having my periods go from 9 days to 4, and from extremely heavy to extremely light, this has helped me a lot. Also, I have not bad cramps since I started. My endometriosis used to keep me in bed for days, but now I can lead a more normal life.
Birth Control	K, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	4/16/2012 7:50:40 PM	I experienced non-stop bleeding for two months after I began taking this medication. I was tired, noticeably down, and just didn't feel myself. I have never experienced this with any other type of birth control. 
Painful Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	4/12/2012 2:22:01 PM	I was on Ocella for years, (generic for Yaz) and loved it. My periods have been getting worse since entering my mind twenties so my doctor put me on Balziva, telling me that switching up would help with painful periods. It has been awful. I gained about 8 pounds (I have a small frame so it might as well be 15) I am a very healthy eater and go to the gym about 4-5 times a week and haven't been able to lose the weight at all.  I developed horrible depression and mood swings, and I lost my sex drive. That being said, I am going back on Ocella. I do believe that it really depends on the person for the birth control but it just was not right for me.   
Birth Control	ErinVT, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	3/27/2012 12:19:21 AM	I was on this pill for over a year, and it was the worst year of my life. I had severe mood changes to the point that I was clinically depressed and suicidal. I gained about 30 pounds and looked swollen or bloated all the time. My boobs went from B's to DD's, which may sound good, but I outgrew all my clothes and experienced severe back pain because of them. I got headaches all the time and was tired 24/7. It took me a very long time to figure out that the pill was the cause of all of these symptoms, but as soon as I stopped taking it, within two weeks I felt completely normal again. I am also not the only one who experienced this. My friend was also on Balziva and had the same problems. It wasn't until after she was prescribed antidepressants that she realized that the pill was actually the cause. I very very very strongly caution against taking Balziva. I wasn't myself for over a year and almost ended up taking my own life because of it. There are plenty of other options for birth control that work much better, but if you do decide to take it, please just be careful and be very vigilant in watching out for yourself. No one deserves to feel the way I felt. 
Birth Control	Cam, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/31/2012 10:56:23 PM	I have been take this pill for 5 months now and I have not experienced any major side effects. It made my skin clear, which I am so happy about because I had aweful cyst like acne. My breasts get really tender around the 3rd week before the week my period is due and as far as my periods, the flow is lighter but I am still bleeding for five days. I don't have any mood swings, nothing out of the norm and my sex drive is even better. This is working for me and this is the first birth control pill I have ever taken.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/12/2012 5:12:19 PM	It has cut my cycle from 7days to 3days and they are much lighter.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	12/22/2011 9:26:15 AM	I am on this med for hormone inbalance. I was on FEMCON with great results (3 packs from the DR) and was given a rx for OVCON 35..my pharmacy gave me Balziva. OMG!! I've been on this for 9 days and I am ready to kill someone. No joke. I feel like I am in the middle of the worst PMS of my life. My breasts are tender, my moods are horrible. :( Called the pharmacy and they are sending out the brand name OVCON asap..it's going to cost me $30 a month, but my sanity and that of my family is worth every penny.I suggest you think long and hard about taking this med..I know everyone is different, but this did not work for me. I read the reviews and was sure I wasn't going to have any issues....well, here I am on day 9 and I'm ready to blow my top..for no reason..at all. My kids and dh noticed a difference right away and asked if I was PMSing..I'm not..my period is 10 days away. 
Painful Periods	honestgirl92, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	19-24	12/17/2011 3:35:52 PM	I've been on Balziva for about 2 years now. I've been mostly satisfied with it. Before my periods were irregular and very painful. I also had problems with acne. They are now very regular and have shortened to 2 or 3 days a period. The cramps haven't subsided much, but I can tell a little difference, but my acne is just as problematic. I have frequent mood swings and anxiety which I didn't have before, but I haven't had any of the problems with hair growth, thank goodness! Overall, I'm satisfied, but I'm sure there is better out there.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	charmattack, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	8/25/2011 7:00:10 PM	I was put on this BC after having to have 2 large cysts and scar tissue removed from both ovaries. I have spotted or more, every single day I have been using this, I have extreme episodes of depression and my ability to handle frustrating situations has lessened. It has literally been epic PMS every single day. I haven't had my check up ultrasound for the cysts so I can't comment on that yet, but this has been an awful experience and I am hoping when I go back to my GYN, there will be an alternative. 
Birth Control	KelseyKels, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	6/27/2011 2:18:39 PM	At first I attributed the side effects of this drug to just getting used to it for the first few months.  However, this pill is noticeably worse than others I have taken, which were not a problem at all (Yaz, Yasmin, Gianvi).  The only reason I switched is because my health insurance barely covered what I was on before and this was cheaper.  Balziva has made me incredibly empitional, which has rarely been the case in the past.  The spotting is horrible and the period lasts a minimum of 6 days, which is pretty long compared to other drugs.  The menstrual cramps on the first few days of the period are awful.  I also felt bloated the first month or two but that gradually diminished.  Now, I'm noticing that I am developing a light, furry facial hair from my side burns and down my jaw line.  I'm totally freaked out because I have never been a very hairy/furry person!  Switching out of this crap ASAP!
Birth Control	sassynsweet, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	5/23/2011 2:36:32 PM	I began taking this drug about two years ago; I had heavy periods and bad cramping. Taking birth control has helped with the cramping and has been 100% effective. I'm not pregnant yet  lol...the only problem I have is remembering to take the medicine but I haven't had any of them other problems that I'm seeing people have been saying they have. Just like with any medicine it will effect everyone differently. But I would recommend giving it a try to see if it works for you. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	4/6/2011 2:52:01 PM	My emotional mood swings have been getting worse every month.  I am almost constantly depressed or experiencing anxiety.  I also suffer from hormonal acne while using this, and I spot for almost a week and a half until I have a full period.  YUCK!  My GYN is switching me to Yaz.Also, to the person who commented about generics required by law to have the same amount of hormones, etc.  They do NOT have to have the exact same amount, they only have to be within a certain percentage.  Talk to your doctor about this. 
Birth Control		5	4	1			3/3/2011 11:03:35 PM	This has made me very emotional. I feel sick all the time and have sore breasts all the time. I would not recommend it.  It almost makes you feel pregnant. And I have had 12-14 day periods. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	2/15/2011 9:31:47 PM	I have been on this pill for more than six months but the past three I have spotted at various times before my period. The spotting also comes with mild mood swings which I originally got on birth control to avoid. Up until now, it has been a very positive experience since my last pill made me extremely emotional. I just want to switch to something to stop the spotting. 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	1/10/2011 3:35:23 AM	I used to take the brand name Ovcon-35 and then the pharmacy decides to give me the generic..balziva or however you spell it. I havent lost hair like I have read so many on this page. I really hadn't had a problem until just recently. I would say I have been on this pill 3 years maybe. I have noticed I have gained weight, no sex drive, and my period the last three months like non existent. I would have old blood with very little new blood. I thought I was pregnant the first month this happened to me because my boobs were tender and the weight gain etc. However I was not pregnant. I go to the doctor this friday im demanding a new birth control and im sticking with the brand name i dont care if its 50 dollars.
Birth Control	Lindsey, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	12/19/2010 12:38:54 PM	I recently switched from Aviane to Balziva. It has been kinda horrible. I've gained weight, felt slight nausea, stomach bloating and cramps and moodiness. Maybe it's because my body has not adjusted to it yet since I've only been on it for about 2 weeks.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	11/27/2010 1:55:25 AM	I was reading all the reviews posted here and learned that balziva is the generic of femcon which gives me more reason to not like balziva. I took femcon a few years ago and never had any problems. I am on my second month of balziva and I hate it. I was put on it because in addition to I need for contraceptive my menstrual cycles were very painful. That is the only thing I can say it does. From the day I started this pill I was experiencing the extreme nausea.I dealt with it for a few weeks but I became fed up with the constant discomfort and inability to eat so I stopped it until my next period started. I began taking it again with my new cycle and was happy to no longer experience nausea (I find taking it in the middle of eating lunch helps) but about a week and a half into the new pack I started to have irregular bleeding which I have never experienced in my life. So I went to the dr and was told it's normal and is only a problem if it continues past 3 months. Well not for nothing I have been bleeding lightly but bleeding none-the-less for a week and a half now. It's annoying that my contraception is causing me to be uncomfortable about having sex while spotting like this.  I HATE THIS PILL 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	11/11/2010 5:25:53 AM	I began using balziva a three weeks ago I'm on my fourth week. So far it has been ok for not relieving my abnormally long period right away.  Still had light bleeding throughout using this pill. My dr instructed me to give my body a chance to get use to it. So ill see what happens with the next pack of pills.  
Birth Control	B1S, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/8/2010 3:43:08 PM	I just started on this pill last Thursday and it's Monday. My doctor switched me because Loestrin24 was too low hormone for me and I was having 2 periods a month for the first time in my life. I used to be on .25 mcg of estrogen before Loestrin and that seemed to work well.I'm now on Balziva and it's .35 mcg of estrogen, which I hope is not too high for me. I will see.The reason I'm posting is because so many people have put negative reviews about Balziva as a generic brand for Ovcon or FemCon. I justed wanted to make everyone aware that it's required by LAW that generics have the EXACT same ingredients as brand names. So, there should be no difference in the pills, only a difference in the weight of your pocket. The reason generics can be cheaper is because they had no research overhead and everything that the brand name/original producers did.It might be real emotional issues and not the generic version of a pill.
Birth Control	missy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	6/29/2010 11:11:58 PM	I started Balziva to relieve extreme discomfort during my menstral cycles, and it proved effective in preventing my previous dizziness, heavy bleeding, and a strange hot flash I would get once during each cycle [this was so horrific I would go pale, sweat up a storm, pass out, and wake up ice cold. EVERY month.] I have been on this pill for over a year and its benefits outweigh the negatives. BUT it wasn't always like this. When I first started on this pill, I had bleeding for a month straight. In the following month or two, bleeding every two weeks. I was kind of psychotic for a day or two out of every month back then. After a few months, all these symptoms vanished for me. My period is so light that I'm not bothered when I have a period anymore. I just had it on vacation and I didn't give it a second thought. Now, the only complaint I have is the lack of sex drive, sexual arousal, etc., so eventually switching pills seems like a good idea.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/31/2010 3:00:30 PM	I swiched from femcon FE to its generic Balziva prescribed by my GYN. I never had any issues with Femcon, worked great for me, I switched to a generic thinking that it would save me some money but switching to Balziva was totally not worth it. It caused me to gain almost 7 pounds in 2 weeks, my whole body feels swollen, I have no energy and I have a terrible back pain and weakness in my legs and arms. I have never felt this kind of weakness before. I am calling my GYN back to switch back to Femcon FE. Balziva has been a horrible experience.

OMG PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD PILL!!!!!! COULD NOT GIVE IT A WHILE, I THOUGHT I HAD SOME SERIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEM, LIKE CANCER OR SOMETHING!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	4/7/2010 3:40:50 PM	I know most people only post reviews if they have a bad experience. I usually don't post them unless I have a good one. But this was exceptionally bad! Like the 3/1/08 poster, in the first 5 days of taking, I've been so nauseous I can't function. I just want to eat everything in sight to make my stomach feel better. I also gained about 10 pounds in water weight as soon as I started taking it. I was so bloated it looked like I was pregnant. I guess you could say the drug is effective...I mean, I'm not pregnant. But I called my dr. today and told him what I'd been experiencing and he told me to stop taking it. So se la vi, Balziva! You suck! No, but really, I owuld have stuck it out the 3 months like they usually say to had it not been for this awful constant nauseousness, from the time I wake up in the morning until I go to sleep. Every woman's body is different. This REALLY didn't agree with mine! I pretty much had every one of these side effects:Most Frequent:Abdominal Pain with Cramps, Abdominal Swelling, Acne Vulgaris, Body Fluid Retention, Breast Engorgement, Dizziness, Edema, Fatigue, General Weakness, Mastalgia, Nausea, VomitingI've been on about 12 different pills over the past 3 years because I have constant breakthrough bleeding, which is why my dr. tried prescribing this for me after an ultrasound to make sure I didn't have any polyps causing the breakthroughs. At this point, I may just try other forms of birth control.
Endometriosis	Anon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	3/15/2010 9:57:17 PM	I was originally prescribed Balziva to treat my excessively painful periods. So far, so good. I experience little to no cramping now during my periods. However, I have had other side effects others have already mentioned: bleeding in between periods, breast tenderness, some nausea...I can live with the bleeding and the tenderness, and the nausea is only mildly irritating. This is the first birth control medicine I have ever been put on, and I think it works fine, if you're willing to put up with the side effects. Most people aren't going to be, though. 
Birth Control	frustrated, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	3/13/2010 9:05:31 PM	i take the pill in between the babies i want/ which are six yars apart/ and all is effective on not geting pregnant. i was to have a hysterectomy because i was bleeding so bad a year ago and i was put on this to get regulr because i am only 37 and they did no want to set me in to early menopase so i got this medicine. weight gain out the wazoo, two heavy periods each month/ or what they call breakthru bleeding/. i have no sex drive and terrible mood swings wanting to kill myself too.

I used it for three months with mild nausau. We stopped the pill for a few months and the first day we restarted it, I vomited. Severe nausau this time. Some dizziness too. Would not recommend this pill.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/16/2010 12:58:38 AM	I am now on my second week of my second month on this pill. So far i havent found any horrible mood swings or emotional outbursts like i have with previous b/c's, but i do experience 2 periods a month. Ive been on my 'period' for 4 days and my actual period is not supposed to start for another week and a half. this happened my first month on the pill as well. so far this is my only major side effect. If it continues after another 2 or 3 months of use, i will be switching back to yasmin. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	 (Patient) 	1	3	1			12/22/2009 12:54:30 PM	This is the worst pill i had ever had. i was taking this pill for 3 months &amp; i had nausea, vomitting, dizziness &amp; depression. On top of all this there was bleeding inbetween periods which stayed for a long time. i would never recommend anyone to take this especially people having prolonged heavy periods.

I have only been on the pill for a month. I wouldnt take the pill.. 
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	sharon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	11/26/2009 6:25:18 PM	I have become so withdrawn and unmotivated to do anything, which is not like me. I'm in college and have some serious bill issues, but before taking this medication I could handle the stress. I find myself constantly upset, unable to focus, and severely depressed. I spent Thanksgiving alone crying because I couldn't bring myself to leave the house. None of this is normal for me. I can't afford to pay for this stupid medication, but if I don't, I'll probably have to have another blood transfusion which costs even more. I guess this is the price you pay for being &quot;healthy.&quot;
Birth Control	Whitney29, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	19-24	11/12/2009 11:15:07 AM	I have been on this birth control for less than a month. I changed from another pill because it made me crazy, crying all the time and depressed. I started my period Oct. 30, 2009 and stopped the 5th of Nov. and on Nov. 11,th I started bleeding again, like a period, not breakthrough bleeding that is light, but heavy. Anyways, this pill makes me very nauseated and I throw up about every two days on it. I also get extremely bad headaches, where the light and noise bothers me so much that I have to lay down in a dark and quiet room. I am ready to get off this birth control. I have lost about 8 pounds in three weeks. And I am tired all the time. I would rather not be on birth control than to have all these side effects.
Endometriosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	10/7/2009 8:51:08 AM	i haven't been on this bc for long ,but since i've started it i've had a constant headache and dizziness, and my heart speeds up randomly, it's a little scary really.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/28/2009 10:36:50 AM	I started taking this medicine as a generic brand for Ovcon. I had terrible side effects that included numbness in my arm and pain and weakness in my legs. It also altered my mood. I would not recommend this medicine for anyone! 
Birth Control	jackgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	8/9/2009 5:02:48 PM	I started 3 months ago because I was getting married. About a month after starting my hair started to fall out. It was horrible. It would come out while brushing or in the shower. I have lost over half the hair I had.  If I dont eat before taking it I throw up.  Even as a newly wed my sex drive is ZERO!!! I hate this pill. Once your hair starts to fall out switch pills. I thought it was just stress from the wedding.  It was not.
Defective Internal Secretion of Ovaries	sassymiss, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	3	5	3	Female	25-34	8/6/2009 4:47:08 AM	periods still longer than 7 days
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/20/2009 8:59:01 PM	I tried to kill myself and ended up in the hospital when I was taking this Tri Sprintec. I cried almost every day, and felt very emotional all the time when I was taking it. I don't keep track of things as well as other reviewers on here, so I don't know exactly when it started, but I know that I was on Tri Sprintec for almost a year and cried every day almost every day. Then, when I switched to Femcon and next Balziva, I became a normal person again. Before I took Tri Sprintec, I had been taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and didn't realize there was a problem with my moods, but now that I have the perspective from being on Balziva, I think all the tri-phasic pills cause me to feel like I want to cry all the time, whereas the mono-phasic pills such as Balziva and Femcon make me less upset. Actually, with Balziva, I feel completely level-headed and rarely feel like crying. I don't even have PMS now. Tri Sprintec gave me the heaviest periods I've ever had (Super flow tampons for five days, but without BCPs I rarely have a period and when it comes it's like spotting and nothing more), but with Balziva I wear Regular tampons for four days, and sometimes I can go for several hours without a tampon during my period. Anyway, everyone is different, but Tri Sprintec really messed me up emotionally and I don't ever want to switch from Balziva to anything else now.
Birth Control	Brooklyn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	4/18/2009 3:31:02 PM	Does the job at preventing pregnancy and regulating your cycle but I have had HORRIBLE anxiety and depression while taking Balziva, like nothing I've ever experienced while taking Ovcon 35. Also, expect your libido to completely disappear. After taking Balziva for three years, I don't recommend it at all and would rather switch to condoms.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/13/2009 10:21:04 PM	I've taken Balziva for over three years and I am very happy. I experienced mood swings and breakthrough bleeding only when I started taking it again following a planned pregnancy. Those side effects left after a couple of months taking it as prescribed. My periods are regular, light, and less painful than without birth control. Fortunatley, my sex drive/life is GREAT and has been for years. No two women are the same- that's why there are so many birth control pill options. This one works well for me.
Birth Control	BCuser, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/22/2009 5:32:16 PM	I experienced breakthrough bleeding with other Bc's. However, this pill regulated my period after a long bout with irregular bleeding. However, I am having to get used to the side-effects...mild nausea and breast tenderness...makes u think you're pregger. But I've taken a test and it was negative (whew). Overall, decent B.C.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	2	1	Female	19-24	2/11/2009 9:24:47 PM	I have been taking this pill for 3 months and it has been the most horrible three months. I have become irritable and have random dizzy spells. My pulse races at times and I become uncontrollably nervous. My vision becomes blurry and I am not able to focus on objects. During the second month my appetite completely disappeared. This caused my rapid weight loss of 13 pounds in less than a month. I do not recommend this pill to anyone. Prior to Balziva I was taking Ovacon and NEVER had any of these symptoms. 
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	Twinsoulzz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	2/11/2009 8:05:55 PM	Took this pilss after taking Cryselle 28-3rd day have very heavy bleeding and cramping. I was taking Provera as well to stop the abnormal bleeding be4 taking BC pills- Not sure if I have my period now or this is just breakthrough bleeding from taking BC. I began meds after being diagnosed with a functional cyst. I feel bloated on this Pill and feel frustrated the bleeding is so heavy! :&lt; 
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	11/18/2008 4:36:26 PM	Absolutely terrible...took it for heavy periods and cramps and I still have cramps, only with 2 week periods every month now.  I have been on it for about six months and haven't had any weightgain, but I have had acne outbreaks CONSTANTLY since I began taking this pill.  Awful pill, if I knew I would have my period for half of my life I never would have started taking it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	10/15/2008 2:54:41 PM	I have been on this drug for over a year now. It has worked well except for the fact that I have absolutely no sex drive. I dismissed the low sex drive to a long distance relationship, now this is not the case and I am more than likely going to change pills. 
Birth Control	paula, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/8/2008 12:44:54 PM	I love it. I lost 10 pounds on balziva.Work great for me.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	mtylr2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	8/29/2008 7:13:27 PM	Been on this 2 weeks and switched from Seasonique because of breakthrough bleeding between periods and this had more estrogen to stop the period.  First week 1/2 was great, now I've started the tan discharge again I had on Seasonique.  I feel good on them mood-wise, no breast pain yet, but it has kept my stomach upset.  I've actually lost 3 lbs on it. (probably due to the, er...stomach problems :))  I am so upset about the discharge, though. Thinking about going off the pill altogether.
Birth Control		5	5	3			7/20/2008 2:01:24 PM	I was on ovcon 35 before taking this generic, and have experienced side effects from it i never had from Ovcon. My sex drive completely diminished, and like clockwork i spotted between weeks 2-3 on the pill pack. There was no weight gain or acne or anything like that, so I can't say that this pill is the worst thing on the planet. I have finally switched, though.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	7/9/2008 11:29:36 AM	I used to be on Ovon 35 and ever since I switched I have gained 20 lbs, maintained constant and severe head aches, and had crucial dizziness from time to time. I do not recommend this pill unless you want severe side effects.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	35-44	7/3/2008 10:23:22 PM	i've been on this med (28) for 4 months and have:  gained 15lbs, severe cramping, mood swings, depression, loss of sexual interest, heavy bleeding when i am on my period, bladder infections(when never before), my breast have grew with the 1st month of use the pain then was so unbearable and even now they are sometimes tender for a whole week before my period that they hurt when i shower!  i say this pill is somewhat effective because i was bleeding months on end that so far this pill has somewhat helped; however when i am on my period the first 2 days are really heavy and recently i seem to be starting my period before i am done using the pink pills. . . i don't want to be bleeding but i can not afford to be gaining more weight or feeling depressed all the time. . . 
Birth Control	ellabella, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	6/27/2008 10:47:33 PM	I was on this birth control for four months and every month the breakthrough bleeding go worse and worse. I ended up having my period every other week! I do not recommend this to anyone.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	DC47, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/7/2008 11:26:50 PM	I have been taking this drug for about 6 months for abnormal bleeding due to menopause.  It has regulated and returned my periods to about normal. I seem to even have less mood swings and other premenstral symptoms. I am having a problem with weight gain, and I am thinking of trying something else because of this.
Birth Control	Amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	6/5/2008 8:14:08 PM	The first couple of months was fine. About 7 months into taking it I started having constant breakthrough bleeding for the week before my period, then I would have my period, then a couple more days of bleeding. I kept on the drug for 4 more months hoping it would even out, but it never did. I hate this pill and told my doctor that I would rather be pregnant than take it anymore. And I am still having pre-periods after stopping this pill for two months. Bah!
Endometriosis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/31/2008 11:25:16 PM	Love it. I've been on it 2 months &amp; haven't had a period, spot for 2 days &amp; that was it. No side effects of any kind. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	3/1/2008 10:49:15 AM	After being on this drug for just 5 days, I became dizzy, disoriented, and have had a constant headache. I nearly passed out at work! I also experienced breakthrough bleeding.  I will never EVER use this product again, and I would certainly not recommend its use to anyone else either! It should be taken off the market as far as I am concerned!
Birth Control	Cat, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	1/28/2008 10:08:07 AM	I have been on this medication for 8 months and I have had different types of effects each month. The first month, I didnt experience much; I didnt have much of a period but would have slight cramping. The second month, I experienced  a lite lite period and the same amount of cramping. Slowing but surely this medication has my moods off balanced and my periods are slightly worse, but the cramping has not gone away and each month they are to the point that makes me cry. I am not sure at this point if being on a birth control pill is the best thing for me. I would recommend for somebody who is looking to get on this medicine to consider if they want to have cramps and mood swings all the time.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	11/25/2007 10:59:14 PM	I have had several of the side effects associated with this pill! The frequent headaches, altered sexual interest, nausea and hair loss, just to name a few. The altered sexual interest and hair loss are the most traumatic for me. The hair loss is traumatic for me because I had long, healthy, full hair. I have used different pills before and this is by far the WORST experience I have ever had.  You don't have to worry about me using this product ever again.
