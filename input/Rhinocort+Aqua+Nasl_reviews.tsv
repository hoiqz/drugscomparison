Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	hollyay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/28/2010 9:42:09 AM	I live in New Orleans (below sea level) and there are many mold and pollen spores in the air year-round. I have suffered with allergic symptoms my entire life, and the Rhinocort Spray has made my symptoms virtually non-existent. On occasion I must use Zyrtec, Zyrtec-D, etc., but if I go without the Rhincort, a trip to my ENT will be mandatory.I recommend that you use the spray exactly as described in the patient info insert. If used improperly, it could cause nose bleeds ans is way less effective.I only use once in the morning as it does keep me awake at night! Hope this info helps someone.

I have to take Mucinex and Allegra D with this... Rhinocort does not seem to do anything for Post Nasal Drip as I still have it and A DAILY HEADACHE turned migraine.  I am not spending another $50 on little bottle of this stuff ever again.  It gave me awful headache-- did not help my Allergic Rhinitus---only GAVE ME painful daily HEADACHES and foggy thinking.  NO HELP.

This drug significantly reduced this occurance. While surgery is the long term solution. The drug significantly reduced the issue until surgery can be performed.

After using the drug, I can breathe through my nose again, and I have less mucus to blow out every morning. I feel better in general because I sneeze less. Side effects I've experienced are blood clots in my nose, light bleeding, and sores in my nose. It hurts when I touch my nose from the outside. I am not sure whether to continue using it or not...because I do enjoy the clear nose.

Now, I'm not so sure.  My right side keeps clogging up if I don't use something, so I'm having to use Rhinocort at least every 2nd or 3rd day now (although, I know, that is not per the recommended dosage).  I may have something weird going on in my nasal passage or in one or more of my sinusus.  Anyway, the biggest thing I want to say is that all side effects have resolved themselves - other than every once in a while I may get a slight headache that is easy to trea / goes away soon enough.  I don't know about the other corticosteroids, but Rhinocort (budesonide) works well with minimal side effects.  From the very beginning (within 4 to 6 hours) I was doing much better.

Long time snoring problem (years and years).  Sleep doc asked about congestion - yes, I've been more congested this year than others - always blowing nose to clear sinus build-up.  On this med, my husband says I don't snore as much ans when I do snore, it is not nearly as loud.  Am very happy - no side effects experienced.

I also get short of breath easily and my heart beats weird right after I use it.  I really hope these symptoms go away because I'd like to continue using the spray.

At the same time, it gave me a headache, made it a little difficult to concentrate, and gave me a feeling not unlike that of acid reflux.  I used Rhinocort 7 years ago and it worked great - and I don't remember these negative side effects then.

However, I have a little suspicion that my appetite disruption &amp; light-headedness throughout the said period might be due to its side-effects.

Also always have blood in nasial fluid when blow nose.  Suspect part of my issues with dizziness and weakness may be a result of this medication.
