Other	Rog, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male		4/15/2012 1:08:09 PM	I have an urgency to go to the toilet around 4:30am to 7:30am. I was on .1mg but the doctor moved me up to .2. The .2 is doing a better job than the .1 but I was wondering if a .3mg would be OK to take?
Other	Guinea Pig, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	65-74	6/14/2011 3:41:08 PM	I was a subject in a study testing the efficacy of desmopressin to relieve nighttime urination in adults.  For that purpose it worked excellently. In the 35 days I was on the study,  I went from voiding 3 to 4 times per night before the study to once or no times per night.  HOWEVER, the quality and quantity of my sleep went down significantly.  While on the drug, I was getting 1 to 2 hours less sleep per night, and I generally felt froggy during the day. I napped much more frequently while on the drug.The study was slated to last for 90 or 120 days.  I was removed from the study group after 35 days because I twice tested at too-low sodium levels.

Bedwetting	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	4	3	Female	13-18	3/13/2010 5:16:11 PM	My son has been taking the medication for 2 weeks. The first week he only had 1 nite of wetness. Now it's not working so well, ever night he's been a little wet.His dr. wants him to take it a couple of more weeks than he need to be weaned off the meds. His dr. does not want him to take the drug long term since it is not a cure. She feels children that bed wet are missing a connection in the brain to instinctively get up at nite and go to the bathroom. We can only use it for trips. Dr.'s recommend using a bell/bedwetting method when a child starts to go it wakes them up so they learn to get up.

I couln't stop the excessive intake of fluids untill my doctor finally did a overnight study on my thirst. This Medication is amazing, and am completely greatfull for it. It has even helped my sleeping habits get back to normal. Of course if a miss a dose or &quot;forget&quot; to take it, my family knows right away. I drink up everyting in sight.

Therefore,I was diagnosed with diabetes insepidus. I was prescribed desmopressin. I take one pill in the morning, and one and a half pills in the evening. I have had no problems with this medication. I now can drink normally and pee normally. The only thing I am having problems with is the cost of it. It is expensive, but that is another story.

He is up to 3 .2mg pills before and this has been completly ineffective. This is so easy to use and sounds like something he can really benefit from. very disappointed.

I take 2 .112mg tablets at bedtime.  Results are some days I can go up to 8 hours without urinating, other days it's every hour or so.  I wake on average 2X a night for restroom.  My surgery was in Mar 08 and correct dosage has not yet been determined but we are close.

It did not keep him from bedwetting. We tried doubling the dose, still no luck. We were afraid to go higher because of possible side effects.

Without it, I honestly think I'd be tied to the house because of extremely frequent need to urinate huge amounts of unconcentrated fluid. With the drug three times a day, I can go out for a few hours without worrying. It's been almost 2 years now, and I think I'll be taking it the rest of my life.
Bedwetting	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	4/24/2008 4:43:25 PM	i am a personal user of DDAVP..im 15 years old now and my parents and i finally went to see a doctor about my &quot;problem&quot;. My kidneys are like  awesome now even though i dont take DDAVP anymore. I stopped after my 2nd checkup-w/o doctor notification and it took me a while to re-adjust but after about 2-3 months im great, bedwet free and everything!so i encourage the use but see a doctor first=]
Bedwetting	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	5	Male	13-18	4/4/2008 2:05:15 PM	My son had been successfully taking this medication for 9 yrs now, his doctor says he'll stop bedwetting one day and then we can discontinue use. I feel that this is a long time to take this medication. My son is now 16 yrs old and when he doesn't take the medication, he wets the bed. I've taken him to a specialist and he tells me the same thing. Do I have reason for concern?

He is 12 years old, and honestly we were tired of waiting to see if he would outgrow the bedwetting. We are pleased with the results and also are prayerful that he will be able to stay dry when we stop the medication.
Bedwetting		5	5	5			10/18/2007 8:53:10 AM	9yr old son was wetting multiple times nightly...feeling self conscious having to wear pull-ups every night, he has taken this med for 3 months-- and it works wonderfully!  He never forgets to take it and feels better about himself!! We will try to taper off in 3 more months per MD's recommendation.... and hopefully he won't need this med any longer....but for now----YEAH!
Bedwetting	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/18/2007 10:22:42 AM	when my 9 year old son spends the night at a friend's house he takes 2 .2mg pills.  He never wets the bed when he takes this medication and therefore doesn't have to worry about being embarressed. It's been a blessing for him to have this medication available.
