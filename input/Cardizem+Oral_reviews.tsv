Supraventricular Cardiac Arrhythmia	jerryinoz, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male		3/17/2012 12:05:38 AM	To those who say they are having severe leg pain on this drug --- yes indeed! This medication and all others in the same class can cause severe leg and muscle problems. If this happens to you contact your doctor immediately. You need to be off it! I am having severe problems with dizziness, extreme tiredness and weakness since being put on Cardizem. I will stop taking it ASAP. This is the third calcium channel blocker my cardiologist has tried and I am not able to take any of them. I was much better without it. So, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!!

Other	Dave, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	9/25/2011 3:59:39 AM	I've been taking this med for a week for irregular heatbeat ( my heart skips a beat every so often) and I haven't really noticed much difference in my symptoms. I have a low heart rate ( about 50 to 60 bpm ) and have to monitor my heart rate often on this med. I take 60mg twice a day and haven't noticed any real side affects other than some dizziness. Overall, if you take this med and it helps you, you probably can tolorate it very well.

High Blood Pressure	Shore, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	45-54	2/12/2011 9:44:41 PM	MY doctor prescribed this med after neck surgery.  I was having difficulty swallowing my 300mg capsules (CD). Due to post-op swelling, I crushed these pills in ice cream to take them.  The CD cannot be crushed. Took until swelling went down, then went back on cardizem CD 300mg daily. This pill saved me when I could not swallow.

Other	chappy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/16/2010 8:06:57 AM	a few weeks ago I had a attack of atrial fib.. and spent the night in the hospital.my pulse was at 175 beats per minute and my b/p was high and the doctors had given me lopressor but didnt work and then gave me this med and it brought it down, so I was sent home with this med and the only side effect I have had was some heartburn during the day and then some weakness but went away after about a week. as for the lady that cant pick up her head and having a hard time.. contact your doctor.. it may be more than the med. I take it at night.. also are you taking it with other meds. sometimes interactions happen.. try taking it at night without any other meds or at least wait 1 hour before taking other meds. so far the med seems to be working for me. there will be some side effects but usually go away after a few weeks. but after that if you are still having problems contact your doctor just dont stop taking the med. also it might be the wrong dose. I am taking 120mg once a day. try taking it at bedtime. that way the side effects wont bother you as much. if your blood pressure drops to low, you may experience weird feelings too. cause this med does bring down your b/p. just some helpful hints.
