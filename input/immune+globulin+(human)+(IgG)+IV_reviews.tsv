It didn't. And finally I stopped it altogether because I was developing an adverse reaction to the treatment.

I have dizzyness and sometimes my my brain gets what you may say cloudy not being able to remember things clearly Im in my 50's and find this quite frustrating overall it has been great to have the Igg infusions as I was bed ridden and now i am free to do what I like allmost oh and sometimes suffer from constipation but I do take nexium and the Magneism helps me along all in all I am greatfull to be alive!
Absence of Gamma Globulins in the Blood	Stillfighten, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	25-34	7/27/2011 12:37:43 PM	I have been on ivig now for roughly seven months. I went from looking like the walking dead to somewhat healthy. I wish i felt as good as I looked. I was sick for five years straight with everything in the book that normal people get and fight off in days. I would be sick for months. I hope my success w the drug continues. I do get severe side effects especially if they infuse too fast. I get dizzy, headaches, nausea, fatigue. I believe this drug saved my life. I have about one quarter of the infections now. Still way more than a healthy person but i hope it to get better.

My first treatment was over 7 days, now I receive the same dosage in 3 days. To begin with I needed it every 2-3 months but have gradually gotten to every 6-8 months. The difference it makes in my strength and over all feeling of well being is tremendous. For me there has been no side affects.

Other	Shellyhshell, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	2/3/2010 4:36:26 PM	I have polymyositis.  I started ivig about 5 years ago.  In the begining I had treatments biweekly and currently I go every 3 weeks for 2 days.  When I first started treatment I was barely able to walk, now I am much stronger.  In the begining it have me huge headaches however now that the hospital changed from the powder form too liquid form the headaches are rare.  Last year I thought ivig wasn't really helping but then I missed 2 treatments in a row and quickly went downhill to the point where it was very difficult to walk.  I realized that the treatments were a great benifit.  Getting a iv needle stuck in your arm every few weeks damages the vains and is Very painfull.  If you are getting ivig on a regular basis I highly recomend getting a port.  I wouldn't be as well of as I am today if ot wasn't for ivig.  The treatments are ridiculously expensive, mine being over $20,000 a shot.

Myasthenia Gravis	sns92, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	13-18	9/2/2009 2:04:05 AM	I've had Myasthenia Gravis for about 4 months now. I started IVIG transfusions immediately the day I was daignosed with the disease. It has helped me tremendously with my muscle weakness. The only side effects I get are fatigue, loss of appitite, and nasuea. 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	kayandchase, 45-54 Female 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/31/2009 6:58:45 PM	I received this IGG IV while in the hospital for newly diagnosed auto immune lupus-like disorder. Was $10,000 per day for five days treatment....but....brought my labs from critical to normal in five days! Does make you nervous/tearful feeling or it did me....they gave me Xanax each day befor starting it on MD recommendation....was a miracle drug....
Other	halfwhit, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/28/2009 8:53:49 PM	I have had dermatomyositis for about 6 years.  I started IGIV about 6 months after being diagnosed, doing 4 half days a month.  Changed it to 2 half days every two weeks to start.  The first time was terrible. I had the first and worst migrane I had ever had.  However, the side effects decreased to the point I haven't had migrane in years.  I now get treatment once every 7 weeks.  At first, I could not walk, pick my self up if i fell, swallow... horrible.  Now I have virtually no symtoms whatsoever.  My PA says I am stronger than she is.  My advise... Take it, keep your head down and keep moving.  It'll be work it.  
Hypogammaglobulinemia associated with Recurrent Bacterial Infections	Slr, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	1	5	Female	35-44	7/15/2009 3:17:59 AM	After leaving the mayo clinic with a few  diagnoses;  lupus, hypogammaglobulinemia, and an &quot;unidentified immune disorder&quot;,  I began ivig treatments. I go every month and take 8 hour infusions. On Those days I feel awful along with 1 or 2 additional days.  However, the rest of the month I feel....like a normal person. I'm not constantly sick anymore. When I do get sick, the Medicine actually works.....I don't end up in the hospital. I've been doing this for almost 3 years. I am thankful for all the donors that make each transfussion possile (since thousands of donors are are necessary for a single treatment.)   
Guillain-Barre Syndrome	bevijea, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	3/16/2009 11:14:26 PM	I was given this drug for Guillain barre syndrome. After 7 treatments it has helped me so much. I wasn't able to walk without assistance, bath myself and it was hard for me to use my hands, now I am walking on my own and can do the simple things I wasn't able to do. I had no side effects and the only negative thing was I had to be admitted to the hospital since they didnt give this treatment as an outpatient
Other	Kacky1945, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	55-64	1/27/2009 10:03:17 PM	I received IVIG in Oct, Nov and Dec 08 for 2 consecutive days as an outpatient in a Boston Hosp for symptoms of Dermatomyositis.  It helped my muscular weakness and balance problems significantly, but did little to help the skin problems of redness, heliotrope rash and intolerable itch , particularly of the scalp.  A Dermatologist prescribed topical steroids to be used twice daily for 2 weeks, and then off  for 1 week, and I have continued this program, with about 80% relief of the skin problems.  I am most grateful for these IV and topical treatments which have improved the quality of my life greatly.  I no longer fall down and have more strength in my arms and legs and can lift more weight than before Rx .My first Rheumatologist could not provide the IVIG regime (which I am continuing for 2 days on every third month), ie, on one month and off for two months.  I got a second opinion and chose another  Rheumatologist who arranged for the IVIG after MRIs and lab work and assessment.  It has changed my life! I'm grateful that my insurance covers most of the cost.  It is very expensive.

It has been a terrible experience. Horrible headache, rash, dizzyness, Lower &amp; mid back pain.  If this is what it is going to be like with each treatment I am not sure this is what i want to do on a monthly basis.  For such an expensive treatment.  I cant be missing 4 days a work after each treatment because of side affects.

I also was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in Sept.2006. I received 5 days of IVIG in 10/2007. I failed to follow up and by 12/2007 was so weak I couldn't get out of bed or a chair without the help of my 84 year old mother. I also needed to use her walker in order to get around. I had 5 more treatments the last 2 days of Dec. 2006 and first few days of Jan. 2007. I improved significantly in mobility after that. I received 5 more treatments in Feb. and from March until now (Nov. 2007) receive 3 treatments each month.

The expense is enormous  5,ooo.oo for each infusion.
