He took it along with Xalatan. For two years)Doctor said stop taking the Timolol.  No one at the eye doctor caught this because they never took his BP.  It was caught by his regular doctor. Eye doctors need to check you Blood Pressure and heart rate as well as Just Your Eyes.
High Eye Pressure or Glaucoma that May Worsen without Treatment	Jim, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	6/29/2010 1:17:39 PM	My doctor tried me on this medication. I started having a rapid heart beat and skipping beats. Had a few emergency room visits, costly ones, before it was determined that Timolol caused the heart problems. My blood pressure meds were changed with every ER visit. It cost me tons of money on the Co-Pays. Who knew an eye drop could cause cardiac problems? Now I use Marijuana exclusively, with a prescription, and two puffs three times a day keeps my IOPs at 18 and 20. No Side Effects!

IT WAS GREAT BUT I HAD TO STOP BECAUSE IT WAS CAUSING MY HEART TO SKIP BEATS [WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT TILL I HAD A ECOCARDIAGRAM] I WAS SURPRIZED CAUSE I HAD NO ILL FEELINGS. WISH I COULD STILL USE IT CAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY DROP THAT DIDN'T MAKE MY EYES BURN AND STING AND GET RED.
Wide-Angle Glaucoma	Ivy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/22/2008 7:19:52 PM	I gave this 5 stars because it worked perfectly for me for 20+ years.  However, lately, the pressure started creeping up to the point where I have had to add another eyedrop with the timoptic.  The pressure is coming down again.  But, overall, never a problem with the timoptic.
