Bipolar Depression	PBY, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	45-54	7/19/2010 4:26:52 PM	I have had bi-polar for 35 years.  I had been on Lithium several years ago and hated the dead feeling it produced.  Other than weight gain, I had no side effects.  I tried a variety of newer drugs all of which failed in controlling my manic episodes so I am back on Lithium.  Like before, I gained 30 pounds...not a great side effect, and at my age a whole lot harder to take off.  This time though I have had to contend with hand tremors.  I was reduced from 1200 mg a day to 900 mg's a day in hopes of reducing the number of tremors.  They have slightly reduced but are still present.  It makes it very hard to work when your hands are trembling uncontrollably.  This can occur several times an hour.  My doctor has said that it is a common side effect of Lithium and that my levels are right where they need to be.    
Bipolar Depression	lbarrett692003, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/11/2010 6:35:40 PM	I have suffered from depression for 26 years, and all the Drs said the same thing, depression. I have tried every single &quot;antidepressant&quot; drug with no relief, yet suffered all of the side effects, I was finally tierd of SSRI's and a horribile life. I went to a Pshychiatrist and was finally given a correct medication for bipolar, I was first put on Limictal, but developed a rash on my hands, now I am taking Lithium 600mg Bid, what a difference, night and day, although Lithium is not for all, but for me it works, with little side effects, I have to pee alot, and iits hard to hold in, I also dont want weight gain, so I limit my eating. and restrict snacking, and make my self walk our dog. Thank god the stigma of taking Lithium is of days past, Im finally doing things, and living life. Lisa
Manic-Depression	angeleyes, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	5/3/2010 7:15:19 PM	I was on this med. for about 15 years before a new doctor decided to change my meds.Stopped any manic episodes as long as i took it right! and kept me pretty well balanced. I did have slight hand tremors, but with time they were barely noticable. I had some but not much weight gain. Now my doctor has passed away and I was left &quot;out in the cold&quot; trying to find a new pdoc. I was tried on lamictal with bad anxiety effects and no mania control, abilify and will never go there again! I would go back on Lithium and endure the blood tests because it worked so well...for years. Now to find a doctor who is not wanting to push the &quot;newer&quot; drugs and maybe stick with what is tried and true. this drug is a winner and that is why they call it THE GOLD STANDARD.

The Lithobid ER (Lith Carb 300 mg)600n mgs at night stopped my crazy head and I could actually follow a thought. GREAT. THEN: Hard muscle cramps, muscle weakness and extreme tiredness. I slept 24/7interupted at least every1.5 hours over muscle cramps, the next time to pee then both constantly. Grogged is how I ended up. I dropped it back on my own to 300 mg ER but the thoughts started speeding up...like now. Muscles still draw but not as bad and certainly don't pee as much.At my Drs. today. Tryng Eskalith 450.MY GRIPE: I was ordered Lithobid ER and got Lith Carb 300 ER byRoxane. Today ordered Eskalith CR and got Lith Carb 450 ER by nWedt-Ward in it's place. What the hell???????? What's the difference? I AM ANGRY. It's MY head being dicked with!!!

Bipolar Disorder in Remission	sjh1448, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/21/2009 11:41:58 PM	I have been taking Lithium for 12 years.  I am sure there are mild side effects that I experience, but I have been taking it for a third of my life now so I don't really know the difference.  It is so worth any mild side effects.  I am happily married and planning a pregnancy.  This wouldn't be possible without Lithium.  The key (and with any medication prescribed daily) is to take it EVERY day no matter if you want to or not.  You just have to accept that you need it even when you feel fine.  Sometimes I wonder about the long term effects and will begin to do research but I would rather be happy and live a healthy life now and many, many years to come.  Also, for anyone wanting a family some day - my doctor recommends Lithium for being the safest for the fetus if take meds during pregnancy.

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	19-24	5/17/2008 3:51:51 AM	I was started on Lamictal - which worked great, but I had an allergic reaction.  I was switched to lithium, and it's amazing.  It's the first time since I was diagnosed with Bipolar I that I've found a medication that really works.  I can't express how grateful I am for this med.  The biggest downside, though, (which is often too much for people) is that it makes you really thirsty all the time, you sometimes feel like you're overheating, and you need frequent blood tests to check the levels (which I have to do anyway because of the Depakote, so it's less of an issue for me).

Manic-Depression		1	1	1			11/8/2007 5:32:05 PM	I began taking this and in a few days had tremors. Stopped for a few days and then restarted at a lower dose and once again had tremor and had to go to the emergency room. I know this drug can be great for some people, but they don't tell you that there are people who just can't tolerate lithium.
Bipolar Depression	Jamiepisces44, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/19/2007 7:31:05 AM	I am 45 and have been bi polar for over 20 years. This medication has worked wonders for me and given me back my life. I tried Lamictal but it enhanced certain manic episodes and even caused additional problems, but Lithium has worked so far. I have gained a few pounds but otherwise I can only see good.
