Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Unhappy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	8/31/2012 9:38:05 PM	I have only been on this medication for a 3 days. It does work and it works quickly. After using it with in 5 minutes I can feel the congestion in my sinuses break up. With that said, I can also feel MANY side effects.When I feel the congestion breaking up, it slides down my nasal passages and into the back of my throat (very normal) but the medication burns my throat and I can taste it at times. The taste is awful but all this I am ok with-it just means that it is doing its job. I have a constant runny nose instead of a stuffy nose... which led to sores from a constant need to use tissues. Again all ok. Mild side effects.The side effects that are NOT OK are severe drowsiness and very painful ear pain. An hour- to two hours after taking this medication I am beyond tired. I feel loopy and slightly disoriented. I didn't associate these symptoms initally with this medication since I am on other allergy medications too (allegra and singulair which I only take at night), BUT since this is taken 2x a day and the others only 1x.. Ive noticed that an hour or so after taking this in the morning by itself- I feel these side effects in the morning as well as in the evening. My ears were filled with fluid prior to taking this medication. I am very used to fluid in my middle ear and barely felt it but after taking this medication they hurt almost every time I swallow and will randomly ache. Which makes me think that this medication is effecting my eustachian tubes somehow.

It causes no side effects for me and I use it whenever my nose is clogged up and immediatly I can breathe good and have no sinus pressure. This is wonderful and I reccomend it!
Other	MeeMee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	8/5/2011 5:38:47 PM	ENT prescribed this after I complained of headache, vertigo, fullness in ears, and other allergy symptoms.  First dose worked quickly to reduce sinus congestion.  So far, so good - I hope it continues to work.  I did experience a small amount of drowsiness after dosage.

Could not take a chance of continuing to get sick so I had to stop using it.

I take Xyzal daily, and I was using another prescription spray, but it was less effective than saline. My ENT suggested this, and all I have to say is wow!  It makes my sinuses drain, without fail, withing thirty minutes of use.  For someone with chronic sinusitis, this is huge.  I still suffer a little, but at least I can function, and that is a big step in the right direction!   
Seasonal Runny Nose	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	5/12/2011 10:27:23 AM	I was prescribed this by my ENT and I LOVE it! For many years, I have had constant post-nasal drip and sinus problems. I mean, anything and everything caused my nose to run (change of temperature, flowers, exercising, eating, etc.) and it was very annoying to say the least.  I had to walk around with a tissue 24/7. This is the only medicine that has ever relieved this symptom and I've tried all of them--Allegra, Zyrtec, Nasonex, Astelin, etc. The taste is not pleasant but not the worst thing ever.  I did have a slight headache when I first started using but that has subsided. My ENT said to use twice a day but I have been using it once a day in the morning (two pumps in each nostril) and it was worked beautifully.  My only complaint is the cost. Luckily my ENT had a sample with a coupon so I was able to get $40 off, which still made the cost with insurannce around $80. It's totally worth it to me though.  The difference is amazing!

Please check with your druggist if you are taking other medications so you know if there is a possible problem.  Druggist have a better knowledge base than doctors who don't dedicate as much time to medication effects.   The druggist knows and keeps track of when and if a person gets drugs refilled.   I am glad my husband quit taking it.  He does not complain now about facial pain, so maybe it is just not  a long term drug.   But it can cause facial swelling probably after it has done it's job.

The bad taste is starting to taste good because I know I won't be sick and can concentrate on my school and work. Last semester of college was really hard because my head was always congested and I always felt like crap. This stuff has given me my life back. And I can stop getting immune to antibiotics I may need to save my life someday!

The price is what I'm not pleased with.  I'm trying to figure if $150.00 for one bottle of nasal spray is worth it.  Insurance did pay $50.00

I read some reviews and I think people are spraying it incorrectly. I was told to spray it into the nose and do not breath in deeply.  The medication should stay in the nose and not go down the throath.  This way it stops the pollens before in get into your airways.  I use this in conjunction NASONEX.  No side effects at all if you use it properly. Works wonderful.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	55-64	5/25/2010 3:08:21 PM	The problems I have with the medication has more to do with the design of the bottle and the instructions for use. It's awkward to get the dose in my nose, hold one side and spray the other.  The twice a day is a problem as I used to take an oral med once per day.  It works great when I get it in my nose correctly.

As another reviewer mentioned, after I started using it I developed a sinus infection which I was trying to avoid by using this medication. My throat becomes sore after using this product and rinse my nose out with saline solution on a regular basis so it is not that congested. I have tried so many nasal sprays and none of them have helped my ears unclog. I have been using it for a month now along with Nasonex, and Allegra-D; my allergies are still out of control.
