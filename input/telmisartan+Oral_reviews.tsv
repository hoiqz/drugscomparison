My blood pressure is under control and normal, and I have had no side effects from this drug.  Previously I was taking Lisinopril which caused severe coughing spells, which my doctor thought was due to asthma and bronchitis.  I switched from Lisinopril to Telmisartan and both the asthma and coughing spells went away.
