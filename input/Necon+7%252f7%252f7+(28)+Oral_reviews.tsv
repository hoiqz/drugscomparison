Birth Control	packersbadgers12, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	9/30/2012 3:44:00 PM	At first it made my mood uncontrollable but after a few months it calmed down. I gained a little weight but it's not noticeable and my boobs grew almost a cup size so i can't complain. Spotting, cramps, and acne breakouts were pretty bad at first also.
Birth Control	nicole, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	9/1/2012 12:49:12 PM	I gained weight and have high blood pressure sometimes cramping is not always bad. Had some chest pain recently not sure what the reason was for that.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/8/2012 8:19:35 PM	It is the only one that I have tried that has regulated my periods. And of course kept me from getting pregnant. However, its made me sweat more than I used to. I also never had a yeast infection before this, but I don't know for sure if that is related.
Birth Control	nothappy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	3/22/2012 9:43:08 PM	I have been on this medication for a month and a half and have gained 12 pounds. No change in diet or physical activity. Just this med. I am not happy!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/21/2012 5:19:24 PM	I have had horrible headaches and confusion while taking this medicine. Also I have a slight speech impediment and it seem as if it has gotten worse since I have been on this medicine.
Other	FyreWyre, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/2/2011 11:30:38 AM	I'm taking this both as a contraceptive and to help regulate my periods. I am only on day 8 but am completely satisfied! I am not gaining weight (and I am already big so that's a good thing), and I have not experienced any of the other problems I had with Mirena, Paragard, or NuvaRing. I have had horrible headaches, intense and prolonged painful bleeding, insane mood swings, and awful cramps with all of those products, but now I am actually satisfied. I didn't want to use a pill because I was worried about remembering to take it, and was concerned about the hormones negatively affecting me as they have in the past - but I am actually thrilled with Necon 777, and I think this will be a great option for me. 
Birth Control	finallyfoundone, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/27/2011 5:25:49 PM	I have tried 6 other pill brands with multiple side effects (weight gain, headaches, sweat fits, cramps) before my doctor finally switched me to Necon 777. Its been a life saver so far. The ONLY one that actually regulated my period. I did retain water a bit more than usual but it quickly left when my period did. Highly recommend!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	4/26/2011 1:13:42 AM	I am going on week three of a very heavy period. That's really all I have to complain about. It hasn't effected anything else, so I'm just going to give it another month to see if it regulates. I'm pretty satisfied with it overall. 
Birth Control	godbless, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	4/20/2011 2:42:34 PM	Ladies, we are all different. For one, I have tried Losestrin and Seasonique (UNFORTUNATLY). Necon has cleared up my skin (mind you, i did not have terrible acne before using it)...I have VERY light periods with slight cramps...it has not made me gain weight but i also watch my salt intake (as every woman should do when taking birth control, as it will make you retain more water)...i dont really get all the horror stories of this specific birth control. It has been excellent for me and its done its job!
Birth Control	tawboomer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	10/22/2010 3:18:28 PM	My skin broke out, severe cramps (on a period that lasted 3 weeks with heavy bleeding), and my mood was uncontrollable.  I have taken other birth control in the past but this one just took its toll on me.I just didn't feel like myself on this one- my moods were up and down.  And the long period was so hard to take.  
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	13-18	8/24/2010 3:30:27 AM	I had horrible cramps and break through bleeding all the time. I stopped it mid-cycle because of all the symptoms. I had dizzy spells and headaches, too. Still haven't got my period and I got off it 11 days ago.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	5/3/2010 7:24:08 PM	I've been on it for months and have had horrible cramps, can not lose weight, and just started getting really bad chest pains. So now Im looking for a new birth control :( Any suggestions...
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	4/7/2010 10:44:24 PM	I love this pill, however the satisfaction rating isn't as high since I have a hard time remembering to take it sometimes. I haven't had any problems from this and I have been on many different types of Birth Control. I don't have former problems I had like; vomiting for hours on end, severe migraines, severe stomach cramps, very bad depression, weight gain 10 lbs or so, muscle cramps and other annoying things.
Painful Periods	bobee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	35-44	3/3/2010 10:42:09 AM	This medication decreaed my appetitie (I have lost weight). I started taking the medication because of painful periods. It did not work for that. My vision has changed drastically in my left eye, and I have increased vaginal fluids. My menses still lasted 7 days but the flow has not been as heavy.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	1/18/2010 1:22:24 AM	I love this pill. I've been on it for three years and recommend it to all my friends. The only downfall was I gained about 5 pounds but other than that it's great.
