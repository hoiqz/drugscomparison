Bronchitis	highlander, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	4	2	Male	65-74	12/25/2009 7:54:44 PM	My 5 year old granddaughter, after taking this medication, has become a very beligerant child and has sessions of thinking that everyone hates her and she goes into a panic mode and starts hitting and kicking everyone and thing around.  It takes about 15 to 20 minutes for her to calm down and be her sweet self again.  There must be something in the drug that is affecting her thought process.  Her mother is going to talk with Dr Monday and see if there is another med that will help without these outrages.

Medicine took care of the croupy cough though. Not sure we will give 2nd dose or use again!!
Asthma	mfranke1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	5/27/2009 9:26:30 PM	This is the 3rd time in a year that my 4 1/2 year old son has been on this.  Although I am happy with the job it does, I DO NOT LIKE the really negative side effects it gives him:  excessive sweating (his head is soaked within 1 hour of him taking a very low dose (15 mg), very rapid heart rate, and this is the 2nd time he has had cramping and tingling in his fingers (both hands, all different fingers).  I'm thinking of reportint the finger thing to the FDA.  Has anyone else had this side effect?
Asthma	Jlee52003@aol.com, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	3/23/2009 8:47:34 PM	My son is 3.5 and has increasing trouble with asthma. His doctors don't like to give him this medication because of potential side effects although I haven't experienced any as of yet except for a little hyperactivity the first and second day.  This is the fifth time in a year he has been on it at a dose of 1 tsp. twice daily for 4/5 days.  It always seems to help along with his nebulizer.  I am researching Orapred to find out exactly what all the bad side effects are.  His doctors also put him on Singulair as a preventative medicine and the side effects from that have been far worse.  I just found a website (Askapatient.com) that listed several pages of complaints about that particular medication but so far I haven't found as many complaints in regards to Orapred.  If anyone has any further info - I'd love to hear about it....

I noticed he is very thirsty but can't figure out if this is normal side effect.  He was initially hyper the 1st day but ok the second.  no improvement has been seen yet.
Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/7/2009 6:57:36 AM	My 2 1/2  yr old had symptoms of croup and our 1st time using this (last night) we were supposed to give him 2 doses..He turned into the tazmanian devil...very destructive (even more than normal). But aside from that, the &quot;barkiness&quot; is gone and so far, it's just regular coughing  
Asthma	allendory, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	5	1	Female	7-12	3/2/2009 7:52:22 AM	My 9 yr old daughter has been taking this for 4 days now.  The cough has somewhat decreased but the side effects were not worth the medication.  She's had upset stomach, restlessness, stabbing feelings in her chest, legs and arms, &amp; dizziness.  Would not use again.
Asthma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	2/4/2009 9:36:36 PM	My son, 6, was put on this for his wheezing and bad cough, along with breathing treatments and an inhaled steroid.  After two days, his coughing and wheezing is gone. So far, I'm happy with the results.  It also helps clear up his eczema.  Only side effects are increased appetite and a little upset stomach.

We usually have to do breathing treatments along with the Orapred. After 3 days ,his personality changes (more aggressive). But on the whole I like that it works rather quickly.
