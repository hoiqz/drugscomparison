I actually felt better than normal.

I just recently stopped taking them,I was concerned about the length of time I have been on them and things have been horrible since I stopped, nite sweats,hot flashes,mood swings and NO desire. I'm ready to go back to taking them again. It worked wonders for me!

Had to be tested for possible blood clot.  The test was negative but it still makes me nervous to think about continued use.

Having had a hyst 7-8 yrs ago, I will fight you if you try to take me off. It has worked great and 'the change' is not anything I want to deal with now. I am 58 and so far...so good! We have to mail out meds into the insurance co...I pay the extra to be able to take them. I do not want to 'try' other brands...it works!!

The times I have taken a break from using cenestin was very hard to deal with because of hot flashes, and sweating. It definately helps with post-menapause.It also helps with maintaing a healthy relation ship with my husband!

I have had the hot flashes and night sweats taken care of. The only drawback for me is the really dark splotches on my face. I have freckles and this makes it worse. I have recently stopped taking it and the splotches have almost cleared up. I have been able so far to deal with the mood swings and hot flashes.

Mood swings, hot flashes and night sweats are gone. Intimacy has become improved considerably.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	45-54	8/11/2009 5:07:33 AM	I had a hysterectomy and had to go on HRT because of the side effects. The Cenestin was great in keeping the emotions and hot flashes pretty much at a standstill, but I didn't know about the side effect of the dark brown spots that it would leave on my face. I now have to have a large spot, about the size of a quarter lasered because of the Cenestin. This does not happen with everyone, I just happen to be one of the unlucky ones. I've since changed to a different HRT and developed a dvt, so now I am no longer allowed to be on any HRT, so I have to deal with the emotions and hot flashes.

Eventually I would like to get off these meds, I'm not willing to deal with the awful symptoms I experienced without HRT. They have worked wonders.

I am also on prometrium. The combination has worked for me and I do not plan on getting off of the hormones any time soon.  For me...they have worked.
