Effective for fibromyalgia pain, however, after many months of use, you need more to achieve the same result of lessening pain. Can cause withdrawal symptoms if discontinue abruptly. Everyone is right - terrible taste!

Pain	Painfree, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/5/2009 12:03:47 PM	I have asked my Doctor to let me try it b/c I am horrified at the war in Afghanistan to protect Poppy fields.  I have used Demerol for nearly 7 years w/ no real bad effects.  However I was noticing an increase in cranial pressure (w/ the demerol) &amp; swollen eyes the last two scripts I had &amp; just an overall ill feeling.  I have only used the Talwin for two days now, but do not feel the cranial pressure like w/ demerol &amp; it seems to be effective,thus fa, for my pain (which is severe pain).  Also I had trouble keeping an appetite w/ demerol not so w/ the Talwin..I ate like I had the munchies yesterday!!! LOL  so, at this point I am plased w/ it &amp; hope I can encourage others who are using opiates to try it.  It is a class four so monthly visits are not necessary to get it ( it can be refilled)...Please people consider our men &amp; women in war &amp; don't contribute to it.  Let them keep their poppies....The US has developed this one &amp; it works fine!!!

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	5/15/2009 9:37:51 AM	My Dr perscribed this after tylenol 3 had no effect. I took it the first time in the day. Seemed to help with the pain. Then I took before I went to bed. I couldnt sleep at all and when my alarm went off this morning my legs feel as if i drove cross country in the backseat of a gocart. I am more miserable than i was before I took the medication.
Pain	SJinTexas, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	55-64	4/23/2009 9:39:50 PM	Taken for last two weeks for pain in wrist due to proximal row carpectomy.  Not really effective, but better than nothing.  Have tried Vicodin in past and noted almost no pain relief (torn rotator cuff and bone spur) from it, so tried this.

Pain	rangerdog, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	11/30/2008 8:34:14 PM	I take this med for pain in my feet and have been taking it for a little over a year. Yes, it does taste HORRIBLE,however I take a big sip of water first, then the pill and it seems to do better that way. It takes a little while before it starts working, but it does relieve my pain. I haven't had any side effects from this pill,but I do have to take a Benadryl about 20 or 30 min. beforehand, so it doesn't make me itch. I have to take it before I do anything involving being on my feet. I have found that it really has taken care of the pain,especially at night, so that I can be able to sleep. 
Pain	 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male		11/10/2008 10:20:05 AM	The taste of the pills are horrible, the pain relief is minimal at most, and did i say the taste is horrible. I cannot say it enough that the taste is nauseating enough to feel the pain than throw up. maybe a little dramatic but common they must of figured that out in prelim testing. coat it in cherry or grape they do it all the time, but other than little pain relief and the inconveniences it offers I would of liked to stayed with my previous pain reliever, TramadolXR, it worked it was once a day and ya didn't taste it, I have Arthritis in my lower back and 2 herniated discs in my neck which from day to day causes servere to light pain, weather sleep habit, activity habits ect. also effect pain.  but besides going on heavier pain meds Tramadol has done a lot of great things in the almost 9 months using it, only reason I stopped was a developed resistance which is normal so when my resistance subsides I'll gladly resume.  Hope it was helpful but stay away you can read in the drug description it try's to stop dependency so it obviosly isn't a great drug.
Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	9/8/2008 3:22:15 AM	I was perscribed this medication for low back pain from arthritis. At the time I was also having pain from a broken wrist which developed into carpal tunnel syndrome.  I was given it because I am alergic to most perscribed pain killers.  Pills taste TERRIBLE and dissolve in my mouth quicker than I can swallow.  I ended up taking one every 4 hours (Rx was 1 evert=y 4-6 hrs) and used up the Rx before time for a refill.When I saw my doc the next time he lowered my dose to 1 every 6 hrs.  They were effective for the low back pain but did nothing for the wrist pain.  Since I was awakend during the night with the severe wrist pain I would take another (or two) but they still didn't seem to work.  Before I noticed it, I had used what was to have been a 3 month supply in 6 weeks.  I intend to stop taking them except for the low back pain and use EXACTLY as perscribed.  My Medicare Part D plan did not cover them and I really can't afford to pay for them.

Pain	Lady unicorn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/18/2008 9:38:09 PM	I had a tooth pulled that cracked.  I have had other meds that helped on pain but this pentazocine/naloxone does not seem to work.  It makes me sleepy is all it does.  It was not worth $1.80 a pill.  I feel ripped off.
