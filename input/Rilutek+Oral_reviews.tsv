Other	Niarajud, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	5/8/2012 1:13:08 PM	My husband has ALS and he took this medication for two weeks.  I noticed a difference in him within the first week.  It made him weaker and he was not able to function as good has he had before starting it. The second week on it he noticed the difference and he stopped taking it.  The Dr has said it will slow the progression of ALS by six months, one of the side effects is muscle weakness and with ALS you sure do not need to be taking something with muscle weakness as a side effect. From my research one of the causes of ALS  toxins in the body, so my husband has a regular detox footbath.  We are trying natural supplements.  He was diagnosed 2 years ago and is doing pretty good right now.

Second liver function test abnormal, third less so. Feeling more fatigued and seems to be increasing rather than maintaining former levels. Edema in my lower legs presumably because of more difficulty with mobility. Have developed insomnia over the last couple of weeks. I'm going to keep up until I see my doc in May, unless the insomnia continues or I get weaker. Then I'll call and request an earlier appointment.

I have not experienced any side effects. I know that it isn't designed to do anything to the symptoms that I have now.  It is designed to slow the progression of ALS.

One thing I do not like about this drug is that I have to swallow it quickly because it dissolves pretty quick. if it stays in my mouth I'll have the feeling of numbness and burning and caused me to cough. Numbness stays for about 10 minutes so I had to rinse it out or swallow something to drink. Drug must be taken on an empty stomach and for me since my tongue controls everything that I put in my mouth so I ended up having to swallow some food to scraped the burning sensation. Yes, very tough drug.

Although, my doctor has ordered for me to have a blood test every month and my first was just recently and I have no idea what the lab will find hopefully none. I will come back here to do another review as soon as I find out any progression for my condition from my Neurologist.

Rilutek has a warning if cough developes or difficulty in breathing discontinue drug. And most patients with ALS eventually die from discontinued lung function.

However, if you don't get it down right away and it softens in the mouth, you do experience numbness and tingling of the tongue and mouth.
