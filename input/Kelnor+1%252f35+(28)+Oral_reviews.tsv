Birth Control	Amy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	12/15/2011 3:20:32 PM	The only reason I did not give Kelnor a full 5 star review is because it is a pill you must take at the same time every day, and because I have experienced mood swings, depression, anxiety, headache/migraine and occasional spotting. I have not ruled out that it defiantly is or isn't the Kelnor causing these problems,  still just making connections. Otherwise this has worked great form me for two years! My periods are light and cramping is much better, acne has cleared up a lot too!
Birth Control	Danny, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	25-34	11/2/2011 6:23:04 PM	I missed one dose and within hours started experiencing symptoms, such as heavy bleeding, bloating, mood swings and increased appetite. I have never had these problems when using other oral pill contraceptive brands.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/4/2010 1:13:18 PM	This birth control is cheaper than the others I was on, cleared up my skin! And shorter lighter periods as well. Only side effect might be that I put on 2 pounds. But I will take it!
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	4/6/2009 10:51:05 AM	I was put on Kelnor by my doctor to treat my Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and to regulate my period. So far I've experienced some side effects, during the first few hours after taking the pill, but nothing that lasted for too long or anything too severe. I've noticed a change in my skin and mood, and sleeping has become more restful.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	13-18	3/9/2009 4:52:20 PM	it was effective, but it made me very sick and i had bad side effects with it. It caused more health problems than it prevented
