Worked the first night. Not terribly inconvenient, but some does leak during the day if you use it the night before. That's the only drawback, but well worth the effort.

I have insurance &amp; still had to pay $90.00 for 1 tube.Since most women who need this are on fixed incomes it would be nice if it were affordable.

It's not quite a week and I have noticed a discomfort in my stomach.  At first it was just an awareness, but it seems to be getting more prominent ever day.  Hate the way it has to be administered.

This really worked. I've had NO side effects, if anything, it has increased my libido. I'm using it until she says I can't. I'm sorry that others have not had the success that I have had.
Painful Sexual Intercourse due to Menopause	purplegrrl, 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1		55-64	8/25/2010 2:48:42 AM	My doctor never discussed side effects --just told me &quot;how many marriages it's saved.&quot; It's expensive -- it  made me feel bloated, with a heavy feeling after taking it -- I didn't notice that much of an effect when I reduced my dose after the first couple of weeks.  Research indicates  a connection with gall bladder disease even after short-term use -- I ended up in the ER with a spastic, inflamed gall bladder (not gallstones) 2 months after starting this product. Who's to say but I wouldn't be surprised if they were related. No GB symptoms since I stopped taking it and I feel so much better now.  I knew from the beginning it didn't agree with me -- wish I'd listened to my body! DHEA, black cohosh, vitex, drinking lots of water and using good old lubricant (Silk is a good brand) are working much better for me. Proceed with caution!

Why didn't someone tell me? If only my doctor had said something. I went for my yearly exam and told my OBGYN how painful sex was for me and I was of course Post Menopausal. Wow did I get an education. I only regret not knowing all these years and having to think sex was going to be painful for me and was resigned to that. Thanks to this medication I am no longer miserable and back to the old me. I feel normal now.

I use it right before I go to sleep,,,and there is some discharge in the morning..but not enough for me to stop,,,because the benefits are more positive then the the negatives.  no bloating, no weight gain..I have moodiness but I am menopausal..so..I can't tell the difference.  I just wonder if there are long term side effects from the drug.

I have since cut the dose in half, and am down to once a week, and am still maintaining improved moistness.  I did notice a substantial and quick weight gain when I first began using this ... about 8 pounds ... however, after about a month the weight came back off.  That was my only side effect really.

Other	Premarin, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	9/25/2008 4:36:51 PM	I have gotten quite nausea.  Sometimes so bad that I thought I was going to throw up. 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	7/24/2008 1:50:06 PM	I gave a lower rating on Ease of Use because it's just plain icky.  But it has worked for my painful intercourse; I'm less apprehensive about having sex, and my husband is reassured that he isn't hurting me.  I'm only taking 0.5g once a week because of breast tenderness and vaginal discharge, and I'm still a bit tender during sex, so I'm going to continue with the dosage until the pain completely stops.  I've had some dizziness issues, but not bad.  I also think I'm retaining some water - got that &quot;bloated&quot; feeling.  But all in all, I'm satisfied and will continue the medication.
