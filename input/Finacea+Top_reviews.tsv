Acne Rosacea	Robert, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	9/25/2012 1:41:22 PM	I was breaking out with pustules and iching welts on my face, and I had not changed any products or medications, so I didn't know what was wrong with me.  After enduring the itching, burning red face and embarrassment for over two weeks, I made an appointment with my dermatologist.  He immediately diagnosed it as Acne Rosacea.  He prescribed Finacea and a low dosage of Doxycycline, and I started both medications that evening.  The Finacea itched and burned the first couple of nights, but I read those were common side effects.  I have been using it for a week now, and my skin looks and feels the best it has in months!  I was starting to feel like I would have to live with bad skin the rest of my life, so I am very grateful products like this are on the market!
Acne Rosacea	Angela, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	9/10/2012 8:58:02 AM	BEWARE! Finacea gel and ALL other Rosacea face creams carry warnings of wheezing, tightness of breath but they are not shown high enough on the side effects listings. I have had a bad year with unexplained wheezing. My doctor had no knowledge of this side effect and had me investigated for old age onset of asthma. The test was negative.Web searches revealed this side effect and I tested myself with time on and time off the Gel. No question. I have stopped Finacea and my wheezing has gone. Coughing has caused bladder leakage and strain as well as a neck trauma. In order to sleep and not cough I used three pillows and not my normal two one night. Next day the resulting 'crick' in the neck increased to full-on trembling from pain shock. A doctor came out on Saturday and prescribed heat/diazepam/strong painkillers. Nerve and cartilage/ligament strain has kept me in pain and misery for several days now.That face creams can be absorbed at such a level as to influence breathing is extraordinary, even with a 50% dosage reduction.I am now smoothing in gentle Arnica instead.
Acne Rosacea	wpb, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/23/2012 7:20:56 PM	its been about 2 weeks since I started using Finacea. So far so good after years of searching I feel like I have finally found the right product minus the sting and itch when 1st applied. The Redness and acne are noticeably decreasing.  I have had mild-moderate acne rosacea for about 10 years and for the 1st time I have hope!! I will continue to use it.
Acne Rosacea	Robert12, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	45-54	6/20/2012 6:44:11 PM	The product caused excessive burning and stinging requiring that I discontinue using it intermittently.  My dermatologist told me about a new product for rosacea called PyratineXR and I have been using this product along with Finacea ever since with no or little irritation and better results.

It stung and itched but I heard that this would deminish.  It did somewhat but I developed huge pimples and then small red bumps all over my face.  My skin became very dry and I even went down from twice a day to once and things did not get better.  My face actually hurt.  I finally got off of it totally and my face started to clear.  I am still dealing with Rosacea but will never use this medication again.

Acne Rosacea	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/15/2011 12:03:03 AM	It takes some patience to begin to notice the excellent effects of finacea. I was having adult acne that I thought was due to the pill. But the dermatologist recommended I try this gel. It stings pretty badly when you first begin using it. but STICK WITH IT. The stinging begins to fade after a few weeks. After about two month, my skin is really amazingly clear. I wash with Eucerin gentle cleanser every night, then apply a pea sized amount. Same in the morning. I wait for it to dry before adding my moisturizer with spf. The gel also appears to be lessening some discoloration I have. Amazing! I'm really happy with this product.
Acne Rosacea	cc, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/13/2011 12:22:40 AM	Started Finacea about 7 weeks ago for Rosacea and Peri-Oral Dermatitis. Did sting/burn like crazy at first, took about a week for it to stop stinging/burning. Used Metro Cream and Metrogel previously. Finacea has worked the best. Reduced inflamation, redness and papules.   
Acne Rosacea	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/15/2011 11:24:27 AM	I have only been on the med for 5 days and it seems to be helping. I would like to let the patient that had cold sores with know that if they have cold sores due to the chicken pox virus shot given to them when they were a child, they should take a Lysine tablet once a day to get rid of them. It's an over-the-counter amino acid. I can't live without them! Don't pay for any expensive remedies.

Acne Rosacea	Aggie Veterinarian, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/6/2010 12:04:44 AM	I have used finacea for about 18 months. It has really reduced the redness. It has made my skin smoother and some fine lines even seem smoother. It is not a miracle cure for severe rosacea. It will be part of a regime. I used Norirate( topical metronidazole ) intermittantly, Oracea o ce daily with a severe flare or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily if m really struggling. I made the mistake of stopping finacea for a week or so...it was then I realized how much of a difference Finacea was making. I can not go without this drug. My next step will likely be laser therapy for the persistent redness in certain areas. Keep using the drug if you just start. It will cause stinging up to the first 1-2 months you are on it. Not severe. Lasts 10 minutes or so. It will go away. I still really have to moisturize. The Finacea causes dry flakes even though my skin is oily. Moisturizing is a chore.  Use a very gentle moisturizer like the one that comes in the Finacea kit CereVe. The CereVe face wash is ok but for rosacea personally like Aveeno positively radiant foaming cleanser. Younalso may break out worse before it gets better. What's brewing under the skin must erupt. It will bet better. Then your skin will really start to improve. I saw a dramatic reduction in redness within 2 weeks. There is no miracle cure for rosacea. This is a great drug and well worth the high copayment. Overall, I would strongly urge rosacea suffers to give this medication a try!!!

Acne Rosacea	Sparks, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	55-64	6/16/2010 4:49:44 PM	I have only used this cream for a little over a week now but the results have been positive.  Slight burning but definitely worth it.  My condition seems to be clearing up faster than I expected.  
Acne Rosacea	birdy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/14/2010 6:32:49 AM	I have been using it for 5 days and my nose has already gotten smaller, which I didn't realize how much the rosacea had swollen it.So, the drug is expensive? I'm on free samples right now and I was wondering if I was the only one paying $125 for it. We'll see if its really worth it by my next derm visit in 6 weeks. But, it does sting a little, but is pretty good so far 
Acne Rosacea	CamTolly, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	13-18	6/10/2010 3:35:05 AM	I am actually on my secong prescription of Finacea. When my dermatologist first prescribed it, I have to admit that it did cause my face to itch but I did notice a difference in my complexion. Now when I use it, it does still make my face itch but it is also causing small bumps to form. I don't remember this happening at first!
Acne Rosacea	catbel228, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	5/29/2010 10:41:27 PM	I have only been on Finacea for about ten days but so far, so good.  I use it in the morning, Metrogel at night.  No burning or stinging or even itching so I guess I'm lucky.  I've so far notice decreased redness, and I'm hopeful to have as much benefit as what I'm reading. Per my dermatogist's orders,I also use Dove Free to wash my face-I used to use a strong acne scrub - and apparently I was using methods way too aggressive! My dermatologist also recommended salt/cool water soaks (5 min.) twice a day, which seems to help sooth my face tremendously.
Acne Rosacea	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	5/20/2010 11:55:16 PM	I have had brown spots to come on my face. That is one of the side effects-decreased pigmentation. It is very expensive. It has helped.
Acne Rosacea	Healthy , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/17/2010 3:45:57 PM	I've had rosacea for 15 years. It has been moderate to severe and has been moderate for about 2 years now.  My Dr. recommended I try this drug and I was leary beause I totally baby my face when it comes to skin products, but said I would give it a try. Well... I'm on day three and I already see results.  Yes there is itching but last night it was about 50% of what it was on day 1 and it only lasts about 20 minutes.  I use this at night and then use Noritate in the morning.  Overall it's really great.  My moderate reddness is less and the &quot;hard to get rid of bumps&quot; by my hairline are almost gone.  Can't wait to see what it's like in month.    
Acne Rosacea	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/2/2010 8:50:02 PM	Used in conjunction with Metrogel. Can't tell if one is more effective than another but used together, I've noticed 90%+ improvement.  Easy to use.  Sometimes stinging but nothing I can't live with.  
Acne Rosacea	sprink, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	3/18/2010 6:58:32 AM	Just started using it. I'm NOT a med taker; of ANY type. I didnt realize this was an antibiotic. I noticed I can hardly stay awake when I use this, and I am using a THIN film of the cream. I may take myself down to only using it at night. I can't function during the day sleep walking! I was hoping that side effect would go away. It's been 3 days ... 3 VERY sleepy days.
Other	Melissa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	2/26/2010 9:14:49 PM	I have had always had acne, it's not terrible but I always have several pimples. I tried retin-a, differin way to drying, and lots of over the counter products which did nothing. I have been using this for about one month. It itches a lot when I put in on but I apply a oil free facial lotion, i use cetaphil clenser and z-silc, and it helps with the itching. My skin looks better, but perfect. I will continue to use it and hope my skin continues to improve. Lots of people are complaining about redness and, dryness and swelling. I haven not had any of those symptoms. I am optimistic about this product.

Acne Rosacea	Danville, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/4/2009 10:24:40 PM	Though I have been able to avoid rosacea flares by using a strong glycolic acid cleanser once a day, all my efforts to reduce the existing redness have been ineffective - including $2,500 spent on IPL. I switched from Retin A to Finacea this week and my redness is down and my face has never been this smooth. The peeling around my nose from the Retin A is gone.  Can't wait to see how my skin looks at 4 weeks.  I'm off the glycolic cleanser (Aqua Glycolic) for a few weeks so as to minimize any irritation.  I'm using Aveeno Positively radiant cleanser till I know my skin has had time to adjust to the Finacea.  Finacea isn't nearly as drying as Retin A.

He then took a shot at Rosacea and prescribed this.  My face blew up within 2 days.  Swollen, very red and painful.  I stopped using it 3 weeks ago and the red face, swollen, and painful symptoms have not gone away.  I don't want to leave the house.  I definitely am switching doctors.  I would give anything to go back to my acne.
Acne Rosacea	shamrock7, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/27/2009 10:16:45 PM	I suffered with acne rosacea for many years and have been treated for it for about 10 years with limited success.  I found Metro Gel and Metro Lotion drying and my red face still suffered breakouts.  I've been using Finacea for about 2 months and have not had one breakout.  My skin is smoother, less dry, and the redness has even decreased.   I also use CeraVe as my moisturizer and wash which helps with the redness. Between Finacea and CeraVe I finally have the skin I had wished for.
Acne Rosacea	derrty, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	25-34	1/18/2009 3:45:12 AM	I have been suffering from acne for about 7 years now.  It is no longer active but it left some scars.  My derma prescribed finacea to clear the spots.  I must say, it works wonders for me.  2 months on it, i can see a significant reduction in acne scars.  Still some work to do, but i am very happy with it.  It does burn upon application, even now after 2 months.  However it burns less than when i first started using it.  I also find that it makes my skin dry, but i use some oil free face lotion during the day, and presto.  Overall, great product.  
Other	ooohfun, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	10/29/2008 12:04:31 PM	I was prescribed Finacea only to help clear up redness/scarring from acne on my forehead.  I have not experienced ANY negative side effects.  No burning, stinging, or dryness.  That being said, I'm not sure if it has made much of a difference.  The scars are fading, but I wouldn't say they are fading any quicker than normal.  It costs $20 on my insurance instead of the usal $10.
Acne Rosacea	poodleprincess, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/25/2008 3:04:50 AM	I have been using this product for about 4 weeks, you have use a very very thin film of it on your face, if you slather it on like moisturizer, the side effects are worsen. Please use a very thin film of it, very thin that is all you need. Its been working for me, clearing up very nicely and it does sting and itch, but mildly. Nothing in life is easy and sometimes, its worth the mild to moderate side effects to have better self-esteem. The redness was awful and breakouts and money I spend on make up to cover it up. Try it, and give it a chance, but, be patient.
Acne Rosacea	laura, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/2/2008 5:00:08 PM	it has stopped the progress of the Rosacea.I do find it does burn still after 3 yrs of use if I use too much.  I usually put cream right on top so the burning goes away quick.I do find that I get very dry skin on either side of my nose which is a bit annoying but tolerable since the med works.
Acne Rosacea	Beautiful, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/8/2008 6:37:27 PM	I have suffered from rosacea for almost 30 years. Usually had to cover up with thick makeup; I felt awful. I was finally given this by a new dermatologist, as well as oral antibiotic for the first 60 days. Used in the morning (Metrogel used at night) I saw a 95% improvement in my skin after about 2 1/2 to 3 months. I now can go makeup free and still look normal! In fact many people (I work in a beauty store, of all places) tell me I look 10 years younger than I am.It takes time but don't stop unless your derma tells you to!

Acne Rosacea	naohime, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	35-44	10/24/2007 4:02:59 AM	It worked for the first week, but then side effects such as burning, itching, and redness of my face increased one day, all of the sudden, to the point my face became so hot and swollen.  This medicine was so expensive even with insurance - so disappointed.  I need to go out of town in a couple of days and I don't even want to go outside now.
