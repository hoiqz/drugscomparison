Excessive Sweating	Tmash, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	7/27/2012 4:19:06 AM	I sweat excessively from my scalp in summer and winter to the point my hair would be dripping wet. It Was hard to go to places and look cool and confident such as parties and resturants. I placed on scalp for three nights and the rest of the week it was 100+ degrees each day and I did not sweat. For 52 years I have been looking for an answer to my prayers and now I have it . This stuff is great.

Excessive Sweating	Joel, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Male	19-24	2/9/2012 7:22:27 PM	I am a 21 year old college student majoring in Elementary Education.  I was always very nervous to get in front of students because of my excessive armpit sweat.  I used Drysol for the first time last night and there isn't a drop of sweat under my arm today.  This has already helped with my confidence. It is so nice to not have to worry about stains under my arm anymore. Great product! Can't believe how well it works! 
Excessive Sweating	jonnyphish, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/30/2012 10:40:17 AM	I used to have big moons in my pits, and had to buy special shirts. I even tried t-shirts with pads built in due to the massive amount of perspiration, sometimes that worked. Nothing has been as wonderful as Drysol!! I can truly &quot;Raise my arms&quot;!! You will experience a slight bit of itching burning during the first week of use (use every night for a week to get it started, then only once per week should do). No more burning, only occasional itching at first few minutes of application but WAY BETTER than those big sweaty pits!! I tried this once years ago but did not follow directions right and figured it was like everything else. Use every night for a week and see what happens. I suffered for years with schweaty pits...Much better, much happier!!

Excessive Sweating	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/28/2011 7:07:05 PM	I have been using Drysol for about 10 years and am happy with the results. I used to have excessive sweating on my hands, feet, and underarms. While my underarm issue has disappeared, I still use it for my hands and feet. It's a bit inconvenient and usually itches, but I would still prefer this treatment over surgery. I recently tried the Hypercare solution and it did not work for me at all. It's definitely worth getting the name brand version.

Excessive Sweating	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/22/2010 2:31:20 PM	I have used both Drysol and Hypercare. Hypercare touts the same results as Drysol but does not deliver. With Drysol, I was able to discontinue use of the medication on a regular basis after about a month of use, which lasted about a year. Hypercare has not worked at all, but does produce the same stinging effect as Drysol. I did notice that while using Drysol, I would only sweat excessively if I tried to apply another antipersperant or deodorant in the morning before leaving the house after having Drysol on overnight. Of course, if the medication is working, there is no need to use an antipersperant or deodorant, so it's not a downfall. After I stopped needing to use the Drysol at night, I returned to using deodorant/antiperspirants as usual. I have tried every OTC product out there, and was considering surgery or Botox injections, but the Drysol worked. Should it stop working, I will probably ask for the Botox injection treatments, but until then, I will continue Drysol. To those of you that are considering the cheaper generic Hypercare, please be cautioned that the two are not the same. When compared in my area, the total cost of the Drysol is about $9-$12, whereas the Hypercare is about $6-$8. Obviously, I cannot speak for all pharmacies in all areas, but the difference in effect vastly outweighs the difference in price for me, even if I did not have insurance for the drug. Overall, Drysol is worth it. Hypercare is much less effective, but I think most would agree that any degree of relief from this condition is worth almost anything.
Excessive Sweating	13-18 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	8/19/2010 2:31:29 AM	I suffered from hyperhidrosis for six years before I decided to do anything about it. Once I made my appointment with my doctor and was prescribed drysol my first night using it I had a little discomfort but the results were incredible! The next day I didn't sweat a single drop when normally my unerarms would be conpletely soaked with sweat. With every application of drysol the discomfort of tingling has decreased and it has remained as effective as the first day of use. Drysol has changed my life and gave me a huge confidence boost. I would strongly recommend it to anybody who has excessive or even just excess sweating that is affecting their personal life and self image.
Excessive Sweating	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	19-24	8/18/2010 7:22:26 PM	After four days of using on hands and feet, they still sweat to the point wheere you can visibily see it. Hopefully it will stop soon. It is also very difficult to apply,as its tricky getting out of the bottle w/o spilling.
Excessive Sweating	Jen777, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	7/26/2010 11:37:15 AM	Much like other reviewers Drysol was a fabulous cure to my sweating problem. I am a woman and I was so embarrassed to sweat from my armpits like I did. I applied Drysol once a month for a year and it was amazing. A little itchy/burning upon application but nothing too horrible. HOWEVER - I noticed that even without using Drysol I had stopped sweating. I haven't used it in over eight months and I do not sweat from armpits. Now I get pimple-like outbreaks on my chest, arms, shoulders and back. I have never had back-acne before. Something is not okay about Drysol, it seems that it has sealed up my sweat glands under my arms. I should have been more careful about what I wished for (or how I treated it) and so should all of you. I can't find anything about this happening to others but I am 100% sure it is a result of using Drysol. Beware!!!
Excessive Sweating	Used to Sweat, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/25/2010 9:45:28 PM	I used to sweat from my scalp and face much more than others, esp. in warm weather, social events, playing golf, etc. I now apply it once a week to my scalp and face, and the sweating has completely come under control. I also had an issue with the Drysol itching after application, but found a very good solution to stop it. I apply Caladryl Clear anti-itch lotion (alcohol based) while the Drysol is still wet on my face. They dry together, and stops the itching, and also keeps the Drysol from rubbing off while sleeping that night. Perfect combo!

Excessive Sweating	JessDev, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	12/14/2009 10:07:11 AM	I tried all the over the counter stuff and nothing worked. Then I started drysol. How glorious it was to finally have something that worked!Pros: No excessive sweating through my shirts.Cons: Burns and itches EVERY time I apply.
Excessive Sweating	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	12/13/2009 3:28:13 PM	Got the prescription from my doctor and decided to give it a try. It works better than anything I've tried before. I have to reapply it every 4 days or so which is somewhat annoying and towards the end it is not nearly as effective as the first day or two but it's better than nothing! It stung the first two nights I put it on but after that nothing! I would highly recommend this product.
Excessive Sweating	Nicole, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	9/1/2009 11:12:30 PM	I was diagnosed with severe sweaty palms and it doesn't work at all! It may lessen it a little, but I still have to wear a sweat shirt so I can write without smearing. It affects practically every aspect of my life and I'm afraid i wont get a job because of it! Has anyone found a medication that would work? Also it turns my hands white so I stopped using it!
Excessive Sweating	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	7/13/2009 3:08:13 AM	It has changed my life.  I always joke that I sweat just by breathing.  I can deal with the sweat on most of my body, but my underarms are terrible.  I heard about prescriptions for excessive sweating when I was in junior high, but I was to embarassed to ask my doctor about it.  Finally, 20 years later I found a brand name and decided to ask my doctor about it.  If I had only done it 20 years ago!  I love being able to wear what ever color or fabric I want!  I love that I no longer have to hold my arms close to my body and hope that no one notices the sweat rings!  I tell everyone about it.  Yes, the stinging can be bad, but you learn quickly the &quot;do's and don'ts&quot; to keep it to a minimum.
Excessive Sweating	Rwayne, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	5/14/2009 11:54:32 PM	Burns the first couple of nights. It's pretty intense, but to me the satisfaction of not having to sweat through a shirt before i arrive at work in the morning was WELL worth a little burning/stinging. It's made life a little easier. Thanks to my new doc. now i can buy me some nice white shirts! Sometimes I'll sweat a little, when i should be sweating unlike before when it was just random, and i'll get a little odor.. I've yet to use it with a deodorent, I read somewhere deoderent is fine in combination with dry-sol just make sure it's not antipersperent. I'll check it out soon. Overall VERY happy, and would reccomend this to anybody. 
Excessive Sweating	Happy Camper, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/18/2009 4:32:51 PM	I tried every OTC clinical strength deoderant made...nothing worked. I'd literally get out of the shower &amp; start sweating for no reason. I would change my shirt throughout the day b/c of those embarrassing rings. I've only been using Drysol for 3 days &amp; it has already improved the quality of my life. From the 1st day, it worked like a charm. Yes, the 1st night I applied it &amp; instantly thought my underarms were on fire &amp; I did have some redness and swelling in the area it was applied... But no pain no gain, I can finally wear all those beautiful tops in my closet (with the tags still on!) that I wouldn't have dared to wear before drysol! I could kick myself for waiting all these years before trying Drysol.  P.S. - with my prescription plan Drysol cost less than any of those useless OTC clinical deoderants that are still in my vanity!
Excessive Sweating	lovmebaby1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	11/29/2008 8:58:13 AM	I suffered from sweaty palms my whole life.  I am 27 now and wish I knew about this sooner!  I was extremely skeptical and was sure surgery was the only solution, but after one application I went the next day without sweating ONCE!  I was smiling the whole day in amazement! I got that sensation that you get when your hands are about to start sweating and I just sat there waiting for it to fail on me but the sweat never came!  It did dry my hands out the 2nd night/application. I am going to test the limits of this stuff by using lotion which is known to def cause my hands to start raining sweat! I hope it stands up to it! I tried finding info on using lotion with this stuff but found nothing so I'll just experiment. Try it, it's worth it! (I'd still rather have the surgery and not have to worry about this ongoing lifetime treatment but if you are looking for an alternative THIS is it!!)

This product is only for people with mild hyperhydrosis..I have one of the worse cases the doctors have ever seen so I might not be the best one to judge this product.
Excessive Sweating	stichenor, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/22/2008 10:35:50 PM	Used Drysol years ago in high school, very embarrasing underarm hyperhidrosis, now just started using again, and seems to be working!!! SO EXCITED! The deal with the tingling any day over the sweating! 
Excessive Sweating	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/14/2008 10:51:33 AM	In one word, Amazing.  I have struggled with excessive sweating for years.  I have high deductible insurance and can't afford to go to the Dr or get the medicine.  Thanks to the user that said you can order this medication over the internet.  I ordered a small bottle and noticed results after the first two initial treatments.  I don't have to worry about what shirts I wear or stuffing folded up tissues under my armpits to soak up the perspiration. Highly recommended to anyone that suffers with this type of problem. 
Excessive Sweating	Fab907, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/23/2008 4:16:43 AM	I can still remember sitting in english class in seventh grade when I first noticed I was profusely from the underarms and it has been a problem ever since. After years of hiding it under black shirts and hoodies I looked up excessive sweating online and found out I wasn't alone and that there was treatments. I remember asking my doctor for a prescription for something to help me out and she prescribed Drysol. I was excited to get started with it and see if it worked. That night I applied the product and went to bed as directed but the feeling of short shocking pains keep me up for what felt like hours. The next morning I could feel the difference immediately. I use it once every 2-4 weeks and it seems it works better and burns less if you don't shave your underarms for a few days before using. I highly recommend this product, because it has made me more confident and let me feel free to wear whatever I wanted without a hoodie for extra security. This product has seriously changed my life and I hope more people with hyperhidrosis will seek this product out. If you can't afford to go to the doctor for this product you can also find it online without prescription and it is sold in stores in Canada for around $16 a bottle.
Excessive Sweating	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/6/2008 5:36:36 PM	I have to tell you... this product is the best thing that has ever happened to me.  I have been sweating excessibly in my hands, feet, and underarms since I can remember! I suffered with this condition for many many years without hope that it will ever get fixed.  I even scheduled an ETS surgery so that I can solve this problem! I was asked t try two products before surgery and I did... this one being one of them.  I can not tell you how happy I am that I dont need the surgery.  This product stopped the sweating completely!!!! My hands use to drip for hours and now not even a drop! All I can suggest is to give the product a chance to work.  It doesnt always stop sweating after the first application.  Sometimes you have to apply it 3 or 4 nights in a row in order to see the results you want.  One thing I am sure of is that it works!!! Please dont give up on it, it will work!!! 
Excessive Sweating	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	9/14/2008 10:50:50 PM	I used this stuff a few years ago for about a year. It usually tingled a little bit but it worked 100%. I was able to use it less over time and even after I quit using it, it seemed to have lasting effects. However, I have recently started sweating a lot again. I just bought the Secret Clinical Strength deodorant which they suggest using at night. I'm going to give it a try and if it doesn't work, I'll be calling the doctor for Drysol again. 
Excessive Sweating		5	3	4			7/31/2008 4:01:38 PM	This stuff totally works.  The only downfall is that you have to apply it with a cotton ball, which is a pain.  They should consider making it into a roll-on...not sure why they haven't already.
Excessive Sweating	tj, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/28/2008 10:13:00 PM	I've used this product for 2 months.  I wish I'd had it sooner.  I have suffered with sweat for years. I work with public and was always embarrased and self conscious about sweat and odor. It itched a bit at first but I'll take a little itch over the embarrasment of sweat any day.  I love this product.  
Excessive Sweating	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	7/23/2008 1:27:10 AM	I am 21 years old, and have been struggling with sweaty palms and feet, FOREVER! This medication is wonderful to help the constant sweaty palms and feet that can be very uncomfortable and somewhat embarrassing. I used it years ago, and recently started using it again. It is really the only thing that helps control the sweaty palms. It can dry out your skin too much, but it is a simple fix. Don't us it as much! 
Excessive Sweating	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/22/2008 8:59:39 PM	I dabbed this on my forehead and temples and it stopped my excessive sweating immediately.There is minor tingling and itching for the first 15 minutes after applying, but that passes.Wish I had known about this product 30 years ago!Hopefully people at work will not stop glancning at my forehead as they talk to me.
Excessive Sweating		1	5	1			6/6/2008 12:22:15 PM	i have dealt with excess sweating all my  life, but i never thought there was anything i could do about it. when i heard about this product, i immediately made an appointment with my doctor to discuss it and then got a prescription. i have used this product for almost 2 months and never noticed a difference; i sill sweat as much as i did before i started applying drysol. also-it gave me a rash and burns very bad on my underarms. this product is simply not worth it.i am currently waiting for my insurance to approve botox for my hyperhidrosis; hopefully that will work.
Excessive Sweating		5	3	5			5/22/2008 4:50:26 PM	Completely stopped perspiration after two treatments.  Some mild burning, like a minor sunburn.
Excessive Sweating	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/25/2008 1:06:06 AM	Drysol is life changing for anyone who has suffered from embarrasment from sweating. I have suffered from excessive sweating since i was in middle school, i have tried everything they make but nothing worked. It was embarrassing and completely ruined my self esteem, after searching google i found drysol by chance and ordered it. after the very first day i stopped sweating completely and for the first time in years have worn clothes that arent black. it truly has changed my life and i recommend it to anyone with the same problem.
Excessive Sweating	mommajamie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	2/21/2008 11:00:28 PM	Extreme itching and a rash.  I decided it was not worth the bad side effects.
Excessive Sweating	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/11/2008 11:01:31 PM	I love the way it helps with the sweating. I use it every 4 to 6 days on my underarms at night and wash in morning, that way I don't stain my good clothes. It works great through summer also. With other deodorants they would stain my clothes and leave a build up that was hard to remove so I would spent so much money on new clothes. It controls smell to where there is none if used continuously.I do have problem with stinging and itching so I alternate when I use it and when I shave.
Excessive Sweating	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	2/8/2008 3:07:48 PM	I can not believe how well this has worked.  I have had an issue with excessive sweating for over 5 years now.  When these new &quot;clinical strength&quot; anti antiperspirants came out, I jumped all over them.  Unfortunately, they were completely ineffective, and almost seemed to worsen the problem.  As soon as I started using Drysol, the problem stopped.  As a police officer I have to deal with the public for 12 hours a day, and the excessive sweating was becoming extremely annoying/embarrassing.  Confidence was immediately restored.  
Excessive Sweating	e, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/30/2008 9:13:47 AM	it really works!
Excessive Sweating	Pat, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		1/15/2008 2:56:31 PM	No one's underarms could sweat as profusely as mine did. I could never wear anything that had to be drycleaned or that showed wetness.  The first application stopped the sweating immediately and I went weeks before needing another one.  No problem with burning or itching for me.  Just regret I never heard of it sooner and read about it in &quot;Dear Abby's&quot; column years ago! 
Excessive Sweating	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	12/4/2007 10:55:42 PM	Very effective, simple, inexpensive solution.  Itching can be bothersome.

Excessive Sweating	Eshamichelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/9/2007 10:47:38 AM	I been using Drysol foe over 10 years now, and I think it is wounderful... There are sometimes that it does not work as good as the first time... But overall it is a great treatment for Excessive Sweating... I have used it under my arms as well as on my face in my T-Zone, and on my back...  Hope it works for you all as it has for me...
Excessive Sweating	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	13-18	9/18/2007 9:42:41 PM	it works amazingly, but i will say that it hurt a lot the first night. there was a lot of burning and itching along with some sensitivity, but it gave me amazing results.
