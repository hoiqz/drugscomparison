Chronic Trouble Sleeping	TiredLu, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	11/16/2011 3:47:50 PM	I was prescribed this drug, 50 mg, for severe, chronic, menopausal-related insomnia.  Ambian, Lunesta and all herbal rememdies have been ineffective.  After reading all the reviews I was hopeful.  However, after only two nights, I will no longer be taking this medication.  Within about 30 minutes of taking the drug, my heart started racing.  I was unable to fall asleep in a reasonable length of time.  Once I did, I kept waking every 30 minutes or so, all night.  This morning, I woke to a terrible headache, swollen eyelids and swollen fingers.  Yesterday, during the day I experienced moderate agitation at work.   I am happy this drug works for most folks.  I recommend a person tries it for severe insomnia if prescribed.  It is quite terrible to go w/o good quality sleep for so long.  I hope I will find it someday.

Take 150 mg about 20 minutes before bed and it works great.  First time I have slept through the night in over a year.  Wake up a litte muffled headed but it wears off within 30 minutes or less.  Eating seems to help a great deal.  This drug has been the greatest of all meds I have tired.

Traz works ok...it keeps me from being suicidal but still does not really make me the person I was, or am when on an SSRI. It's very sedating, and the dimensions of the pills are sharp and hard to swallow.

Trazadone has worked wonders for me and helps me sleep while taking a very small dosage. It is not addictive like some other sleep meds and I don't always have to take it. There is no rebound insomnis or bad hangover effect. I am very satisfied with this drug.

When I quit taking the trazedone, it became exponentially worse.  I couldn't sleep at all.  Or even go to sleep. I was awake for 4 days and nights straight. I then decreased the dosage over a 1 year period.  Haven't taken it for 9 months now and believe that it has permanently altered my brain chemistry re sleep.  Also my reaction to some drugs.  Nitrous oxide no longer affects me.  This is my dentist's opinion.  Benadry and other antihistamines don't make me sleepy no matter how many I take. Halcyon does nothing, no matter what dosage.  I believe this is the result of long-term use of trazedone.  I would not recommend it to anyone for long-term use.  It is dangerous.  It seems innocuous, but it is not.

I`ve been taking this drug for 15 days now and it doesn`t help me sleep at all. Now what would be the correct drug to take on this condition, I used to take Dalmane 50mg and that did the trick not only it put me to sleep but cured my insomnia for the time being, but for 1 month I took Dalmane 50mg I slept very good until about a 4 months down the road I had rebound insomnia. I tried to get Dalmane 50mg from my Dr. but says that they`re too addicting, yet they`re not to me, they help me, but regardless of my trying my doctor insists -no-
Other	reigndrop22, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/15/2010 8:35:13 PM	I have been taking Trazodone for a month now.  I wake up groggy in the morning, which does not last long.  I have a stuffy nose all day, but to cure that I use the Neti Pot.  The Doctor prescribed it to me because of insomnia, but I find my mood and over all attitude is 100 times better being on it then not.  I feel calm, relaxed, and less anxious.  I think I need to talk to my doctor and have her change the reason behind the prescription.  I am grateful to have been given something that makes me feel human again, not like the exorcist woman....

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Matthew99, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	3/16/2010 2:54:18 AM	I have tried many anti depressents and other sleep aids.  I have chronic anxiety, very minor depression, and severe insomnia. I have been on seroquil, and although it made me sleep well, the side effects weren't fun. Today I use 100mg Trazadone and 1 mg of Xanax.  I take the trazadone at night just before I go to sleep and I sleep very well.  Sometimes I'm a little groggy in the morning but that doesn't last long. I take the Xanax 3 times a day and it works well with my anxiety.  Seems like the mix of the 2 has really changed my overall quality of life and its been wonderful just being able not worry about every little minor thing. Nice thing about the Trazadone is that it doesn't affect your REM sleep so I wake up refreshed.

Each time it takes a few days to adjust to the new drug. One from a Maufacture called APOTEX did not work for me at all. I reported it to the FDA and it was sent to Apotex for testing. Of course they found nothing wrong with their product.

Other	Scared of Desyrel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/19/2010 8:14:08 AM	Was given this medicine on accident by the pharmacy instead of my back medicine. I have a lot of trouble sleeping and would never take this. People who are not perscribed this should never take it because you should be closely monitored by a doctor. I had every reaction except a heart attack/seizure which I may have had if I didn't figure out I had the wrong meds. That was the scariest feeling I've ever had. I am still having side effects over a week later. If you take this please be careful, these meds could have been fatal for me. I've been hospitalized for it and many trips to the doctors still. Take with caution.

Like some have said, sometimes I wake up with a stuffy nose. And as time goes on it's become less effective. Not surprised.What I raelly wanted to say is that I've been taking a look at what's in Desyrel/Trazadone on wikipedia and learning some surprising info. Chloroquie: it cures malaria, but gives you a hell of a stomach ache and blurred vision. Digoxin - heart damage. Phenytoin: produces horizontal gaze nystagmus, has been linked to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome... apparently it builds up in your cerebral cortex after a while (the part of your brian that allows movement), makes your gums bleed, give you Lupus, seizures, ataxia, sudden sedation. I realize thtat the form these ingredients take as a part of Trazadone interact differently than they do on their own, and I admit my own ignorance of pharmacology. But why all this stuff? Plus it looks like a lot of their stuff is made from human waste. kina fascinaiting.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	35-44	7/27/2008 12:44:55 PM	As been diagnosed with G.A.D. and chronic sleeping disorder in 2005, I have tried many sleeping medications, most of them my body becomes immune to after a month or two. Last night, 7/26/08, I took Trazodone 150mg for the first and last time. It did not put me to sleep within a normal time frame and I kept waking up every hour and a haft to two hours. My dream was so vivid, it scared me. I woke with a server headache, blurred vision, dry mouth, dizziness and disorientation. It took me two hours just to get out of bed with these symptoms and after been awake for over four hours now, I still have the headache and disorientation. The only constellation to this drug is that I took it on a Saturday night. If it had been during the work week, there would be no way I would be able to drive myself to work.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	5/29/2008 8:13:10 AM	My issue was insomnia and some minor depression.  I've only been on the trazadone for two nights now (50 mg).  It works very quickly.  I have had two good night's rest.  However, I am getting the stuffy nose.  This is annoying, but it really only lasts for about 1 hr.  I hope this goes away, as I like being able to sleep.

Works well for sleep I actually get into REM stage sleep and dreaming again. A person I know takes 200-300mg and she behaves with extreme hostily and anger towards peopleI think some people become psychotic on this med.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/13/2008 9:20:00 AM	I have been taking this drug for at least 15 years for severe insomnia after someone broke into my home while I slept.  It has  been a fantastic drug to put me to sleep and keeps me asleep all night. Does not cause hangover effect at all for me in the morning.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/25/2007 4:51:17 PM	This is been an absolute answer to prayers for me.  I have suffered from insomnia for years and tried many drugs, often resulting in weight gain or &quot;hangovers&quot; from the strength of the drug.  Desyrel lets me get a full night's sleep and leaves me feeling well rested in the morning.
