Migraine Headache	Een, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	7/17/2012 2:39:27 PM	I have almost a paralyzing fear of needles, but after a few uses that has lessened when I realize how soon my pain is relieved. My only problem is my insurance company will only cover one refill every 60 days and I have had to pay the $360 out of pocket or risk not having a dose ready if a migrain strikes.  I was initially leery because I had very limited success with the nasal spray and the oral was virtually useless

I am a 29 yearold female (will be 30 in June of this year)and have had migrianes since I hit puberty that have gotten worse, especially during my menstrual cycle. I have tried every drug under the sun for my migrianes including Imitrex pills. Now have been on 6mg Imitrex Injections for a little over 2 years and I LOVE it! Only complaint is I get so sleepy afterwards and incrediable knee pain. But it is worth it!
Migraine Headache	Josey, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/20/2009 5:08:47 PM	I really benefited from the first injection and now have some on hand but it is extremely expensive!  It cost, for the generic brand name, $360.00 for two home injection kits.  There are a total of four shots available.  WOW!  That will surely cause another headache! 
Migraine Headache	cledg, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	10/7/2009 11:36:09 AM	I have had migraines for over 30 years. I sometimes wake up with a severe migraine with nausea so this medication has been a godsend. Before, I would take the imitrex pill and would just end up vomiting it up. Since using the injection, my migraines are relieved in about 1 hour. My only complaint is that it makes me extremely tired.

Usually after 15 minutes I get relief. Sometimes my scalp tingles a bit, but then I know it is working. The only complaint I have is the price of the medication. Now that I do not have health insurance, I can not afford the shots.

Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/5/2008 9:24:02 PM	I have tried everything from advil to suffering through the pain and the ease of just giving a simple injection to the quicknes of the medication i will not need any thing else! I had a hard time with the old injection pens, the needles were able to be seen and the pen made a loud snap when you injected and now with the new dose pen there is no snap and no visable needle! This is a life saver, i can continue on with life in a short amount of time instead of spending days suffering and another day trying to recover from the pain!

Migraine Headache	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/1/2007 11:46:18 PM	I use Imitrex because I get migraine with cluster headaches and it's the only thing that works for me.  Preventative meds do not work.
