An Insufficiency in Ovulation	clomidfan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/16/2012 2:56:12 PM	Used clomid to get my body to ovulate regularly and produce some nice sized follicles, which it did.  Although had hot flashes, drowsiness, and extreme fatigue with a bit of weight gain, clomid worked for me, after only 2 months of use.  It reset my body's internal reproductive clock to work efficiently and on time.  I am now pregnant! Highly recommend if your period is irregular and you are overweight and your fsh test results are good to excellent.
Other	247Wishes, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/21/2012 1:48:32 AM	My husband and I have been blessed with two beautiful girls that are 15 months apart. We did not plan them to be so close. Now, I wouldnt have it any other way. They are currently 4&amp;5... So, the present story is that we have tried to conceive for over a year now. Sadly we had a Chemical pregnancy Sept 2011. Then, 6 months later I was hospitalized for Pneumonia. I took Chlomid in Feb before I became ill and thankfully that time it didn't work. I only say that because of the physical hell that sickness put my body through. I am grateful a newly developing baby didn't have to endure it. My cycles are pretty regular, around 27 days. I am feeling healthy and back to my regular self. So I took my 2nd dose of Chlomid this last cycle in May. Now Im happy to say that I am pregnant. I wonder if I could be pregnant with multiples. I took my 1st pregnancy test at my doctors office 5 days before my expected period and they said it was extremely dark. They asked me twice if I am sure I had a cycle in May. &quot;I did and that is when I took the Chlomid.&quot; I said. Now, I have been asked to go in again in a few more days for another blood draw to see how my Count is progressing. Maybe they will be able to see at that point and let me know what I can expect. Twins do not run in my family history. So, I will be extra excited to see how the next few weeks play out.  I will post again soon. Till then, best wishes on your journey to achieving &quot;Baby&quot; XxXxX

I did conceive at the end of May 2010 and we had a healthy baby boy in March of 2011.  I experienced no major side effects and I am looking going back on clomid to conceive again!  Wish me luck!

I took it for 3 continous month with dosage increase each month without success. I had not loosen heart as had heard from many online commnets of success stories the very next month after the medicine was stopped. Same happened with me..We are blessed with a cutie baby girl and she is 10 months old now. So we are not sure if clomid worked or not but then do no loose heart. God is great and will hear your prayers but I will definitely advice to take this medicine. Always be happy and be with a pleasant smile. Think only about positives and have your husband with your side......

It did give me hot flashes and bad headaches. I felt like I had the flu most of the time. Also very irritable. But it did work both times. In fact also had a baby in the middle of those years without clomid. My big question is what kind of side effects if any have grown children (adults) had? I have not been able to find any answers or comments.

Hopefully it works this cycle, if it does I will continue this dose for 3 months, if not I will be referred to an infertility specialist because I have only ovulated twice since taking the clomid.

Well if that was the case then I would have had a 33 day cycle so I started my clomid straight away, which the OBG stated that was ok, she has given me another 3months cycle. I am on the 3rd cycle now and using preseed again. Baby dust to you all.

I did blood work on day 21 to check for progesterone levels and got the results back today (3.9)  so my doctor suggested I take Clomid days 5-9.  I am on day 1, so I will start to use soon. We have been trying for 6mths and I am almost 35. Please pray for us.  We want a baby more than anything. I will report back in a month.  L-

I went for almost 6 months without having a period at all. On the third round, and increased dosage I finally ovulated. Three times. I ended up pregnant with triplets. Because of the complications of multiples, I ended up delivering the babies way too early and all three died. Now I am wanting to try again and the doctors are telling me that I will have to go on Clomid again to get pregnant. I am so scared and can't go through that heartbreak again.

I heard so much about preseed and got some from amazon with the tubes. Am on here to say that my last cycle was 28days I am a day late so did a pregnancy test today and got a faint positive line. As you see from my last post some of the side affects, I researched so much on clomid etc that I took the tablets at night around the same time on this lot. The only side affect I got this time was hot flushes, so I think I sleept through the rest. Clomid does dry the cm so preseed was great help and I think that heled me to conceive with the clomid 2nd round. I recommend preseed with people taking clomid. Baby dust to you all, I will keep you updated. Xx

Very discouraging and I hope everyone has better luck with it than me.

I had been using ovulation tests prior to starting clomid and usually i was ovulating.. but not always. Also the length of my cycle would be 38days one month then 27 the next. So I took one round of clomid, I ovulated one week after the last dose of clomid and got pregnant that month! The only side effect I had were some headaches, but they were tolerable with tylenol and it was worth it in the long run.

My fertility specialist increased the dose each month until I was taking 175mgs.  I felt so sick, I decided it couldn't be healthy.  I got pregnant on my own two years later and eight years later, at 39, I was diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.  I have no family history and eight years is about what it would have taken for my cancer to have grown to where it was.  This is not &quot;fertility light&quot; like they make it out to be.

I only have one ovary but the meds are helping me ovulate correctly each month. My only downfall is I also have other female issues that may be getting in the way, even if the Clomid is doing its job. I've noticed some females on here mention something about ultrasounds. You SHOULD be getting ultrasounds EVERY TIME you start a new round. I usually get two ultrasounds for each round to make sure all is well. Be your own advocate, people!! Getting pregnant is not magic, especially with medical issues. P.S. No side effects that I have noticed

Side effects include hot flashes and fullness of breasts. But these are small hurdles to jump while keeping the goal of pregnancy in the background. Although the symptoms can make you feel like you want to relax, it's so important to keep active during this time. Get at least 30 mins of exercise per day. While taking clomid,I recommend getting the hsg test to make sure your fallopian tubes and uterus are okay. The test is not as painful as some people make it seem to be. (You can bring a stress ball.) Next, you should also have an ultrasound of your ovaries to make sure that the follicle is being produced. These things take time, but, as women, we should be able to multi-task to solve the infertility problem as quickly as we possibly can. When in doubt, pray to St. Gerard, the patron Saint of Motherhood.  Good luck to all and please continue sharing your stories and advice.

The Clomid was not helping make eggs,  only the hormones.  10 rounds of NOTHING.  so if you are on it longer than 3 months, insist on a ultrasound to check on egg development.

Keeping fingers and toes crossed for success because this med is cheap and easy to use.

The first month I took 50 mg and did not ovulate.  The second month, the Doctor upped my prescription to 100 mg and I ovulated and got pregnant!  I actually did not have a lot of side effects.  I honestly felt kind of good when taking it, like not as tired as I normally am.  The second month, I did break out more than normal, but I wouldn't dare complain about that.  That was really the only side effect for me though.

I haven't had any major side effects which I'm thankful for! We have 1 amazing little boy (clomid baby) and are hoping for 1 more :) Our experience with Clomid has been positive in the aspect that I can get pregnant while taking it! After trying to get pregnant for 2+ years I took Clomid and after the 1st dose we conceived our little guy, he's almost 2 now! We decided not to go on anything birth control because of how long it took us to get pregnant the first time. My Dr put me on Clomid again this time around and I took it in April &amp; June (2 doses) and we found out in August that we were expecting, the excitement didn't last long because we ended up having an ectopic pregnancy. I have now started on Clomid again -- I had to take Provera prior to taking Clomid -- and we are hoping for the BEST!!!! I'm very nervous to try again with our loss only being 3 months ago but we're so ready to have another bundle of joy!! So our success rating on Clomid has been GREAT!!!

I went see my Dr. and she gave me a Rx for Clomid. I took it on days 3-7 and starting on day 11 I used ovulation tests. I got a positive on day 13, had intercourse that day, skipped one and did it the next day and temperatures proved I ovulated on day 15. Two weeks later I got a positive pregnancy test!

After 3 months on clomid nothing has happened except for the side effects (headaches, upset stomach, dizzyness...)Looks like it's time for me to say goodbye to Clomid and really allow God to take control.

My doctor put me on Clomid, the first three months were ok, and now that my levels are where my doctor wants them to be I am now on my 3rd cycle of 150mg....yes thats right 150mg. I hope that it works soon and hopefully we will be pregnant before the year comes to an end. My doctor believes that we will be pregnant soon. The only problem I have is the side effects, upset stomach, blurred vision, headaches, bloating. It sucks but its worth the final outcome. fingers crossed

I've remarried and moved out of town. This is when I found my doctor who prescribe clomid. I have irregular periods all my life. In March of 2010 he prescribe provera (to induce period) and clomid 50mg. It didn't work. Next month provera and clomid 100mg didn't work. So I waited and waited until July to take provera and clomid 150mg. Read that: 150mg!!! and it work! I had my period on August 2. I am now 1month pregnant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't lose hope everyone! I wish you all luck!

I have been using it for a year now and still have not been able to get pregnant. I will continue taking these meds until the next year until I see my doc again and hopefully he will up my dose. I have terrible hot flashes and slight abdominal cramping. Other than that no major side effects. When taking this medication you must have patience. This is something that doesnt work over night.

My husband is getting screened tomorrow to make sure he is OK.  The clomid did make me ovulate the last 5 months so I assume it to be working since before that I was not ovulating on a monthly basis.  My OB/GYN is telling me that the next step (If my husband is good to go ) is my choice of either a Hysterosalpingogram or Laparoscopy (minor surgery) to test and see if my tubes are blocked.  I have no history of ovarian cancer, endo, or cysts so we are not sure what the problem is.  Wish us luck!

I began treatment immediately following a laparoscopic procedure to remove endometriosis and ovarian cysts. I had extreme cramping, hot flashes and substantial hair growth on my face.  The hair growth is permanent and still present 5 years later and I have not been able to get pregnant.  This drug made me feel terrible and I still suffer from the side effects.  I would never use it again.

I have wanted a baby since I was a little girl, and always thought it would just happen, and it just hasn't happened yet. My doctor put me on Clomid 3 weeks ago, and I am at the days of waiting to get my period, or not. I have always had my period every 24-26 days, so I am just believing in God to make this happen for my husband and I. I did have alot of the side affects from taking clomid, and I did my thing on the days I was suppose to. I really want this to work the first time, cause I am dreading all the tests that will come up if I do start. Thank you to all the other ladies that posted your success stories, it really helped me stay positive.  
Male Infertility	wslady, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	6/23/2010 1:24:53 PM	My husband &amp; I have been trying to conceive our 2nd child for a year now. We conceived easily with the 1st but he has since been diagnosed with a medical condition that requires him to take Prednisone &amp; other drugs. Because this drug is a steroid, it has affected his sperm count &amp; motility. I get positive ovulation tests each month but no luck getting PG. I start taking Clomid tomorrow in hopes that it will help us. If not, we are scheduled for an IUI next month. I know that it is very frustrating but you have to leave it in God's hands. I know that he will take care of things...so I have to stay faithful &amp; patient no matter how long it takes. Babies are definitely worth it!! Good luck to you all!

I just had my second surgery for severe endometriosis. It was so bad it had actually formed cobwebs. I took my first cycle of clomid 50mg a day for 5 day. We really want twins so i have high hopes for this drug. I have been taking home ovulation tests and not had a positive for 5 days. Getting worried. Really hoping that we get prego soon. It sucks all of my friends are pregnant or have a kid or two. It just makes me stress out more. My psyche can't handle too much more dissappointment. I'm already terrified to take a test cuz i always get a big fat NO. Fingers crossed. Prayers would be appreciated!!

Female Problems Causing Trouble in Getting Pregnant	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/6/2010 1:04:22 PM	I took 3 rounds of clomid with no luck.  I took two months off and then started another 3 rounds.  On my last round of clomid,I got an HSG (to see if there was a blockage in my fallopian tube) and there was not a blockage.  I had made an appt with a fertility specialist to see what our next step was (my husband and I have been trying for a yeah and a half).  I got to cancel the appoint because I found out that I am pregnant!! I swear the Clomid and the HSG did the trick!!  Good luck to everyone and don't lose hope!!

I am in my early 40's and he is in his mid 40's.. He tested fine just me not getting pregnant right away. I have experienced alot of fatigue from morning to late afternoon, mood swings, hormone changes, increased appetite, nausea, feeling of faintness, weakness, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, etc. I had an ultrasound last month to check if any cysts developed which they did on both ovaries but they were small now I just had another ultrasound and the one on the left grew in size. I now have one 3cm and one 6cm causing some pain and pressure. I guess I am too sensitive for this drug. I cannot take it anymore. Praying for a baby the natural way now with God's blessing.
An Insufficiency in Ovulation	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	4/14/2010 10:36:21 PM	My husband and I have been ttc for 7 months. My progesterone levels have been low, in the 4 range, and my ob said I should be between a 10 &amp; 15 to achieve pregnancy. In my 1st month on Clomid, my level remained in the 4 range. During my 2nd month of treatment, my level was a 27, although I did not get pregnant. However, I am very hopeful that this next cycle, the 3rd, will do the trick. Although it caused extremely painful ovulation, (so much so I thought I had a bladder infection) if it works to get us pregnant, it will be well worth it. It has also caused me to have extreme hot flashes, but again, the end result will be well worth it if it works. Hoping for a positive pregnancy test this month!

Very glad it only took one round because the pain in my ovairy was terriable!!I thought they were going to pop out of my skin. My doctor was very conserned about the pain to he said I should have been unable to tell I was on anything, so I guess I was a rare case! I would tell anyone to try this if they have been ttc for over a year. We waited 2 and a  half years before going to the doctor and now we wish we would have gone sooner. Good luck to all of you and lots of baby dust!!

I took it after 4+ years of trying, single clomid, got pregnant, miscarried. Then took double clomid got pregnant 10 months later and had a full term baby. It took 6 1/2 years more to finally have another baby on triple clomid. My two sons are now 31 and 25. Well worth the trouble. Just now finding out that obesity had a lot to do with infertility, and I was heavy. So if weight is an issue - lose it. Trust me I know from experience. Good luck to all of you. Having babies is definitely wonderful, but we expanded our family by doing foster care and adopted three more children - one more boy and 2 girls. So don't give up - there are all sorts of ways to get children - and you do love them just as much as your biological.

Stimulation of Ovarian Function	rubyred, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	2/14/2010 1:02:51 AM	I am 37 yrs old and have been trying to convceive for 2 yrs. My Dr. started me on the lower dosage of Clomid 50mg. Nothing happened. I felt ok, but it did make me have a terrible period, which was expected.  When the Dr. increased my dosage to 100mg everything changed for the worse. I acted like a different person and became very angry and depressed. By the end of the month on this dosage I couldn't get out of bed from depression and couldn't stop crying and having feelings of self loathing. Friends, this is NOT me. I am a really happy and positive person. I write this to warn you to watch for this side effect. I am blessed with an understanding husband and supportive family, but believe me, I was unbearable. Sadly, I did not get pregnant, but for my own sanity and relationship with others went off of the medication.  Please be careful of this. If you feel sad and too depressed, please talk to your Dr. After going off of it I went back to my old self. Unfortunately with no baby, but it was a choice I had to make. Please pray that the Lord will bless us with a baby in another way. God bless all of you who so badly want to be a mother. More women understand this emptiness than you realize, even though it seems like a lonely quest.

Essentially, I have now had 2 or 3 periods in per month for the past two months. I just went back to see my Gyn today on an emergency basis becuase I have started again and could not be seen, so I had to go to the ER for the excessive pain that I suffer from...nothing for the exessive bleeding.

An Insufficiency in Ovulation	 Jennifer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/9/2010 9:42:30 PM	The doctor told me I was not ovulating, this really was devastating to me as I never supected that I would have trouble getting pregnant because my periods where always regular and on time.  That is, until one month I skipped a period, I was so excited, I thought I was pregnant, but with 2 negative home pregnancy test, I went to the doctor, that is when I learned of my hormonal imbalance.  The doctor prescribed 50ml of clomid, the first month, did not work, my levels were only at a 2.8 from my initial level of 2.4.  The second month 100ml which did not work as well, my levels only went up to 3.4.  I was so heart broken that I only had one more increase to go, then I would have to go to a specialist which my insurance did not cover and very expensive, that I decided to get a second job to start saving up for the specialist treatment.  Then, I told my self to give clomid one last try at 150ml.  To my SURPRISE, My levels went up to 27!!! I am ovulating, just found out yesterday.  Now I have to wait another 2 weeks to find out if I am pregnant.  I only have 3 more months to go on clomid at 150ml, so I am buying an ovulation monitor to help with the conception.  I want to let everyone know that I know it hurts to find out that treatment is not working, but do not give up on clomid. Trust in GOD...  I hope pregnacy comes very soon to all of us.

My husband I and have been trying to conceive for about 4 years. My dr put me on Clomid and I took 6 rounds of it still with no success. My husband and I have both been tested and nothing has been found in either one of us that should cause us not to be able to have children. Although we're both heartbroken, we will leave it in God's hands.

I have not been diagnosed with anything wrong, but can't still get pregnant. I have tested my FSH level, normal, and used pregancy ovulator kits to time it right and started treatment with Clomid 50mg and I feel butterflies and cramps in my low abdomen, but don't want to get happy yet, until I miss my period next week. It's very heartbreaing to think and feel pregnant and find out that is negative.

Female Problems Causing Trouble in Getting Pregnant	 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5			11/18/2009 3:11:48 AM	Hello ladies, I had posted about 3mths ago about me and my hubby trying to get pregnant, I was diagnosed with PCOS so my Doctor put me on 100mg of metformin which increased to 2000mg a day, and provera and clomid, Metformin(glucophage) it made me really sick everyday excessive vomitting and diarrhea but me wanting my baby I didnt care, so for 3mths that was my routine, disappointed at no pos. preg test, i stop taking my metformin the 3rd mth because I was really sick, my period was irregular that is why i was taking the metformin, so while taking it the 3mths i always got a cycle, but since i stopped in Oct. 2009 when Nov. came, I didnt get my cycle I was wondering how was I going to tell my doctor I stopped taking it and I didnt have my cycle this month, so i took a preg. test to make sure but it was - , 3 days later I took another one - at 3 min - but for some reason i didnt throw it away so lol 4hrs later it was a faint line THank YOu Jesus (I am now a mother to be 6wks pregnant today)

He is 3 now and we are tring for another baby.  I have severe PCOS and was told at a very young age that I would never conceive on my own.  Today is the 5th day of my cycle and I am starting my 4th round of clomid tonight.  Since I started it in August it has not made me ovulate at all, which has really dissapointed me.  I have not ovulated but I am having regular periods so it's very confusing.  The clomid worked for us once before and I am praying it works for us again because we cannot afford any other treatments.  I feel so alone sometimes and then I come to others comments and I feel like I am part of something.  I want my body to work correctly and sometimes get really frustrated that it isn't doing what it is suppose to do. My mom had this syndrome and had 3 girls.  Let's hope I take after her in that too.

After 3 full years of TTC, my husband and I are ready to take action and move on to the next step....so probably within 2 wks I should be getting my period and getting on it. I am very hopeful that it will work for us. I am 100% fine, but the problem lies with my husband. Male infertility problems. So we will be starting our first round of Clomid and our first IUI this month. Super excited to get things moving and praying we're successful this first month of treatment. Hopefully the side effects of Clomid aren't that bad for me ;) I'll keep you all updated on our progress/success!

My husband and I haven't used protection in three years. I was so worried that I would never be able to have children. I took my first round of Clomid beginning 9/5 at the lowest dose 50mg. I found out I was pregnant 9/28/09. This was a dream come true for me and I would recommend this product to anyone!!! I had very little side effects....slightly moody and ovarian cramps. It was well worth it. I pray that all your dreams come true!!!

I have been on clomid for a year and a half now and not pregnant. I started with 50mg to 200mg. I recently discovered that I had endometriosis, which was never mentioned when I had a HSG exam last year. I was very dissapointed, my DR. referred me to another specialist. I am going to do an IUI procedure now. I am really hoping it will work. For anyone that has been trying for over a year, I strongly recommend that you look into this procedure. It is not as expensive as IVF, which can be up to $10K. I am really relieved that my insuance is going to cover up to $5K. Look into your insurance if you have it. And maybe some of you will get a blessing. I come every now and then to this site to read all of your comments, which makes me feel alot better after knowing that other women know what I am going through. Keep hope. I am really hoping this procedure will work.

Female Problems Causing Trouble in Getting Pregnant	keljer777, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/23/2009 12:02:23 AM	I was told it would take an average of 3 months for someone w/ the conditions I had (polyps, endo-metriosis, precancer cells, mild PCOS, etc.) for the clomid to take effect and it only took 1 month! I was very fortunate! However, I did experience severe mood swings and rapid growth in my facial hair and that was  just from the 5 pills you take in the cycle. Once I became pregnant and no longer had to take the meds the side effects went away immediately, of course. I am going to be taking it again very soon! :) My daughter is 2 and it's definitely time for another!
Female Problems Causing Trouble in Getting Pregnant	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	25-34	10/22/2009 11:11:06 PM	I'm 25, my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for 18 months and one year ago I was diagnosed with PCOS.  My Dr. immeidately started me on Metformin beginning with 500mg/day for one week, increasing by 500mg/day each week after that until I now take 2000mg/day.  It took approximately 6 months for the Metformin to regulate my period without jump-starting it with Provera, when it did start I had a 12 day, extremely heavy period, and then 10 days later I had another 14 day period, the heaviest I've ever had in my life.  I had taken Clomid for two months before the Metformin started to regulate my period and it didn't work (although that time I had no side effects from it), so we waited until we got results on the Metformin for a couple months and then started taking Clomid again.  I have been on 100mg of Clomid on days 3-8 of my cycle and am in the middle of my 5th cycle on Clomid and Metformin combined (this time around).  I have been successfully ovulating for 4 months with this combo, but so far am not pregnant.  I have experienced severe nausea and diareaha from the Metformin, but found that taking two Immodium AD pills every night when I take the Metformin helps that significantly.  I have been experiencing nausea, dizziness, cramps, nipple soreness, anxiety, severe depression, and hot flashes on the Clomid.  If I can get pregnant it will be worth it, but I hope it happens soon because I really hate taking the Clomid.  Trying to get pregnant has been the hardest thing I've ever done and when all my friends, family members, co-workers, etc. are having babies it gets even harder.  My best advice is try to stay positive, but be realistic about your expectations!  I know that sounds bad because obviously for some people this works, but when it doesn't it is crushing, so just try to be realistic and not get your hopes up too high, that just makes it harder.

I actually haven't started taking the drug yet but I'm giving it great ratings in anticipation of great success! I was recently diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and my doc has suggested I take this along with something else. I'm a little nervous to begin treatment but the success stories are very encouraging. I will start taking the drug next week and could use your prayers/support. I am hoping to report great news as early as next month!!

Me and my family are so excited. I have blood work today just to make sure it is correct and lord knows I hope it is because I could no handle a faulty test! But ladies don't give up I was very close to giving up and I did not think I could handle much more stress but I toughened through it and now I am glad I did. Good Luck to all!

I have had 3 more cycles of taking it. My second one resulted in what my doctor said was a chemical pregnancy (I showed positive on HPT but 4 days later got a heavy period). That month I felt really sick. However since then I have continued to go through the cycle of taking Clomid (days 5-10) and then getting my period &amp; blood test confirming I'd ovulated. This month my period was late, and I've come up positive on HPT, I feel much healthier then last time and have fingers crossed no miscarriage!My advice, is as hard as it seems, stay positive, because eventually it will happen, even if it's by other means (IVF, Surgery, clomid, etc)

I have had surgery 1 1/2 year ago for endom. I have tested positive for ovualation each month but no positive pregnancy test yet. I have my periods every 31 days therfore I should start on sept. 27. But seeing how i am impatient I took a test on my 27 cycle day (9-22-09) with negetative results however I was told that could possibly be to soon to tell with a urine test. However if I do start I will be on my 4th month the doctor told me i could only take it for 6 months. Good luck to everyone baby dust to all!!!  
Stimulation of Ovarian Function	smartola, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	9/23/2009 7:39:44 AM	I have been taking clomid for three months now but I just got my period again this morning. My husband and I are not happy. I'm 30 and we've been trying to get pregnant now for 2 years. Initially, my husband was told he had a low sperm count and this led us to changing into a healthier lifestyle which changed things drastically. The last time he went for his test, we were told his sperm count is gone from 11m to 108m which would have been good enough only if we had got pregnant. I did all the necessary test and everything seems to be ok with me but my doctor still prescribed clomid to boost our chance of getting pregnant. I'm done with my 3 month clomid cycle now and I'll call my doctor today to see what the next step will be. If there is any of you that has similar problem with success, I can use some encouragements.

My boyfriend and I have been trying to concieve for 6 months or so, I went to the dr and she perscribed me clomid, 50 mg. I took it for my first time and bingo...now I am five weeks pregnant and waiting for next week when I can go get my ultrasound. I would say it was the clomid and we were very satisfied with the results.

While I already have many follicles on both ovaries, my doctor has been very impressed with the size and amount after Clomid.  I want to warn potential users that the side effects are very real.  Nausea, headache, eye sensitivity, etc.  Just be prepared!

My dosages have increase from 50 to 150mg.  I have not ovulated, not once.  My doctors said I have baby eggs but no developing eggs. My options now are to increase the length of days I take clomid or start on the injections.  I think I will start on the injection.  I am 34 years old and I'm kinda in a hurry to become pregnant!

I have PCOS and my Dr. got my periods in straight and I have been ovulating. I have been taking Clomid for 3 months and I find out 30th if I am PG or not. I dread that day every month because I always start my period! I am tired of being disappointed every month. Why does this have to be so hard? I know many of you women reading this are going through the same thing as I am. I am just getting ready to give it all up. I have always heard that when you quit trying you will get PG. How can we not think about it when it is something that affects our everyday life? Some people just don't understand because they did not go through this. I really hate when these girls get PG and have an abortion or just don't care about there babies, when all of us women are trying and have been trying. Yes ladies I know I am blabbing on but my friends and family just don't really understand since they have never went through this. It is hard and I am scared once I do get PG I will have a miscarriage like most other women. I just want a happy family!

Well, 2 week ago I found out that I lost the baby. The baby stop growing at 5 week and this week I should have been 10 weeks. Two days ago I had a lot of bleeding and my doctor said that I starting to have the miscarriage. She gave me misoprostol 200mg to help clean out my system. So I will start back taking clomid maybe next month. Please get I mind that everything happen for a reason and that God will work it out.

My husband and I have been TTC for over a year and a half. I just received my first round of Clomid Aug 20th. The clomid worked wonders I had 3-4 folicles in each ovary that were the proper size.

We have been ttc since our wedding day. I was diagnosed with PCOS about 10 years ago and so we've known that it would be an uphill battle to concieve. I've been on Clomid since Oct 08. I've yet to have a positive Ovulation Prediction Test. This is the last month of 150. My OB/GYN won't give anymore Clomid after this so I'll have to wait and see where we go from here. I've been on Metformin but had so many problems with it that I now take Glyburide and have a much better time with it. It's easy to say keep the faith but it gets harder with every negative pregnancy test I take. Best of luck to everyone.

I have to go Sept 1st for a blood test. does this sound right? Silly question, but on days 5-9 taking clomid does this mean day 5 when i have my period? or Day 5 on my clean day.

I come on my cycle the first of every month. On August 1 I did not come on. I took 6 pregnancy test and they all came back positive. Ladies please understand that it is not the medicine, but it is God working through the clomid. Please pray and keep the faith. If God promise this to you, he will make it come true. I am now 5 weeks and my baby is due on April 7, 09. God bless and good luck to all.

On day 21 I went and had blood work done to see if the medicine worked and IT DID!!  Now our next step is to take a pregnacy test!  Fingers crossed!

The only side effects I was experiencing were hot flashed and headaches.  I was sent to a reproductive endo specialist and he has me currently on 250 mg.  I had some hot flashes this time, but after the fourth dose I have been really light-headed.  I am keeping my fingers crossed that this works.

Since then, I had not been ovulating so my OBGYN put me on Clomid 50mg for the past 2 months, with no obvious side effects or getting pg for that matter!  It was discovered recently that I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and even on the 50mg of Clomid he said I'm not producing follicles.  I am scheduled for a Hysterosalpingogram, in which dye is injected into my fallopian tubes and x-rayed to see if there are any current blockages (I didn't need my f tube removed from the ectopic). Then, I will start 100mg of Clomid next month, along with oral estrogen pills and progesterone topical gel for my cervix. My OBGYN is hopeful, but I am seriously ready for invitro or whatever is necessary.  He urged me to be patient, and I am a bit nervous to injest all these drugs but will do what I need to do for now!  Will keep you posted and good luck to you all!...  Lisa

I have had several trips to the Doctor and finally found out what is wrong. I missed my period for approximatly 5 months and the doctor did some tests. My uterus is not cushiony like it should be and is not opening up or something like that for me to have a period or get PG. My doctor tried me on different medications to get my period started and then we found one that worked. Premerian and something else I cant remember what it is called but then I started Clomid this month. Today is my fifth day of being off it. It is also the day to get PG. I have been hurting very badly today in the bladder area and I webmd it and I found out I am ovulating so hopefully we can have a little one or little ones! I don't know if I could try like others can. It would be to disappointing for me. I am already sad enough. But we will see God will bless us when he sees it fit!
Other		4	3	5			7/16/2009 11:02:21 AM	I am interested in hearing from moms who took Clomid to get pregnant and were successful. My question is out of all the women who have used Clomid, does anyones child have any behavioral problems. I know this sounds crazy but Clomid was used by my neice 4 years ago and my gorgeous, bright great-nephew is suffering from anxiety/behavior issues. Not trying to put the blame on anyone or anything, just curious if other Clomid users are experiencing any of the same types of issues with there child. It would be nice to know if any other families are experiencing the same problems. This is beyond &quot;normal&quot; 4 year old behavior. Would love to hear from anyone who can relate! Thanks for your time. Andrea Gray

AGO.   THIS MONTH I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND THE MEASURED EVERYTHING, I HAD A FOLLICLE THAT WAS GOOD SIZE SO I GOT AN OVIDREL SHOT THAT WAS SIMPLE TO USE I TOOK IT AND WAS TOLD TO HAVE SEX OFTEN IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.  I WAS ABLE TO TAKE A HOME PREGNACY TEST AND TO MY SUPRISE IT WAS POSITIVE SO I TOOK A FEW MORE AND THEY ALL SAID THE SAME THING I CALLED MY DOCTOR AND IT WAS CONFIRMED WITH BLOOD.  AFTER MANY YEARS OF STRUGGLING I AM HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE A MOMMY.  ALTHOUGH I HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BECAUSE I AM ONLY 2 WEEKS PREGNANT SO I STILL NEED LOTS OF PRAYERS AND I WISH THE BEST OF LUCK AND MY PRAYERS ARE STILL WITH ALL THE STRUGGLING WOMEN WHO WOULD BE GREAT PARENTS.

When I got off BC, my period wasn't coming back. My dr had me wait a while and finally I got put on Deprovera. That was 2 months ago. This month I also did Chlomid. I go to the dr tomorrow for bloodwork and a pelvic exam next week. I would be ecstatic beyond belief if I was PG but also want to know that the meds helped me ovulate. I keep mentally psyching myself out that I have signs of pregnancy, but it may be wishful thinking. I'm glad I can go to this website and read other people's successes (and frustrations). It seems that everyone around me is PG and it was so easy for them. STAY POSITIVE!

And I'm here to announce after 3 months of trying I am FINALLY PREGNANT!! These drugs do work you just have to use them properly. For me that meant taking clomid on days 3-7 of my cycle, and taking prochieve on day 17-22. I took Metformin (generic version) every day, 3 times a day and it all worked.  One thing that helped me was using the online ovulation predictor kits.  When I read online that I had to make love on days 16-18 in order to get pregnant.  We did it everyday.  My doctor actually advised me to start on day 12 and to continue for 14 days.  Well I decided to do just that but I added the extra days thinking it couldn't hurt.  And look it didn't!  If you wan to know when I took my medication exactly and how much read my posting from March 4 (ANH). I really wish all of you the very best.  May God bless you all with your hearts desire.  Baby dust to all!!!!

We have been tring for one year in Aug. to have our second baby. Went to Dr. nothing seemes to be wrong so he suggest we use clomid. We just took the first dose and I had no side affects. The key is to take it at night.  I am due to start the big P. on june 9th and we will see. I am a little concerned or happy about one thing, I have a lot of tenderness in my breast and I am hoping it is because I am pregnant. We always wanted 2 children but I think due to waiting so long to try to conceive it has lowered my chances. I will key in again to let you all know what happens.  We should never loose hope and should practice a lot!!!!! Good luck to all of you.  May babies be with you!!!

I was 6 weeks pergo in sept and had a m/c. I saw my DR, and he gave me the option to either get prego or have surgery again. My boyfriend &amp; I decided to try to get prego again, last month no luck, so my DR put me on clomid on day 3-7 and I went in to see him on day 12 (friday may 29) for a synogram, my rt ovary had an egg that was almost at 22 cm, I recieved a shot yesterday (HCG)to jumpstart my ovulation, I really hope this works, he told us we need to have sex for the next 2 days. I will not know until at least the 14th of next month due to the shot-bc it will show up as a false/negative result bc of the HCG. I had had headaches, breast tenderness, and hot flashes due to the clomid--I can handle that just be be able to become a mom. I wish everyone else well--I will keep you updated!

My husband and I have been waiting to get good news, but it just doesnt come our way. I try not to get discouraged, and its really hard. I like reading everyones reviews, because when I read them, its nice to hear from other women that know what we are going through. My Dr. has a strong feeling that I will get pregnant with this medication, I don't know if I am so sure anymore. As for my symptoms, I really haven't had too many a few hot flashes here and there. I pray every night that we will soon hear good news, until that day is here, I truely wish all of you best of luck in this journey that we are all taking. Never lose hope.

I never followed up with the medication due to recieving a new job in a different state...but now that I am settled in i am soon to try my next round of 50mg this month...since it helped with ovulation last time I hope it will result in pregnancy this time. The only side effect I had the first round was HOT flashes...not too bad. Wish me luck! And good luck and prayers to all of those who are trying as well!

We were married last year in June and started trying right away.  I found out shortly after that I have PCOS, and wasn't ovulating.  I am now on my 2nd round of clomid @ 100mg and have been taking metformin since Sep of 08. I have been having hot flashes like crazy and headaches this time that I didn't notice them with the 50mg. I am hoping this works for us.  I go in today to have Ultrasound and find out if my follicles are big enough to produce a baby.  It really sucks to not be one of the &quot;lucky&quot; ones who don't have any issues but we are dealing and praying that clomid is our answer.

My husband &amp; I had been together 5 years &amp; rarely used protection &amp; I never became pregnant. After all the tests the only thing they found was a SLIGHTLY low progesterone level in me. Dr decided to give Clomid a shot for 6 cycles &amp; we'd go from there. No really bad side effects. Mostly hot flashes. I conceived on my 3rd cycle &amp; am 30 weeks pregnant w/ baby #1, a little boy. Baby dust to everyone!

Stimulation of Ovarian Function	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/16/2009 5:20:03 PM	This is my story which started 21 years ago. We tried for over 2 years to conceive. After finally getting pregnant, then miscarrying, my doctor decided to do some fertility testing. He determined that I ovulated too late in my cycle for the fertilized egg to implant. He prescribed 50mg Clomid to move up my ovulation date. It worked the first try. I had a baby boy.The only side effect was painful ovulation. When we decided to have another child, I again took 50mg Clomid. This time I got pregnant on the second try. However, I produced 2 eggs (fraternal twins!)AND one of those eggs split producing an identical twin to one of the eggs. 8 months later, I gave birth to my adorable triplet boys! The identical triplets were not due to Clomid, according to my MD. Identicals are a &quot;fluke&quot; of nature, not even due to heredity.

I tried clomid for two months and had no success but that was because I was taking it improperly.  I have since gotten a new Dr which specializes in Infertility and have no complaints thus far even though I am only on my first month.  For all of you who have been asking when to take clomid, I would strongly suggest that you speak with your doctor.  You need to have your medical history checked, get a physical exam, and have your husbands semen analysis before beginning clomiphene.  My doctor also prescribed Metformin at 500mg.  I take Metformin three times a day and I started taking clomid on day 3-7 of my cycle.  I was instructed to then wait until day 12 to start trying.  On Day 17 I am to start Prochieve which is something that I would suggest for all of you out there who have miscarried or are taking clomid.  It is supposed to increase the cervical fluid which should reduce chances for miscarrying.  I was told to make love every other day starting on day 12.  On day 21 I am to get my progest. levels checked to find out if I ovulated and then start the whole process again if no baby.  I would strongly suggest that anyone who has not spoken to a doctor speak to one before starting these drugs.  I have been through two doctors already not because there was no success but b/c I thought there was not enough attention given to my situation.  This new Dr has prescribed Metformin, Clomid, Prochieve &amp; Provera (to start my period) which the other DR mentioned nothing about Metformin.  So I am prayerful that it works the first time around.  You are all in my prayers.  I never knew there were that many of us out there.  May God Bless you all with your hearts desire.

I am having problems with ovulating so my doctor suggested Clomid.  I have done two dosages, 50 mg the first time and then 100 mg the second time.  The only concern or shall I say weirdness about it is the way I feel.  I feel depressed, sad, tired, and easily agitated.  I don't know if it's just me or if it has to do with Clomid. I just know I started feeling this way last month.  Due to these feelings, I wasn't sure I wanted to take it again.  But we want to get pregnant so badly.  I know I shouldn't feel pressured because of my age, but I do especially when people tell me, you better get pregnant before it's to late and then the other thing I have to worry about is down syndrome in my family.  I am going to play it by ear and hope I feel better real soon because others are noticing I am just not myself.

Other	Deniz, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/16/2009 12:07:25 AM	I've been on this medication for 3 months already and haven't been able to concive yet! Besides clomid I've been taking some estrogen medication. I just had  my annual pap done and the results turned out to be abnormal. Two days before my pap appointment I had very ligh bleeding or more like spotting, which at first I thought was okay because ever since I stopped using Birth controll pills I had unexpected spotting time to time. The pap results diagnosis indicated that it was ASC-US. I had an abnormal pap about 10 years earlier and it was due to some minor infection and it went away by itself less than 6 months. Ever since then I've always had normal paps and about a year ago I had a vaginal ultrasound to check my uterus for any polyps etc. The result on that was all fine, no polyps or any other growth found. Now, during my pap this year my doctor informed me that I had a polyp about size of tip of a pinkie. I'm all worried and can't think of anything else but to blame clomid or the estrogen pills that I've been taking. I'd like to hear other people's opinions and experiences. Thank you.

After giving up and waiting I decided to see a new ob/gyn who diagnosed me with PCOS in July of last year. I was prescribed Metformin. After taking Glucophage for 4 months my doctor decided to add Clomid to the mix. After 1 month of using Clomid (100mg) and Metformin I got my BFP on 12/7/08. To my surprise the two actually work well together. My suggestion is if you are one of the unlucky women that suffer from PCOS talk to your doctor about adding Metformin with Clomid.

We finally decided to try again.  After talking to my doctor, he put me on Metformin and Clomid.  The only side effect I had from clomid was one hot flash and that was it.

I was pregnant and I gave birth to a set of twins. I am planning to use it again. Can anyone tell me when to use it? is it three days after the cycle or three days to/during the cycle? my new Dr. told me when to use it but the time is confusing. If clomid has worked for you, when do you start using it. Is it during your cycle or after?Thanks for your suggestion.

Stimulation of Ovarian Function	techgoddess1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	1/1/2009 10:13:28 PM	While I took the 5 day course (50mg CD 5-9), I was VERY hormonal, and cried a lot--felt like my PMS from my early 30's.  Some pelvic pain the 1st day of treatment, and some nausea the other days.  I took it before I went to bed, as I heard that lessened the symptoms, and it seems to. After I finished taking the pills, I had no reactions until CD 16, when the pain of ovulation nearly dropped me to my knees.  Next day, I had my 1st Positive OPK.  Had the pain on the right side of my pelvis, ranging up to my hip bone for 3 days--B'danced despite it.  Went to the Dr on CD18--no problem with enlarged ovaries--so now we wait to see if it worked.  If not, I have another Rx for 50 mg for next month...Bottom line--worked like it should for me, and the side effects were completely bearable...Good Luck!

I started taking the medication this month so this is fairly new to me. My OB GYN did tell me to take this drug at night so the side effects would be less harsh which I think helps. I do have several side effects though. The light tends to hurt my eyes and they feel sore, I have had a few headaches, I'm moody, loss of appetite, nausea and some vomiting. Although I would do anything to have a child so I could care less about the side effects. I am 30 and my husband 32, we have no children and pray everyday that this works. I'm only on the 50 mg dose so I hope it works for me and good luck to you all.

An Insufficiency in Ovulation	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/13/2008 3:29:15 PM	I started on Clomid due to irregular ovulation. My husband and I desired to become pregnant and since I don't ovulate on a regular basis my doctor started me on Clomid 50mg on day 5-9 of my cycle. The first time that I took it I got pregnant.  I then miscarried at 6 weeks. I am taking 50mg again since that dose was effective for me last time. I am only one my second pill so hopefully it will work again for me.  I did not notice any side effects of the drug except maybe some irritability, but I also work 12 hour night shifts as a nurse, so that can make me irritable also. Friends of mine who have taken it did have some bad side effects, but I think that when you really want a child you can handle a few side effects for 5 days. Good luck to all of you who are trying to get pregnant

We have been trying for the last 6 months to get pregnant after I miscarried. (The miscarriage came from a pregnancy on our own)After speaking w/ my doc about it and letting him know how irregular my cycles were, he put me on Clomid. I took 50 mg the first time to no avail and I started my second months worth (100 mg) yesterday! No side effects yet! I can not predict at all my ovulation (not even the thermometors help) so I have no idea when to try! Is there anyone who could help me with this problem? Also is it healthy to have intercourse every night while you are on Clomid or every other night (since I don't know when I am ovulating!)

I took the Clomid before bed to lessen the side effects.

I took clomid in Sept &amp; got pregnant but had a m/c (1st round of clomid). I just started again this week so hopefully i can get pregnant again and keep it this time. wish me luck!

I've been trying to conceive (assisted with medication) for about 10 months and longer than that if I count my time before being diagnosed with PCOS and starting medication.  I've posted on this site twice before (10/5 and 10/20) during different phases of my journey.  I did one round of Clomid (100mg) and found out I was pregnant on Friday!  I had few side effects with the clomid, but was not hopeful because I never got a positive with the ovulation predictor kit so I just kinda chose the &quot;most likely&quot; days to be intimate.  Well, it worked and I'm amazed.  I'd love to answer questions for anyone so if you have any, let me know.  Good luck to all of you!

My husband and I tried for 7 years to get pregnant and finally after the m/c turned to Clomid to help. I got pregnant the first time around. We wanted to try again a few years later, and turned to clomid once again and found out a few weeks after taking Clomid for the 3-7 days we were expecting again. I have two prefect little boys 4 yrs. and 14 months and would have never been able to do it, I don't think if it wasn't for Clomid. Only side effect I had was headaches to the drug. For those of you out there that are wanting a baby and have tried for year or even months, had a m/c...try this. I can't say enough good things about it. Good luck, keep your head up...it will happen. God bless.

I finished taking the clomid almost 2 weeks ago.  However the side effects didn't end until about 2 days ago so therefore the side effects don' t go away when you finsih the pills.  I had to change my shirt about 4 times a day due to hot flashes, and finally my abdomen quit hurting too.  Any more questions just leave a post and I will get back to you.  I have had two miscarriages in the last 6 years so I am trying to have faith that I will get pregnant with this medicine, I know that I can get pregnant I just hope this medicine  helps me get pregnant.  The first two times was without meds, so the main thing is just trying to have faith.

I sure do hope this medication works for us, becuase the side effects have been pure hell.  I am having the horrible hot flashes one minute I am cold as ice, and the next I have sweated through my shirt.  The abdominal pain sometimes is so bad that I almost hit the floor.  I just hope and pray that it works for us.  It would just be a little price to pay for an amazing gift.

We had no idea until then that it was going to be hard to come by. After about 6 months of trying with no success I made an appointment with my doctor. My doctor referred me to a fertility clinic and Dr. Frank Silver took us under his wing. I found out that I had cysts all over both of my ovaries and that my right ovary was inlarged. Dr. Silver immediately scheduled me for surgery and removed the cysts. I then started taking Clomid 150mg daily for 5 day each month and found out I was pregnant less than 5 months later. Our delight was suddenly ended 3 months later when I began bleeding and lost our baby. Two months after loosing our baby I was reluctant to try it again, but the idea of not giving it one more try for my husband eased my fears. After about 8 months of trying we started house hunting so our attention was taken away from baby camp and we dove into getting a house, but I still continued to take my medication on time every month. Finally about 5 weeks after moving into our home I began feeling a little queasy. I bought a three pack of pregnancy tests... And we were pregnant!!! Our son Payton is 2 1/2 years old now and we couldn't be happier!!! For those out there frusterated from going through this... Don't give up!!! When you least expect it, your little miracle will com. Remember that stressing eachother out on not being successfull each month puts one more barrier in your path. Love one another and have faith that one day you will have you little miracle.

He is 30 and I am 26 and in those 8 years I have had two miscarriages about 3 years apart.  The miscarriages caused me to have rh neg blood.  I just started my first round of Clomid at 50 mgs a day for five days, and this is my second day of taking the clomid. I have had some side effects (headaches and cramping). I have read the reviews, and I hope that this works for us because I feel like a failure and guilty that I can't give Derek the child he wants, and he is a very loving man.  I am so lucky to have this wonderful man whom I love more than anything in this world and beyond.  I know I can get pregnant because I have been twice before.  If anyone has any information about the clomid and when we should expect to start ovulation, and about when to have sex please respond.  But honestly I hope the best for anyone going through the same thing I am praying for you, and if you can pray for us too I'll take all the prayers I can get.  I want a baby to make our family complete.  If you have ANY info that might help please respond.  Thank You!

I posted, for the first time, on 10/5/08.  At that time I was taking glucaphage and provera.  Waiting for a period so I could start my first cylce of Clomid.  Well, I started my period on my 7th day of Provera.  I started taking 100mg of Clomid on the third day of my cycle, and tomorrow is the 6th day and will be my fourth day of taking the medicine.  I feel like I've had very few side effects.  A little bit of dizziness for about an hour, but that's it.  I have an appointment (in about a week) to see if I'm ovulating so I'll keep everyone posted.  Again, these message boards are my saving grace, thanks for all your insight.

This is a second marriage for both of us. He had a reversal done in May 07. I have never been on any type of birth control pills during my 1st marriage nor this one. My 1st hubby has 2 children (we always thought it was him). I found out that my left tube was 100% blocked and I have PCOS I had surgery Aug 27, 2008. My Ob would not give me Clomid so I switched doctors (she wanted me to spend $6000 for an IUI). My new doctor determined I have not been ovulating even though the tests said I had been. My current hubby's count and motility are low but,the doc feels confident that this should work. He also told me that clomid is also being used for men with the same issues as my husband.

HOWEVER, this time, they found a large ovarian cyst, and my treatments have now been stopped. THis apparentlty is a side effect, and the worst side effect is the hot flashes and sweating. All day long, and weeks after the treatment has ended.

I am on Provera to induce a period and will start clomid after that.  These message boards have helped a lot and I will keep everyone posted.

Female Problems Causing Trouble in Getting Pregnant	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	9/29/2008 2:22:36 PM	I started on 50mg in 6/08 after trying since 8/07. I am 26 &amp; DH is 24. Everything is good w/ DH, the RE even said his stats were &quot;out of this world.&quot; Nothing too abornal w/ me except my progesterone wasnt as high as he would like but it wasn't terribly low either. I followed dr's orders in june on which days to try. No pregnancy. The first time I took it I saw spots, got dizzy &amp; a little sick to my stomach &amp; some hot flashes. In July I used ovulation strips. They never seem to work well for me. Even when I had my ultrasound that showed my folicle, the line on the strip never got darker than the control line. In August I used a digital OPK. Started testing w/ the strips on cycle days 11 &amp; 12, switched to the digital on day 13 &amp; got my positive on day 16, meaning I ovulated any time between 16-18. No pregnancy tho. This month I started testing on day 14 (not wanting to waste the digital one's since they are expensive &amp; I'm out of strips) &amp; my tester didn't work. Tested again on day 15, tester didn't work. Tested again on day 16 (w/ new tester) through today which is day 22 &amp; haven't gotten a positive. So I'm assuming I didn't ovulate this month (which as far as I know has never happened to me before) or I ovulated early. Not much hope for this month. UNLESS I ovulated early. Then I possibly could've gotten pregnant on my 1 year wedding anniversary which would be nice. Only side effects after my first time around have been hot flashes &amp; feeling as though I was going to cry over EVERYTHING.

My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for the last 2 years.  I only just recently started Clomid.  I am in my third cycle now.  My doctor started me at 50mg for the first cycle.  She game me Provera to bring on a period first.  I took ovulation tests for 2 weeks and never ovulated.  Needless to say, I didn't get pregnant.  For my second cycle, she again gave me Provera to bring on my period and uped my Clomid to 100mg.  This time, however, I did ovulate.  I was very excited, but still no pregnancy.  Now, for my third cycle, I got my period all on my own without the Provera.  This would be my first period without medication in 5 years.  My doctor has now uped my Clomid to 150mg.  I have yet to ovulate, so only time will tell.  She said if I don't get pregnant this time around, we'll have to try other options.  This has been frustrating.  I have been a wreck lately with my mood swings, hot flashes, and breast soreness.  I'm losing all hope.  I'll keep you all posted on the outcome.-BEM

I have been to many doctors trying to find out why I did not have periods for months at a time. Every one of the doctors blew it off, they told me nothing was wrong. So I just thought that it was just me being worried and nothing was really wrong. When I was 25 I became pregnant after trying for a year and a half, I was very excited and relieved. My pregnancy was perfect and I had a healthy baby girl. We decided to start trying to have another baby when my daughter was a year and a half, nothing happened. I decided to go to my gyno again to see if maybe something was going on. My doctor decided to do some blood work, we found out I have PCOS. They started me on a medicine called Metformin. I started having regular periods. Then my doctor decided to start me on another medicine called Clomid along with the Metformin to help me ovulate. The first month on the medicine I didn't ovulate, my progesterone level was 0.7. The second month on the medicine my progesterone level was 9.8. We had hope that the medicine was working and maybe one more month would do it. The third month on the medicine my progesterone level was 7.5. I was devistated. Now we are hopefull that maybe this next month will work. My doctor told me on my last visit that I can only take the Clomid for one or two more months, then he will have to take me off of it. I am starting to wonder if the medicine is going to work for me at all. We'll see what happens next month, maybe it will be good news.

I believe I ovulated but I don't know if I'm pregnant yet I was told to wait until the 8th of next month before I see the reproductive specialist or start taking more of Clomid.  I have only had a few hot flashes but I was also taking prenatal vitamins to prepare my body just in case.  I drink a lot of water and green tea and watch what I eat. Clomid just takes time to work.  Everyones body is different.

My first round of Clomid 50mg, over 3 years ago, was successful.  I now have a 2 1/2 year old little boy.  The side effects that time were only some hot flashes.  This second round I seem to have more side effects especially this second cycle because I am taking 100mg.  A LOT more hot flashes, mood swings and headaches.  The first couple of days of taking 100mg, I took them in the am this time instead of at bedtime, I had some dizziness.  Last cycle on 50mg my lining was good.  I am not sure about this cycle yet.  Definite appetite increase the first round and now with the second.  Near ovulation time and thereafter I have had an increased fullness feeling in my lower abdomen.  Also a few more ovary pains and aches than normal.  Taking all these side effects, which to me are minor, into consideration and the relatively inexpensiveness of the drug I think it is well worth it when for a lot of women with fertility problems Clomid is a very viable solution.  When taken under a specialist's guidance I highly recommend it, since obviously I am taking it again to try to conceive a second child.

The first time I used it at 50mg, I don't think I even ovulated, my period never showed up. I had to force one with meds so I could start the next cycle of Clomid at 100mg. With that round of meds, my period wasn't even forced until 11 days later (the first time only took 2 days). I am fairly certian I didn't ovulate this time either. And the cramps the first month were awful, but I would trade those for the breast tenderness of the last 3 days!!!

I wanted to up the dose but my doctors said no studies prove that uping the dose would make a difference.  If nothing happen on the second round of the 50MG I'm going to switch to 100MG.

Female Problems Causing Trouble in Getting Pregnant	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	7/1/2008 11:51:13 PM	I have PCOS and do not ovulate on my own, so Clomid was our first try for fertility treatment. I'm 35. Despite all the warnings about side effects, mine were very minimal: one or two hot flashes that lasted no longer than 5 minutes, and some brief cramping. Not bad, and totally worth it. This drug made me ovulate both times: first two follicles, then five! The only down side is that at the 100mg dose, it also thinned my uterine lining (common side effect: happens to about 30% of patients), so I was unable to sustain the pregnancy. Now they're switching me to Femara. But I liked Clomid. It really didn;t bother me at all, and it;s the most affordable fertility drug out there.

My Boy-friend and I are trying to get prego for the past year.  But so far no luck.  I was on Metformin for a few months no cycle no luck.  I also took a test called HSG, which checks the tubes and everything was ok.  With my pervious doctor not realy knowning what to do with my situation (which was strange) I switched my doctors, Now I'm on provera and Clomid got my cycle and took the last pill on Saturday. I have been testing myself with the home ovulation kits and so far nothing.  Doing my research I've read that I should ovulate 7 days after my cycle that's friday.  Well since then I have been having intercourse non-stop.  I really want to have a baby.  But Wish me luck

The first two months I was on 50mg with no luck. The third month my doctor put me on 100mg and we are now four weeks pregnant!!! Prayers from others along with a positive attitude played an important part. I know It's hard to stay positive while struggling with fertility but it helps. Best of luck to everyone!

The next cycle I tried 150mg also with no luck. The only side effect I got was hot flashes. I am also on metformin because of PCOS. I don't ovulate at all at this point and haven't since I stopped taking birth control a year ago. I am about to start a treatment of Femara. If this doesn't work, my Dr says I will probably have to go get FSH shots. Wish me luck!

I have a wonderful 5 year old, but have been trying to get pregnant for a year without drugs.  Still no luck.  It's very heartbreaking to take ovulation tests over the counter and still no luck ovulating.  I have set a realistic goal of getting pregnant by December, and hopfuly it works other wise I think my chances are pretty slim.  Good luck to all the women out there.  Hope you all find happiness soon!  I'll keep you posted.

Been trying ofr #2 for almost a year. About 6 months ago I just stopped ovulating. Had a ton of tests done and they found no reason for this. Started Clomid 50mg last month. Blood test showed I ovulated. 5.6 level, but doc said it should be between 6-10. Got my period, it was regular which is good. I am back on 50mg again this month so we will see.Horrible nausea and hot flashes are my only complaint. Hope it works this month. But realize how lucky I am to have to little boy I do!!!Good Luck to All!!!!

Seeing my friends go through pregnancy and raising their families gets a little heartbreaking at times for me. The doctor has decided to put me on clomid and after reading the reviews on it I'm a little scared. So many people have said that they have tried and tried even with this drug and have had no luck. I'm still going to try because I'm hopeful that it will work for me and I hope anyone else who tries it will have luck. God bless us all.

Stimulation of Ovarian Function		1	5	1			5/25/2008 10:14:01 PM	I've taken 3 rounds of clomid--single dose first round, double dose second round, and triple dose third round. It has not caused me to ovulate and has given me horrible hot/cold flashes. I've been waking up every night freezing cold yet dripping in sweat. This round of clomid has also caused me to spot--although it's more like a light period.

I stop clomid and meformin to take care of other medical problems in Nov 06 but got pregnant in May 07 and then m/c in June 07.  We've been trying to get pregnant for at least 6 years. I started back on the clomid 50mg two months ago.  The first time I tried clomid I had no side effects, this time around I'm noticing blurred vision.  I'm praying that the clomid is the reason why I got pregnant the first time and hoping it will work again. Hang in there ladies.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	3	Female	35-44	5/7/2008 1:32:07 PM	My husband and I have been trying to have our first child for over 4 years. I have had the hysterosalpingogram which showed no blockage as well as all simple testing to determine the problem. No one can explain what the problem is. My physician prescribed Clomid 50mg for the first time this past month. I didn't have any side effects except mild mood swings, according to my husband, and some constipation later in my cycle. My test results showed that I did ovulate. However, on my 28th day of my cycle, my physician told me I should have my period if I was not pregnant. I went in on my 31st day and had a preg. blood test which was negative, but I am still not having a regular period. I have only been spotting for the last two days. I am disappointed that it did not work. She is going to keep the strength at 50mg this month since I did ovulate.  Praying that this month will be the month.  Good luck to everyone out there.

Anyway, due to some difficulties with my PCOS, I had to have my right ovary removed due to tortion (twisting) and a ruptured cyst. I have been on provera 3 times and just started taking clomid. I have some side effects like hot flashes but nothing major. It's hard to say if I have ovulated since I have not done so in almost 5 years..I hope this works even though this is my first cycle..My doctor says that if this doesn't work, then we will try Gonad-F..I hope this works..My new husband and I have been trying since we got married and I really want to be able to give him his first child vs. adoption..GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE!!!

This medication made me very moody, I got hot flashes every night for about 2 1/2 weeks, My skin broke out, I had swollen, tender brests,I gained about 5 pounds, and my overies are a little swollen. Although I went through complete HELL for a few weeks, it definanly did what it was supposed to do. My doctor said that I ovulated beautifully!I will find out monday if I'm pregnant, if I don't start my period before then. If I'm not pregnant I will be cutting my 50 mg dose in half. I definatly wish the side effects weren't as intense, hopefully I won't have to take that second dose!

When I came off the pill 2 1/2 years ago my cycle was only every 3 months and I was not ovulating.  I thought that this would settle down because of the length of time on the pill. I have just taken clomid for 6 cycles and although I have been ovulating it has not had the desired end result.  I kept being warned of the 'risk' of twins but to be honest twins would have been a blessing.  I have also experienced severe cramping where I all I can do is go to bed. I am waiting to see the consultant again next week to see what the next plan of action is.  I hope your experiences produce better results than it has for us.

I was reluctant to start Clomid because I have PCOS and endometriosis and was worried that it would cause the problems to increase.  I have had 2 surgeries already and facing a 3rd if I don't get pregnant.  I now have been on Clomid 50 mg for the 3rd month- days 3-7 of cycle.  I have had no success for the first 2 months even with using ovulation predictors and having sex every other day.  The doctor is checking my hormone levels and they are great-I actually am ovulating for the first time in several years!  The only side effects I have had are mild to normal: cramping, mood swings, and slight anxiety.  They are not overbearing by any means but sometimes can be annoying.  I highly recommend the medication for just about anyone.  Even though we have not had any luck yet, I know that in time it will happen.  God has a plan for everyone.  Good luck to everyone on the medication.

I told my gyno about my irregular periods so she prescribed me 50mg of Clomid on days 3-8 of my period.  The first month I got my period after 26 days and had the worst cramps I'd ever had!  This is my third day of taking Clomid and hopefully I get pregnant this month!

Female Problems Causing Trouble in Getting Pregnant		3	4	1			1/22/2008 12:35:31 AM	I'm currently being treated for unexplained infertility, and I've just completed my third month of Clomid. It made me incredibly moody.  I finally had to be taken off of the med because of visual disturbances (increasingly blurred vision x2 days).  Now I'm starting on Gonal-F.  I'm hoping that works better for me.

An Insufficiency in Ovulation	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	1/11/2008 8:48:50 PM	This is my second dose of Clomid.  The first time around didn't work.  It made me ovulate but we didn't get pregnant, instead it made me have heavy bleeding 2 weeks after my initial period.  The side effects are awful, but we're praying the second dose does the trick.  We've been trying for one year now without success on our own.  I've been warned of the possiblity of multiples but my husband works in medicine and hasn't heard of anyone personally having that outcome.  At this point, anything would be a blessing!  Who knew trying to get pregnant would become so difficult?!?!

My sister is a obgyn nurse and she advised me to take the drug on days 5-9 and have sex every other day from days 14-21.  I tried it and it worked the first go around is normally not successful because the drug has to have time to get in your system! The trick is your mate has to have time to build *** ***** count. ****** *** once every other day gives him time to do so. Also ladies stay stress-free!!

My oldest was concieved after 3 rounds of low dose Clomid (50mg), my second was conceived after 4 rounds at 100mg.  The only drawback was the mood swings.

After giving up for 4 months I got pregnant on my own, but m/c after 16 weeks due to an incompetent cervix.  I thought getting pregnant would be easier than this, the clomid takes a lot out of me when I take it.

Now, trying to get pregnant for the 2nd time, I'm taking Clomid for the 6th month and this will be the last (shots are next).  I often experienced severe headaches and fatigue at least 1-2 days of every Clomid cycle, and bloating. Overall, it was okay.

I am now taking clomid again in hopes of a 3rd child. It has a  low risk of multitables. I had very little side effects. A small amount of cramping during ovulation. I would highly recommend clomid.
Female Problems Causing Trouble in Getting Pregnant	25-34 Female 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/16/2007 8:36:59 AM	The previous reviewer said that she took clomid for 18 months without success. I think that you are only supposed to take it for 6 months. That is your doctor's fault for allowing you to go through that for 18 months. That's very sad considering the emotional effects that infertility causes.I'm glad to hear that you ended up getting pregnant on your own.
