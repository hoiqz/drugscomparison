Hair Loss	leesa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/5/2012 7:25:05 AM	I am 44 years old and when a 9 year old child said to me that I was bald, I had to do something. I have been using Rogaine for 3 years and my hair has never look so thick and has never been so long. I will use it for the rest of my life.

As it turns out, I'm not alone!  I stopped using the product yesterday but even as I sit here, my heart is beating quickly and I feel pretty uncomfortable.  Can't wait to get this stuff out of my system!  I'm a perfectly healthy middle aged woman taking no other medication.  Buyer/user beware!

I now have so much hair on my face that I have to have my face waxed. I had to call 911 because of a fast heart beat and went to the hospital. No more Rogaine for me.
Other	Bomma, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	3/23/2011 11:29:40 PM	My Doctor recommended Rogaine for women to use on the sides of my head, above the ear. After 4 weeks, and no side effects, I called Rogaine about the dosage, and they asked me to stop usage, since it has not been tested for the sides, only the top of my head. I called my doctor, a reputable dermatologist, and he said to continue using as he instructed,Please let me know if there is any harm in using this product on the sides of head. Thank  you

Don't put yourself through the pain, avoid using rogaine. My doctor recommended Fortalex PT and I have been growing my hair without side affects. I recommend Fortalex.

I have to go to the dermatologist to get cortisone shots in my head to grow it back and cure the excema.  NOT a great product!

I was a veteran rogaine user for 3 years who became very frustrated after the product stopped working. I tried their shampoo for six months straight and that didn't help either... My doctor recommended Fortalex PT and I've been seeing much better results and its very comfortable considering its a shampoo type treatment.. I am much happier using Fortalex PT.

Hair Loss	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	55-64	1/11/2011 1:02:50 PM	I am a female who used Rogaine to replace some frontal hair loss due to my blood pressure medication. The product did work with hair growth after a month's or so use, so it was effective. First I will say that the solution is syrupy, and makes the hair somewhat sticky, making hair styling difficult. But more importantly, I had bad side effcts, and had to totally stop after a year of off-and-on use. 30 minutes after application I frequently had anxiety attacks and a feeling of unwellness, which would last at least a day, and would occur again during my every other day applications. After almost the year's use I developed mild dizziness(reeling) every time I changed the plane of my head, and later developed ringing in the ears. I obviously stopped totally after my hearing was affected, but the ear ringing became permanent. I noticed that besides the Minoxidil, a Rogaine solution base ingredient was propylene glycol, a cousin of anti-freeze's ethylene glycol, also a syrupy sticky liquid. I figured this chemical was absorbed through my scalp, and poisoned me. My mother, who also had hair loss due to blood pressure medication, also had the same ill-feeling symptoms. But she quit early because of them; I was more determined, and continued its use until the final inner ear problems occurred. I do not know whether others have had this experience; but for me, Rogaine is a poison.

Seems to have decresed the hair loss although maybe it would have slowed down anyway, not sure.  Will keep using and there are cheaper brands out there sold by Target and Kirkland products by Costco.  Same product better price.
