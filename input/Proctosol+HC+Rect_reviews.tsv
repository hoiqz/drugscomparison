After 2 applications, I have a big, red, extremely itchy rash around the area - worse than the problem I was trying to treat.

Probably it is too soon to see if it actually works.  Not sure if I am using it right.  Pain is slightly reduced, but bleeding has not improved.  I hope the whole problem just disappears!
