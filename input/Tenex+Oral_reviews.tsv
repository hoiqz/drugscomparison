I was given Tenex 1m, he was to take 1/2 3xs a day! It was to much so i gave him 1/2 once a day only at bed time and OMG! This medicine made my child into someone i dont even know! He's showing symptoms of ocd and very paranoid His eye's twitch constantly and he seems trapped in his body and cant get out. I can't stop crying! He will never take this medicine again!

In addition, I itched frequently and had unmanagable constipation.  Had I not had the side effects, I would have considered continuing use. Please note that I take a tremendous amount of other RX's - perhaps made a difference re:  side effects.  ??

If she isn't asleep she's crying. And screaming for hours. She was on a stimulant(Vyvanse) her therapist said Tenex would work better due to her severity of ADHD she was prescribed 1mg in the am and 1mg in the afternoon. After this past week she will NOT be getting another dose of Tenex !

I took it 10pm and didn't wake until 3pm the next day except to go to the bathroom even after that I was still groggy all day. I was on 6 BP drugs before starting on Tenex so that probably has something to do with it. I am now prsently getting evaluated to get Renal artery nerve ablation at Edward hosp. in Naperville Il. I have never been as sedated as I was with any other drug as Tenex,I hate it.

I was taking 3 benzos ( valium, Klonopin and lorazepam) plus ambien for sleep. I still did not sleep at all plus i was addicted to the medications. When i decided to go off of all narcotics my doctor was reluctant to dc the meds due to my severe PTSD, i sought help froma different doctor. This new doctor prescribed me tenex and told me he used it off label as a blocker of adrenaline to help with the PTSD, i wasnt quite sure how a blood pressure med would help with PTSD but it makes perfect sense, with PTSD we have a fight or flight reaction to situations, horrible nightmare and lack of sleep, the fight or flight syndrome causes an adrenaline rush so the medication blocks that arenaline. I have never slept better than I do now, this drug is a wonder. I have not had 1 side effect, I no longer have to rely on narcotics, i was deemed disabled due to the PTSD and now I am working, enjoying life and functioning. I also have to see a psychologist in conjuction with the medication but it is so wonderful to sleep again.

We tried this medication for a week and worked for ADHD.  He did his hmk by himself!  But...he became even more irritable and aggressive!  So this medication had the opposite intended effect.

What a disaster the bot is so constipated he has been in the er 2 times in a week. nothing helps him. I personally do not believe in medicating children and I believe that sometimes doctor's hand out med's like they are candy. Maybe the doctor should have to sit and listen to him cry because his little belly hurts so bad and he is vomitting because he is so plugged up!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	A.M.Y., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	11/6/2011 1:52:23 AM	This was prescribed as a supplement to my 5-yr-old's ADHD medicine (Concerta 27mg); in less than a week (maybe 3 or 4 days), he got incredibly aggressive and tantrums skyrocketed to an all-time high. He also claimed that his &quot;hands were out of control&quot;. The doctor and I were in complete agreement, and we pulled him off of it. It was only a 1 mg dose once a day around lunchtime, but once we pulled him off of it the aggression abruptly disappeared as quickly as it had come. We won't be using it again anytime soon... And I hope the FDA periodically reads these reviews, so hopefully they know that this is a possibility with this medicine, at least in young children..

Hardest part is not knowing which disorder is acting up to judge which meds are working or not.  I like the fact it's a non-stimulant &amp; used for anxiety/mood stabilizing along w/ADHD.

He was on it for three days and I was already seeing positive effects.  I was happy.  However, on the 4th day, he told me he had a pain in his chest and that he'd had it since the day before.  We needed to discontinue this medication and try somethign else.  I was sorry about that, since I thought it was working so well and I liked that it was not a stimulant.

It has helped her tremendously! It made a difference immediately. She was able to focus better and helped her stop throwing temper tantrums every time she didn't get her own way. She started out taking 1/4 of 1mg tablet and is now taking 1 1mg tablet at bedtime. I am a mother of 3 children; 2 w/ADHD and 1 w/ADD and all took ritalin to begin with and are now on Concerta. Their doctor monitored their weight, height and blood pressure to make sure they were where they should be for their age. We make sure our children eat before taking the medication so there is a minimal loss of appetite. We have also taught them that medication isn't the answer for everything and not to go through life thinking a pill is going to solve their problems! Parents, be cautious and research everything. Talk to your doctor before you give your children anything! When my children started a new medication or dosage change-I did it on the weekend so I could monitor if there were any side effects! And never ever, give your child more than what the physician has prescribed! If your child seems spaced out-call your doctor immediately! The dosage may need to be adjusted or changed or stopped altogether! People think kids who take medication act like they are drugged or spaced out. People don't know my children take medication unless I tell them and most of the time, they don't believe me! Medication doesn't work for everyone, but it has worked for mine.

She also has mild tourettes. It has helped her performance in school amazingly, but has had little effect on her tics. It also helps her outside of class, in social situations homework, etc. She takes 1mg, and has fluctuated between 1 and 1 1/2, but the 1 1/2 makes her tired. If she is forseeing problems, she takes 1 1/4 for a few days. Definitely worth a try!

The only side affect we noticed in the beginning was loss of appetite. THIS IS NOT A WONDER DRUG! WE ALSO PROVIDED MY SON WITH RULES, SRTUCTURE, AND BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS THERAPY!
