I've noticed that though it will clear up on certain areas the plaques just reappear close to the cleared area. Though I'm 35 and balding, I've noticed in increase and darker facial and arm hair. I sincerely and strongly DISCOURAGE anyone with severe psoriasis to continue to use Betamethasone as an treatment for our illness. I've read and researched a new drug called Remicade and I'm excited to try it. Good luck to you... Sonia

Psoriasis of Scalp	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/22/2009 5:08:56 PM	I had scalp itching, dandruff, and buildup of dead thickening skin on my scalp. I used this medication as prescribed and it reduced the itching, softened the scaliness, and helped reduce the &quot;snow&quot; on my shoulders. The thick scales eventually went away, and new pink scalp appeared. My hair began to regrow in stubbles where bald patches had been. It felt cool when applied and seemed to moisturize the dryness I felt. It was sometimes tedious to apply because I had long hair. My hair became greasy after applying proving hard to be removed with shampoo.Overall I was happy with the outcome of using Betamethasone Dipropionate Top Ointment.L.Woodard

I consulted my Doctor about it and she gave me this cream to try and relieve the nerve under the skin to kill the itch all together. It has NOT killed the itch altogether but it does stop the itching while it's on (I must admit that I got sick and wasn't putting it on 3 times a day like I'm doing now that I'm well)Also, I'm only a month into the 2 months she gave.

I have tried many different creams ordered my my dermatologist (none worked). I'm a nurse and this condition almost made me go on disability. This cream was ordered for one of my residents by accident and was going to be thrown out. I decided to try it and within one week my hands were clear. I now feel like a greater power sent me this cream. I am so happy i hope it keeps working.

Skin Rash that Becomes Thick &amp;amp; Discolored From Rubbing It	ifiwru, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	12/6/2007 11:12:06 AM	I was diagnosed with lichen planus over 15 years ago. This medication works very slowly in some areas an not at all in others. These lesions are horribly itchy and the rash site forms tiny cracks in the skin and the skin becomes &quot;leathered&quot; form prolonged scratching. It takes so long for this medicine to work, that by the time you clear a lesion in one site, another lesion is generally manifesting itself in another location. I was told that Lichen Planus was an autoimmune response. I wonder if the new lesions form spontaneously or does the scratching aid in spreading these lesions to new sites?

Disease that Causes Disc-Shaped Patches On the Upper Body	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	55-64	10/6/2007 5:51:19 PM	I have only been using this medicine for three days so I cannot fully rate it, however, it does seem to be working.  The redness is slowly going away as are the raised bumps.  The problem is primarily contained to my abdomen and back and when it started to go to my thighs I went to see a dermatologist. I was unclear as to if I should see a dermatolgoist or allergist at first.  He prescribed betamethasone dipropionate lotion USP 0.05% (augmented)to be applied twice a day along with cephalexin (K-flex) 500 mg. capsules--one per day. I am on peritoneal kidney dialysis, which I do at home while I sleep with the aid of a machine.  I thought at first the rash may have been caused by that because I used to have hemo-dialysis, which is where one goes to a clinic and the blood is cleansed of toxins.  With the home dialysis there is no blood involved, just four exchanges of dialysis solution during an eight hour period while I sleep, so, I thought it was the dialysis solution causing the rash, along with the many meds I take.  The dermatologist told me it was dry skin. There were also white pimples intermixed with the red rash.  Hopefully this combination of lotion and meds he prescribed will do the trick, so far it seems to slowly but surely be working,
