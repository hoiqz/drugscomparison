Low Energy	BSDRUG, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	8/7/2012 1:26:36 PM	This drug has caused me to to have severe headaches since I started taking the drug.  The drug also causes disorientation. Although it did give me energy, the side effects are not worth it. NOT RECOMMENDED! I just threw away the rest of the box.

I did not feel any energy and about 3 hours later.. I had a horrible migrane &amp; was sick to my stomach. I ended up not working that day and laid in bed sick. I could not sleep that night either. Took me about 24 hours to recover. Do not take!

At first we didn't know what was going on - he had all of these tests done and everthing came back good. He realized after this last time that these episodes happened after he took Vivarin. I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced a reaction/episodes like this as well.

Low Energy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	5/14/2009 4:04:58 PM	The few times I've taken this medication it truly makes me Ill. I get warm all over except my hands freeze, I get rapid irregular heartbeat, sick to my stomache, and a terrible headache. I took it once then twice thinking maybe I just wasn't used to it. -Not the case I don't think.
Low Energy	wired, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/27/2009 9:10:38 PM	I have been taking 2 tablets nearly everyday for the past 16 years. I take them usually when I wake up and I feel as though I cannot function without them. I wonder if they are having long term effects because I seem to bruise a lot lately and occasionally my heart beats rapidly. I had very low energy before I ever started taking them. On days that I don't take any at all, I feel completely exhausted.

If you have an empty stomach it may cause some upset feelings or some jittey feelings but if you take the right dose its a great way to stay alert and focused.
Low Energy	19-24 Female 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/19/2009 3:35:47 PM	I use this product occasionally at work when I kinda get into that afternoon rut and need a boost. It is effective in bringing my energy level back up and has not caused any negative side effects. I would recommend it as long as you take it according to the recommendations on the box.
