Nausea and Vomiting	Saved, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/7/2012 6:38:01 PM	After I had a Mallory Weise tear, I was a high risk tearing again if I kept vomiting, because I was so nasueas, this was the only drug that worked.  Dr tried Reglan, had many many anxiety attacks from that.  Promethazine made me basically narcoleptic.  This is the only one I take now.  I take 4 8mg a day.  Saved me!

Prevent Nausea and Vomiting After Surgery	youngnewyorker, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	4/6/2011 7:20:13 PM	I have no history of heart problems and i had a very frightening adverse side effect which is listed as &quot;Rare Side Effect&quot; during surgery- Heart problems which required a shot to my chest to slow my heart rate back to normal- according to my doctors this side effect is common with this drug for anyone who generally gets a rapid heart beat from products with Pseudoephedrine such as Sudafed. So please take care to mention this sensitivity to your doctor prior to surgery!!
Nausea and Vomiting	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/7/2011 9:40:27 PM	My 4 year old son caught a stomach virus and was vomiting every 45 minutes for about 12 hours before we were seen by our peditrician. It took only one dissolvable tablet which was so easy for a little to take. No more vomiting. It worked like charm. His fever broke about 14 hours after that and he hasn't stopped taking and playing yet. Now of course I have come down with the same stomach virus (imagine only having been vomited on about 12 times). I am contiplating taking one of these myself. I read in a couple other parents were even prescibed the medication because the flu often goes through the entire family. I do not take any other medication. Any thoughts out there for me tonight - it is after hours for me to call the doctor. Any thoughts?
Nausea and Vomiting	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/18/2010 1:31:55 PM	Seriously the best medicine ever prescribed for the stomach flu.  I took my daughter to the ER for severe vomiting and the ER Dr. gave her this and within an hour she was a totally different child.  He wrote the RX for more, figuring we would be next in line to get the stomach flu.  Dr. was right. Within 48 hours we both had it also.  We took the pills after vomiting 2-3 times and it worked amazingly. It still took us the usual 2 days to get our strentgh back. This drug is amazing. Thanks to Dr's also, for prescribing the meds.

Nausea and Vomiting	yepitsmehollyh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	10/17/2009 7:53:20 PM	I was prescribed 8mg twice daily to stop nausea and vomiting from Gastroparesis.  It tastes like grape flavored vomit.  About half of the time, the sick feeling in my stomach is gone, but the lump in my throat is still there.  It also gave me horrible diarrhea a few times.  Yuck!  I've been taking it for almost a week and I took my last pill this morning.
Nausea and Vomiting	mom of 2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/6/2009 11:08:45 AM	My 2 young children (age 3 &amp; 6) had a really bad stomache flu.  This was miracle drug for us! No vomiting for 12 hours YEAH! When my husband and I came down with the same flu, we tried it too (with our doctors approval) and it worked. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste, but is wonderful. Even my youngest was able to take it, since it disolves on contact with the tongue. Wish they came out with this drus sooner. I can NOT take other anti-nausea drugs like compazine, tigan and phenergan, due to EPS (dystonic)reactions, so this drug is a god-send.
Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	Crystal, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	5/9/2008 5:51:18 PM	Gave me great relief when nothing else worked during my experience of hyperemesis during pregnancy.  The ODT was very helpful since I couldn't keep down any pills.

Excessive Vomiting in Pregnancy	mae, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/25/2007 3:57:37 PM	I lost 15 pounds the first eleven weeks of my pregnancy.  The doctor had prescribed another drug but I couldn't keep it down.  Zofran has eased the nausea and vomiting.  It may cause you to have a headache but it's well worth it!
