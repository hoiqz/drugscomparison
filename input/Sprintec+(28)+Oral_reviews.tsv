Birth Control	GoTeamUSA, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/1/2012 3:44:11 PM	I started taking Sprintec because my periods were really heavy and lasted all week...I would get terrible cramps the first few days and really bad PMS. I also wanted to go on BC to avoid pregnancy. I've been taking Sprintec for a month now and it has been going great. I have not gained any weight and my breasts have gone up a cup size. The first two weeks of starting the pill I had mild insomnia and small bouts of nausea but they were tolerable. I had slight spotting for 3 weeks but that has since tapered off. I am taking the pill in the manner in which you only get your period every 4 months, so I skip the placebos and go straight into my new pack, so I have not experienced a period yet on the pill, but all is well so far!

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	7/31/2012 9:19:55 PM	I started taking sprintec after having the mirena IUD removed and within the first month I noticed my face breaking out badly. I decided to give it a second cycle and I experienced migraines mid cycle, extremely itchy legs, tender enlarged breasts and severe acne. I'd say some weight gain included as well but only a few pounds. Currently switching to Junel 1/20 21.....

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Nikki, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/24/2012 9:00:47 PM	I have to say I was afraid to take this pill due to the many scary reviews it got. But I am so glad I tried it. I have been on it for a week, I started it during my period and right away I noticed a difference. I have very heavy bleeding during my period and on day 2 of taking the pill and of my period I noticed it was lighter. I have had no side effects so far **knock on wood** I def agree that everyone is different. I take the pill every day at the same time, I eat something 30 mins before I take it or right after I take it to avoid any nausea that I noticed people mention and so far so good. I also asked friends on FB if they have used it and those that did said they had no issues at all. Def don't let the scary reviews sway your decision to try it...everyone's body reacts different than others to different medications. So glad I went with my gutt decision to try it even tho I was scared at first.
Endometriosis	laura, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	7/23/2012 9:53:31 PM	I have only been taking it for a month, but my acne is so severe since taking this, I had to go out and spend $40 on acne products, its even on my eyelids....wth?!?!? I am also having horrible mood swings.  I am already thinking of stopping it.  
Acne	tinkerbell, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/21/2012 12:50:12 AM	Nearing the end of the fourth month of taking Sprintec.  Acne worsened during the second month but cleared up to what it was before starting (primary reason for starting this pill), nausea at times, fatigue, slight weight gain all in abdomen/thighs, and now ongoing thirst that doesn't quench.  Worsening of slight depression and realizing my mood swings are worse too--stopping now! Decreased sex drive (as in don't care to have it). Never had these issues for 8+years of other birth control pills I used prior to childbearing.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/18/2012 12:35:14 PM	Sprintec has been great for me.I haven't experienced any bad side effects while on the drug, no acne, no heavy periods, no mood swings, no severe cramping or depression.My period is only 1 day longer than it had been prior to taking it.I would recommend to try it, everyone's body is different and will respond to different medications differently so you shouldn't make your decision based on all the negative feedback on here.Good luck!

I've also been experiencing bacterial vaginitis since I've been on the pill I've taken two rounds of antibiotics which have made me very sick and have suffered from yeast infections after the antibiotics. My jaw hurts and I'm much more tense than I have been in years.

Birth Control	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female		7/7/2012 9:27:46 PM	I thought I was having a quarter life crisis until I read these reviews. I started last month and I've done nothing but cry every day, I've had a couple panic attacks, and my anxiety is so bad that I can't breathe sometimes. I've been fighting with my boyfriend almost every day. He's told me I have not been myself lately. Upon reading these reviews, I think I'm going to discontinue my use and see if things improve. Like I said, I've never been like this before.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Sadtochange, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	6/25/2012 10:35:34 PM	I have been taking Sprintec for about 3 months.  I originally started for irregular periods,  I have pcos.  Immediately I experienced dry eyes I kept on taking it because it is affordable and regulated my cycle.  I though it would pass, but has not.  The dryness has increased drastically.  I have to douse my eyes with lubricating eye drops all day.  I am now having vaginal dryness and I always feel like my throat is dry.  I am always feeling dehydrated no matter how much water I take in.  I am a little disappointed because my cycle is normal, my mood is actually better than before, and my skin is looking great.  Unfortunately the dryness is unbearable .
Birth Control	Candy86, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/2/2012 4:06:31 PM	I HATE this pill! I have a severe thyroid condition so I had to be on it as my periods were severe. I've been on it a year and everything is getting worse as time goes on. I've had a list of symptoms: nausea almost every day, severe headaches 3-4x a week, sore breasts, cramping/bloating, confused, depressed, suicidal, weight gain, can't lose weight, hair falling out, mood swings, no sex drive, constant yeast infections, joint pain, muscle pain, aggravting my psoriasis, consipation, acid reflux, and bad vaginal/vulva swelling. Yes it works very well as a birth control, but the side effects are not worth it at all. How the hell did this pill get approved? I never had a problem when I was on the shot. As soon as I switched to this, my life was horrible. My doctor finally said I'm well enough to quit, thank God I only have 4 more days!!! Save yourself the hell and torture of this. And I don't say any of this lightly, this is the worse thing I have ever been on!CK (WI)

This stuff is like a mirical pill, I used for cramping, PMS, and heavy periods.  It worked after the first month, and it still works after 2 1/2 years!
Absence of Menstrual Periods	beanerbaybee237, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	13-18	6/27/2012 7:28:13 PM	I haven't had a period for 2 and a half years. I wento to the ob/gyn to make sure there wasn't anything wrong. She said there wasn't anything physically or hormonally wrong with me (which basically means the absence was simply due to the fact that i run a lot) but she decided to put me on this medicine anyways. Only took it for 10 days. had bleeding two days later but it was the worst 10 days of my life. My acne got worse, I gained 4 pounds, went through crazy mood swings. Worst experiences  when your a high school junior in the midst of AP exams, an approaching track championship and prom. Most of the weight was water weight because 2 days after I stopped it, my prom dress slipped right on. The other weird side effect which contradicts many others was that my sex drive increased. I'm usually completely against sex or the thought of it. But it didn't seem as bad when I was on the medication. Regardless, I will NEVER take this again
Birth Control	MissPharmD, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	6/26/2012 12:53:03 AM	This drug is 100% effective at preventing pregnancy because you never want to have sex! Not only does it decrease your sex drive completely, but I now have an annoying yeast infection. I have been taking this drug for 7 days and I am coming off now. I have taken other types of birth control for 6 years and never had these types of issues. I am itchy all over, muscle weakness, constipation, cramps, horrible nausea, headaches, anxiety, unexplained crying spells, and vaginal secretion and irritation. HOW DID THIS DRUG GET APPROVED????
Absence of Menstrual Periods	VDKinman, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	6/25/2012 6:40:00 PM	I used this specific BC after being on Loestrin 24Fe. I hated this pill. I took it not even 2 months. I started taking it due to the other not working. I hated it. The first week was great. After that it went down hill. I would constantly stay in bed 24/7 and cry because I would hurt so badly. Now, I am married and we've been trying for 3 years to get pregnant. I talked to another doctor and I have done research on the net and found out that this specific BC after stopping usage can cause all female parts to swell to keep sperm out, it can cause non-ovulation and some infertility. I have been fighting 3 years of non-ovulation and infertility. None of my issues happened until after I was prescribed Sprintec and discontinued using it. I had a very BAD experience with it even though it was very easy to use. I will NOT use it again!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	6/21/2012 4:36:23 PM	This is the first birth control I've ever been on. I thought I was feeling bad because my body was just adjusting to the pill, but everything I was experienced got worse. I've been on it for 6 months and I have never felt so crazy in my life. My sex drive has gone down a TON, I have crazy mood swings, I cry ALL THE TIME.. Like seriously it's pathetic shows like Say Yes to the Dress and commercials make cry, even my feelings for my boyfriend were getting mixed up and confusing me. Thank you for everyone who reviewed this, I'm so happy that I'm not all alone. I'm stopping this tomorrow.

Lo24 made my periods amazing! But I had frequent breakthrough bleeding which was really annoying. So far on Sprintec I haven't thrown up or had really any side effects,other than my sexdrive increasing like crazy and my breasts are tender and growing. Only thing I can complain about is my period went right back to a really heavy flow. But I'm going to give it a few more months and see if it gets any lighter. Fingers crossed.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Sick of it, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/20/2012 10:41:28 AM	I found out I had pcos. I had been on sprintec for one week. I woke up at five am Monday and blood began to run down my legs and pool around my feet. I have had horrid cramps. The only way to explain it is it feels like some one is jamming a steak knife in to my rectum. I called my doctor in sheer horror and they told me that my estrogen was to low (no blood work to confirm this) and that I needed to bulid my lining back up bc I bled for three weeks for the month of March and May. They said to skip the placebo this month and it will help to build me back up and help me to be normal. So they said take two pills for three days. Today is the morning of day three and I have gone through twenty five tampons in two days and nights. I am also loosing nickle size chunks of skin. It's not working. I have never felt this horrible in my whole life. All I want to do is sleep and cry. Not to mention I have gained four pounds in a week which is very discouraging after just losing fifty in the last three months. It has to be this birth control. I would rather put up with missed periods and facial hair from my pcos then go through this bs.
Other	craftjunkie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	6/16/2012 11:39:19 PM	My son is 15 months old and I have been on the pill since my 6 week check up. I started with Tri-Sprintec and have recently changed to Sprintec. (I was on a lighter dose of bc during the first 6 months b/c of nursing.) I gained a lot of weight right at the end of my pregnancy due to pre-eclampsia. I have about 35 lbs to loose before I am several months before I got pregnant. Since using this drug I have excessive bloating (wedding rings don't even fit!), and have not been able to loose the weight!! It's so frustrating. I have gained a whole pants size since getting on bc in the first place. I hate the stinking stuff and have gone off it altogether. Using alternative bc altogether! 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	6/14/2012 3:28:32 PM	I have been on this medication for about three years. I initially went on it for mood stabilization and then birth control later on. I thought it was working at first, but its awful. I still ovulate some months. I have had problems with ovarian cysts. I have had break through bleeding, and two pregnancy scares. I have extreme anxiety and depression and horrible mood swings. Headaches and nausea almost every day as well. I have gained 10+ lbs and am hungry all the time. The only thing it has helped is my acne. After reading these reviews I am stopping it after I finish out this month. I strongly do not recommend. GL
Birth Control	ksct, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	6/13/2012 9:14:25 AM	I switched from the generic form of Ocella to Sprintec almost a year ago because I was having severe breakthrough bleeding on Ocella.  Sprintec has been great and I have not experienced any breakthrough bleeding.  Also, it helps with my acne and my nails seem to be less brittle with this Rx too.
Birth Control	Mama1022, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	6/11/2012 8:56:20 AM	I have been on Sprintec for one year now after switching from another pill. At first I really liked it and it helped with PMS and cramping during my period. After a few months I experienced some spotting and eventually the PMS &amp; cramping went back to what it was without birth control. I feel like I need to be in the fetal position for day 1 of my period and still experience moodiness, complete exhaustion, and now a decreased sex drive. I'm calling the doc today to see what they can switch me to.
Birth Control	pinkbunnie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	6/6/2012 1:15:51 PM	I was on this BC about 5 years ago but had horrible mental side effects (it felt like i was splitting into two people). so my dr took me off of it and put me on ocella which was great but at $80 a month, not so affordable. My new dr just put me back on it because she thought maybe the reaction before was caused from taking anti depressants and mood stabilizers. I have only been taking it a week and a half any I am having horrible mood swings, I'm extremely depressed, my boobs are swollen and very sore. I am stopping it today, I cant handle it any more. I really think this is a terrible BC, which is probably why its so cheap.
Birth Control	Melissa , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	6/2/2012 12:02:00 AM	I used to take this about a year ago and stopped after me and my bf broke up. It was great! I wasn't moody. I actually lost weight and my skin was amazing. I also have ovarian cysts and it made them go away. I started taking sprintec 2 days ago because my cysts are back and it's day 2 of horrible mood swings, bad headaches, and I'm having a hard time with focusing on things. I'm stopping it now. I can't handle another day! I thought I could take it through the month and see if it gets better but I can't handle it. I never has problems before with it but now I can't handle it!! I don't reccommend this!

Birth Control	April, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	5/30/2012 2:56:58 PM	I started this BC about 4 months ago. At first everything was great! No complaints at all, but within the last month I have had horrible headaches EVERY DAY! severe nausea, mood swings, and acne. At first I thought something was seriously wrong with me but I started reading these reviews yesterday and I think I found my problem! I didn't take a pill last night and I feel 100% my old self today! :) I have been on 3 different kinds over the last 3 years and never once had these kinds of problems. I would not recommend it to anyone! 
Birth Control	smm1234, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	5/30/2012 10:21:50 AM	I have been on this birth control for 7 years.  It is very easy to use - just set a reminder &amp; take it at the same time every day.  I do get a little moody right before my period, and my breasts grew from a small C to a large D once I started taking it.  I also did gain about 8lbs when I started taking it.  However I did not feel any of the other side effects (headaches,naseaua etc.)after the first month that I was on it.  As I said, its been 7 years and I have never once worried that I was pregnant.  I would like for my boobs to be smaller or to lose the 8lbs that I gained, but its worth it to not be pregnant for now!

Birth Control	Lynn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/28/2012 6:49:51 PM	I'm 26 and have never been on any oral contraceptives before. This pill has been easy to take, I just set the alarm on my phone and take it in the morning (I work nights). I've been on it a little over a week and haven't had many side effects, only a little nausea and a few headaches that could easily be stress-realated rather than a side effect. Other than that, the only other side effect I've had thus far is some light breakthrough bleeding after orgasm. (It worried my boyfriend, let me tell you!) That has happened twice so far, but with less bleeding the second time, so I'm not overly concerned. If it continues after the first couple months, however, I will be calling my doctor. Other than that, I've been pleased so far with this product. Good luck to everyone else who tries it.

I didn't get mood swings, bloated, anything. I loved it! I've tried 3 different typed of birth controls since then, mostly generics of Sprintec, one in particular stood out to me:  Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo; made me eat ALL THE TIME, made me severely moody to where I was annoyed with everyone for no reason! I stopped taking it after 3 weeks. Haven't gone back since. My friend also had weight gain on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	5/9/2012 6:32:39 AM	HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! I had previously taken Orthro Tricyclin Lo (for approx 3 yrs with no side effects) but due to cost switched to this...and for the past 3 weeks I have not felt like myself. Never having had an issue with BC in the past, it took me 3 weeks to link all my symptoms to this pill, which I am stopping today. I am 27 yrs old and take no other medications. Side effects I've experienced include: severe nausea, abd cramps, weight gain, and terrible mood swings. I was annoying myself with how ridiculous I was acting towards my boyfriend..poor him! With all of these symptoms I thought I may be pregnant...and going crazy. I've been 115 lbs for years and now have gained 8 lbs in 3 weeks. I was nauseous every morning the entire 2nd week and sporadically at night. Woke up several nights with severe cramps. I could keep writing about how terrible this pill is but I hope I got my point across. If you haven't started this pill, do yourself a favor and DON'T START! And if this is the only BC you have ever tried and are experiencing any symptoms, dont just put up with it, talk to your doctor about other options because there are plenty out there and switch! You would be risking your overall health with even the more serious side effects this pill has as well as your own sanity!

That explains the weight gain and why I can't get it off! I lost 45 pounds almost 2 years ago and kept it off, then got on these pills and gained 15 pounds in 3 months!! I've been struggling trying to get it off with NO results! Not to mention, I still cramp SEVERELY for about 2 weeks out of the month and my breasts get so sore it hurts to even exist! I can't even sleep on my stomach or let the shower barely hit them they hurt so bad! These pills haven't helped with the heavy bleeding either. I was continuing to take them thinking that my body would get used to them, then I read these reviews! I'm calling my doctor tomorrow to request something else!!!
Birth Control	Jen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	5/8/2012 3:17:20 PM	This BC is easy to take, but I have noticed after the first month a 10 lbs. weight gain! AHH! Luckily this is just temporary since I am getting an IUD placed in a month, but for now I have to deal with a unexpected weight gain. 
Endometriosis	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	5/7/2012 8:33:42 PM	There have been so many bad reviews on this but i love Sprintec so far! i am on my second pack and my period was lighter no headaches or nausea. The only problem i faced was the first 3 to 4 nights i felt very nauseas, i threw up the first night, the first month i also experienced some breast pain...it wasn't exactly pain my breasts just felt very heavy(which is funny because there quite small) but after those few days it was great! i set an alarm on my phone for 5 O'clock everyday to remind me to take it and it works great! i would recommend this
Painful Periods	Tee-tee, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	13-18	5/5/2012 10:58:30 PM	I have been taking Sprintec for two weeks, and I have had no negative complaints about it. It has made my boob grow, and thats always a plus since ive had small boobs. 
Birth Control	harajuku, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	13-18	5/4/2012 11:58:40 PM	I have been bloated ever since i started taking Sprintec. My mood swings have been off the roof ! i hate it.
Birth Control	Hate Sprintec, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	5/1/2012 2:41:08 PM	I have taken other birth control for 5 years. As soon as I switche to Sprintec, because of cost, I gained 10 pounds. ( that's in 3 months!!!!!) Now let me tell you, I am an avid runner and weight trainer. Work out 6 days a week and run 15-25 miles a week. I am a health fanatic- and I eat 1400 cals a day. No change in my lifestyle in this time, but the weight is packing on and I have had crazy PMS like I've never had before. It was so bad that last month I thought I might need anti depressants! I can not wait to finish this cycle and switch back to my other BC. This sprintec is not worth the savings of money. It sucks and makes you feel like you're crazy- and fat!!!
Birth Control	midnight, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	13-18	4/30/2012 7:25:08 PM	I was only on this for a week and I went completely crazy. My anxiety went through the roof and I was so moody and I could feel myself getting depressed. I also started to get chest pains which were painful. I'm switching to a low dose pill and I'm hoping it'll work. This is my experience on this pill, don't use it to effect your decision. Try it, it may be right for you.
Birth Control	EC2454, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/30/2012 1:21:15 PM	Sprintec wreaked havoc on my body within the first month that I started taking it. I'm an avid athlete and have never had any health issues whatsoever. I've also never had issues with acne, even throughout my teenage years, but Sprintec caused my face to break out consistently, even when I wasn't on my period. Even now, 3 months after I've stopped taking it, I'm still experiencing bad acne, among other lingering issues. I also experienced extremely bad mood swings (to the point where I felt bipolar), overall depression, and severe anxiety. My boyfriend was bewildered by the sudden changes in my mood and several times a week, I would have a crying jag and threaten to break up with him. The worst side effects that I had, however, were chest pains and difficulty breathing. It got so debilitating that I was having difficulty concentrating at work and couldn't sleep at night. My cardiologist ruled out cardiac-related problems and blood clots. I've been subjected to various breathing tests to determine if there are any underlying issues that had been overlooked, and I'm still awaiting those results. While my mood swings, anxiety, and depression have subsided, I still feel overly cranky and emotional at times, which was never the case prior to taking Sprintec. While I've had a terrible experience with this pill, please keep in mind that everyone's body responds differently. I started Loestrin 24 Fe yesterday, so we'll see how that pans out.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Left, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/28/2012 9:33:53 PM	My doctor prescribe this to me for heavy periods.  I have been so grouchy and I can't even stand myself.  No sex drive and my legs ache and hurt so bad.  I am having trouble sleeping and even to focus at work.  I do not think i would recommend this pill to no one.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	4/26/2012 7:26:53 PM	I have been taking Sprintec for about a month and I am discontinuing it today. After reading other reviews I realize that I am not going crazy. First of all I have had abnormal vaginal discharge the whole entire month I've been taking this. Its been so bad I've been wearing pantyliners everyday, obviously this is very embarrassing and killing my sex drive. Furthermore, I have been in the worst mood ever. I just realized I have heard myself say 'I am depressed' this past month more than I have ever said in my life. I actually even cried earlier this week about the stupidest thing. I haven't noticed any weight gain, nausea, or increase in acne as others have mentioned. I am stopping it today simply because the disharge is getting so heavy and it is not worth it, I also I would like to be happy again. 
Birth Control	Tee7, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	2	Female	19-24	4/25/2012 2:24:35 AM	I had an allergic reaction called Erythema nordosum.  The bumps were on my legs and were painful and very noticable.  The medication was just too strong. 
Birth Control	Frustrated101, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	4/25/2012 1:45:06 AM	I am having a horrible experience with Sprintec.  Yes - it's kept me from being pregnant - but that's only because I can't have sex on it.  I've been taking the medication for 3 months and am now experiencing continuous bleeding (going on about 13 days now).  My first period after taking the pill gave me extremely painful cramps and was super heavy.  I was going to be camping during my second period on the pill and decided to continue onto the next pack of blue pills without taking the placebo pills.  Instead of skipping my period, I've now been on it for 13 days (plus I even started spotting while still taking my last 3 blue pills)!  I don't know whether to start taking 2 pills a day or what I should be doing to make the bleeding stop.To me, the horrible cramps, continuous bleeding/spotting and tender breasts I get from being on this medication is not worth it.  I'd rather use condoms than have to deal with these horrible side effects. I'm calling my doctor tomorrow to switch me to something else.
Birth Control	Brave, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	4/17/2012 9:13:44 PM	1.First for the people who are reading these reviews. You will not find the answer if Sprintec is right for you. Trust me2. I read and I have been taking it for few days now and I feel nothing but myself.3. If you are willing to try, please do not fear and woman up and try it!
Birth Control	Chels92, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	4/17/2012 11:12:54 AM	I've been taking this for about a month, Starting my second pack today. The first few days made me incredibly sick like it says, only lasted like 4 days, i had some vomiting but it was hours after i taken the pill so it wasn't defective. the only thing bad i can say about this is the crazy mood swings,  I cry a lot like A LOT, i get mad a my boyfriend over a lot of little things when usually im not like that. Overall from the beginning sickness to the moodiness it's really not that bad, I am tired a lot of the times but I feel great on the days i get a lil extra sleep. No babies yet, hope to keep it this way!
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	13-18	4/16/2012 9:56:58 PM	I've been on sprintec for almost one month and  all i do is cry. At random times i just cry and i am always getting mad at people for no reason. I have always been told i'm the nicest person people could ever meet but the past two weeks i cant control the uneasy feeling i am having about everything that is going on in my life. This pill works very well but causes crazy strong mood swings. 
Other	Mpnorthport, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/14/2012 9:25:30 PM	I've only been on this medicine for a week, but so far I'm not liking what it's been doing to me. I've been very tired, bloated, irritable, breaking out on my face, and I feel like my breasts have grown a size in 1 week. Not to mention, this is usually my &quot;sweet week&quot; where my libido is pretty good, and I don't want anything to do with it! I am gonna take the rest of this pack to see if things get any better, but I'm not sure if I'm going to continue with it. I am not taking this pill for birth control reasons, I'm taking it to try to regulate my periods better. My periods have become closer together and my PMS symptoms have been about 10-14 days instead of just the week before my period starts. I will write an update in a few weeks to let you know how things are going. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	4/14/2012 12:47:03 PM	This pill is horrible. I've been on it for just a week and I've noticed myself becoming more and more depressed everyday. I can't even begin to describe how I feel, my mood swings are horrible. My mind is in a million different places. Not to mention I feel sick to my stomach almost everyday and I have the worst fatigue. I literally have no energy in me but sleeping doesn't help cuz I can hardly stay asleep! Please do not take this pill. You will regret it. Now I have to wait till Monday to call the doctors and see if I can even get off this pill right away. I'm sure it'll just harm my body even more if I just stop it. Hate this!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	4/12/2012 3:08:10 PM	satisfied enough, although it's not my favorite. it works (knock on wood after reading others posts...) but it comes with drawbacks. I have always had minor anxiety and this has taken the anxiety to a whole new level (and added some severe depression). Less sleep and extreme fatigue is  most annoying. Definitely get what you pay for but I can manage for 9 dollars a month rather than 100 for ortho tri cyclen lo, which I've found to be best for me. oh well.
Acne	cewing88, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	19-24	4/8/2012 11:15:23 AM	I am concerned about being on this birth control. I started it to get my periods normal but I don't like this bc at all. My breasts have enlarged and are soar 24-7. I can't even touch them they are so soar. My back and shoulders have also broke out with acne, and I have never had this problem with acne. I also agree with everyone else on the mood swings. It is aweful. I fight with my husband all the time and it's like if I explain something to him and he doesn't understand right away I get way out of line and go off the deep end. I don't want to be on this bc anymore but I want my periods to get normal so I can have a chance at having a child. #don't know what to do!
Absence of Menstrual Periods	 on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	4			4/7/2012 4:17:52 PM	This is my first time taking birth control. I'm 22 years old. I'm on the 4th week of it and the only major symptoms I've had is diarrhea, fatigue and breast tenderness. My period is lasting a lot longer than normal. I went 6 months without a period though so that's why my OBGYN put me on this pill to get me regulated. I've read other reviews that said that there is weight gain but I've actually lost weight some weight and am still losing weight. My acne seems to be clearing up. So far I am satisfied with this  pill. 
Birth Control	sw1m4l1fe, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/6/2012 10:20:55 PM	I've been taking Sprintec for close to a year now and it's the only pill I have ever tried. I'd read all of the horror stories about different birth controls and found pretty solid reviews for this one and opted to try it out. It was a great decision. Sprintec was easy to start - no spotting, no weight gain, no acne or nausea, blood pressure problems or anything like that. It didn't affect my sex drive and has prevented pregnancy so far!I set an alarm on my cell at night to remind me to take it (also was recommended to take at night so if it does cause nausea, you'll be at home/asleep).Even the times that I missed a pill or two in a row, no spotting and no babies! Yay! My periods are pretty light and only last a few days. Overall, I'm really satisfied with Sprintec and highly recommend it to any girl just starting to take birth control, or any girl who is looking for something new!
Birth Control	need 2knw, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	4/3/2012 11:23:25 PM	I have been on Sprintec for little over 2yrs. I was not having any major problems or so I thought but I agree to the moodiness, the fatigue,as well as the headaches; though for me not too often. In reading the reviews I only notice one other person with hair loss and thats where my MAJOR concern is because I never had severe hair loss before. I take vitamins and eat healthy so I not sure, plus I have recently been to my doc; internally I'm great. My Hair is constantly shedding in large amounts, thinning, and my texture is not the same.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	4/3/2012 11:23:11 AM	I started taking this medicine back in Jan and purchased a 3 month refill because it is cheaper than the non-generic I was taking.  I have had major mood swings, depression and anxiety.  Always terrible cramps which I have never had.  Now that I have seen others review I know now that I am not crazy!  I&quot;m finishing this pack and then I am done!  Thank you for letting me know I'm not nuts ladies!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	rkj1818, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	13-18	4/2/2012 10:45:43 PM	i'm 14 years old and am taking this birth control for my long and heavy period, before i started taking this pill i was a twig, never worked out, could eat whatever i wanted, but since i started this pill i'm very insecure about my stomach, have to watch what i eat and work out as much as possible. so overall, weight gain was my biggest difficulty.
Birth Control	Pinkaboo986, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/2/2012 6:11:51 PM	My doctor put me on this medicine because it was a lot cheaper then I was paying for my last birth control. BUT you get what you pay for. I have been on it for about a month and a half, and it has been horrible. I've had mood swings, no sex drive at all, painful intercourse, cramps, gas.. just all around the worst pill I have ever been on. Switching tomorrow. Thanks to everyone else on here you wrote a review, I feel a lot better, I thought I was going crazy. 
Birth Control	Sheshe, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/28/2012 6:50:15 PM	This BC is AWFUL!!! DO NOT TAKE!!! Anxiety, Fluttery, can not sleep, racing heart, lack of sex drive! why is this drug even on the market and available. oh and headaches! going off it immediately!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	3/25/2012 12:14:53 PM	I was prescribed Sprintec for &quot;hormonal imbalance&quot; and birth control.  While I understand that giving your body time to adjust is important, I had to stop this after 3 days. I have OCD/acute anxiety and am prone to depression (I take Zoloft for this).  Within in 3 days, and this only seemed to happen after taking this pill, I have had severe anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and depression.  It seemed pretty sudden, so I'm assuming this medicine is to blame.  I haven't had much success with BCPs in the past, and I don't think I'll be trying anything else soon.  Really can't wait for my hormones to level out.

I'm going through the waiting game now. Have a back up &amp; don't just rely on the pill.
Birth Control	Disappointed, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/18/2012 11:31:52 AM	I used this product like I was directed and became pregnant. Need I say more.
Other	KEL, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	3/14/2012 10:52:35 PM	I was on this birth control because the previous brands my doctor had me try were awful and I needed something to prevent pregnancy and help regulate my periods and decrease the cramping! I had all the side effects from Portia and had terrible mood swings, so 7-8 months ago she had me try Sprintec. At first, I loved it! None of the awful side effects and mood issues, or lack of libido. However, about 3 months ago my periods started to become heavy again, consisted of old blood, and the cramps were insufferable.  I just changed to another pill (we'll see how THAT goes), and coming here I see that I  have been suffering from a lot of side effects that I factored to other things: fatigue, trouble sleeping, constipation and gas issues, occasional diarrhea, nausea that would last a week or more at a time, etc. The only thing it did was keep me from getting pregnant, which I guess is its purpose, but all in all, I am not satisfied with the product. As a side note, my periods were more regular after a couple months on this pill.
Birth Control	badgertastic, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	19-24	3/12/2012 12:29:05 AM	I started taking this medication about a year and a half to two years ago.  All in all it's okay because I haven't gotten pregnant on it...however, I have always had migraines and this pill makes them worse.  Also, when I started taking it I weighed 120 lbs and now I am 160.  I was also a bra size 36B and now I am almost to a 36DD.  Don't know if there is any correlation there, but I had been a size 4 since I can remember, to the time I was 19, when I started taking it.    My periods were also great whenever I first started taking it, and now I am suffering from debilitating cramps and 7-8 day periods again.  I am going to the OBGYN soon to get on something else because it's not worth the side effects if there are other things out there that will work the same without them.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	3/10/2012 11:25:27 AM	I've taken Sprintec for about 6 months now.  During ovulation I get horribly constipated and have wretched gas.  A day or two before my period I'm plagued with diarrhea.  The longer I've taken Sprintec I've noticed my PMS symptoms keep getting worse.  I'm switching to Aviane which is a monophasic pill so hopefully my PMS gets better.  I used to take Yaz, Yasmin and Gianvi and had no issues other than the occasional nausea wave which lasted a few seconds.  I'll take that over a day of debilitating diarrhea anyday!  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	3/6/2012 9:22:02 PM	In total I have taken this medication for 5 months. The first month, it was fantastic. As the months continued, I noticed an accumulation of side effects. Water retention, fatigue, trouble sleeping, weight gain, and jaw pain. This caused me to be irritable and moody, of course. It is important to pay attention if you believe it is working for you, but you have only been taking this for a short time. Since stopping, my side effects have subsided, and I am energetic, rested, and healthy.Be careful.

Birth Control	dakota, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	13-18	3/5/2012 9:49:45 PM	Well, I have been on this birth control for about 4 months now again, and still after taking a break from it I keep having insane headaches, migraines, I can't sleep, and I get sick at least 3 or 4 times a month from it. I do not recommend this birth control for anyone who doesn't want possibly dangerous side effects. I was not pleased with anything about this birth control, what so ever. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Ice, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	2/28/2012 8:32:33 PM	I've only been on the pill for three months, I am going into the fourth month however my period just because excessive so I am beginning to worry. I stopped having the cramps but I have never had a period last for over three days, it has now moved to over a week. 
Birth Control	Lu82, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	2/27/2012 12:39:24 PM	My doctor put me on this medication because it was the first pill I had been on in years (I had chosen other methods) and it was cheap.  However, after three months of being on it, I have experienced the following side effects:Painful cramping (I have never had cramps)Spotting (bleeding for weeks on end gets old fast)Severe mood swings I understand that not everyone will have these symptoms, but I had these side effects and depending on your perspective of which is worse, the mood swings were the WORST. I would get very angry and it would last for much longer than when I get angry on previous birth controls. I think that was the most worrisome to me, I am now switching to something else where I hope to have more luck! Use with caution...as with any medicine!

Birth Control	YourFavoriteBITCH, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1		19-24	2/23/2012 1:09:29 AM	This birth control almost RUINED MY LIFE. I had SEVERE mood swings, rage, anxiety and depression. i told my husband who ive loved since i was 17 years old that i wanted a DIVORCE countless times for no reason at all, one time i even broke a mug and got mad at myself and ended up telling him i wanted a divorce. We have the most amazing marriage and are the best of friends in the world -- this drug almost ruined all of that for me.

Im 19 years old, ive previously taken yaz as a form of birth control which was HELL. Some say this is similiar, but i have yet to experience any of the side effects i had from yaz.I did spot for the entire first month, that has now stopped and periods are shorter! Ive debated whether a few issues i have are from this pill but i dont want to jump to conclusions, so as of right now i must say i am pleased! Its cheap too ;)
Birth Control	anita, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/9/2012 5:33:33 PM	I have been taking Sprintec for years and have had no problems. Three years ago my doctor &amp; I figured out that my migraine headaches are hormonal and she told me to start taking Sprintec everyday, without taking a &quot;period break&quot;, for three solid months and then go off for 4 to 5 days only then back on for 3 months so that I keep my hormone levels even. It works!! I havent had a true migraine in years!!
Birth Control	pokcax, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	2/8/2012 8:28:53 PM	I was on this medication for 28 days and had a dural sinus thrombosis (stroke) and almost died.  This pill was effective, in the sense that I didn't get pregnant, but I had been on other pills for years with no side effects.  The 12 days I spent in neurosurgical ICU was not worth it.

I started taking this pill the end of dec. started having diheria, serious heart pain, shortness of breath, blurred vision. nothing good comes from it i believe that if i had continued taking it, it  would have killed me.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/25/2012 10:56:19 AM	I went on Sprintec for my terrible menstrual cramps. One day out of every month, I was crippeled by that pain until I went on Sprintec. Not only have my menstrual cramps lessened and I no longer need to take any pain relievers, I didn't have any side effects from taking Sprintec. My friend who takes it, loves the fact that it helps clear her acne. The dosages of Sprintec are very low that the side effects of birth control are very minimal if at all. Also, it is one of the cheapest birth control pills you'll find on the market. Target and Walmart sells them for $9 with or without health insurance!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	1	Female	25-34	1/20/2012 11:46:10 AM	Terrible Experience! I started Sprintec because they stopped making the kind I took for years. I am 28. This is the only med. I take. Took Sprintec for 1 1/2 months and it gave me chest flutters then pains plus other heart attack symptoms. Also was causing my long eyelashes to fall out. I stopped taking it and I feel like a new woman......I am done with pills! We have decided to go the vasectomy route.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	Opie622, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/18/2012 12:04:18 PM	I'm currently taking this because of my irregular periods due to my hypothyroidism. I haven't had any problems for the first week- my acne was clearing up, I had a small headache the first 2 days of taking it but it hasn't affected me any. Once I  got my period, I have been having some severe headaches throughout my whole period and i've been taking ibuprofen as much as I can in a day. Plus it's been making me sleep a lot more than usual. It's not a bad drug, I wish I just didn't get the headaches and excess tiredness when I get my period.

Other	Angel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	1	Female	25-34	1/14/2012 4:42:07 AM	Taking this medication to prep for ivf cycle- extreme breast tenderness, moodiness, some headaches and especially EXTREME fatigue.  Sleeping 12+ hours and still wanting to nap throughout the day.  I'm so glad I only have to take this for another week or two....having other side effects as well. I couldnt imagine taking this long term. 
Birth Control	Cgirl26, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/11/2012 10:38:18 PM	Very bad experience! Similar to another review I read, I was soooo thirsty with this pill. I was nauseous everyday; on the 3rd week I couldn't sleep, had blurred vision, dizziness and was very withdrawn and a bit depressed. If you use this pill and experience extreme thirst within the 2nd week definitely discontinue use. It's the start of a long list of side effects. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	13-18	1/10/2012 4:14:13 PM	I was on Micronor for almost a year and switched to Sprintec because I changed doctors. I've only been on it for about a month now but I've started to notice a few side effects. I typically have some acne but not as much as what i have now since taking Sprintec. Also, I've noticed a small weight increase (about 6 lbs) in the last month. However, im slender and the weight gain doesnt bother me too much. I'm not sure if I'm going to switch but I would like to go back on Micronor. It has less side effects.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	1/8/2012 5:28:21 PM	I started talking this pill because I had made a mistake and slept with the wrong person once and ended up with chlamydia and since then my periods have been off so my doctor prescribed this birth control to see if it would make my hormones go back to normal since she said the STD probably shocked my system. I have been taking it for about a week. I haven't had any sever symptoms. Some mild head aches but i get head aches often anyway. My boyfriend said he has noticed that I seem to be in a better mood more often and honestly I feel like I have been in a better mood since I have been taking it. I just feel good and I love it. I took this pill with my period so I cant say if its making my face clear up yet because usually my face clears up when my period ends. I have felt bloated too but I get that way on my period anyway. So its hard to say what symptoms are from my period or from the pill.Also i have had light chest pains every once in awhile but i get those because i have an anxiety disorder and it comes with stress so its another unknown for me if its because of the pill or not. But so far I think this pill is working. My doctor says I need to take the pill for at least 2-3months to see if it would help with my periods. Before i started taking this pill I read some of these reviews and they honestly scared me. Then I read a few of the good ones and went to another site with people who had more good things to say. People are right, it all depends on the person when taking these pills. If it was so bad they wouldn't be selling this pill. There is a reason its out there for people to buy. There is a reason you're doctor prescribed it to you. Because they believe it could help. I recommend this pill because it has helped me. Don't be afraid of all these reviews that people put on here. Everyone reacts differently to medications. Just give it a chance.
Birth Control	hjgfhgd, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	1/8/2012 2:42:54 AM	Recently switched off of Yasmin birth control that I had been taking for 2 years. In first 3 weeks on Sprintec, I was consistently nauseous, bad headaches, and gained 10 pounds (not normal). Switching off of it asap.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Tara290, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/6/2012 9:40:29 PM	Great pill for me. I have been using this pill for five years now and never once had a problem. When I first started taking a bc pill for heavy periods I took a lower dose pill and would get my period if i took the pill more than a half hour late. Sprintec has been great for me, I've never had an issue taking it. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/6/2012 6:56:13 PM	I took Sprintec for about 4 months. The first months were fine; the only side effects I had were dry eyes and tiredness. Those symptoms were easily manageable and went away as he months went by. It wasn't until about my 4th month that I had realize I had slowly been gaining weight, stopped seeing my friends and every time I ate I never felt full. I work out every day and have never had a weight problem. My doctor switched me after my symptoms wouldn't stop. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/5/2012 9:47:24 AM	I have used Sprintec for just over 2 years. I had to get a cheaper BC pill b/c I could not afford the more expensive brands. I have previously used &quot;the patch&quot; and a chewable BC pill prior to using Sprintec. From my experience this pill does cause acne breakouts for the first couple of months then it clears up. It does cause nausea, but I find that eating something before taking it keeps that from happening. Also I get REALLY nauseous when I take it with my multi-vitamin and have not ate breakfast. The headaches are also terrible, which begin the day before my period starts and end when the period ends. I take Tylenol or Ibuprofen and it reduces the headaches. There is a definite decrease in sex drive and increase in mood swings. I am somewhat moody normally so I can't be certain it's all the pill. But it seems to cause very high - highs, and very low - lows. I have gained 10lbs since starting to use it and my diet is the same, but I was slender and the lbs don't bother me. Overall the pill has done it's job b/c I'm not pregnant, have clear skin, and my period is lighter with fewer cramps.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/4/2012 10:09:26 PM	I have had zero side effects while taking Sprintec.  My periods are definitely lighter and I am not pregnant!
Birth Control	mmt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	1/4/2012 10:00:32 AM	I was prescribed Ortho-Tricyclen-lo but since it was so expensive I asked for the generic, which was Sprintec..This Birth control was effective of course, I did not get pregnant; However the ectra vaginal discharge was insane...it made my sex life horrible, I could hardly a thing when having sex because I was so wet all the time. I know a little wet is a little thing but this was just insane, embarrassing and a very nasty feeling. After 4 months on sprintec I got off of it, and decided to pay the extra for Ortho-tricylen- lo. WHAT A DRASTIC DIFFERENCE!!!! I have only been on it for three days, but the vaginal discharge stopped immediately and it has been such a great feeling, to feel normal again!!!! Sprintec may be a genric for Ortho Tricyclen Lo, but if you read the ingredients there are higher hormones in the Sprintec..It is not 100% the same... Thank God I just decided to pay extra for Ortho-Lo, sometimes you truley get what you pay for!!!!

I began taking Sprintec when I was 18 years old and loved it. Now I am 22, and recently diagnosed with pulmonary embolisms (blood clots in lungs) because of it. Please be aware of all the side effects. Never in my life did I think a birth control pill would cause me this serious health problem.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	12/29/2011 9:21:25 AM	There have been a lot of negative reviews regarding Sprintec, but I must say I have had very few (if any) side effects.  No noticeable weight gain, no decrease in libido (actually, possibly an increase!), and no noticeable mood swings, outside of one instance when I accidentally took two pills, two days in a row.  As other users say, every medication affects everyone differently, and just because I did not have side effects does not mean that another user won't.  Overall, I am satisfied--it's working as it says and I'm most certainly not pregnant.  I'm actually switching to an IUD at the end of the cycle because I hate taking something daily, but if I react badly, I would go back to Sprintec.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	12/28/2011 4:35:18 PM	Love this birth control!

No meds, even prescribed, eases the headaches :( .. It caused HORRIBLE moodswings that has affected my marriage. I just took my first pill of Junel. I hope it will treat me better. I have 3 kids, 4 years and younger and I dont want anymore anytime soon! lol

I so wish I had read the reviews before taking it. I have had the worse side effects, everything people have said on here. Never have headaches let alone a migraine! Worse experience. I had horrible mood swings and lack of sex drive on my honeymoon. I wish I knew back then what the reason was. It makes me nauseated all the time. I have crazy up and down mood swings and loss my appetite for the real foods, not sugar. I am officially stopping it, my last pill was taken a few hours ago. I was only on it for a month and a half.

As I know, everyone has different side effects towards different medications. My levels of anxiety have skyrocketed while on this pill, and my periods are still super heavy. It kinda sucks. As I don't really have acne, so it doesn't really help with that. Oh, and I guess if you are trying to loose weight, or don't want to gain weight this pill would be great, but seeing as I am not in either of those categories it seems that I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I guess it is time for me to go back on Junel Fe, which has a smaller dose of hormones. What a great amount of problems that has befallen upon me since I have taken this pill... Best of luck to those of you who are searching for the pill that works the best for you. 
Birth Control	onetogo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	12/10/2011 9:14:14 AM	I know that eveybody's body is different, but Sprintec did not work for me. I was nauseous all day for the first 3 weeks. Then I felt amazing for about 8 days. Then I felt horrible. I became irritable, angry, withdrawn for my son and husband. I started not being able to sleep, I started having feelings of hopelessness. I would wake up with the thought of why bother even getting up. Then I started getting thirsty, very thirsty. No matter how much water I drank, I was still thirsty. I drank a case of water in 2 days and it wasn't enough. The hopelessness and the thirst lasted for 10 days, that's when I stopped Sprintec. One day after stopping I felt great. This drug was not right for me, there are other BC's out there. If this happens to you, find another medication.

No side effects except for wicked once a month headaches that don't go anyway with any type of medication.  They last about 4 days, once the sugar pills start.  As soon as a new pack of pills is started the headache goes away.  No break through bleeding, no cramps, no weight gain, no breast tenderness or moodiness.  Just the horrible headaches!!!

I've never had acne and i have severe breakouts in different patches of my face and its now on my back which is something i have never experienced before. I'm extremely moody and yell over the most minor things  and I have zero sex drive (my poor husband!) I'm going off this wretched thing asap, its really ruined my life the past few weeks. I'm switching back to the patch, ortho evra. I was on it for two years but switched because of the high cost ($80/mo) but this so not worth it!

It makes me feel nausious and causes me heart pain. supposedly it is the same as the other two... whatever they say, it cannot be true because it sure does not make me feel the same... this happened now three times... my pharmasist had put me back on this because they ran out of Mononessa... I just started a couple of days ago. And, I am already feeling bad again...

My acne cleared up, I lost a little weight (5 lbs) and all of my PMS symptoms went away! (Back aches, feeling hungry, headaches, etc.)  The only thing I noticed was that it effected my mood slightly. Four months ago I stopped the Sprintec to just see how my body would react since I wanted to try some other birth control methods.  The weight, acne, and PMS symptoms all came back...I am starting some new pills soon, so am hopeful that they are as good as Sprintec minus the slight moodiness!

Absence of Menstrual Periods	Ray, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	13-18	11/17/2011 12:53:14 AM	I started Sprintec a month ago. I have been battling depression without medication for about 8 months already, and I was concerned about it possibly worsening my condition. The things i like about this pill are my bigger boobs, less acne, and of course the fact that im not pregnant. this week I got my first period on the pill and it has been an awful experience. Horribly painful cramps lasting hours on end, on and off for 4 days straight. Also bled an obscene amount. I assumed these things happened because it was the first period. My depression hasn't gotten any worse BUT I am very angry all the time. Before, i was just sad. I am going back to my doctor ASAP and asking about these problems. If I find out this might happen again I'm probably switching to Loestrin. I heard that's better for my age group.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	11/15/2011 11:08:36 PM	Maybe this is because I have only been using Sprintec. Apparently these side effects will subside after a couple months....a couple months, of me being crazy? Look out world.I have every side effect in the book thanks to this drug. I have been nauseated to the point I've nearly felt like throwing up. I've had head aches on and off again. Extreme bloat from fluid retention. All things I can deal with. But what bothers me the most are the mood swings. All my emotions are very extreme...I hate my job enough as it is but now I REALLY loathe it to the point of depression. And I really love my boyfriend...like  REALLY love my new boyfriend, haha. And I get overly anxious with an incredible appetite. I am never full and I am never satisfied. I am worried about gaining weight from this pill when I worked so hard to lose weight, so I'm combating extreme cravings to eat and eat and eat. I'm afraid if these symptoms don't lessen up I am definitely going to have to talk to my gynecologist about switching perscriptions. The only thing I like about it is my larger boobs! This pill really sucks so far. Had to get that out! Good luck and be careful to anyone starting to use it...just be ready for what might come!

My weapon was takin away from me and i had no belt or shoe strings. I was also very moody, and I always cried. I stopped taking it because I thought me being in Training was the reason I was depressed. I started taking it again in Oct 2011 and I do not like it. I have headaches all the time. I can't sleep, every morning I am up by 7. My appeitite is chaning and I have gained like 10 pounds. The mood swings are something else. I cry over the stupidest things and my temper is unbareable. althoug it is cheap and it helps with cramps I wouldn't recommend it. It's also worsened my anxiety to the point I hate being by myself in the daylight or night timeI am going to my doctor to change itI HATE THIS PILL

I wasn't on it long, but immediately noticed horrible mood swings and headaches every single day. My sex drive is almost non existent, my poor boyfriend, and all I want to do is sleep. I've also had more trouble breathing here lately, and chest pain. Not to mention the dreadfully long and painful periods. If I hadn't read the reviews on this drug, I wouldn't have known it was my bcp but so glad I did.

I lost weight before being prescribed this product, and havent gained any back(I've lost more actually).

Birth Control	Aurora0ctane, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	11/8/2011 4:18:26 PM	If I could give Sprintec zero stars for overall satisfaction I would. Earlier this year I was diagnosed with anxiety and it has gotten better so I haven't had any need to dip into my medication for it. However, since taking Spintec I feel like my anxiety is worse than ever! For the past week I've had to take my medication at night right before bed because if not I wind up having panic attacks or not being able to sleep. I'm an emotional wreck! Lately I've been losing my patience with my boyfriend for no reason it seems, and crying all the time! I'm constantly tired and have headaches throughout the day, my stomach is bloated. I can't even fit into my jeans I was able to wear last week... I've gained 5 lbs so far! My boobs are sore, swollen, and heavy feeling...been trying to not wear a bra while I'm home now because the pain is unbearable at times. Oh and my acne is worse than ever... I'm 27 years old, I shouldn't be breaking out like this!!! With all the complaints of this product I'm deeply shocked it is on the market for use... I hope this company gets shut down obviously there's too many hormones for MOST people out there!!!
Birth Control	dana1221, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	13-18	11/3/2011 6:08:48 PM	Negative side effects may outweigh the positives. I have been taking it for 3 weeks now. I never used to get acne but now I've  noticed small breakouts not just my face but also on my back. Very dry skin despite applying mosterizer regularly. I constantly crave junk food and have noticed weight gain slowly starting already. Crazy mood swings and feelings of depression often times I cry or get upset over stupid things. 
Birth Control	Bluegirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	11/2/2011 10:20:01 AM	I have been on Sprintec for a year, and while it has been effective at preventing pregnancy I definitely feel the side-effects are a deal-breaker. As with other reviewers I've noticed mood swings and depression, increased headaches. I used to get migraines maybe once every couple years and I've had at least one a month since starting on Sprintec. Hair loss and lack of sex drive are both an issue too. I just don't feel like myself anymore and have decided to stop taking this medication.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	11/1/2011 9:54:02 PM	This high estrogen pill is the worst thing ever. I went absolutely crazy on the pill and I'm pretty sure the moodiness would have driven me to depression if I hadn't gone off this when I did.
Painful Periods	Ashley_Prez, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	13-18	11/1/2011 2:37:44 PM	This pill has helped me greatly.  The first pack or two was really rough and I had really bad side effects. I got very nauseous and felt like vomiting and my period had unbearable cramps at the oddest hours. My acne still hasn't improved dramatically but that just depends on how each person reacts to the hormones in the pill itself. I am overall satisfied with the birth control part of the pill and my period has been regular which is perfect because mine were off the wall at different times and I could never keep track. But i would recommend looking around for a birth control thats right for you. But if your looking for a cheap and effective birth control Sprintec 28 Day is a pill to consider.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	13-18	10/25/2011 1:26:56 PM	I reviewed this pill a week into taking it. I have now been taking it for 3 months. So far I've had headaches every single day. My libido has decreased as well as my appetite... healthy, good food is no longer appealing to me. I gained about 5 pounds (I'm really thin, so I'm fine with the weight gain). But the daily headaches are terrible. I am switching to the lowest dose of hormones Lo Loestrin as soon as I finish this last pack of Sprintec. I bled for two weeks straight when I first started taking it, but since then my periods have been lighter (only about 4 days long!) and less cramps. It's cheap too! Anyway, the crumminess feeling and headaches are not worth the cheap cost, in my opinion.Of course, every body reacts differently so if you want to try it, go for it.
Birth Control	Ms.February, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/24/2011 5:30:42 PM	I notice water weight gains every now and again, but a good cardio session and drinking lots of fluids seems to &quot;flush&quot; me out and fixes this prob.  I do notice changes in mood and sex drive occasionally, but thank goodness my hair has not fallen out.  I have used the depo short before and gained lots of water weight, looked and felt pregnant, horrible mood swings and my hair did fall out.  What's worse is that those symptoms lasted about year after I stopped taking the shot.  Sprintec is definitely not as dramatic as the depo shot.  Overall I am satisfied as this has been the least disruptive (health-wise) BC I have used.  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/14/2011 7:08:37 PM	I started taking Sprintec bc about two months ago from the advisement of a doctor. My hair loss is unbelievable! Every time I brush, wash or even run my fingers through my hair I have tons of strands falling out. I have also gained five-ten pounds with no change in my diet. I have been increasingly less social and uninterested in all things. I've been on bc for 15 years and never had side effects. It honestly didn't occur to me that this was the cause, until I came to the webmd site looking for hair loss solutions and I found reviews of other women. I would not recommend this bc to anyone.

It does not happen every week, but about once a month. Especially in the morning when waking up, nausea hits me. Other than that, it's been ok.
Birth Control	K, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	10/12/2011 12:34:53 PM	I went from Lo/ovral to this one! I have gained 10lbs in the 1st two weeks! My blood pressure has gone up also! My vision is blurry and I am dizzy, nauseous! On the positive side, my hair stopped coming out and my achne cleared up! Lo/ ovral made my hair fall out, I didn't link the 2 together until I got off of it after a year of use! I called my Doc today and asked her to call in a different pill for me!

About the time I started taking it, I also developed severe skin problems, including psoriasis and embarrassing dandruff. My contacts are always dry now to the point where I don't even like to wear them, and I have gained weight. Sure, I'm not pregnant thanks to it, but this sure is a lot to go through....

Birth Control	mashenka, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	10/10/2011 12:25:33 PM	I've been on Sprintec for over a year now, and it seems to be a good fit for me. I've been on a couple of different pills over the years, and rarely have negative side effects, minus an irregular period. It gets the job done and doesn't bog me down with mood swings, weight gain, acne or anything like that. Also, it doesn't hurt that it only costs nine dollars per month.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	10/10/2011 8:21:22 AM	Sprintec worked as a birth control, but after a few months I noticed that I was really grouchy and tired all the time. I was someone who never cried, but while taking sprintec I cried at least twice a week. I gained about three pounds when I started taking it, which wasn't a big deal. I had to switch my contacts to a more mosturizing brand, because every afternoon my eyes would get so dry and it felt like my contacts were sticking to my eyes. The biggest problem sprintec caused me was my libido. My sex drive was totally gone, but the hormones affect everyone differently.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	BeachGirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/9/2011 1:31:16 AM	I've been on this pill for over 2 years. I've had absolutely no issue with this medication whatsoever. The greatest thing is I never had any adjustment period when beginning this brand of birth control; no headaches, nauseousness, tender breasts, spotting, migraines, mood swings, drop in libido, nothing. I transitioned smoothly and without any issues or side effects. I have been on yaz in the past. But I struggled with migraines for about a year until I decided to switch BC pills and see if this helps. I also am a year-round allergy sufferer and the migraines were really debillitating me. I am VERY happy and pleased with Sprintec. My periods start the second day of the sugar pill, and last 2-3 days and stop by the second pill once I start new pack. My periods are light and I have no cramps or pre-menstrual symptoms.

Birth Control	cptnobvious123, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	9/30/2011 4:24:59 PM	I have been on Sprintec for a month now and I am just starting my sugar pills. In contrast to what everyone has been saying online, I have no experiences any bad side effects besides my breasts got really tender the week before I started my sugar pills. I never get any acne, I have actually lost weight, and I have no mood swings and no nausea and serious side effects. The side effects vary from person to person, but I can definitely say for the cheapness, it is definitely worth a try..
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Logan, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	9/24/2011 11:16:43 PM	I've taken bc before and was fine. I've been off of bc for about a year now and began sprintec almost 3 weeks ago. It's caused me to have what is now going on a 17 day plus period and it's been very heavy flow from day one.
Birth Control	Jazmin, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	13-18	9/22/2011 10:28:53 PM	Since i started taking sprintec 4 months ago i've had irrational mood swings where i would be happy and excited during the day and it seemed that almost every night i would cry myself to sleep. I would get migraines from time to time but they seem to be more frequent now that im on the pill. Also, i've had frequent infections, right now i have an ear infection, throat infection (tonsilitis), and a bladder infection. I dont know if the pill affects the immune system but i'm starting to suspect it does. Otherwise in the sense of birth control it seems quite effective
Birth Control	Melissa, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	19-24	9/15/2011 12:19:56 AM	When I had my son two yrs ago, I started taking it after he was 4 months old. And its been a roller coster! It was my first time taken BC, and Im starting to hate it. My moods vary like night sweats,no energy, then a burst of energy, etc My husband is thinking what did he get himself into :) , gaining weight little by little, headaches are so bad now and Ive never had bad headache, No acne until right before I start, Sex drive went down hill, Losing my hair; every night I have about a quarter size hair ball out of my brush Its bad. Its not working for me but that doesnt mean it would not work for you, but im about to ask my obgyn if i can switch or just stop. I just dont like how I feel and the effects it has on me. I want to be normal again :) yeah understand it has to do with your hormones, but really does it have to make us crazy and irritable. Hope this helps.

Birth Control	AMD, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	9/12/2011 10:28:56 AM	I was using another birth control, and switched to Sprintec, because of the low cost. The Sprintec worked, but my hair began to fall out. At first I thought it was stress or my diet, but I continued to lose hair!! My hair was past my shoulders when I started taking the pill. I stopped taking it about a year later. When I stopped taking the pill my hair continued to break-off. When if finally stopped, my hair was 2 inches long!!! A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	4	3	Female	25-34	9/10/2011 7:40:20 PM	I've been taking sprintec for about 6 months. I had to go through some breakouts and nausea in the first 2-3 months, but they are gone now. I gained about 2-3 pounds since I started taking the pills, but I'm not sure if that was because of the pills. No change with my sex drive. My period is lighter and shorter. The major problem I have with sprintec is spotting/breakthrough bleeding. It has happened almost every month and I am switching to another OC next month. Otherwise, sprintec is cheap and seems effective.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	C.Clark, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	9/7/2011 8:25:10 PM	I was put on sprintec because i was having abnormal bleeding, well while i was on sprintec it did stop the abnormal bleeding but now when i have my periods its like i spot in between periods. I dont like it and it also made me bloated all the time so i looked pregnant (actually had someone ask me was i pregnant) I wouldnt refer this to anyone, but like someone else said, what may not work for you may work for someone else.

My doctor and I agreed to switch to something similar but much less of a cost than yaz. My doctor recommended sprintec and said most women have little to no side effects and not many complain about it. I LOVE the cost of this medication, but my periods are ridiculous! I am used to going maybe 1 day and being able to use the same pad all day long while taking yaz to saturating a pad in an hour and a half on sprintec. My periods are so heavy and my cramps are at times unbearable! I think that this is a bigger concern for me than the cost, I think I will take my yaz back!!!

Although it is cost effective ($7 a month for me), it had HORRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS! I gained 13 pounds in a year which I've narrowed down to Sprintec being the culprit, I now experience cystic acne and I have no sex drive (ZERO!) along with extreme dryness. I knew there were side effects when I started taking it, but I guess I never thought it would be this bad! I will definitely go back to Loestrin.. whether or not it was more expensive.

I've been on sprintec for about 5 months now and overall its a good pill. The first month really messed with my depression and mood but now it's fine. Aldo during the first month my cramps were worse than ever but now I barely have a period at all which is great! The one thing I would say to watch is your weight. I gained about 2 pounds a month which was so little that I didn't realize I put on about ten now. I'm really active in sports and its been really hard to try and lose it. Overall I would recommend this pill its great and does what its supposed to. 
Birth Control	Monique, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	8/24/2011 12:18:09 AM	I've only been on this pill for a week. I see no difference in this pill and the other one I took. Trinessa. I am still spotting but thats because I am switching pills. We will see what happens! No side effects at all yet.
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	8/23/2011 9:19:01 PM	This is my first experience with birth control pills. After reading the reviews on this site, I was leery upon taking it... lots of horror stories, it seems! I have only been taking it for 5 days now, but so far I have not had too many problems. I had nausea my first two mornings (I take it at night), but that has ceased. I am a &quot;first day starter&quot;. Usually by the fifth day of my period, I am about done (light flow)... it is the fifth day now and it still seems to be coming... I don't know how long I will bleed or not... Before, I had terrible cramping the first two days of my period. It's the fifth day, and while the cramping is not terrible, there is still a dull feeling of it. Just my body adjusting, I'm sure. I also don't know if it's the pill, or the fact that I just haven't been touched in awhile, but I have been really horny the past few days.... I hope this first period ends soon!! ;)Anyway, so far it's been okay. My body is still adjusting to it, and as I have read it will take about 2 months to get used to it. I will post back later to update. I will say, if you are anxious about taking this, or any birth control brand, just give it a try. Every body reacts differently, so you may as well find out what works for you!  
Birth Control	Sprintec for the win, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	13-18	8/22/2011 9:34:37 PM	I'm on my third week of Sprintec 28 and haven't had a single negative side effect. I started using it on the first day of my period which also happened to be a Sunday (lucky me). I love it! As long as there's no side effects and nothing changes then I'm staying on this pill forever. The only thing I noticed is that there was still light bleeding even after my period ended but nothing big.No headaches, nausea, vomit, mood swings, cramps, stomach pain, breast tenderness/pain or anything!It depends on the person, you can't just judge it based on the reviews because I was scared to try it. I read so many horrible reviews but I gave it a shot and I am pain freeee :)

I was on Loestrin for about 5 years until about a month ago I decided to switch because I thought it was causing me to go through a phase of depression over the years I took it. Ever since I started Sprintec I've been emotional over everything and I've been breaking out. I'm honestly afraid to finish them. 
Painful Periods	Susanna, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	8/18/2011 3:52:41 PM	Massive weight gain due to insatiable appetite, food cravings, water retention in belly, feet and hands, painfully swollen ankles, migraines that last a week, painfully swollen breasts.  Hate this stuff.  Quit last night after reading others' experiences.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/16/2011 6:15:04 PM	I read what everyone had to say on here before switching to Sprintec from Yaz. Sprintec is really good! No more spotting, clear face, NO weight gain. A little bit bigger boobs, too. It does its job. Ignore the bad everyone else is saying like I did. It takes about 3 packs for your body to get used to the pill anyway, so don't judge it from 1 or 2 weeks on it.

No big issues except my cramps are worse than before but they last only 2 days! However I can easily over see it because my period was 9 days long before and it is now only 4 days. Also my face has cleared up! I haven't experienced weight gain or moodiness! The hardest is beginning the birth control because you do feel sick for about a week! Not bad over all!

I've had no weight gain, no hair growth no zits caused from the birth control (I'm a teen so a few here and there are expected). It does take away my cramping during periods. my periods are becoming regular. I'm not moody. No bleading in between. No hair growth. It hasn't effeted my sex drive like some people say it has. nor has it made me lose my appetite.. nothing. This pill is perfect for me. I enjoy this pill and that's the first time  I've said that about birth control. I've  been on 2 different kind that didn't work for me. Lots of people are saying that they've  been on it for 6 months-11/2 years and they're just starting to gain weight. I think everyone needs to understand that as you get older, you gain weight. it might not be from that pill if you haven't gained it till that time period.

I started taking this medication about a month ago.  During the first month I didn't experience any of the side effects.

This is my first experience with birth control, and I've been on it for 6 months.  Every single month has been hell.  It has in fact, made my PMDD much worse.

My period sometimes comes when I still have a week left of pills to take and it is longer and heavier than ever before.  I have been on my period for over 7 days at one point, and the cramps and back pain has been very intense.  I am going to switch to something else as soon as possible.

But in my second year and until now, I have had my acne start coming back, weight gain, my period doesn't start on the same day it used to, heavier flows, increased hair growth, dizziness, and loss of sexual desire.  I am currently weighing the pros and cons and leaning towards not continuing with birth control.

I used to have REALLY bad heavy periods, and after taking this pill, my periods are light and no cramps. I do get moody the week before my period but thats about it. I did gain 10lbs but it isnt that bad, my breats are larger, so no complain there. It cleared my face to the point that I have absolutly NO acne now. When I first started it, I was dizzy, and tired but now it is normal. I totally recommend giving it a try.

I look like Im preagnant, my stomach is bloated and hurts all the time. I just started my period for the first time since starting it and am having the heaviest, longest, most painful period ever! I am not taking it anymore....throwing it away and going to use condoms until I find a pill I can take without such horrible side effects.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	7/11/2011 12:55:10 AM	Overall this pill does a its job well, it prevents pregnancy. However after a steady 30lb weight gain and heavy mood swings, I'm ready to quit it. My periods became slightly longer and heavier. I started having severe headaches the week before my period and have become very emotional. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/6/2011 5:38:24 PM	I took it for 3 1/2 years it worked amazing the whole time but later on after i stopped taking it all my acne came back i lost a lot of weight and i bleed almost everytime after sex now and that never used to happen so i do recommend this but just be careful because stopping this pill might have side effects too 
Painful Periods	Heather, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	7/4/2011 5:12:33 PM	I started taking this birth control about a month ago when my original birth control was discontinued. Without talking to my doctor, the pharmacy just switched me to this one. Well I have to say I've had headaches almost every day. I'm constantly exhausted, I've had stomach pains, and I also seem to have gain some weight. I'm calling my doctor soon to switch. Not happy at all with this birth control.

I get home from work and pass out, so hard to get to kickboxing class when you are so tired you nod off at work.  Something is not right!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	6/26/2011 2:21:14 PM	I was on this medication from April 2009 - April 2010. It was great for the first 10 months. I then began having terrible mood swings and became incredibly emotional. I decided to quit them. I decided to try again this month June 2011, and I can't wait to finish the pack. I have gained weight and I am incredibly moody and emotional. I have also discovered my desire for sex has decreased. This pill is effective for birth control and does help control acne, however it is not worth the side effects.
Acne	Kelly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	6/23/2011 11:28:38 AM	How long is an appropriate wait time to make sure this drug has balanced out?  I am on my third week and have bad acne and am confused about how long to give sprintec a chance.  My reasons to start BC were to improve acne and mood, but I am worried after reading all these reviews.  Are there any indicators as to if this drug will end up working or not?
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/22/2011 10:01:51 PM	I have been taking this pill for about 2 years now, and it has worked great for me. I had been taking Yaz before Sprintec, but the Yaz was making me absolutely crazy! I cried literally all the time and over the most absurd things, not to mention the terrible migraines. After switching to Sprintec all my symptoms went away. The first couple days I had nausea and dizziness, but like all birth control pills, your body just needs to adjust. I have had no side effects since then. If I miss a pill and have to take 2 in one day I tend to feel sick, but that rarely happens and it is my own fault. I would definately suggest this pill to anybody. With that being said, everyones bodies are different and react differently to birth control. If you start taking Sprintec, or any birth control for that matter, at least try continuing it for a month or so. Everyone normally has unpleasant side effects the first couple weeks, but many times they subside when your body gets used to the pill. 
Birth Control	nikiafkng, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	6/16/2011 4:30:36 AM	i have been on sprintec a little over 2 weeks. I am very skeptical about taking western medicine becuase everything has severe side effects, but me and my boyfriend choose to stop using condomns, and we do not want a baby anytime soon. The first day i experienced nausea and a little bit of dizziness. I am a college student with a very busy life so i kept missing days. which i dont not reccommend!!! first time i missed, i was up all night throwing up. my mood is the same, and think thats all psychological anyways. i did experience itching on my legs and arms, but that might be from the dry air this summer. my acne is the same,im not pregnant as far as i know, and i have not experienced weight gain...yet

As for balancing it is working for sure!! and the price is awsome! I would definantly recomment to others.

My cramps went away for the first couple of months but are now back. Also I have started having severe migraines and elevated blood pressure. Overall this pill works for birth control, but I'll be switching very soon.

I started originally taking it to control my period (flow, cramps, nausea), and it helped me out so much! As far being married and using it as a means for birth control, it's very reliable and easy. I take it at night so I don't get nausea like I have it taken in the morning. But overall, great, great pill.

Birth Control	danichris21, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/27/2011 5:02:34 PM	So far so good. I've only been on this medication a week and already my skin is clearing up!!!! I was on Lo/Ovral 28 and got it free through my local heath dept but now can no longer go there. My new doctor switched me to this brand because it is very similar to my other pill (the hormones don't change in the either of these meds, both are 28 day packs, and have similar hormones). It took me FOREVER to find a pill that worked for me so I was very skeptical about switching but so far I have no nausea, fatigue, weight gain, mood swings, etc... So glad I switched. Just a work of advice for all women reading these reviews...remember different birth control pills affect a woman in a different way. Just because it doesn't work for some doesn't mean it won't work for you. You also have to give it a couple months for your body to get used to it. I highly recommend this pill to any woman, especially those having trouble finding a pill that works for them!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/22/2011 8:32:40 PM	I took Sprintec for about 10 years, right until I was ready to get pregnant.  I was off the pill for one month and got pregnant.  Two kids later, I started back on Sprintec.  I've been back on for 8 months and have had no issues.  No cramps, lighter flow, and you can set a clock to my period.  I've heard really bad things about other pills and would be afraid to try another.  This one works, so I'm sticking to it.

My Dr. prescribed me this drug because, I have not had a cycle in a yr. Since taking this med, I find I am less snappy. But I find myself crying alot more and keeping a bit of nausea, and staying really tired most of the time. So far, I think it's working pretty good. I really hope I get bigger breasts too. I haven't had my first period, since being on this medicine yet, but I hope it will be less painful than before. I would say to other ladies,you never know, it just make work for you, but you must try it and see . I have never been on any other birth control. So, I hope I get the results I'm hoping for.. a regulated period.

I just started on my second month of this one, from switching from Zahara. Every bc is going to react differently with every woman. Every other bc I've used has made me moody, extremely crampy, and sick 24/7. So far, I have noticed weight gain with this medicine, but my period was only 3 days, I only had a couple of cramps. My breasts have also grown. I am very tired all the time, and have a low libido. But, from what I'm seeing, the low libido tends to even itself out after a few months. I'm definitely willing to gain a few lbs, and deal with being tired and not want sex as much for the smaller price, and not being sick ALL the time. Plus, actually having a normal period and no PMS or cramps is GREAT! I'm very glad to be taking this Birth Control, and plan on staying on it for a long time!

I have gained 6 lbs, have lots of bumps on my face (acne, but they are the color of my skin, seem like a rash), and am a little moody. the symptoms are not as harsh as i have experienced with other pills. the yaz and nuvaring gave me horrible mood swings. i am going to wait it out for a couple months, hope my skin clears up!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/28/2011 12:07:09 AM	I initially was happy after taking this pill for the first few days. My breast enlarged, my skin was starting to look more clear. then, fast forward one month and 4 days and I am miserable. I had to take off work because I continued to get bad migraines. Now, to be fair, I usually get headaches the week before my period but it is easily resolved with 1 or 2 advils. However, after taking Sprintce, I noticed I would get headaches a few times a week and as the weeks went by my headaches turned into bad migraines. I would find myself over dosing on Advil! I also feel nasiated every morning (i take the pill at 9 PM) and sometimes throughout the day. I will be stopping this pill tonight!

Sprintec definetly helps with cramps, but I usually feel more bloated than ever, and look like im pregnant when it's that time of the month. these are the only things that made me very unsatisfied about this pill. OMG I think I'm even getting some what of a double chin.

The first couple days i felt kind of  sick and lightheaded, i forgot to take it the third day an took 2 the next day as instructed. about 3-4 hours after taking it i became very dizzy and was not able to keep anything down, i thought is was the flu until i read the reviews...i do not recommend skipping a day. i have noticed that i may have gained a couple pounds this week though i am not sure if it is the pill or not.i think i will give it a chance and just listen to what my body is telling me..looking forward to bigger boobs as well;)..good luck to all

Side affects that i've noticed are headaches and strange dreams which are starting to get creepy and disturbing.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	4/10/2011 4:43:05 PM	I switched from YAZ to Sprintec 28 and have been very happy with Sprintec 28. I got on birth control originally because my menstrual periods were nearly unbearable. Sprintec 28 has been great, altogether. My skin has cleared, I have never had a pregnancy scare, I haven't gained weight on it, and I don't deal with cramps EVER. I'm very happy with Sprintex 28 and don't plan on switching anytime soon.

I am pretty satisfied with the medication. It has been a wonderful birth control because I'm not pregnant. I have notice some weight gain and I've had irregular periods but it could be the result of other medication.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	4	4	Female	19-24	4/2/2011 1:41:59 AM	I have only used Sprintec for a week but so far i am impressed. I have alraedy noticed that my skin is clearing up. Also, my chest has grown about a half of a cup! No complaints about that. Honestly, I was skeptical about taking any type of birth control pills because of the side effects, but I have to admit I am happy I tried Sprintec. The only side effect I noticed after a week is that I am tired about an hour after I take the pill. This does not affect me to much since I take it at night. For those that are thinking about Sprintec, I would advise that you try it for yourself. There are so many types of birth control pills and I am happy I started with this one. Each person reacts differently so you will only know how it works if you give it a try.

I was so nervous to start it but the best advice I can give is to just try it and see how your body responds to it. I haven't had any issues with it and it has made my periods much more bearable. I know it won't work for everyone, but just give it a chance.

Birth Control	boo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	3/23/2011 4:18:04 AM	I've been taking sprintec for a year now and I have noticed a few things. Weight gain of about 10 lbs, and the first two months were pretty rough. I was crying all the time, feeling hopeless and many other symptoms of depression, which i shrugged off as side effects of a sick sibling. But after the second month the extreme emotions passed. I was on the drug for 11 months when I stopped taking it for 4 days. When I started again I gained weight and became moody again, I hoping this will pass in time too.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	3/9/2011 2:40:06 PM	I switched to this brand a year ago because of its very low cost of only 9 dollars a month. Since then my menstrual cramps have gotten progressively more crippling and the frequency and size of clots have become more often and bigger with each month. I decided to switch back to my old brand, the cost savings is not worth it to me any longer. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	3/7/2011 1:45:10 PM	This birth control has made me very tired and irritable and the two days that I missed a pill the next day i was violently ill (throwing up the whole day, unable to eat a thing)when I returned to taking the pill as directed. I changed to a different birth control right after the first month package was done with, I do not recommend this Birth control.
Birth Control	Casi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	3/7/2011 9:55:37 AM	I've been on Sprintec for 3 years and have had mostly positive experiences.  I haven't gotten pregnant, so it's obviously effective.  My face cleared up, my periods are lighter, shorter, and more predictable.  I am tired all the time, but I never thought that was because of the bc until I just read all these reviews.  I also get a migraine during the week of my period every month.  Also, I puke one time, once a month.  The night after I take my first blue pill. One migraine, one puke, and a little tiredness sound a lot better than some of the side effects other people get from the pill so I'm afraid of switching to something that will give me worse side effects.  No medication is without side effects, so I'll be sticking with the one I trust.

My periods are super light, I don't have any dizziness or nausea, I had increased breast size, and my acne is slowly clearing up.  The only problem that I have with it is that it has caused a bit of weight gain.  That said I am in college so take it for what it's worth

I was 110 lbs when i started the treatment, now I', 125 lbs and still gaining weight. I can't control my appetite for food. Before i didn't have any problem with food, at the present it is terrible issue. I don't recommend this medication.
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	BEARZ, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/4/2011 3:34:55 PM	I started taking Sprintec about 2 weeks ago. I took Loestrin24Fe for three months before they changed the price and it became unaffordable. So far I like Sprintec. The first 4 days were rough because the pill made me nauseous but thanks to gingerale I was able to ease the nausea a lot. I have had no other side effects so far. I have PCOS so I'm hoping to help reduce it by taking Sprintec so I can evetually have a baby. I think it would also be helpful for you to know about me. I'm 24 years old, 5'3&quot;, 190 lbs., caucasian, married, and have tried many types of contraception but find the pill has the least amount of side effects and is the most effective.
Painful Periods	LA, 19-24 (Patient) 	5	4	5		19-24	2/24/2011 5:53:26 PM	I love these pills. I used to have horrible periods before. They used to be extremely heavy and I also used to have bad cramping. I have been on the pill for 4 months now, and I love it. My periods are very light and have absolutely no cramping. My skin is great; I havent had any break outs. I havent gained any weight or facial hair. My boobs are bigger, which no complain there.  I did get sick for the first few days, but that was it. I totally recommend it. Dont let the other comments scare you, each body reacts to medications differently, so defiantly give a try.

Well, I've been using Sprintec for seven months now and I too had no sex drive and breakouts on my skin for the first two months. On the third month, my skin started clearing up beautifully and now I only get the occasional pimple. My sex drive is back to normal. And it's done wonders for my period. No more cramps, light bleeding, very easy to manage, completely done by the 6th day. And the best part, no more cramps. Let the birth control settle into your body and give it a chance to start working the way it should. You'll be glad you did considering this pill is only 9 dollars a month. 
Birth Control	Lucky41, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	1/28/2011 11:26:51 AM	I switched to Sprintec from YAZ about a year ago because I lost my job and didn't have insurance to cover the YAZ.  I've been on the pill for over 20 years, and I haven't had any problems.  One day about a month ago, I was picking up my prescription and by chance, checked my blood pressure. It was 158/105, which is Stage 2 hypertension!  I am a healthy weight, no family history, and I'm only 41 years old... so I figured out the only change was my pill. I thought it couldn't be the pill since I had been on them forever. I figured that maybe I had a stressful day at work. I waited a week and checked again.. 145/103..  Hmmm.. I went to the local clinic (since I don't have insurance), and he took my BP, which was 160/108! He told me to immediately stop taking the Sprintec!  It's been three days and my BP is down to 128/82, and dropping. So be very, very careful! I will be researching other forms of birth control due to this scare.

It shot me into menopause type symptoms that I think play a part in my now breast cancer diagnosis.  I had fatigue, moodiness, leg pains, circulation problems, head aches, spots appeared on my face, night sweats, shortness of breath, heart sputters, blurred vision, mid cycle bleeding, gained 20lbs, caused me to get sick off of 1/2 glass of wine and more.  I was on it about 8-12 months and the longer I took it the more symptoms I got.   I took northo ovum 1/35 for 20 years minus pregnancy and nursing years with out one problem. This drug should be off the market!!!!!! 
Birth Control	Drew, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	1/25/2011 2:15:19 AM	I started taking Sprintec over a year ago after I became pregnant from using the Nuva Ring. I have notice a decrease in my sex drive. I guess that doesn't really matter since my boyfriend and I don't want to get pregnant again right now. I have not experienced any side effects and my periods are monthly, but very short.

I have had such a bad experience on this pill. I get hot flashes, have horrible acne, NO sex drive at all, hair is falling out. I'm constantly moody and always feel like crying. I was convinced it was a thyroid problem but the blood work came back normal. After reading some of the reviews here I finally know it's this pill. It might work fine for some people, bur it is making me go crazy!  I also have out of body experiences where I feel like I'm going to float away and I get dizzy all the time. I think I'm going to stop taking bc all together, and let my body get back to normal. I have gained about 20 pounds in the 2 years I've been taking it with no change to my diet or exercise routine. I could go on and on with my side effects but they are all mentioned in the other reviews so I won't. Bottom line - listen to what your body is telling you!!
Birth Control	swgal, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/22/2011 11:41:13 AM	I am on my second month of Sprintec and having an ok experience.  I switched from Ocella due to the huge price difference ($60/month vs. $9/month).  The first week on it I had a major boost in sex drive and also bad headaches but it went to normal after the first week.  Have noticed my breasts getting bigger, gained a few pounds but also started taking it around the holidays so who knows if its from that.The first month my period started 2 days early and was pretty heavy, but Dr. said that is normal and give it a couple months.I'd reccomend anyone give a new BC 2 months to see how it goes- I remember when I first started Ocella had a bad experience the first month but it was fine after that.  I'm guessing once my body gets used to the Sprintec this month it should be fine.  I&quot;m willing to put up with the side effects to save $50 bucks a month.

I tried Nuva Ring before having my first son and it was awesome however afterwards it was horrible. Mirena caused me to gain 30 lbs and bad bad mood swings. I went without birth control for 6 months and now I am on Sprintec. A slight loss of appetite and some headaches but beyond that I am very pleased with the lack of mood swings and feeling calm. I also have more energy so I am switching to taking it in the mornings. In the last 6 months I have been ridiculously sluggish and exhausted. Although diagnosed with MS it is a different type of sluggishness. Like my body wasn't cooperating hormonally not physically. I hope this works out because I am really tired of not having answers. Also got tested for hypothyroidism the same day they prescribed this and waiting to get the results. Don't know if it's related but I workout everyday and wasn't losing weight whatsoever. I can't wait to have all the answers very soon and to hopefully get back down to my healthy BMI. Hope this continues to be a good birth control.

Birth Control	justme, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/9/2011 9:59:20 PM	So far this birth control has worked for me. The first few days it felt like I had slight pms but that went away quickly. No problems with sex drive at all. I totally recommend this pill!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/9/2011 2:29:19 PM	This is the first birth control I have ever been on, so I can't really compare it to others, but I have been on it for 2 months now and I am having no problems whatsoever. The first month I did notice my breast being tender, but nothing unbearable. I have not gained any weight, but my breast have gotten bigger, but not much. I have not had any sickness, or headaches. I will continue to use this pill because it works for me! It will react differently for each person!

My Doctor suggested it due to my general reactions to the other birth controls and after taking this for over 6 months I am pretty content. I am tired all the time anyway due to working, have been diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and depression for 6 years, and if anything I generally seemed more balanced than not taking the birth control before. No nausea unless I miss a pill for 2-3 days (not recommended), I would say I am as cranky as I generally am, the only thing I have noticed is moderate vaginal dryness. 
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	12/28/2010 1:06:55 PM	I have been on this pill for over a month now. When I first started, I had bad acne, but it cleared out after two weeks, now my skin is actually great. I felt nauseous for the first two days, but I was ok after. My breasts have definitely gotten bigger, and no complain there, but I havent gained any weight yet. I havent had any mood swings, which I love because I used to get them all the time.  
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	Radicaladhsnb,  Female  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female		12/25/2010 11:50:45 PM	I recently switched to Sprintec and the only thing I find wrong with it is nausea when I take the first hormone pill after the week of sugar.  Other than that, I find a little weight change. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	2	1	Female	19-24	12/24/2010 3:53:20 AM	This pill is really horrible. Now, I've never tried any others, but I can tell you right now I'm never taking this again. I've been on sprintec for a month and a half and my symptoms have only gotten WORSE. I have acne, which I've never had. I've also been more moody and depressed than I usually am. But the worst symptom of all is the constant nausea. I get sick almost every night. I'm absolutely done with this pill now. Do not recommend.

I would recommed this birth control pill to others. I was on Loestrin 21 and I had to write myself a note to make sure I take my inactive pills. I like the fact with Sprintec 28 has the pills right there for you. Remember everyone is different, so for the people that are having problems, if it does not get better my the end of the first month, I would talk to your doctor about getting off it, and trying something else. Good Luck to everyone.

Birth Control	EyelinerCat, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	12/12/2010 6:10:25 PM	I'm on my third week of taking Sprintec, and I really don't have much to complain about! The first week, I had some mood swings (Crying, alot...but I've been going through some tough times in my personal life as well so I can't fully blame the pill), and the only times I got nauseous was when I didn't eat right before or right after taking the pill, otherwise, my stomach feels fine. I am a size 32A, and already my breasts seem to be getting a little more rounded on the sides/fuller. They are a bit sore though, but nothing unbearable(I hardly notice). I haven't weighed myself for an exact weight gain/change, but from the looks of it, I still look the same (I'm about 115 lbs) so I am happy with that too. I was definitely scared to take this pill after reading all the negative comments on different sites by ladies, but now I'm seeing that I am doing just fine on it, and will continue to use this! If you get prescribed for it, just give it a try.

I'm a completely different person. I would never recommend this to anyone!

I am lightheaded, have had major hair loss, and am very depressed. I have lost interest in everything.

The first couple months I experienced little to no side effects, but the past month I have been extremely nauseous. I also have cramps all the time, the only good thing about this is the increase in my breast size...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Absence of Menstrual Periods	EmilyTheGreat, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/5/2010 8:35:21 AM	So I've been reading other reviews for this, and I really think that people should wait until after the first month to decide if this is a horrible birth control because OF COURSE we're going to have the bad side effects the first few weeks! Our bodies are adapting to a new drug so just be patient! The first three weeks I had nausea, mild mood swings, loss of appetite, and EXTREMELY sore and swollen breasts. Since then I've been side effect free. I've been on it for three months now and I have to say it's amazing! I take it for PCOS and because of my PCOS I would be having periods every 6 months and they would be KILLER! I would literally be in bed for days, but with this BC I have mild short periods every month! It's fantastic! So like I said, be patient and give your body time to warm up to it because it's a great birth control! If it's still not working for you after 2 months then try another brand! I definitely recommend it! Plus the price totally can't be beat.
Birth Control	Tephy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/30/2010 1:07:52 PM	I started taking Sprintec a month ago and so far I am pleased with it. The only side effects I have noticed is I am a little more tired than normal but that could just be because I have a 5yr old a 1yr old and a 2month old. I never took birth control before but after I had my last child my husband and I decide it was time to start. my doctor recommended this pill because I was breastfeeding and said it had less of a chance of lowering my milk production than others.

And, I have moodiness that i've experienced the week before I start my period. I would not advise this drug.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/20/2010 3:08:12 PM	After reading many of these reviews, I was very hesitant to try this pill. I figured that every woman reacts differently, so I would give it a try. I wanted to go on the pill for a few reasons: to regulate my period, deal w/PMS and severe cramps, and birth control. This is the first form of birth control that I have tried, and so far, I am pleased. I am on the white pill of first pack. I take it at 9:30 every night, usually on an empty stomach. I was concerned with the side effects interfering in my everyday life, especially at work, that's why I decided to take it at night when I'm home. Since I began the pill, I experienced little nausea (mainly in the first few days), occasional minor headaches, and very little spotting. I have also noticed mood swings happening more frequently; I find myself crying more. However, I do not know if that has to do w/the pill or what's going on in my personal life right now. I also have noticed almost constant breast tenderness, nothing unbearable though, and they seem to have gotten a little bigger...no complaints there! If you are considering this pill, I would recommend giving it a try, and just remember that every woman reacts differently.

Before sprintec I was on yaz which I had numerous problems with, from spotting to severe depression, but after switching to Sprintec all of those issues went away. I know everyone's body reacts to these pills differently but Sprintec has worked very well for me and I would suggest it to anyone. 
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	11/16/2010 10:22:52 AM	I have been taking the pill for about two and a half weeks now, i start my inactive pills next sunday. The first few days of taking the pill my acne got pretty bad. But it has cleared so much since then. I'm the type of person who eats alot, and always has an appetite, but i have lost my appetite some since being on the pill, which i think is a good thing for me. My breasts have most definitely grown within two weeks, (no lie) and my sex drive is higher than ever! I'm totally satisfied with this pill! But everyone has different side effects. My older sister has taken it for a year and never really hide bad side effects either. Her breasts grew as well, and it is very effect!

Birth Control	hatesBC, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	11/9/2010 11:43:43 AM	I have been on 2 birth controls prior to this one, and both gave me nausea and stomach pains. That made me extremely hesitant to try a new one. But, after being persuaded by my doctor that this pill is afffordable, and will work, i started taking it. After being on the pill for a week, i began getting a tingling and numb sensation throughout my arms, hands, and even legs. While eating, i even got the same sensation through my lips and mouth. Migraines 2 days in a row since being off the pill and i still have that same tingling sensation, and apparently just have to wait for it to go away. I wouldnt recommend taking this birth control to anyone, personally. But as we have seen, there are people who it has worked for so there is no point in bashing it. What works for some may not work for others. But in this case, i will NOT continue taking any form of birth control, it clearly is not what my body wants.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	10/29/2010 8:44:40 PM	I switched to Sprintec from Yasmin (which was amazing). It was the most horrible month of my life. After taking this mediccation for only three days I noticed that I wasn't as much and my headaches got much worse. By the three week mark I was sleeping less than 3 hours a night and I was sick all day. I was an emotional wreck. My doctor prescribed me a different birth control but told me to finish these. Before my period I cramped so bad that I would double over from the pain and I bled so much during my period that I almost called my doctor.

MY acne got worse, I had terrible headaches, and was so irritable I couldn't stand myself! The only good thing about this pill is it's cheap and now I know why. Wouldn't recommend this.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	10/26/2010 11:32:11 PM	I haven't seen anyone else mention this but I've been on this BC for over a year now because at the time it was all I could afford and it also was a replacement for the horrible Seasonique. I've read the pamphlet and it says if you miss a pill to take it with your next pill, which I know from past experiences is supposed to be alright.  But if I do that with this one, as I've sometimes had to do due to me forgetting, I get super sick and nauseous 3 hours later. I can't keep food down for the rest of the day, even water is hard to keep down. That's about the worst side effect I've ever had from BC. It hasn't convinced me to switch so far since it's mostly my fault and it's cheap but I really could do without that side effect.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	10/26/2010 8:03:43 AM	I started taking this birth control because my last birth control caused spotting...the first month everything seemed normal...then the second month I started experiencing terrible anxiety attacks and depression. I stopped using this birth control. 
Acne	ClevelandGal, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/25/2010 9:14:44 PM	I've been on this pill for almost 2 weeks. I, too, was horrified at many of the reviews and almost didn't take the pill at all. Thus far, I've had little to no reaction to the pill at all. For the first day at 2, I was a bit nauseated. No, I did not vomit 12 hours after taking it, as several reviewers said. It was just a little uncomfortable - I was never physically sick. I've had some abdominal pains, but they were hardly even noticeable. I've had no breakthrough bleeding, spotting, or anything of the sort. And I'm already noticing clearer skin. Plus, maybe it's just me, but my stomach seems noticeably flatter. I feel like I was retaining some water weight before and that's practically disappeared (I'm slim to begin with, but I did notice it.) I'm prone to some depression and anxiety, but I haven't had any mood swings to date and I feel happy as a clam!I think, to be honest, that a lot of reviewers have control over what's happening to them, but choose not to act accordingly. For example, I heard that the pill might upset my stomach. I made it a point to change the time that I took it to around 6 pm when I would be eating a large meal, and I haven't had any problems.Furthermore, if you're gaining weight, it's likely because you're eating more. If you recognize that, like on ANY pill, you might gain weight, you should be cautious about eating more than you usually do. If you're in tune with your body, you shouldn't have any problems with it.So ladies, take this pill. Don't let reviews freak you out about it. For $9 a pack, it doesn't hurt to try. If it's not the pill for you, switch. Everyone is different. But don't let exaggerated experiences steer you away unnecessarily. Good luck!
Birth Control	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5		25-34	10/25/2010 3:36:15 PM	I am writing this review because I got on here and read the reviews before I started this drug, and almost immediately wanted to call and get a new Rx because I was so scared of all the horrible side effects. I am on my second month and have had no side effects whatsoever. If anything, my face has cleared up and the pill has been very beneficial. I have never been on birth control before and can not tell a difference in anything now that I am on the pill. Don't let all the bad reviews scare you! I couldn't have asked for anything better! 
Birth Control	weezgirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	10/21/2010 12:10:54 PM	After having some problems finding a good birth control pill for myself, I've been on Sprintec-28 for about seven months and am doing fine with it. I don't like to blame everything on the hormones associated with the pill, but I was on Lo-24 before Sprintec, and I felt very tired and emotional all the time. I decided to switch, and I haven't had any negative side effects to speak of; however, I've been on a few pills over the past six or seven years, and Lo-24 was the only one I had a problem with. Also adding to the positives is that this is one of the pills available at the Wal-Mart pharmacy for only nine dollars per month. I gave it four out of five for Ease of Use just because it *is* sort of a drag having to remember to take it every day, but it comes with the territory. Not every pill works for every woman, but I've had good luck with this one. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	10/20/2010 10:13:31 PM	I have had several side effects to this medication. I have had sever spotting for more than a week, numbness in my arms, ankles hurting and a sever rash on both thighs that has made dark spots on my legs. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	noelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	10/19/2010 11:51:30 PM	I have been on this med for a few weeks now, and I have to say, that I am very pleased so far.  As with any birth control pill, we all worry about the usual side effects, such as, weight gain and mood swings etc. I have been a many, and this one so far has worked well with my body.  I used to have all over body pain, much like that of fibromyalgia, and ate things like motrin 800 and advil all day everyday.  Curiously, on my second week of taking the pill I realized That I had not even had any pain meds in at least a week! That is unbelievable to me, and my husband pointed out that my mood is much better, He said Im the &quot;old me&quot;. So I hope this continues, and this just proves that you need to keep searching for the right medication for you! My doctor had told me that this medication delivers a more balanced even dose of hormone, rather than the usual dips you may get with others. I think being 36, this is right for me, where it may not be good for a young woman who is &quot;at the top of the hormone game&quot;.  Keep looking for the pill that works for you.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	10/16/2010 3:07:56 PM	Sprintec has made be break out like crazy from day one. I also started my period (or just bleeding) while i was taking the pills I continued to take them but I've been bleeding for about two weeks now and there are no signs of it getting lighter or stopping. I am very disappointed in Sprintec and would not recommend it to anyone.

Birth Control	Alicia, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	10/13/2010 1:39:35 AM	I'm always tired and very very emotional on this pill. My dr put me on this pill because my health insurance did not cover bc. I don't like this pill at all. The past five months, I have been miserable. Mood swings, soreness, tenderness, emotional, you name it; this pill does it. I haven't conceived on the pill, which is good, but I've gained like 25 pounds in 5 months, and I'd say stay away from this pill.

About 6-7 months during the last year i have had cycles lasting longer than 14 days! That is ridiculous! I have major mood swings, cry at the drop of a hat, and im always upset about something. No ambition or interest in doing anything either. I hate this pill... and i DO NOT recommend this to anyone!

I lost all sex drive and started to hate him for no reason. i was very moody and somewhat bipolar.I did manic things out of personality and neglected the people i loved the most.I stayed very tired for no reason.I cant tell you why i did the things i did. But now that i am off the pill i feel everything and completely normal. I lost so much because of one pill and its too late to save it. if you are on this pill get off now
Birth Control	Donna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	9/19/2010 9:13:01 PM	I do not have another child so, this Sprintec has worked. That is the only good thing I can say. I have numbness in my arm- which can be a serious side effect that I did not connect with bc. I am very anxious, worried and cry at the drop of a hat (I really cried in the car one morning because the place I buy breakfast was out of eggs!) My breast are so tender and swollen, they hurt when I walk; I am naturally a 34DD but they do not fit anymore. I am unmotivated and worry that everyone is angry with me all the time.I do not think this med. is worth $1 much less the $9 I paid for it. $70 for YAZ is a better value because I can have a life without being upset and worried.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	TRICEY B, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	9/18/2010 8:28:24 AM	I was prescribed this medication after my D&amp;C because I had abnormal bleeding for over 3 months and I also had polyps removed. After I started taking the medicine my period came and it never stopped!!!! It is very heavy and on going. I am moody, depressed, and suffering from headaches. Doc switched me so hopefully the next pill will work for me!! I DO NOT recommend this medication!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	25-34	9/17/2010 8:32:10 AM	This pill is HORRIBLE! I was on Portia for 1 1/2 yrs and never had any problems. My DR switched me bcuz, of course, the cost and I dont have insurance. I have headaches everyday, I have a &quot;flutter&quot; in my chest in the evenings and mornings (like my heart is skipping a beat), acne is worse, weight gain is horrbile, stomach pains all day. Ive been on this pill for 3 months and I am waiting for my DR's office to open today so I can call and get off this pill!!! It's so not worth saving $10 with how horrible I feel now. 
Birth Control	Terri M, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	9/16/2010 2:07:51 PM	I am on my fifth month of taking the pills. My doctor said that if I would take all the inactive pills and skip the white pills for 9 weeks I would not have a period. That has yet to happen...  the last month I have been so tired and I wasn't sure why.  I have also lost all sex drive in the last month.  The acne breakout on my chest and face is terrible.  I pulled out the Sprintec Information pamplet last night to review side effects.  The only sympton it listed was the fatigue. I started searching the web today to see what I could find.  Granted the first three to four months was okay but this month has been terrible! After reading the reviews and knowing my personal experience with symptoms I will be stopping the b/c pill today.  I hate being this tired and I'm in my 30's I should be enjoying sex!!!!

It feels like I haven't even been taking it. My PA prescribed this pill to regulate my periods and it has worked great! You have to find a pill that works for your body.

Endometriosis	endogirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	9/10/2010 12:20:42 PM	I started my pills the first Sunday of my period. The first week I had no side effects, the second week I did have horrible lower abdominal pain, nausea, tiredness and a little irritability. Those symptoms have now stopped, but I have been having break through bleeding for a month now, just started my period, the only way I could tell is it is heavier than the last couple of weeks and my breat are very soar. I have not noticed any bloating and barely any cramps. Which is a blessing for me, I have been dealing with endometriosis for 3yrs now, had two Laparoscopic surgeries with no luck. I am wanting children, but I cannot handle the pain anymore. I am hoping the break through bleeding will stop, I have only finished my first month. My Dr said it takes atleast 3 months for your body to adjust. So I am going to hang in there. I am very please with the decrease in abdominal pain. I would tell anyone with endometriosis to atleast give it a try.
Endometriosis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	9/6/2010 8:01:51 PM	I have nothing but bad things to say about my experience with this medication.I am on b/c pills to stop my periods due to the pain of endometriosis. I was on logestrel and decided to start taking a cheaper b/c pills. I have been miserable. I have never felt so much pain in my life. The pain of the endometriosis returned (and worse than before). I felt pain from the middle of my back down to my feet. Also, I have bipolar. No b/c pill has ever affected my moods. This one has sent me into a terrible depression. I fight the suicidal thoughts. I don't recommend this pill to people who have bipolar or endometriosis.
Endometriosis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	8/28/2010 8:57:03 PM	I started Sprintec in April for Endometriosis treatment. Since then I have gained weight, had extreme breast tenderness, frequent and irregular periods even though I was told to skip the placebos and not have a period.  This month has been the worse and I have been having some sort of non-stop period now for 25 days and it is just getting worse.  Im going to the doctor in a week.
Birth Control	hhjgt, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	8/22/2010 10:33:04 PM	I have'nt read this effect in any of the other reviews, but sprintec gave me very sensitive teeth, worse in the first three months.I've taken it for 5 months now and the sensitivity is not so bad unless I forget to take a pill at my regular time and take 2 pills close together.  On the good side, periods are light and regular, and I've lost weight. (maybe that has to do with the tooth sensitivity, though.) No mood or sex drive changes, but would like to know if anyone else has had the tooth problem?
Birth Control	Happyguest, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/20/2010 10:16:54 PM	I take my last &quot;inactive&quot; pill tomorrow. This is my first month with this birth control. I was advised to start this pill the Sunday AFTER my period started. I have had some headaches and I am really sleepy but it seems to be working. I started my period on the third inactive pill and being tomorrow is the 7th one, I am almost done with my period. I also have endometriosis and pcos. My periods ARE WAY LESS painful and lighter :) I think it's great. I have two children, I got pregnant with my daughter (almost 5 years old) with an IUD. My son is 12 weeks old and I was on the depo shot when I got pregnant with him. So.. I am hoping that this will prevent pregnancy. Although this time around my husband and I are using condoms too. If YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO GET PREGNANT. Just be smart, get birth control and/or condoms. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/19/2010 6:07:00 PM	I've been taking this pill for about 4 months now and so far I've been satisfied with it. I haven't felt any different than I did before taking it. I am moody during the week of my period and I get some pretty nasty migraines during that week as well; however, that is exactly the same as I was before taking birth control. One thing that did improve for me though is I don't get cramps anymore while on my period. I have also gained maybe between 5 to 10 pounds but I don't know if that is because I'm a newly wed and I eat later at night and maybe not eating as healthy as I did living at home or if it is because of the birth control. I don't work out so I'm not trying to hard to get rid of it at the moment. So overall it works good and for a good price.
Birth Control	jelyfa, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	8/15/2010 3:47:13 AM	This is my second time on Sprintec. The first time I was on this pill (which was for a period of approx. nine months),I had a generally positive experience, save maybe some weight gain (though it was my freshman yr of college). This time however, I've noticed persistent acne depsite being on a prescrip. acne med, depression, bloating, nausea, a bizarre shift between loss of and increase of appetite, extreme breast swelling &amp; tenderness, vaginal dryness, decreased sex drive, and loss of energy. I truly enjoy the feeling of security (pregnancy-prevention wise) that comes along with being on the pill, but these side effects are making me consider reverting back to condoms(ugh!)I've only been on Sprintec for a month this time around, so I guess I'll stick it out to see if the side effects subside at all. But, I must say, seeing all these reviews with effects similar to mine does not encourage my efforts!

Birth Control	Sl2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	7/30/2010 4:54:26 PM	After three days of being on Sprintec, I was irritable and decided to give my body two weeks to adjust.  After five days, I was sobbing uncontrollably on my sofa in my bath robe.  Sprintec sent me spiralling into acute depression.  I immediately stopped upon advice from my doctor and will never go back on this med again. 
Birth Control	Dolly_Rose, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	7/28/2010 1:51:46 PM	I'm not sexually active, I took this pill because I will be going to college in the fall and wanted to be prepared. I have had no side effects, and have only been on it for less then a month. No mood swings, no anxiety, no depression. I suffered from both these things before and oddly enough I've never felt more beautiful, womanly, or confident. My periods are extremely light, some sticky little clots come out but its not everyday. My period started friday and there's been no cramps. I went on this pill because my period is very much untrackable, popping up oddly enough when ever I go near water. I have slight acne and there's been no increase or decrease yet. My feet are tingly a little, and dry somtimes, but no uncomfortable. My eatting habits have changed, I get fuller faster and am turned off by most meets now. The tast, if it gets stuck on or under your tongu whilst swallowing, is gross but just throw it back and its fine. It does give som headaches, but nothing that has effected my daily life. My Grandmother and Mother both suffered from high blood preasure while on the pill, don't know which type, so I will be going to to check my blood preasure while on this, but thats the only side effect for me. No swelling of the breasts yet:( Have heard some people went from an a cup to a d cup while on this pill.   
Birth Control	BabyGirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/27/2010 5:45:39 AM	Took Sprintec for 6 months and stopped due bleeding for 3 weeks straight. The tenderness of the breast was the worst expectally when sleeping. Overall the pill was effective but the side affect is a major turn off for me, but they all have them.  
Painful Periods	SarahZ, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/25/2010 9:48:58 PM	I am taking this med to prevent the painful periods. Without the medication I'd be sick to my stomach, unable to work, 2 days every month.  Now, one pill every day, and I feel great!  I should have been on it years ago.  I do not experience the headache or moodiness that somepeople describe.  No weight gain either!  And my periods are lighter and don't last nearly as long.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	marysue, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	7/22/2010 3:53:39 PM	My doctor put me on this because my periods where out of control very heavy. Bleeding thru clothes at work, etc.. I have been taking for over a year now. Gained weight but I was heavy to begin with! My main problem is very severe migraine headaches a week to a few days before my period. My doctor told me to stop pills for one month to see what happens but I am afraid of the heavy periods again and I hardly have one now. Not sure what to do. Stop the pill or live with the headaches? They are severe ones to where I have been vomiting and sleeping alot when I have one. Sometimes the headaches last for a day up to 3 days at times! Anyone have any ideas to help with the headaches?
Birth Control	newsprintecuser,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/19/2010 12:11:20 AM	In the first week I had bad headaches with Sprintec, the second week i had sore breasts but since then (and Ive been taking it for a month and a half ) I have felt nothing and this has worked well for me. My period was heavier than ever the first day then the second it lightened up and by the third it was gone. Definitely better that 5-6 day long ones!! 
Birth Control	Naomi, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/14/2010 6:59:32 PM	I have been taken this birth control pill for almost 4 months and I must say that I did have some problems in the first month.  When I first started taking the pills I had bad headaches.  My doctor told me that things will get better, I just had to give my body time to get use to the pills.  And as time went on the headaches did stop.  The only problem that I am having now is that my breast are really sore.  My doctor said that my breast are growing and when the tissues multiply and grow that soreness does happen.  But my periods are lighter and I my cramps are nowhere near as bad as they were.  I like the pill.  I have not grained any weight and I do not workout.  I suggest that if you do try this pill try to stick with is for at least 3-4 months before giving up on it.  Remember this pill is sending your body different types of messages that your body may have not heard before, you have to give it time to the messgaes.
Birth Control	KC, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	7/13/2010 8:48:07 PM	I've been on this pill for 11 months, and I gained 25 lbs in the first 5 months with no change in eating habits.  The only reason I probably haven't gained more is that I literally exercise more than I have now than in my entire life. Any suggestions for pills that won't make me gain weight?

Birth Control	bcdevany, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/7/2010 2:05:02 PM	Side effects I have been experiencing after 4 months on this pill: ZERO sex drive, weight gain of 6 pounds that won't come off, and extremely tender/sore breasts. I have finally decided to go to my doc and either go off of b/c pills completely or change to a different one. I worked really hard to lose almost 40 pounds and it is killing me to watch some of it come back.

While on Sprintec I have experience a HEAVIER period than ever before, cramps bad enough for me to vomit up to a week prior to my period, head aches, some (not bad) acne, and extreme moodiness and loss of apetite.

Birth Control	laurengyll, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	6/28/2010 5:05:32 PM	I took this soley as a contraceptive and it served that purpose well (I did not get pregnant while on it); however I experienced a wide range of rather drastic side effects that took me too long to connect to this contraceptive. For over a year I was having problems with very dry sensitive skin all over my body, vaginal dryness and irritation, very dry eyes (my eyes began to reject my contacts), decreased libido (although I was in denial about that), and uncharacteristic fatigue. I had mentioned to my gynecologist my skin and vaginal dryness and she just had assumed that I had extremely dry skin which was leading to my problems, and suggested I switch to fragrance free detergents, lotions and told me to baby my skin and vaginal area constantly with lotion. I tried that for about a year and it minimally helped. I finally went back to my general practitioner about 8 months later for an iron test because I was experiencing uncharacteristic fatigue. My MD also suggested that I run a hormone panel and thanks to him we discovered that my testosterone levels had dropped to basically nothing, which explained my constellation of symptoms, which until up to this point I had no idea were connected. My MD explained that oral contraceptives can lead to a decrease or in my case, a complete drop in your testosterone levels. No one had told me this before and I almost felt betrayed that I had experienced my array of side effects for so long and no one else had told me that my birth control could be causing them. I switched to an IUD about 3 months ago and have already seen an improvement in my symptoms. I am not saying that Sprintec or all oral contraceptives are bad, I just wish that physicians were more aware of the potentially disruptive side-effect of lowered testosterone in their female patients when they are taking oral contraceptives. Women need testosterone too!

Birth Control	nomoresprintec, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	6/15/2010 10:22:24 PM	I have been taking Sprintec for 3 1/2 years.  I am 28 years old.  I had blood work done at my doctor's office because I am always fatigued.  My doctor's office called today and said that my estrogen and testosterone levels were too low and that was causing me to constantly be tired.  They said that Sprintec was known to cause low testosterone and estrogen levels (I didn't even know women had testosterone lol!) I didn't have any spotting or irregular bleeding, or headaches while taking Sprintec, and yet it was affecting my body negatively.  My sex drive has been non-existent, but I thought it was just me.  I'm glad to finally have answers.  My doctor wants me to try Loestrin 24, and it is only $17 at Wal-Mart.  I hope this information is helpful to other women who are taking Sprintec :) 
Birth Control	meljo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/15/2010 3:25:17 PM	I have been on Sprintec for two years straight, and have been on it before several years prior. I have not had any of the side effects other users have stated, and find my periods light and regular, no cramps, moodiness or bloating. No pregnancy (phew)! My sex drive is normal. For $9 a month, totally worth it!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	eeleectrick, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	6/14/2010 6:21:50 PM	I have been on this BC for about 3 weeks now, and although it is not as long as some other reviewers, I felt the need to report this. My breasts have gained a whole cupsize (which is good for me) but that might be bad for others. However, I don't have the breast tenderness that others talk about.The only thing I am very concerned with about myself being on this BC is that it makes me extremely susceptible to sun burns &amp; blistering... and it's very extreme. Right now my forehead is a mass of blister, and small blisters on my nose. I have never, ever blistered before, and although I have semi-fair skin, I did apply SPF50 sunscreen repeatedly throughout the day. Doctors appointment tomorrow to make sure-- but if you are fair skinned, I would be aware of this.
Birth Control	Megs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	6/14/2010 5:49:32 PM	I was on this drug for 2 years.  I called my doctors 3 times in the first 3 months asking to change bc of breakthrough bleed and breakouts and she told me to stay on it.  2 years later I still had horrible mood swings, brown age spots all over my face (at age 26!) and no sex drive.  I stopped taking it and a month later already feel and look better!
Birth Control	 Female  (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female		6/12/2010 9:11:41 PM	I've been on it for over a year.Terrible mood swings. Headaches. Break through bleeding. I tried to let it work. Its not worth it.
Painful Periods	4sprinteccccc, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	13-18	6/9/2010 1:59:04 PM	i've been taking sprintec for about 4 months. my doctor put me on it because i have had severe cramping and painful periods. i've noticed that my cramping has decreased dramatically and i hardly ever have pain anymore. I wood get mood swings the first few days of taking it but i would also get that with my period. this is the only BC i've tried but so far it works great.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	6/7/2010 11:00:46 PM	I have been using Sprintec for five months now. The transition from Ocella to Sprintec was easy and even relieved some of some harsh stomach effects Ocella had given me. I noticed that I gained about ten pounds and became depressed and felt poorly about my body. This subsided after a short while. Unfortunately, a month ago I started breakthrough bleeding during my active pills. I have been bleeding off and on for almost a month now. This is incredibly irritating and inconvenient, and I am now switching to something else.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/7/2010 8:34:19 PM	I'm overall really happy with this pill. I experienced some intense moodiness the first month, but after that I was fine. The only other side effect I had was if I had to double up on a pill, I had horrible nausea. My periods are actually heavier than they were when I wasn't on the pill, but not any longer. That's the only downfall for me. I have yet to get pregnant, so apparently it's pretty effective! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	6/6/2010 7:30:35 PM	this birthcontrol gave me a deep vein bloodclot!

First pill I've taken and as soon as I got to the white pills in first pack period was there and shorter and less crampier.  Will admit been kind of moody, but that isn't nothing new to me.  Only problem is on last pack for this month and on the white pills but no period.  Usually they are same time every month and this is the first time it's late.  Haven't had any breakthrough bleeding since been on pill so overall I have no complaints with it.
Birth Control	lalullbi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/29/2010 2:09:54 PM	I have taken the pill for about a week and i have been crying every day, major mood swings and feeling bad. I had a horrible taste in my mouth, i could not eat and when i did the food tasted weird, my stomach hurt all the time and i felt sick. it felt as if the pill just sat inside my stomach.I had so many side affects that i had to stop taking it. Since I stoped I feel like my old self. My friend took it as well and had many of the same symptoms.

I have PCOS and am basically using it so I quite ovulating/therefore my ovarian follicles will shrink.  I've taken 7 days worth of pills and I want to check myself into the local mental health ward at the hospital.  I'm terribly moody.  Crying for no reason.  Crampy, retaining water, and feel like a giant balloon ready to pop.  I am discontinuing use as of today and am going to explore other options to control my PCOS symptoms.  I realize that almost every drug has a side effect but these side effects aren't worth it!

I was given this in combination with Pristiq to see if I could get any relief.  Thankfully, it has worked and I am beginning to feel human again.  Please keep an open mind--what works for one may not work for another.  My quality of life is definitely improving.

After taking it for fourteen days, she developed a massive headache and began vomiting uncontrollably. She was rushed to the hospital where she was diagnosed with multiple blood clots in her brain. Thankfully, she survived.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	5/17/2010 1:53:13 PM	I had tried two pills before this one and had trouble with extended periods and lots of breakthrough bleeding.  This pill has regulated my period wonderfully.  However, the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits.  I now have mood swings, depression, and fatigue.  A generaly happy, determined individual who hardly ever cries, I now expierence random bouts of sadness and cry for no reason. I have been on the pill for three months. 
Birth Control	Jelle18, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	5/17/2010 12:56:31 AM	I'm still taking the first month/pack, but i've been bleeding ever since i started it. My breasts swelled and were tender. I cried everyday the first week and I had horrible mood swings. My boyfriend had said that he'd rather me be off the pill and  happy instead of being crazy. Now, after the first 3 weeks, the symptoms have definitely died down and now i'm just still bleeding.
Birth Control	sunnygirl83, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	5/15/2010 4:34:10 PM	The pill has done it job as far as pregnancy prevention. But that is where it stops. I started taking this pill b/c the cost of Yasmin kept going up. This pill caused very heavy periods that lasted over a week. The cramping was unbearable. My pms symptoms multiplied 10 fold. The week before my period I was a crying mess. The week of my period I could hardly get out of bed. The week following my period was lonely b/c no one wanted to be near me! It caused me to be a very angry and mean person. I didnt feel like myself. When I wasnt on my period, I was spotting. Regularly!! For months! It was continuous. I took the pill same time everyday, just as prescribed. My doctor finally decided that this pill was not right for me. He switched me to Ortho Novum and it works much better. This pill may work for you so give it a try. Just be aware of your body and the warning signs it may send you. Listen to your body. Only you can decide if its right for you. 
Birth Control	loves_reading, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	5/12/2010 6:18:52 PM	During the first two weeks of taking Sprintec I experienced horrible mood swings, would cry at the smallest things, and was considerably more irritable in general. After reading online that BC has been known to deplete essential vitamins, I started taking multi-vitamin supplement every day and immediately noticed a difference in my mood. I've been doing this for about a week so far and have only had one noticeable mood swing, so for anyone suffering from the depression/mood swings I highly recommend taking a vitamin supplement, it helped definitely helped my mood immensely.

I almost just threw it away.But I manned up and took it after a giant meal and then had desert to assure my stomach was full.I waiting an hour for it to be in my system, fingers crossed.Nothing, I've had no side affects and I'm only hoping when I do have sex, that it WILL prevent pregnancy. I'm thinking about waiting an extra day... I really don't want to get pregnant right now.This is a great great product, don't let the reviews scare you, and just try it. If it's awful, move on. Take w/food and good luck for, like me, not having children right now!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	5/6/2010 11:54:13 AM	This pill is HORRIBLE. I am more than moody- angry, crying for no reason, frusterated. It lightened my bleeding some but emotionally it's not worth it. I have had a few heahaches but I have noticed intense, sharp pelvic pain. I tried to stick it out for 6 months, but I'm stopping at 5 months. Be careful taking this- your moods are aweful!

I have never had acne before and now  i can play connect the dots. I have no sex drive, I am a NEWLY WED!!!!. I am depressed, anxious, and cant sleep at night. I have been on the pill for 5 months and symptoms are getting worse not better. If it works for you then great!its cheap but its not for me.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	5/4/2010 3:02:44 PM	I have been taking this for about a year and a half now. When I first started taking it, I had horrible mood swings and the smallest of things would make me cry. I was also unreasonably mean to my boyfriend. But, this subsided after the first month. I have gained a little weight, but it does fluctuate during the month (I lose weight and feel thinner during the inactive pill week). So far I have not been able to lose weight while on the pill, but I am still trying because it is very inexpensive and effective.

I threw up every single day, and my doctor said it was just b/c my body was getting use to it. Two months later and 20lbs lighter he finally suggested it was doing my body harm. Then my body was so use to throwing up that it took me almost 3 weeks to get back to normal and then I gained a shit load of weight back.

I have had horrible nausea,cramping, acne(which i've never had), mood swings, have gained 15 pounds and literally have had no sex drive! This is my first time taking BC pills so I didn't know anything different. By the last 5 months of taking Sprintec I started to get dark skin above my upper lip. I went to the doctor and he said it was because of the high dose of estrogen in the pill causing my skin to be darker and he would have never put someone on this pill that has never taken BC before. I DO NOT recommend this pill!!

Something in between light-headedness and vertigo, which didn't start right way, started with the second month of taking it. I've had a metallic taste in my mouth as well.
Birth Control	kristigirl25, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	4/13/2010 1:34:16 AM	I'm not vary satisfied with this birth control. I have experienced many side effects. Migraines, light headed, low blood sugar, out of body experiences, I tend to forget things easily. I'm depressed all the time. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I have also had a seizure. A sex drive that flew out the window. Thanks Wal-Mart!! Of course getting this drug from Wal-Mart it's going to be the drug that is formulated to kill the women from the inside out. Wal-Mart is cheap, I should have known better than to pick a birth control that is on the $9 list. It should tell you right there that this medication is packed full of serious side effects. I will go back to my previous birth control Portia. The only great thing that this has done for me is, made my breast grow 1 cup side. Since I'm so nauseous I have lost weight. I have lost about 6 lbs. My acne is all cleared up. No longer have the oily face. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!! (take it if you want to feel miserable)

Most of the awful reviews are by women who have taken this pill for less than two months, and until my third month I would have agreed. My first and second months were miserable. I had mood swings, tenderness, cramps, bloating, weight gain, the works. I thought I was pregnant, and I hadn't even had sex! Now, I couldn't be more satisfied with the pill. I feel great, my skin looks great, my sex drive has never been better, and my periods are becoming lighter!

My mood was tolerable and my drive was amazing. For some reason,my gyno switched me to ocella. I'll try it and see if the tenderness stops. Maybe i will like this one better.
Birth Control	rty3456, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/10/2010 3:47:08 AM	I've tried the other &quot;cheap&quot; Wal-Mart birth control before (Junel 24 FE) and it was a HORRIBLE experience. All of the bad reviews I've read on here about Sprintec were exactly my experience with Junel. Weird spotting and just a HORRIBLE overall mood. I was very depressed and would come unglued at the smallest things. I was very weary to try Sprintec because it is even cheaper than Junel at the Wal-Mart pharmacy ($19 Junel vs. only $9 Sprintec). I didn't want a repeat of the 3 months I was on Junel. I am only on my first month of Sprintec, but so far I've been pleasantly surprised. The only side effect that I've been experiencing is very sore, tender breasts. The first week I also felt very nauseous and threw up a few times, but that has subsided. It was just my body getting used to the estrogen and such. I haven't had any issue with spotting or starting a period early, I haven't had any crazy mood swings or depression. I never had major acne or bad skin, but I would get occasional pimples and lately my skin has been looking the best I've seen it in years. I'm on my last &quot;active&quot; pill and will be on my placebo pills soon, so I should be starting my first period next week. I'm just really ecstatic that it's been going so well because this is my 4th kind of birth control and the other 3 just didn't work right with my body. I hope Sprintec continues to be such a contraceptive blessing!My advice to anyone reading this review and the others below it would be don't rely on the bad reviews to choose a birth control for you. If I did that, I would have never gotten a prescription for this &quot;cheap&quot; birth control from my doctor. I've been on $70-$80 birth control pills and the side effects were out of this world bad. So it really doesn't matter about price, it really just depends on what birth control reacts well with your body! 
Birth Control	foreverPMS, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	4/8/2010 2:44:52 PM	Up until I read all of these reviews, I thought I was losing my mind too!  I was on Loestrin for about 6 months with little to no problems.  Changed to Sprintec to save money...starting to think it was a huge mistake.  I have just finished my second month and I too, have horrible mood swings (mainly depression), breast growth/tenderness, bloating, always so tired, jittery (maybe a blood sugar thing), always hungry, practically no sex drive, minor acne before period, awful PMS!!, weight gain (which I don't need, I already have issues with weight loss).  My doctor told me she didn't like these pills.  Now I see why.  Still trying to decide if I should try one more month and see if things get better or if I should just be done with them all together.  I don't care if I save money or not...
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	4/6/2010 11:09:39 PM	I would not recommend this pill for anyone.I was on it for 4 years and slowly everyday my health got worse. I was hungry 24/7,my blood sugar was messed up, I would have breakthrough bleeding, I gained 40lbs,I was depressed, I had no sex drive, and much more.This medicine should not be on the market. Please dont use it just because its cheap its not worth the dangerous side effects.Also I quit taking it about 4 weeks ago and have lost about 10 lbs. I actually lost 4lbs in a week.And I feel back to normal again.
Birth Control	Steph, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	13-18	4/5/2010 11:08:04 PM	This birth control is great, I've taken it for a little over a week now and i haven't gained weight, had nausea, or headaches. The only thing I have experienced is breast growth but hey thats a plus too right? It's cheap and very effective for me but of course every woman reacts differently.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/5/2010 1:23:48 PM	This medicine is easy to use and I had almost zero side effects if I missed a pill or took it a few hours later. However, that's where the pleasantries end. I was previously on Portia but switched to a higher dose because I was told higher doses were more reliable and effective. However, within a few weeks of starting it, I lost my sex drive, vomited at least once a week from nausea, have anxiety that makes my chest hurt, and find little pleasure in doing things.
Birth Control	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		3/23/2010 3:31:19 PM	When I found out that Wal Mart was offering BC pills for $9, I demanded my Doctor switch me. I was paying $30 a pack before that, WITH INSURANCE! (Do Doctors get a kick-back by prescribing certain meds? WHY whould I pay $30 when a $9 prescription does the same thing?   I felt no difference, no weight gain, no mood swings, no spotting and I have a pretty healthy sex drive.  I would recommend it. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	3/23/2010 10:29:24 AM	I was having heavy 2 week periods every month and i was miserable. My doctor put me on Sprintec and it worked extremely well.  My periods went from being 2 weeks to 4 days. It has worked as an effective birth control for me as well.
Other	sportsgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/22/2010 5:08:28 PM	I personally have been on Sprintec for  1 yr and it has worked very well for me. I acutally pay $4.00 each month. My period is just a little heavier but no weight gain or side effects. I switched to this from YAZ which was horrible for me.
Birth Control	Meg, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/22/2010 9:39:26 AM	I switched brands of pills because I was having breakthrough bleeding.  Now on the Sprintec for 3 weeks I'm miserable.  I feel anxious and unmotivated.  Plus my face broke out!! Personally I would not recommend Sprintec.  Everyone is different, but it did not work for me..
Other	*Regret*, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	3/20/2010 1:45:03 PM	I was dating a guy for a while and things hit the roof right off the back. We were having sexual intercourse and he already had a child. He did not want another one due to being a parent too soon was hard work. I asked my doctor of what I could do since he was allergic to condoms. My doctor recommended Sprintec Birth Control. I decided to give it a try. After three weeks I stopped using it because I found someone else that I wanted my child with. It has been almost six months since I had my period and now I'm having severe stomach and bladder problems. I went to a different doctor and found out that I was not pregnant and now it's even twice as hard to get pregnant with no menstral cycle. I regret using this method for birth control. I now want a child more then ever. I have had unprotected sex with this same guy for three years now and still nothing.
Birth Control	Georgetowner, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	3/19/2010 8:19:18 PM	This pill has caused me to have severe acne and I am 43 years old!  I also have lost complete patience with my kids and have little or no sex drive. Needless to say I will be switching to another pill and will gladly pay the extra money.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	3/18/2010 1:05:48 PM	I have been on NuvaRing (not good), Yaz and Ocella and they ALL made my face break out ten time worse than it was before. Also on NuvaRing i had a VERY increased appetite and i hated it. I was moody and was sooo tired all the time and just didnt feel like myself, so i had to switch. But, since i started Sprintec, i love it!! I wouldnt say my face has completly cleared up, but it for sure hasnt gotten worse at all. It decreased my appetite and i feel great, not tired until its time for bed and im always in a great mood, i have only been on it for about a month but so far so good. Everyone reacts differently and i had heard bad things about this pill, but i have had none of the side effects, so i think anyone could try it just to see, its also very cheap..i would definitely recommend :)
Absence of Menstrual Periods	socalichica88, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	3/17/2010 2:44:50 PM	I started taking Sprintec when I was 16 to regulate my periods.  I still use it for that reason and also as my birth control.  After 5 years I have never had a problem with it, my acne even cleared up with using it.  I guess medications effect people differently but I have not had one single issue with Sprintec, for about 3 months I tried a different brand with horrible side effects and quickly switched back.  I also take it at night because it's easier to remember and I it doesn't upset my stomach.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/11/2010 9:00:00 PM	I switched from seasonale to sprintec for financial reasons. I've experienced pros and cons. Sprintec doesn't make me feel as hungry as seasonale and I've actually lost weight on it. The first month or so, I got terrible symptoms of nausea, breast tenderness..felt like i was pregnant but Ive been on it for about four months now and those symptoms have gone away.  My periods are heavier then they were on seasonale and of course the hastle of getting them every month. but I think its work the money for now. 
Painful Periods	jennysar, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	3/11/2010 10:48:47 AM	after 2 weeks of use, my vaginal discharge (and a lot of spotting) has been increasingly uncomfortable and more frequent. Also, the naucea in the mornings is not something I can get used to. So, no more Sprintec for me.. 
Birth Control	Rees, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	3/10/2010 1:48:52 PM	I was forced to switch from LoEstrin to Sprintec for financial reasons.  yes, the Sprintec is only $9/mo., but I have had horrible side effects.  I have felt jittery, nauseous, dizzy, and have had little to no energy.  I feel like I am constantly having an &quot;out-of-body&quot; experience.  I am calling my OB today to get back on my LoEstrin.  I've been on birth control pills on and off for 18 years and I've never had a negative experience until now.  Be careful before taking this pill.  Pay attention to how it makes you feel and if you start feeling like I did --- consider a new form of birth control.  Saving the $$ is not worth the suffering.
Birth Control	Karyniepooh, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	13-18	3/7/2010 9:12:35 PM	I have Been using this birth control for 9 days and my stomach is upset all the time, i have been overly emotional, and i have litterally no sex drive...I dont thinks this is normal

I stopped taking today and will switch birth controls, HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!
Birth Control	Molli, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/3/2010 5:53:06 PM	Started out very well. I didn't gain weight, and it helped with my acne.  I've taken it for 7 months now, and it has made my periods much lighter. Now though I have started having a lot of nausea and I think it's because of the pill, but I'm still satisfied. No mood swings or depression like others talk about.
Acne	michellehaaay, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	13-18	2/26/2010 9:38:58 PM	i used this for about two weeks and my acne got better ! my friends noticed too . its easy to use im just laazy so i take it between 5-7 whenever i feel like getting up .
Birth Control	PillTaker,  Female  (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female		2/25/2010 1:00:03 AM	The first day I took the pills I was a day behind so I had to take two on the first day and about 12 hours later I threw up. But I have been on it for about 5 months now and I have not noticed any significant weight gain, I still am even tempered but the only problem I have with it is if I drink alcohol I get really sick very quickly so I have had to cut down my alcohol use considerably while on this pill.
Birth Control	AMama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/23/2010 9:08:25 PM	I have been on this pill for over two months. my breasts are tender, and have enlarged some. Other than that I have not experienced some of the other side effects mentioned in reviews. I hope it stays that way!!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/20/2010 8:35:46 PM	I had not problems with this BC---although I tend to get nauseous when I miss pills but it is usually very mild.

Other	LucyLoo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	2/18/2010 9:07:22 AM	My gynecologist put me on this bc to regulate my cycles and I am at low risk for cervical cancer. I am only halfway through the second week of taking it but I decided to read reviews on this med after having visited my primary care with complaints of severe stomach discomfort, nausea that is ongoing, waking up with headaches for no reason, bloating and weight gain and I have also had low grade fever. My primary care had me go for a CT Scan because the symptoms are also indicative of Apendicitis. Of course it came out normal.The only positive for me has been that my acne has begun to clear.Needless to say, I will not be continuing on this med and it is amazing to me that a product with so many side effects is permitted on the market.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	sammom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	2/17/2010 10:14:03 PM	I have been on my 'cycle' for almost four months straight.  I was put on this in November, after a month-long period.  It did nothing.  In January I did finally stop for a week and a half, but started up again and just now switched to another medication as of yesterday.  I had no side effects to speak of, but it also did me no good.  
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	2/13/2010 9:49:26 AM	I have been on Sprintec for 3 months and I have had break thru bleeding for 6 weeks. I have gained 5 pounds, some acne, mood swings, depression. Not Good but it is affordable.
Birth Control	meow, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	2/11/2010 2:15:47 PM	Worst birth control ever! I switched to Sprintec just like everyone else b/c it was cheap. BIG mistake. I have been on BC for over 10 years and never had side effacts like this!! I have been on Sprintec for 3 months. At first everything was good but for the past 3 weeks I have been bleeding, non-stop. My breast are tender, I am crampy and moody and have a ZERO sex drive. I am switching back to my old kind on sunday. It's worth paying the extra money over all this hassle and emotional damage. 
Birth Control	spring, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	13-18	2/7/2010 7:03:39 PM	I started the pills on the 1st day of my cycle and have been bleeding since. Please advise.
Birth Control	giving my boyfriend the bluesbn548d, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	2/4/2010 2:13:01 PM	Ok this pill works as birth control but the side effects are horrible. I know that there are mixed reviews so I guess im one of the unlucky ones. Im a happy girl usually and now not so much. My sypmtoms include: HORRIBLE STOMACH PAIN - HORRIBLE HEADACHES {FOR NO REASON} - NAUSEA {DAILY ALMOST} - MOOD SWINGS {LIKE NEVER BEFORE} - SADNESS {MAYBE DEPRESSION}. Only good thing is that acne hasn't returned but since reading these reviews I am going to try to change ASAP. Thanx ladies!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/4/2010 11:33:36 AM	I have been on Sprintec for the past 5 years and have had no problems. 
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/2/2010 1:51:00 PM	I began taking this because on low-dose pills I was not getting my period. I am very active, so I guess that's why but I have had no problems on this. My boobs do get just a tiny bit sore the week before my period on this, I feel like I gain weight but it's only during the week before. No acne problems...acutally, my face is much clearer now than it was on the low-dose pill before. I like getting a cycle every month since my boyfriend and I are sexually active so this pill works for me. This is the end of my 3rd month on it, so I am hoping that it continues to remain this way but I do worry that I will gain weight as time goes on. Overall, it is a good pill, but remember that every one's body is different so what works for some, might not for others. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/1/2010 10:44:49 AM	I have taken Sprintec for over a year and experienced no side effects. My complexion didn't worsen, no mood swings, no adverse affect of my sex drive, no weight gain. The only time I was sick from it is if I missed a pill and had to double up, but that's with any BC. Recommend!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	1/30/2010 8:15:03 PM	I've only been on birth control one other time in my life. I recently got married and had no insurance so i was issued a perscription for Sprintec bc it is cheap. I have had crazy mood swings, stress, many stomach pains, weight gain, and not to mention have grown extra hair growth due to the many hormones in Sprintec. If u can avoid this birth control PLEASE DO!!!!
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	brittlek, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	1/29/2010 3:31:56 PM	My doctor recently switched me from Yaz to Sprintec because it's cheaper. I'm a few pills from finishing my first pack and I'm NOT impressed. I've gained 7 pounds, my breasts are so sensitive ALL the time, and my mood has done a complete 180. I've never had a problem with being moody or depressed but this past month has been a living hell for me and the people around me!! I can't afford $69/month staying on Yaz, but I can't handle the effects I'm experiencing either!! I know everybody's different and I hope I haven't scared somebody away from taking this, but didn't research this pill before I took it... and had I, I would have KNOWN to stay away from it because it doesn't seem like many like it! On a positive note, it's prevented pregnancy and it's only $9/month. So if you are looking for a cheap alternative and can handle side effects, Sprintec is for you!
Birth Control	ropi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	25-34	1/28/2010 5:22:01 AM	After reading all these reviews I figured out my problem. I'm on my second month of Sprintec  I thought I was going crazy, I'm very emotional and having bad headaches. I also gained about 5lbs. 
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Lorraine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	1/26/2010 4:39:17 PM	I started this pill to control and regulate my periods. Which it has done. So far these are working well for me. The only down side I'm noticing is constant breast tenderness and weight gain. I'm thinking of using this every other month, as I don't need it to prevent pregnancy, just menstration control.
Birth Control	conner, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	13-18	1/25/2010 8:55:22 AM	
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	1	Female	19-24	1/25/2010 1:57:11 AM	I just recently switched to Sprintec from Ortho Lo, they do not offer it anymore. I didn't think the switch would be major but I am MISERABLE! Mood swings, zero sex drive, acne, stomach pain, anxiety, break through bleeding... no weight gain, breast tenderness but no growth. It may work differently for you but my overall experience with it has been horrible. Wish I would have looked into it before taking Sprintec. Hope this helps!
Birth Control	casssio, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	1/22/2010 8:45:24 PM	After reading all these reviews I was so scared to take this pill. It's my first time on BC, and I've been taking it for nearly 2 complete cycles. I have not had one single side effect. I was hoping it would get rid of my acne.. but it didn't. At least it didn't make it worse though (I guess It's because I have non-hormonal acne). I got my period on time and I didn't get pregnant despite having lots and lots of unprotected sex with my boyfriend :) The only problem I'm having from it is because I accidentally forgot to take my pill one day and had to take two the next day. So now I'm having some spotting. Not a big deal though. I am very pleased with this pill and so relieved I didn't get any of those horrible side effects! I also have a friend who is taking this and hasn't had any problems either. And it's relatively cheap so I think it's worth a shot
Absence of Menstrual Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/21/2010 5:13:18 PM	I first got on BC to regulate periods which it has done.  I can count on having my period every 28 days and it lasts only 4-5 days:  day 1 very light day 2-3 normal, day 4-5 light.  Without it I had long heavy periods.  The only side effect I have experienced is breast tenderness few days before my period but it isn't too bad at all.  I have missed pills and doubled up the following day in which at times makes me feel a bit of nausea but then again its 2 pills.  I have not gotten pregnanct although I miss pills and don't take it the same time everyday. It most definately works for me.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/21/2010 1:32:16 AM	After reading the reviews of this pill I was extremely worried about taking it. I have now been on this birth control for over five months and have experienced none of the extreme symptoms as others have. The only side effect was gaining a couple pounds.
Birth Control	Devon, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	13-18	1/19/2010 12:46:42 PM	I went on this birthcontrol for only a month and the first day i took it, i got incredibly sick. and every day after that my stomache kept hurting so i stopped taking it. it has been 6 months since i took it and my stomache STILL hurts. DO NOT TAKE THIS. and i have a very not sensitve stomache.
Birth Control	skillet, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	1/17/2010 10:26:19 PM	ummmmmm, lets just say that my son is here and i was taking this when we got pregnant with him. I had an alarm set on my phone to take this and never missed. The first few months it killed my sex drive and I just decided after talking to my gyno that changing was not gonna help, we changed some things to help me and well maybe we should have changed but we would not have our little angel right now if we had.
Birth Control	Amber, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/12/2010 1:50:21 AM	I've been taking birth control for 5 years and i have tried about 7 different kinds and this is by far the WORST one ever. Im a student and i switched to it because its cheap but after the last 8 months of taking it i finally broke down and called my gyno to switch. At this point i would be willing to pull a second job if thats what it took to afford anything better than this. The first 4-5 months i literally felt like a crazy person from the mood swings and depression, which eventually went away. The worst part is the acne. What a nightmare. When im on the 3 active weeks of pills my face is a disaster, so bad that it hurts to even open my mouth to eat food! Giant zits every where. And when i stop taking them for the week i get my period my face clears up almost completely! I guess i stuck with it so long because they say it takes a while for your body to adjust, but every month the acne got worse. Every person is different, but for me its like poison. The only thing it did was keep me from getting pregnant...
Birth Control	eel2010, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/9/2010 6:39:53 AM	I have been taking it for about a month and a half now and overall its been alright. The beggining of the month i do get a little nausea and my breast size has increased about a cup size. My body is getting more used to it now and the symptoms seem to be decreasing.
Birth Control	lilmama22, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/6/2010 5:41:19 PM	I started taking this about 2 months ago and I am mostly pleased.  It does cause me to have horrible mood swings and depression the week before my period but I haven't gotten pregnant and that's what this is supposed to do!  Plus it's cheap.
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	1/6/2010 3:44:26 PM	I was on this pill for 4 months and every time I started back on the blue pill I would get sick. I had to leave school throwing up just about every time. It made my acne worse. What really did it for me though was when I read that it makes it difficult for women to get pregnant after using it.

I thought I'd try Sprintec because I have PCOS and was told this should help and to do the 3 months on in a row, then have a cycle and back to the 3 months.  I feel like it's working in reverse.  Haven't seem to have major mood swings or haven't noticed an increase in breast size, but some tenderness.  I'm going to be changeing to somethig else soon.

I may consider switching to something else cheap.

Birth Control	Charlie, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	35-44	12/23/2009 10:30:19 AM	I switched from Levora to Sprintec b/c of cost.  Since I started this med in August 09, I have anxiety attacks that I never had before.  I feel jittery and off balance almost all the time.  I stopped taking Sprintec today and will go back on Levora. Don't take this pill!!!

I haven't had ANY problems. Doesn't make me sick or anything. Been on it for over a year, married, and have no babies. The price is great and it doesn't have any recalls or bad effects like yaz, yazmin, or ocella. Only nine bucks a month!
Birth Control	19-24 Female 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	12/19/2009 5:24:28 PM	I have been on it for almost a month and I have experienced nausea all of the time. But I am kinda glad because I have lost weight cause I don't want to eat anything....... The pill works differently for everyone so I say just try it and see what happens, if you do not want to get preggers. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	12/18/2009 2:08:09 PM	I have been on Yaz for 2 years. My Doctor switched me last month.  I am one pill away from finishing my first pack and I am MISERABLE!  The PMS symptoms and cramps are worse that I ever remember! My breasts have been hurting ALL MONTH LONG!  I knew the price was too good to be true!  Can I have my YAZ back, please?!?!?
Other	teeny, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	13-18	12/17/2009 9:31:35 AM	I started taking this medication for hormonal reasons...now I find myself slightly jittery, nauseous, lost 7 lbs., my breasts grew a whole cup size, and have painful cramps more often... the periods are lighter though and the ovulation time has decreased... going to wait another month to see if I get any better or I'm switching.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/15/2009 5:21:55 PM	Remember, everyone's body is different! I have been on Sprintec for 3 months.  In the first week, I  had slight nausea and was a little moody. Soon, after about the first month, my hormones balanced out and I was feeling like my self again. I did gain about 5lbs, but that was expected.  My appetite has decreased and I'm starting to loose the weight.  My breasts are about a cup size bigger too. Overall, I'm really satisfied with this product.  It is a great form of birth control.

I have PCOS and high insulin so my doctor put me on it to regulate my periods and take away the cysts. I still have cysts and my insulin is still high. I have horrible migraines and had to be put on depression meds and never thought it could be the bc causing it until i read all the reviews so thanks to everyone who reviewed, i have a doctor appointment this week and will be getting my pills changed. this is such a horrible bc i would not reccomend it to anyone
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	12/12/2009 12:08:33 PM	I had been on Sprintec for about 3 years on and off, I would notice that everytime I would start it, it would get harder to get over the symptoms that came with the pill, but I always ignored them thinking that it was normal until I started the pill again in the summer of 2009 and I had been having headaches every day and feeling depressed, and nauseous all the time i just kept thinking it was normal, and I believe it had something to do with this pill that after taking it for so long it took me to the edge. I also gained a lot of wieght and still exercised and was not able to loose any of it. I would strongly suggest for people who are about to start any birth control to listen to your body and do not ignore anything that you know could not be normal. I chose to ignore it and I am paying a big price for it. I just hope that it has not done any permanent damage.

I did not get the break outs or weight gain like others had mentioned, but every once in a while I do get break through bleeding in the middle of cycles. It also gives full heavy periods like I had before I got on birth control
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	13-18	12/10/2009 7:53:22 PM	After bing on YAZ for a year i decided to switch to sprintec. This pill made my sex drive so low that sex wasn't even an option. I also gained 15 lbs in a little over 2 months. This pill is awful.. Now i am trying nuvaring. Do not take this pill you will feel awful. i even gained weight when i work out 5 days a week for college basketball!

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	12/5/2009 6:12:16 PM	I took this BC and it stopped my bleeding for a while then it started back heavy again.  I then went to the ER because i had sharp pains in my side.  I found out i had developed blood clots in both my lungs!! i was at serious risk and in the ICU for 3 days and a week of recovery in the hospital.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	12/5/2009 1:01:33 AM	I hate this! My cramps are worse, my periods longer and my mood is I hate everyone! before my period. I have been using sprintec for a year now and I just keep getting worse. I like that it is cheap and you dont need insurance to get it but I am switching to Yaz, I would rather pay more than loose my husband because of my terrible moods:)
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	12/4/2009 12:00:26 AM	I was very apprehensive when starting Sprintec after reading all the reviews. I've only been taking it for over a month. The first two weeks I experienced slight breast sensitivity and acne. I only get hormonal acne, and Sprintec made me break out with 4-5 pretty noticeable pimples. My boobs got a little bigger (not complaining). It also changed my appetite a bit--I wanted to eat more, like I usually do when I have PMS. After the first three weeks most of the side effects subside, EXCEPT for the appetite change. I don't know if it's college or the pill, but I CANNOT STOP EATING. I've gained about 8 pounds since September although it may just be college and the freshman 15 etc...However, Sprintec has controlled my acne rather well which is one of the primary reasons why I went on it. My periods are shorter and lighter, I have less intense PMS and so far it has worked as birth control.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	12/2/2009 12:59:22 PM	Horrible. I had been on Yaz for years and switched due to cost and have been on Sprintec for a month and my face broke out worse than it has ever with red blotchy spots and bumps all over. It hurt to touch for days. I also had pretty bad mood swings, which I have never had before. I'm going to just suck it up and pay the extra to be sane and acne free. No wonder its only 9 bucks.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	11/27/2009 8:50:39 AM	I started taking this bc mostly to regulate my periods, and had been taking it two months with weight LOSS, (about 5-10 lbs)and breast growth, but sore breasts the whole time, and then, i missed my period a few weeks ago which was weird, and then a few days ago i started having the worst cramps of my life! I have never gotten serious cramps ever. I wasnt able to go out and do anything, and in major waves of pain... weird... but then yesterday I decided to not take the pill just in case it would stop the cramping, and ever since I have had extreme bleeding, and the weirdest tissue-skin-colored-rubbery-stuff coming out of my body with the blood. Scary YES. I know it has GOT to do with this pill, and i am not sexually active so there is no way for it to be some sort of miscarriage. I'm going to wait for the weekend and see if anything happens, but up until this the effects were worth the cheap price.... now I'm not so sure.

Birth Control	brown, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	11/18/2009 12:37:19 PM	This is the worst birthcontrol ever.My doctor swithched me not even 2 weeks ago and it has been a disaster.As soon as she switched me i looked it up online and saw all the reviews and was horrified to start taking it.The 3rd day of taking it i started feeling nausia.Going into my second week i have had a headache every day,cramps like you wouldn't beleive,very run down tired.I don't feel like doing anything.I used to walk 4-6 miles a day and now i get about 2 miles and feel like my body can't go any more.Needless to say i called the doctor and she is switching my pills back!! I know this bithcontrol is cheap but it is so not worth the pain and agony.Oh yeah and my face is totally broke out!!

Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	11/11/2009 3:43:49 PM	This drug gave me terrible and unbareable nausea and headaches. I only took it for one month and that was definitely enough for me. I had a very very heavy period and I never have that. It's easy to take and it prevented me from getting pregnant but it was not worth it with all the awful side effects. Do not take this birth control!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	11/10/2009 12:17:05 PM	This is my first time on birth control. I have been on sprintec for about 3 months now. It started out fine. The only problem is with the nausea which gets really bad when i drink any amount of alcohol. I could have one beer, or i could have 10 beers and be sick for atleast 4 hours the next morning. I never had a problem with this before I went on the pill.

I have gained weight with no change in diet or activity level.  I've even tried not eating for a couple of days and my weight still wouldn't go down.  My hair has thinned out a lot.  My breasts are huge and tender all the time.  I've also been breaking out with acne on my face, chest and back - gross.  I feel bloated all the time.  I've been having trouble moving my bowels.  I feel like a cow with some grotesque disease.  I would not recommend this birth control to anyone.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	19-24	11/2/2009 10:22:20 PM	I started taking Sprintec and was scared out of my mind when I read the horrible reviews. I was on Yaz before. I decided to take the pills at night when I knew I'd be home. At first when I took them I'd wake up exactly four hours after extremely nauseous and vomiting. Then I took the pills with food and its worked like a charm.  I would suggest taking them at night, its so much easier than the morning I don't have any nausea or any side effects, its great!
Birth Control	MariposaBleu, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	11/2/2009 1:04:03 AM	I just finished my first month of Sprintec. I experienced slight heartburn the first week, extreme gain in breast size and severe tenderness.  I have gained weight and have noticed greater than usual hair loss.  I'm going to give it a couple more months to see if the side effects even out since they're not that bad and I am rather enjoying the  larger breast size (as is my boyfriend).  I have not had any of the other side effects discussed by some of the other women.

So I really don't know yet how effective it will be, but everyday since I started taking it I have been terribly nauseous for hours. I am going to give it a couple of months before I give up because I have no insurance and really can't afford anything else. However, I did read another similar post and this side effect did go away after a month &amp; 1/2. I'm currently taking it in the morning if the nausea persists then on the next pack I will switch to taking it before bed and let ya know if this helps.

I have gained about 10 pounds, but I'm not positive it's from sprintec because I'm on some other medication as well so who knows.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/19/2009 5:55:06 PM	Do not like this BC at all.  During my period it made cramping worse and last longer.  I had a constant headache and cramps during that time.  A week after I started on it, I started to have heavy bleeding which lasted for several days.  The cramping returned during this as did the headache.  The worst was the emotional wreck it made me... I felt overwhelmed with decisions and life.  I felt hopeless and worthless and actually tried to break up with my partner.  This pill made me an emotional and physical wreck.  I would not recommend it.

I have had slight hair loss. This last time (I have my period the end of the pack) When  started I am just getting Hoorible heaches and nothing helps. Other than that it is doing great I am having no other problems so far. I dotn know if it is the med or if I am just head cold or something. But if anyone can help or give advice. that would be great.

I used to have periods that would be extremely heavy and could last up to 2 weeks at a time. I would also end up with a cold about a week or so before my period was to start. Now my periods last maybe 5 days at the most, and are very very light- so I'm a happy camper! Only issue I've had is that I do get cramps now the first (which I didn't get before the pill)...only lasts about 1/2 a day though and seems to be getting better every month. Other than that small thing, this pill's been very good to me :)

Other than a slight decrease in libido, I have not noticed any side affects through the 4 months that i have taken the pill. I take it at night before bed so i rarely miss a pill. It has also been very helpful in pregnancy prevention. I do not plan on changing this regiment any time soon!
Birth Control	JennKay85, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	10/4/2009 8:51:17 AM	I feel so much better reading these reviews knowing that I am not the only one experiencing some crazy symptoms.  I just started Sprintec a month ago and have experienced breast tenderness and signs of a yeast infection.  However the worst symptom of all is the way it makes me feel so crazy and out of control of my emotions.  I feel a major lack of motivation and unsatisfaction, depressed, and moody, all of which are not typical for me.  My husband said I have also been a lot grouchier.  I am going tomorrow to talk to my doctor about switching.  I switched from Yaz because of its high cost and also all of the lawsuits going on with it, but I will pay more for a good pill if that means none of these terrible side effects!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/25/2009 1:21:57 PM	I am just finishing up my second month on Sprintec and I have no complaints.  With the other pill I was on I had headaches all the time, but none with Sprintec.  I do get some slight breast tenderness on the first day of a new pack, but that goes away quickly.  I gained a little bit of weight during the first month, nothing terrible, but I've already lost it.  I used to have bad cramping, but now it's gone away completely.  Overall, I would recommend Sprintec.

I do have terrible PMS for about 5 days before my period, but it's not as bad as it was before I started taking Sprintec. I switched from the Sprintec Lo since I was having so much breakthrough bleeding, and overall I've been very happy.I will agree with many that I gained about 4-5 pounds (mostly in my hips and lower tummy) the first month, but I've lost that weight now!You have to give it a couple of months for your body to get adjusted!!!

Was taking Yaz unless the price with thru the roof. I never got periods before which I was fine with, no acne, no cramps, etc. I am a very active person and assumed I thats why I didn't get periods, plus the Yaz.  Well let me tell you, I hate this pill. I have bewen bleeding all 21 days, with cramps, I am breaking out, mooody, tired, depressed and retaining water.  As a fitness person and personal trainer, this is not good with me at all. I need to feel my best for others!  Help!  Does anyone have any recommendations for me to try next week?
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	9/11/2009 2:09:11 PM	I've been on this pill for almost six months (starting the 6th pack this weekend). I hate it. I have nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to smells, moodiness, tender breasts... you name it. My boyfriend swears I'm pregnant. I've taken 3 home test and even gone to the doctor's office and taken a pregnancy test there. All of which are negative. I hate feeling this way. I loved being on yasmin but I changed insurances and I can't afford it right now. I can't wait to go back!!!
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	9/11/2009 12:10:28 PM	I took this medication for about 6 months.  The side effects were not so bad except that it caused excessive hairloss.  It took me a while to figure out that the medication was causing it, but i eventually talked to my doctor about it (who i don't think beleived me at first) and i switched to something else.  The hairloss stopped immediately.  I'm guessing this is one of those side effects that only occurs in a small portion of patients but be aware...it happens.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	4	1	Female	25-34	9/11/2009 11:29:40 AM	I began taking this 6 weeks ago as a lower-cost alternative to my previous birth control. It was definitely not worth the saved money. I have felt like I'm having an out-of-body experience while on Sprintec. Lack of motivation, anxiety, depression, not to mention gaining 5 lbs around my midsection. I would not recommend Sprintec to anyone. 
Birth Control	kpharm87, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	13-18	9/8/2009 10:52:46 PM	I have been on this pill for 3 weeks now. It has done a wonderful job at clearing up my acne. I used to break out mildly on my face, and sometimes the tops of my shoulders and chest but it has cleared up completely. However, for the first 2 weeks on the pill, I had VERY severe mood swings. I went from being happy to very very angry in 2 seconds flat and sometimes I would get really depressed and cry for no reason. Also, my appetite has definitely increased. I've put on about 5 lbs. Within the last couple of days my mood swings have seemed to be getting better. I plan on waiting maybe another week or two to see if the symptoms ease up. If they don't I plan on switching. The mood swings are the WORST!
Birth Control	4bamamas, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	9/8/2009 2:03:10 PM	This is the first type of birth control I have been on and have been taking Sprintec for almost a month.  since I have taken this pill I feel like I am going crazy!  I experience over the top mood swings, uncontrollable crying episodes, and extreme lack of motivation.  I am always tired and have a hard time sleeping at night.  My whole body itches all the time (it drives me even more nuts!!!) and I have had an increased appetite since taking this pill which makes weight loss impossible!   I can't wait to switch pills so I can be myself again not only for my sanity but for my husband and children!
Birth Control	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	13-18	9/7/2009 1:34:01 AM	i've only been taking this pill for a little over a week and i'm not sure what to think yet. the first few days, i had severe cramping and my boyfriend couldn't even touch my body without it hurting. i have to say, the cramping has gone down a lot now. but the past couple days i have had severe tenderness in my breasts. i put on my bra this morning, and my breasts almost didn't fit in it. i've felt shakey and weak a lot and i'm not as excited for sex anymore. before i was on the pill, my weight was below average and my breasts were smaller than average. gaining some weight in my chest area is the only plus i've seen so far. also, my acne on my forehead is not getting any better. it's embarrassing. if my acne doesn't go away or if my breasts don't stop hurting, i will most likely stop taking this pill.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Bootsie, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	9/3/2009 2:37:16 PM	Have had painful, heavy, long periods that continued to get worse over past year.  This medication has taken care of all of these problems.  However, I have gained 15 unexplained pounds since starting the medication and can't seem to lose it even though I hadn't changed anything.
Birth Control	Jessicaa!, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	9/2/2009 5:01:43 AM	the only reason i went on this pill is to get rid of cysts. yet it didnt. but it didnt make me emotional or anything i just get headaches alot. and my chest grew ALOT!
Birth Control	kalund, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	3	1	Female	19-24	8/31/2009 12:26:16 PM	I have been on Sprintec since February of 2008.  I was engaged at the time and wanted to go on birth control before I was married.  Almost immediately, I felt like a completely different person.  I over-analyzed everythin and became depressed.  Not to mention I gained about 5 pounds.  I was so depressed and down that I called off my wedding to the love of my life.  I am still on it and am getting off because I am constantly moody and have times of depression that are so bad I think of hurting myself.  DO NOT TAKE THIS BIRTH CONTROL!!  It is worth it to spend a little more money and be happy.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	8/28/2009 6:14:27 PM	This bc sucked! I have never had such bad headaches until I started taking this medicine.
Birth Control	aaminaa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	8/28/2009 10:59:45 AM	I was very disappointed with the side effects of this drug.  I have never experienced such negative ones when taking birth control and I have been on birth control for some time.  I constantly felt as though I was going through PMS - very bloated and a lot of tenderness i breasts and abdominal area.  I gained 5lbs out the gate and have felt uncomfortable and extremely moody since starting the drug.  I also noticed that my skin began to become greasy and I developed cystic acne.  I am 33 years old and have not had skin problems in over 15 years.  This drug has very adverse side effects (at least for me) and it probably the worst that I have ever experienced.  It was effective in the fact that I did not get pregnant, but the level of discomfort simply aren't worth it.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/26/2009 9:31:53 PM	I started this pill a week ago and I've been bleeding not to mention passing blood clots really bad ever since. I have severe nausea and headaches galore.Im suppose to be taking this pill to regulate my cylce but its still in full effect. My sex life is suffering because Im not in the mood lately... Don't take this pill..
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	8/24/2009 10:04:06 PM	I've been on Sprintec since the beginning of '09.  I am about to call the doctor and get it switched!!! Due to my insurance not covering my LoEstrin, I had to switch to the cheapo Sprintec that has made me nothing but an emotional and depressed wreck!!! Not to mention, I put on some weight and am having the hardest time losing it even w/diet and exercise!!!  Also, the breakthrough bleeding sucks as well!! Highly DO NOT recommend! I'm switching ASAP!
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	8/23/2009 1:34:29 AM	Im 19 and started taking sprintec three weeks ago.Its my first time on the pill and i hate it. I thought there was something wrong with me, but after reading these reviews I realize theres something wrong with sprintec. I began taking it for mild acne I wanted to clear, but also because I just started to be sexually active with my boyfriend. My skin has gotten worse, its dry and flaky. Not to mention the 5 pimples that pop up every day. Today, i had to wear a pad all day because I was spotting.. thats disgusting. I have had the worst cramps and headaches which make me unable to sleep. I cant believe this pill is on the market. Im going off it as soon as possible, and would never recommend it to any sane woman. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	8/22/2009 12:10:28 AM	Extreme nausea, headaches, dizziness, always tired, moody as hell, crying for no reason, rash on my face that seems to clear up while im on the inactive pills. Severe breast tenderness and actually have milk coming from my right nipple, so happy to see that I'm not alone!! Absolutely WOULD NOT reccomend this bc to anyone.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	8/15/2009 7:28:21 PM	I've been taking Sprintec for over a month and I have been very pleased. I am not taking it for birth control so can't vouch for that...I was having PMDD symptoms but they are less severe now.  My face has been breaking out a bit more than normal but not enough to stop taking it.  As far as the nausea-I take it at night so I just sleep it off...Overall it has been a good choice for me.
Birth Control	KRNAV, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	8/10/2009 8:06:38 PM	The first few months on this pill were ok. I'm in my late 20's and havent had a problem with acne since I was 16 or so. SO it worked in the sense that I havent gotten pregnant, but for the last few months I have been so broken out like I was a teenager again! I also have been very moody. Wouldnt recommend this to anyone.
Birth Control	RadRachel, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	8/9/2009 7:28:20 PM	I have been on this pill for well over a year now, and I have not had one problem with it.  Yes, the first month I did have some serious cramps but that was simply because my body was finally starting to regulate, but once onto the second month things were fine.  I have had no decrease on my sex drive and my relationship with my boyfriend has remained wonderful, and baby free :D I would recommend this pill to anyone (and ontop of that its cheap)
Birth Control	whoknows, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/8/2009 5:56:11 PM	I did feel a little sick to my stomach for a few days after starting this pill. But other than that it's a really good drug. Haven't had any change in my sexual desire either. 
Birth Control	Nicoliie88, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	8/3/2009 12:49:11 PM	I've been on this pill for over a year and a half now, And I have very mixed reviews on it. It's great for preventing pregnancy, I've had no problems with that. The downside to this pill is the PMS a few days prior. It's horrible. I thought it was only me getting it until I read these reviews. I get uncontrollable rage, and become very depressed. Its almost ridiculous. I can't say I would recommend this pill to others. For prevention is works perfectly, but the mood swings and rage is just not worth  it.
Other	lexdyl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	25-34	8/1/2009 8:33:10 PM	i hace been on this birth control for about 3 months now. th first month i took it I had terrible nausia. About a week before I was suppose to take my white pills I started to bleed. I have no sex drive. I have mood swings. I also have IBS and ever since I started taking Sprintec my stomach hurts all the time. It feels like I've been living off  of Rolaids for the past month. I do however get irregular bleeding/spotting for a day or so. But I'm not pregnant so I guess it is working out in that department.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	susie9asia,  Female 	1	5	1	Female		7/29/2009 11:24:50 PM	my doctor put me on this to put my periods back to normal because i had polyops in my uterus which caused very heavy bleeding for for over 3 months straight. they have been removed. i am on this pill, and i don;t like it, i am bleeding heavier have not stopped. i feel so tired and cold all the time.  i have never taken the pill before, it makes me feel depressed. i am gonna have to switch to another pill, this one does not work
Birth Control	disappointingpill, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/27/2009 5:18:44 PM	This pill is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  I have been on this pill for 3 weeks.  I have non-stop cramping and nausea.  This morning I woke up and couln't even stand up without feeling like I was gonna pass out for the first 3 hours.  I have felt depressed and moody for about a week now and extremely bloated.  I am done taking this pill as of now.  
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	:(Sad all the time):, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	7/23/2009 12:02:50 PM	My doctor prescribed Sprintec after I had surgery to remove a large cyst from one of my ovaries. The pill was supposed to prevent new cysts from forming. First of all, I was nausous and throwing up EVERY night for about the first 2 months and had random periods for several months. Acne has not only worsened on my face, but I have it on my chest and back really bad. I also experience outbursts of crying and strange mood swings, as well as some depression and anxiety symptoms (not fun). I have no sex drive and my boyfriend thinks I'm just not interested in him anymore, which makes me sad. I still get pain where the cyst was removed, and I am almost sure that I am still getting them. I am ready to get my life back and I am tired of being down and then anxious all the time.. it's like a rollercoaster. Condoms are just going to have to be enough because I am never taking any birth control pill again.
Birth Control	FutureDrSmith13, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/22/2009 3:05:13 AM	I've been on this for about 4 months now for birth control purposes and I haven't had any severe problems. I had mild acne before and now it has cleared up. The only problem I ever had was moderate nausea during the first week of starting a new pack, for the first 2 months. It's not really hard to remember to take the pill at the same time because I set my cell phone alarm to remind me if I forget and my ob/gyn explained that as long as you take it within 1-2 hours of the same time everyday good enough. Overall I'm very satisfied with taking Sprintec, and the inexpensive price doesn't hurt either!
Birth Control	Lori, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	7/19/2009 6:36:46 PM	I took this for a few month's and it made my blood pressure increase. I've always had normal blood pressure. It caused to swell and retain fluids. My breast were very tender. I gained alittle weight and my period was like every 3 weeks. So, I quit taking it. I would not recommend it. My blood pressure has been normal since I've stopped taking it.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Hopeful Bride, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	7/19/2009 12:46:49 AM	I started taking this medication because I have always had very irregular periods that were long &amp; heavy. My gyno put me on this drug to help the length &amp; intensity of my periods.  Also, I wanted to get on the medication because my wedding was upcoming and I didn't want to have a surprise period on my wedding day.  The first month I started to bleed after the 1st week of pills &amp; bled for 3 weeks straight.  After a consultation with my dr. They told me to stop for 4 days &amp; 'jump-start' my system &amp; try again.  Long story short I did have bleeding on my wedding day.  As time has progressed I've noticed my periods are more regular, not lining up with the pills exactly but I am having a period every month unlike before where it would be months at a time.  My periods are shorter only 5 days instead of the 8-10 before and they are lighter than they were before.  I haven't had acne problems or headaches.  I have realized as of late that I have been experience insane mood swings &amp; after the end of each pack I have a 3-6 day depression.  I have decided to try this medication for another 2 months if the depression continues I will be switching to another form of oral birth control.
Birth Control	jenny, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	7/16/2009 6:41:43 PM	I started taking Sprintec 3 months ago. For the first couple weeks I experienced some mild nausea, and I got headaches pretty often. After the first month and a half, all of my side effects went away. I may have gained about 3-4 pounds from it though, because nothing has changed in my diet since I started taking Sprintec. It so far has worked for me with preventing pregnancy.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	7/12/2009 10:23:20 PM	I have been taking Sprintec for a year and for the most part I have been happy with it.  It did help clear up my acne, and thus far it has prevented pregnancy.  However, I do experience a lot of spotting and tend to get yeast infections more frequently.  Also, it doesn't really help with reducing cramps.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	7/5/2009 11:30:14 PM	This drug has been horrible for me.  I feel like I'm pregnant with bad &quot;morning sickness&quot;, lethargy, and bloating.  I look like I'm pregnant (normally I'm very thin) because I'm so bloated.  I'm exhausted all the time and nauseous most of the day.  I feel slightly depressed and have no energy.  Usually I'm very active and happy but this drug has made me grumpy and tired.  I just threw it in the trash!  I'd rather have heavy bleeding (reason it was prescribed) than deal with all of those horrible side effects!
Painful Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	7/4/2009 6:45:56 PM	I have been taking this pill for a month, mainly to help with cramps during my period, but also to prevent pregnancy. I just got my first period while on the pill and although I did have some pain in the first few hours, it was minimal and went away quickly. Also, I have not gotten pregnant. I have not had trouble with this pill like so many others have. I did experience severe breast tenderness for the first couple of weeks and my mood may have changed slightly, but nothing drastic. My skin has stayed the same. Although many others have had issues, this pill is working great for me. I would recommend anyone try it and if doesn't work, switch. That's the case with many medicines these days.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/27/2009 12:47:11 AM	Easily tired some times. But other than that it is very effective and easy to take, as long as you remember to take it on time every day! I was scared after I read all these reviews, but I have had a pretty good experience with it. 
Birth Control	NoBabiesPlease, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/23/2009 4:48:15 PM	The first couple of months I had some pretty sever nausea for a few hours each day for the first week of the pack.  But its regulated my cycle, cleared my skin issues, and I haven't gained any weight or experienced any change in libido.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	Mook526, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	6/21/2009 12:05:23 AM	This has been the worse experience of my life. This is my first birth control and I have only been taking it going on my 3rd week. My breast are tender as hell. I feel like I want to vomit all the time. I feel like a water buffalo. From the first few days I started it after I went off my cycle, I had diahrrea right away. My cravig for food has been rediculous. I eat everything, even to the point I thought I was pregnant. I have these bumps on my face...never had bumps every. I was excited about taking birth control but this is just not working. I do not recommend this to ANYONE. Yes its only 7 dollars at Walmart but its just not worth it.
Birth Control	dsfniofiejw, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/19/2009 10:42:14 AM	I've read alot about this pill before taking it. By the reviews, I was almost afraid to take it. Knowing it works differently for everyone, I decided to give it a go. I've been on this pill for 4 months now. Expecting to experience side-effects, I've had none. (Maybe it's because I take it every day; on time, every time.) I also get my periods every month, 2 days after I start the in-active pills. This is a plus because there'd be months it'd be absent. It works for me &amp; I recommend it. Plus, it's cheap. $27 for a three month supply, or $9 a month.
Birth Control	JCMOM, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	6/16/2009 1:22:26 PM	I started taking this drug in the place of &quot;yaz&quot; because my doc said it was cheaper and I've already noticed a dramictic change in my sex drive and overall mood.  It seems I have an uncontrolable rage and no desire to have sex.  Doc says I have to finish to pack before changing to a different pill though.  I would not recommend this.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/15/2009 7:03:37 AM	I have never been on any type of birth control ever in my life. I decided now to start. My gyn suggested this brand that she uses. I took the first pill and by an hour I had severe nausea. By two hours I had a severe migraine. By the end of the day I felt my heart was racing. Light headed, sensitive to light and sound, exhausted. I definitely did not take the pill the next day. I still felt this till the evening of the next day. I guess I'm one of my gyn's patients that had the severe and dangerous side effects. I'm upset that I'm most likely now out the $ I paid for 3 months worth of  birth control.

The NAUSEA is the worst, I have had 2 babies and never even had morning sickness to this extent!! I am not taking it one more day, I am miserable and feel like I have had the flu since the day I started taking it. STAY AWAY!!!!!
Birth Control	Victorian, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	6/6/2009 12:36:03 AM	I started taking this pill b/c I already have three children and was not ready for anymore. I began taking it in march of 09 and now in June of 09 I am pregnant. I had terrible acne and swollen breasts. I lost all desire to have sex at all. Plus the fact that I am out the money I spent on the pills for a product that didn't do it's job.
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	6/1/2009 5:16:27 PM	I've only been on this pill for a month. And as the saying goes it definitely must work differently on different people. My only problem is remember a pill haha. But other than that, I have had no side effects. Nothing what so ever has occurred differently with me. I'm just wondering if anyone can help me out knowing when I should get my first period after taking Sprintec because I haven't gotten one so far. Thanks! And, I definitely recommend this pill. No problems with it at all! (For me that is!)

Endometriosis	Ann, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	5/30/2009 2:53:44 PM	I've just started it after the first three weeks on Mononessa, just because I switched to another pharmacy and they gave me these instead of Mononessa and they are supposed to work the same. I was diagnosed with Adenomyosis and Endometriosis. I had horrible painful periods which would take me to emergency room. Now I don't have my periods because I dont use the placebos. But the problem is I have started to have some cramps and spotting which makes me think what the point of taking these is?! I was complaining of pain and now I totally lost my periods but then I am not comfortable either. Also my mood has changed a lot and I feel depressed all the time, I can start crying any second... I feel impotence and I want to call to my doctor to make another decision. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	5/28/2009 11:45:23 PM	I went on this birth control to help regulate my hormones.  I have been on it for about 6 months, and have just realized that I was suffering from the symptoms without realizing they were connected to the pill!  Over these 6 months I suffered form the nausea, change in appetite, vaginal discharge, headaches, being tired, and low libido.  I've also been suffering from mood swings and anxiety/panic.  Turns out the stuff can lead  to panic disorder!  These are too many side effects to continue.  Seek out a different pill.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	5/28/2009 12:29:45 PM	I started this pill March 09 and had horrible side effects; acne, mood swings, depression, spotting, breast tenderness for 2 weeks STRAIGHT before my period. I recently stopped taking it b/c I was tired of feeling the way I did. It has been a week since being off of them and I feel horrible. I am moody/depressed, tired and just don't feel like my happy go luck self. I am ready to feel normal again. I am not sure what pill will work for me, but Sprintec was not it.  I hope this helps.
Birth Control	Jess, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	5/28/2009 12:03:33 PM	I have been on this pill for over a year and I really didn't have any problems with it until recently. I have experienced excessive sweating in every situation, cold, hot, nervous, you name it. Also, I have started to get acne quite bad which I have never experienced. Another recent problem I have experienced is that when I tan my upper lip gets darker than the rest of my face. Not normal! I am planning on switching off this pill but the cost factor is hard to leave.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	5/27/2009 7:48:29 PM	I couldn't handle the side-effects of this drug. After only a short time on this drug, I had tender swollen breasts, cramps, and began to get moody and even depressed. In addition, my sex-drive vanished. Based on my own experience, I would not recommend this drug to others.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	5/26/2009 1:47:22 PM	I could not continue using Sprintec because the side effects were too overwhelming. I had breast tenderness, cramping, headaches, AWFUL nausea, vomiting, and I was the grumpiest person you'd ever met. The price is the only thing this pill has going for it...but then again, you get what you pay for.
Birth Control		5	5	1			5/25/2009 9:11:00 PM	I was put on this birth control after not being on the pill for about a year. After 4 months of mental breakdowns, my boyfriend begged me to get off of it.  We were fighting and I almost broke up with him multiple times for no reason.  I had awful gas, mood swings, horrible cramps, couldn't climax at all, and this all-over itchy feeling.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who like there life.
Birth Control	tahila, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	5/15/2009 6:41:01 PM	I started taking this pill because my insurance no longer covers birth control. The pill works but the side effects have been terrible for me. My breasts are very tender and retaining alot of water. I also have gained about 20 pounds. I have been on this pill now for about 5 months and have been on birth control pills for about 12 years. This is by far the worst one I have tried. Hope there is an alternative pill for the same price.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/9/2009 9:16:12 AM	I have only been using Sprintec for one month but have used it in the past for longer periods of time.  I have always suffered from severe pms symptoms that are almost completely alleviated by taking this drug.  My periods are shorter and lighter, my cravings are decreased, my bloating is reduced and my sex drive has stayed the same.  I would definitly recommend this birth control to anyone looking. 
Birth Control	vmc107, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	5/3/2009 3:11:37 PM	Ive been on 3 different birth controls since I've started using oral contraceptives. This has got to be the worst of the 3 that I've used. MASSIVE migraines, mood swings like crazy, tired all the time, my eyes become very sensitive to light and endless nausea. Lets not even talk about the large amount of acne that I had. I thought that it was just the usual stress of life; however, I stopped taking them and haven't had any of the symptoms since. Needless to say, I went to my doctor immediately and demanded to be put on a different contraceptive.
Abnormal Bleeding from the Uterus	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	4/30/2009 10:24:55 PM	took it for a week and retained so much fluid that my shoes wouldn't fit right, mood swings, lack of sex drive, trouble sleeping.  Read the who should not use list and my doctor should never have even thought of this med for me. Will be finding a better doc and never taking this med again
Birth Control	sublime_gurl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	4/30/2009 12:28:46 PM	This pill is horrible! I'd have these crazy mood swings, my sex drive was decreasing, and I had this weird gas pain that wouldn't go away. This pill also made me have lots of diarriha. I stopped taking them and no pain, no mood swings, no nothing.. I feel like myself. Do not take these!
Endometriosis	Megster, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	4/29/2009 2:33:31 PM	I found out that I had Endometriosis a few months ago and the pain was so horrible that most of the time I was be in bed, stooped over, or either in the fetal postion. After my OBGYN put me on this type of birth control I was able to do things I wasn't able to do pain free!
Birth Control	lovelit, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/28/2009 12:56:12 PM	Horrible acne.Early and continual period. Ruins sex.Ridiculous mood swings - my boyfriend and I haven't gone more than 24 hrs without fighting, always a result of me crying or getting upset.I'm switching. Screw my healthcare providers for setting me up with the cheapest birth control ever.

Birth Control	Kaikie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	4/27/2009 11:25:08 PM	I started this last month because it was cheaper than my previous one and I haven't had any problems with it. I have had some mood swings but I've had alot of stressful exams lately so its hard to say it was the pill. My period was actually lighter this first month I've taken it. Other than that I haven't had any other symptoms. Overall pretty good for the money. 
Birth Control	MzTopModel, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	19-24	4/25/2009 8:37:56 PM	I've been on this med for almost a month. I've experienced breast tenderness, a yeast infection, a bigger appetite, I'm moody as hell, and strangly my sex drive is higher. My doctor put me on this med because my period hasn't come as of yet, hopefully this med will make it come down. I haven't really had a problem with weight gain because I go to the gym frequently. One big plus about this pill is that my breast has grow and looks awesome! Boy oh boy am'I a hottie because of Sprintec (LOL). I hope no outrageous side affects occur in the future....looking at the past review comments are scaring me.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	4/24/2009 10:11:17 AM	This pill was prescribed as a generic to me for the Lo-ovral. I had the most intense mood swings, and thought I was literally going crazy. My boyfriend and I fought for the three days I let myself be on this, before I went to my Dr. and demanded a different pill. My boyfriend and I now refer to this pill as my crazy pill. My advice, do not even mess with it, even if your Dr. tries to push it on you. 
Birth Control	a, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	4/23/2009 10:52:08 PM	I've been on this pill for about a year now. I switched to this because it's cheap.  But now i'm starting to realize that my SEX DRIVE IS GONE.  
Birth Control	mad, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/23/2009 10:33:40 AM	It works. I didn't get pregnant, but it also greatly decreased my sex drive. I took it for over a year and didn't realize until I went off of it to get pregnant...that it had be giving me diarrhea. I thought I had become lactose intolerant after my first child, but nope...as soon as I went off of sprintec to get pregnant again problem solved. I was so upset my doctor had convinced me it was lactose intolerance and all along it was sprintec!
Birth Control	briebrie, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	4/19/2009 11:19:09 PM	This was my first time taking the pill.  For the first 2 or 3 months, I had terrible mood swings.  The 1st month I had breakthrough bleeding and breast tenderness but after the 3rd month, everything seemed to level out. I have noticed some weight gain, but that could have been from going away to college or a combo of both.  I am in my 9th month of taking it and I am noticing that it is hard for me to lose weight.  I don't know if it is from the pill or not though. I am also getting stabbing pain in my breast but I don't know if the pill causes that or not. Also, the week before and after my period, I get a little acne, but not much.  Overall, the pill is effective in preventing pregnancy but I do have to say my sex drive has definitely lowered.  
Birth Control	Jill, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	25-34	4/18/2009 6:34:25 PM	I went on Sprintec 28 day tablets 3 weeks ago when my first period post delivery (I have a 4 month old) started.  I have been bleeding for 3 weeks.  My doctor prescribed Orthocyclen but my pharmacy gave me Sprintec without asking me if I wanted it.  I will not be using this pill again.  I know hormones are crazy after giving birth but a 3+ week long period is ridiculous!
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/30/2009 12:22:28 AM	I had been on YAZ for irregular/infrequent periods for 9 months.  That pill had put me through utter misery for the first three months, with swollen breasts, depression, no sex drive, leg pain, and constant spotting.  Then the side effects subsided, but I had a two-week period beginning the first day of the third week of active pills.  This happened every month for six months.  Finally I begged for a new pill and my OB/GYN put me on this one, which is generic Ortho-Cyclen.  The contrast with YAZ was amazing.  The first day of Sprintec I experienced nausea for about 12 hours after taking it, but that did not last, and I have had no other side effects at all this first month.  I don't expect any in the future since the first month is generally the worst.  My period so far has not started, but that's fine, because I am about to begin the placebo white pills.  I am a little surprised that so many women had terrible side effects with this pill, but what can I say, no BCP is one-size-fits-all.  It has been a very good experience for me, though, and if the pill does work well with your body, it's even better because it is so inexpensive.
Birth Control	samanthataylor, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	3/28/2009 12:01:37 AM	i have to say that i am completely satisfied with this birth control. I take ADHD medication and it has done well with it! i have been on my birth control for about a month and it has worked great. everyone has their problems with medication but overall, i have had no problems with it!
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/26/2009 10:09:22 PM	So far, I have had no problems taking this.No side effects.In fact, I have started to feel better.  I was on ortho cyclen about five years ago and never had any problems.
Birth Control	Sore Boobies, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/25/2009 11:24:02 AM	This birth control is HORRIBLE! ! I have only been on it a month, but I have terrible mood swings, depression and sore breasts.  Since it's only $9.00/month - I guess you get what you paid for.  I will be switching back to Yaz!  It's more expensive but worth it! ! 
Birth Control	Cldia, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/17/2009 9:08:45 AM	I have been on this pill for about 2 years now and I've never had any problems with it. It has worked really well for me the whole time.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	19-24	3/16/2009 12:10:26 AM	I've been taking this pill for about a year now, and I have to say it has made me a basket case, constantly on an emotional roller coaster.  Just recently I've also developed severe nasuea and stomach pain.  Bust most importantly I think it has wrecked me emotionally every month.  No weight gain, change in sex drive, and it is effective in preventing pregnancy. Everyone reacts differently, but I am so excited to switch off this pill!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	3/9/2009 8:11:42 AM	I switched from YAS to this pill because it is so much cheaper, but I'm ready to go back. I have always had horrible cramps and week long periods, and was told this would help with that and also dissolve my ovarian cysts. It was AWFUL! I was told to take it continuously so I would never have a period. Every woman's dream right? Well it had completely the opposite effect. I was having a period every week. 5 days on, 2 off. And they were so heavy I was going through an ultra tampon every hour. Cramps worse than ever before. I was so sick to my stomach and in so much pain I could hardly get out of bed. I lost so much weight simply because I couldn't eat cause every time I tried I got so nauseous. I couldn't even stand the smell of food without feeling sick. As far as preventing pregnancy, that worked. But when you're on your period that much you can't have sex. I can't orgasm anymore. It didn't help with my cysts, either. This is the worst pill to take. Spend the extra money on something that works. They need to just get rid of this one. It's not even worth its discounted price. 
Birth Control	Nikole, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/4/2009 8:47:06 PM	This pill has been amazing for me. It has actually completly cleared up my acne and improved my moodiness. I've experienced no cramps or nausa, and have faced nothing but improvements...
Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	kk, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	3/2/2009 3:48:50 PM	Ihave been taking this pill for almost 3 weeks now and i dnt like it. I started taking it from the first day of my period and i have had spotting ever since ive had cramps and I feel nauseous at times even tenderness in my breast and my vagina.  This pill is horrible for me and im changing.
Endometriosis	UTCleopatra, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	2/23/2009 2:54:59 PM	Sprintec was great for me - except after about 8 months or so, I started having break-through bleeding. The breakthrough lasted for up to 3 months on and off at one point. I am now on Levlen, which has been great except for major acne breakouts! I just can't find a monophasic that works for the long haul. I feel like I switch pills every 12-18 months.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	2/16/2009 11:57:25 PM	This pill has been a nightmare. It has given me severe mood swings, weeping spells, and depression. My face has broken out and bloating has occured. Please use this as a last resort! 
Other	baud, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/13/2009 12:20:50 AM	I've apparently had a hormone imbalance that has made most of my post-pubescent life a living hell! As soon as I began taking Sprintec I was happier, less moody, nicer to my loved ones, and felt the drive to actually take care of myself. I take my pill before I go to bed to sleep through any immediate side effects. I do notice some nausea if I don't get enough sleep, but taking it before bed really made the difference between intolerable side effects that I had on Sprintec the first time (took it at 2 pm). 
Birth Control	Spoofers, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	2/10/2009 9:54:10 PM	I'm on my 2nd pack of this birth control and have vomited twice in the last three weeks and have had a low sex drive. I too, switched for the price but I'm going back to Ortho Tri-cyclen Low. Sprinte should be banned-it's not a good birth control.
Other	mouse, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	2/8/2009 12:26:34 AM	I have been on pills before and this one is BAD,i started it 4 days ago and I feel sick,on and off all the time,i can't eat,its like i have the FLU but i don't.I feel like ####.. YAZ is much better it don't make you sick. for 9.00 they can keep it.i have not had pain like this  (well)when i had my son..Back and should pain,sick,legs hurt,chest pain.
Birth Control	Rose, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/2/2009 1:56:27 PM	After reading the posts about this drug, I was afraid to see the reactions I'd have. But I have not had one side effect that anyone has posted. A little nausea the first 3 days or so, but that was expected. Since then (3 months ago) I've been completely fine.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	19-24	1/29/2009 11:42:39 PM	Ive only been on this pill for a week and a half and i HATE it!!!!! I always feel sick to my stomach and like i'm going to get sick at any time, i also have breast tenderness, headaches, very emotional,crying spells, vomitting,unable to sleep well.........i 'm starting to think i'm pregnant!!!  I'm pretty sure i'm not going to be able to handle taking this pill much longer.....did i mention how much  I HATE THIS PILL!!!!!!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	1/21/2009 1:29:17 AM	I would rather be pregnant than on this pill. I feel like I am on an emotional roller coaster. I am constantly tired, depressed, and nauseas. I have been on this pill for 3 months trying to stick it out but symptoms have only gotten worse. It was successful in preventing pregnancy due to the fact my libido was drastically decreased. This pill just isn't for me.
Birth Control		5	5	4			1/16/2009 4:57:18 PM	I must say that I've been on this pill for almost 3 years and have had no problems with it, I actually switched from another bran to this one! I never had cramping before birth control and don't have any now, it's actually helped me be less moody before my period, and helped me not only loose weight, but help maintain it too.  I did used to spot before any birth control and with my first two pills, but not with this one, and it's made my periods a little bit lighter.  It's the same price as my previous pills, my only concern now (which has not really been looked into yet) is that I have had awful scalp psoriasis and it's spreading to the rest of my body, for about 3 years and am not sure if it is related to this or not, as it is the only same variable for that amount of time.  I would suggest trying it, and if you're not happy, change it.
Birth Control	asapal, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	1/16/2009 1:09:41 AM	I've taken other birth control pills and never had a problem.  I decided to try Sprintec, because it it one of the $9 per month prescriptions offered at pharmacies.  I've been taking it as it is directed for the past 8 months and still continue to heavily spot every month.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/13/2009 7:47:53 PM	Although it did prevent pregnancy, there were a lot of unstated side effects.  Like others, I have become very emotional, moody, low sex drive, tiredness, and weight gain.  I have been on three other types of pills, and this is by far the worst with 'everyday' issues.  I cannot wait to go back to my OB-GYN and get on a new pill.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	1/9/2009 12:40:01 PM	I've been taking this pill for a little under 3 months. I've had massive mood swings and breast tenderness. I am switching to another pill after this pack. I do not recommend using this pill!! My fiance and I call it my &quot;crazy&quot;...
Birth Control		5	4	2			1/8/2009 10:54:28 AM	I began taking sprintec in october. I immediately started to get headaches quite often. I never got headaches before. I have not gained weight, but rather lost 5 ibs. But I also work out and eat extremely healthy. I have had break-thru bleeding for a full month now. That is no fun. As well as loosing my sex drive at times. The product works, but the side effects are awful. Downfall, it is cheap. But if it means stopping all these headaches, then I may stop taking it.
Birth Control	blsr1205, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/5/2009 10:54:19 AM	This medication has helped me from getting pregant. Only thing that I don't like is when my peroid starts, I have very bad cramps. 
Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	lynn spi nn, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	13-18	1/3/2009 7:55:49 PM	so far iv've been on sprintec for about 2 months and daily i feel nausious, get headaces, and blurred vission. on the conterary my hairs been growing and i have no more acne
Other	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	12/27/2008 9:29:57 PM	I have always been a very happy go lucky type of person. While taking this, although cheap, I felt depressed and I had horrible pms. I never normally got it bad before, but I was down in the dumps and crabby as ever. I have switched, we will see what happens.
Birth Control	13-18 Female 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	12/27/2008 3:57:27 AM	This birth control worked very well for  me.  The first month however I missed my period and had stomach cramping on occasion, but after the first month I had no problems with it.  It's affordable and effective.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	lilsweety22, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	12/22/2008 11:30:59 AM	I began taking this medication 3 months ago, and the 2nd day of taking it I got nauseous. Ever since that day, I have not experienced any bad side effects. I think the nausea came from taking it on an empty stomach. I have been taking it with food, and I have been just fine. My cycle comes like clock work now, better than they had ever been because I was use to having one every 2 months. I would say overall this medication works for me.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	12/21/2008 5:28:24 PM	Ive taken one other brand of birth control that had no effect on me at all, this brand however at certain points of the day makes me nauseous, does give me head aches and cramping. Also vaginal discomfort is one of the biggest things i noticed with no sexual activity change i experienced pain
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/18/2008 8:22:32 PM	Cheap, no side effects other than missing my first period, which is normal. I've been on it for about 1 year.
Absence of Menstrual Periods	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	19-24	12/17/2008 1:15:30 AM	i switched from ortho tricyclin last month to sprintec and i did not start my period on time. i have only had irregular spotting for the past 2 1/2 weeks since ive started this bc. im not sure if this is normal or not. i have had constant nausea &amp; severe headaches since i started this bc.

It was terrible it just kept coming in! Also, I would get sick at the end of every 28 days, I would feel so sick I wouldn't want to go out.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	25-34	12/11/2008 10:31:02 AM	I have been on several types of BC.  This one takes the cake as the worse one.  My face broke out in full-blown acne. This is coming from a person who has never had acne.  This drug is very cheap, and I did not get pregnant on it...but that is about it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	12/8/2008 1:43:59 AM	At first, I had difficulty with breast tenderness and nausea, but this was the first birth control medicine I had ever tried. After a few months my body did adjust; however, I have experienced weight gain. I'm not sure if it is due to the medicine or to college eating habits. Possibly both. Overall, it is cheap and effective for its purpose.
Endometriosis	huskylover, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	11/2/2008 9:36:52 PM	I just want to know if anyone out there who has taken this pill has experienced tender/growing breasts.  I've only taken 2 months worth and the past month has been very painful.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	12/4/2008 2:53:31 PM	I've been taking the pill for a few months now and I've noticed a total change from my last pill. Complete loss of sex drive! Sore breasts, not to mention nausea as well. My acne did improve slightly.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	11/18/2008 11:51:49 PM	I have was on the same birth control for 9 years and I recently switched to sprintec for insurance reasons. I have definitely noticed a weight gain. About 10 pounds in one month. I have not changed anything else in my daily routine and my weight usually doesnt vary. Other than that I have had a few headaches. I will be switching very soon. 
Birth Control	ivyleague1970, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	10/27/2008 2:27:25 PM	I took the Sprintec Birth Control Pills for 3 and &#189; years. I started taking it one month after my first daughter was born to prevent unwanted pregnancy. It worked. I never got pregnant. But what didnt work is all the side effects that come with it. My OB/GYN never told me about any of this. He prescribed it and that was it. I didnt know one little tiny pill could wreck so much havoc in my life. I was depressed, very moody, irritatable, low libido and could not loose weight. I thought I had post-pardum all this time. I was tired all of the time. I was very, very emotional. I would cry at the drop of a hat. My husband thought I was crazy and we separated. I was seeing a psychiatrist for depression and they prescribed anti-depressants, which I didnt take. Nothing I did could lift this fog on my brain. It wasnt until I stopped taking the pill while my husband and I were separated, that I felt normal again. I felt like my old self. My sex drive came back. My husband noticed it immediately, I finally got my wife back! I will never take the pill again! It is not worth it. 
Other	babyface, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	10/26/2008 8:00:55 PM	Just the thought of taking this drug makes me ill......I was only able to take it for one week before I had to discontinue.  I had the mother of all headaches and the nausea.  I remember crouching on the bathroom floor and vomiting so much that at one point I was bringing up bright red blood....sorry to all you squeamish.  I would prefer to undergo a hysterectomy rather that take one more tablet.  This BCP is AWFUL and the nausea is out of this world. Cheap is not always good.

I have experienced the nausea, bloating, painful periods, and the depression. The depression is the worst. I have also gained 12 pounds in the 2 months I have been on this med. I am definalely going to switch.

Painful Periods	ha122, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	10/14/2008 7:51:03 PM	I have been so sick, a constant headache, dizzy, and nauseous from this pill it is unbelievable.  I went to the doctor because they were afraid I was becoming anemic I was so dizzy and light headed.  I have had to miss school and work because I have been so sick from this pill and really fatigued.  Didn't realize this was why until I looked up the side effects. I have been on it for a month and a half and I am done with it.
Birth Control	MAGirl08, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	10/8/2008 8:42:57 AM	I have just finished my first pack of Sprintec and noticed that about 1 week after starting the pill I begin to get bloated and remained bloated. I've also gained 5lbs in one month and haven't changed anything in my diet or exercise plan.  I've heard that sometimes it takes your body a few months to adjust to a  newpill and then the symptoms will go away. Has anyone had these symptoms of bloating and weight gain on Sprintec and did it go away?On a positive note, I've experienced no increased acne or nausea. I've actually noticed my skin improving.
Birth Control	marsbar1122, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	10/5/2008 9:29:33 AM	OK, so I am not into taking medications, however, I don't want to get pregnant. I do not have insurance, so after trying Femcon and not being happy I switched to this medication. I have bleed more every month than I even have. I was able to lose some of the weight I gain, but have stalled. Also, I am experiencing more headache and vision changes than I did before BCP's. I am going to switch because I can not take much more of this.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	10/2/2008 1:58:40 AM	I hate this medication. I was on ortho tri-cyclin for years but my insurance changed and my new insurance doesn't cover the tri-cyclin. I am exhausted, almost lethargic, on the placebo week of this brand. I never felt this way on the tri-cyclin. 
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	9/24/2008 10:56:15 PM	I have been on this medication for three months and have experienced no improvements in my Acne. About the only thing this pill has done for me was alleviate my painful cramps- they don't hurt as bad but they last twice as long and my period seems to get longer each month I take it. I also experienced the nausea and abdominal pain that so many others have experienced. I'm going to request a different type of oral contraceptive from my doctor immediately.
Birth Control	Fed Up, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	9/24/2008 12:50:54 PM	I switched from Ortho-cyclen to Sprintec due to new insurance and affordable price of Sprintec.  I am a very active person, but seem to be gaining weight, experience breast tenderness, and experience extreme nausea when traveling by car or plane to the point I feel like I need to throw up!!As soon as my last pack it done, I am switching back to Ortho.  No one should feel like this!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	19-24	9/19/2008 5:35:41 PM	I have taken this drug for about a year. I took it after I tried having the shot which messed me up. I really hate this pill, I have mood swings, no libido, and my contacts are getting harder to wear(plus I have something wrong, I wonder if its due to the pill). I get nasea whenever I take it, like when it hits my stomach. I really hate the low libido part though. I'm considering taking something else. 
Birth Control	lovelyfae, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	13-18	9/9/2008 7:49:20 AM	i had the side effects of this medication..i had the adominal pain, the mausa and vomiting. it hasnt been fun let me tell ya!! i went to the hospital one night because of the pain in my side. my family thought maybe it was my kidneys. even the doctors thought it was saying it was possible kidney stones. so i drank alot of water..ickk..i started my period a week ahead of time so i stopped taking the pill till i could get ahold of my obgyn and ask if im to keep taking it when menstrating. i got an ok, so i took it in the morning. the whole day my side was killing me. at first i thought maybe it was just a hellish period, or passing kidney stones. later that night i looked up the side effects of this pill and found all my problems. this was just my reaction to this birth control though..next time ill be doing alot more research on a pill before i take it however!!! 
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	8/28/2008 12:40:35 PM	I took it only once, but that was enough to make me swear off it for the rest of my life. The nausea was incredible. It was very comparable to one time when I ate bad oysters. I slept for about an hour before I woke up with persistent nausea (11pm) that  I couldn't rid myself of until I finally stopped vomiting at 6am. It was one of the worst nights that I ever had in my life. If you have another means of birthcontrol, use it instead!
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4		19-24	8/16/2008 9:07:57 PM	I've been taking it for a month and a half now. It's helped my moods swings TREMENDOUSLY. BUT I noticed that during the first week or so each new pack, I get a very sensitive stomach and have diarrhea. Not for sure if this is directly related to the Sprintec. But it's the second time it's happened since starting them. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	4	1	Female	19-24	8/8/2008 12:54:51 PM	I was on Yasmin for years and decided to go with a cheaper pill. I guess you get what you pay for because after being on this for three weeks I had bloating, gas pain and weight gain. I would not recommend this pill to anyone.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	8/4/2008 9:14:37 PM	I was on Ortho Tri pill and the patch in the past, never had the nausea.  Since I started this pill, I wake up at night with nausea and have it through out the day.  I will not take this one again.

Birth Control		4	5	3			7/31/2008 11:35:04 AM	I have been taking Sprintec for 5 months. Almost every month I have had breakthrough bleeding. My doctor has switched me to Femcon.
Birth Control		4	4	1			7/31/2008 12:28:44 AM	I have been on Orthocyclen and Yasmin before with no side effects...took this only three weeks with bloating and cramping, gas pains, weight gain, breast tenderness. No mood changes and still effective, but being cheap is not worth feeling this way. Would not recommend.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	7/30/2008 11:59:37 AM	After taking this pill for three months I began to experience head aches and blurry  vision.  A couple of days later a grey spot in my eye. they thought I was getting blood clots, now sending me to specialist and took me off the medication right away. they said these are very dangerous systoms.. I have felt pretty crappy the entire time that I was on this pill. I am a non smoker  
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	25-34	7/28/2008 12:39:42 AM	This pill has been effective in preventing pregnancy, as I've been using it for about 4 1/2 mos now. However, I HATE having to take it because I get nauseous everytime I get ready to swallow the pill. I've also been much more moody than before. I've taken Ortho-Cyclen, which is supposed to be the same thing, for years &amp; never felt this type of discomfort. Even though Sprintec is cheaper, I'll be switching back. No birth control method will be effective if I have to literally force myself to take it!!! 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	7/10/2008 8:02:54 PM	Sprintec is effective in that I'm not pregnant but I've gained 6 pounds since starting it 3 months ago.  I've experienced breast tenderness but no cramps.
Birth Control	ap, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	6/26/2008 2:23:13 PM	I was previously on Yaz for 2 years, and recently switched to Sprintec because of new insureance.  I have hated every minute of the last three months.  I have NEVER had issues with cramping, headaches  or moodiness or even breast tenderness until now.  My breasts feel as if they are totally engorged and Im so bloated I questioned weather I had actually become pregnant.  Fortunately Im not, but hte side effects of this pill are horrible.  
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	6/21/2008 6:37:48 AM	I took this for the discounted price and it worked well until I got my first period on it.  I got headaches, mood swings, and tiredness.  I am mean!  I am switching back to Yasmin.
Birth Control	Bippy-Lu, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	6/17/2008 1:20:18 AM	I had taken Yaz prior to Sprintec. My Dr. recommended it because Yaz caused too many side effects. This one is just as bad but I'm going to stick it out to see if I adjust. I have awful breast tenderness. Like I'm engorged w/ milk. I have higher ab pains and I always feel like I could throw up at any point. usually subsides at night. It's all like morning sickness. Very bloated but no appetite. The breast pain is the worst!

I have none of the risk factors. Under 35, non-smoker, athletic, walk 2-3 miles/4-5 times a week, exercise daily, excellent and better than textbook lab results according to my doctor during my last physical in January 2008. After completing my 3rd month, I started having pain, cramping, swelling, and discoloration in my leg. Went to the ER. I spent 5 days in the hospital due to 3 blood clots in my upper thigh and groin area of my left leg, and a blot clot in each of my lungs. Be very careful.

I have had my period and haven't had much moodiness or the severe stomach pains I was having while on Yaz. I really like that its very inexpensive also, going from $30 a month to $4 is great!!!

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/16/2008 10:57:46 PM	I've been on Orthocyclen (the same thing as Sprintec) and now Sprintec for a year now. I experienced vomiting the very first night after I took it, but after that I had no problems except for one day after I forgot to take a pill and had to take two the next day. My periods are like clockwork now (a very nice change from before) and I had some acne on my cheeks before but it has all cleared up now. I take it at the same time each night (I set an alarm on my phone) and it's not too hard to remember. I always use an additional backup method of birthcontrol just in case, so it's been completely effective for me. Overall, I'm completely satisfied with this pill.

I do still get moody, but that is nothing compared to the pains and all the acne.
