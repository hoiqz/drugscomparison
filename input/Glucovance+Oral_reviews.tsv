I find it to work well. You just need to remember to take it 12 hours apart so not to have your numbers spike, but that's with all medication.

I need to take 1/2 of dosage of 1.25/250 so I cut tablets. However, the brand name is  no longer manufactured.  I can't take generic - I get wheezing, mucus, nasal swelling and cough from probably the coating or other stuff in pill.  Any ideas?
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	2/15/2010 12:20:27 AM	I had terrible pain and bloating of my abdomen while taking this medicine. I had to stop taking it after 3 days and it took that long again for my pain and swelling to ease. However, it did control my glucose level very well.
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Glucovance , 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	6/22/2009 5:55:23 AM	I have experienced the Glucovance tab 500mg/2.5 twice a day right at the time of my breakfast and dinner time.The dose is suggested by my Doctor. I have take this tablet from one month or so, with this I have also take two other tablets name AMARYL 1mg and glucobay 50mg. My doctor recommend these tablets to me because my blood sugar is too high 300 to 350mg/dl and my A1C range is also very poor i.e 11.2% but after taking these drugs my blood sugar level is contol very much i.e in the range of 90 to 115 in the fasting and in the range of 140 to 165 in random. The problem I have faced after taking glucovance is that my stomach is disturbed produce lot of gases in the stomach although stool is passing regularly but it is hard to pass.I Feel my head rotating.

IF TAKEN EVERY 12 HOURS IT SEEMS TO HELP CONTROL THE SUGAR LEVEL.  I HAVE HAD TO ADD JANUVIA IN THE MORNINGS NOW.  BUT THE BIGGEST FACTOR IS WATCHING WHAT YOU EAT AND QUANTITY.  I AM ALLOWED TO TAKE A SMALL BITE ONCE IN A WHILE OF SOMETHING SWEET, BUT IT USUALLY WASN'T WORTH THE SUGAR INCREASE, MUST EXERCISE IF YOU TAKE THAT BITE.

I doubt I could &quot;live&quot; without this medication, literally.  I really do try awfully hard to make sure that I keep my  diet and my blood sugar levels in check, but I know this medication always has my back.
