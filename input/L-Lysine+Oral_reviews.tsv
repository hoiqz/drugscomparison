Other	The Transporter, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/5/2011 12:16:42 PM	I get cold sores often.  L-Lysine, if taken upon first notice of a cold sore, makes it go away within 24-48 hours.  I take 2 - 1000 mg every 4 hours for the 48 hours.  That usually does the trick. 
Other	DoneWithColdSores, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/15/2011 3:59:56 PM	I use Lysine to help in the aid of healing, or pre-treatment for cold sores, or Herpes Simplex.  I always get a cold sore on my lip after having an illness or fever.  I've found that if I take a does, a high does, of Lysine, the cold sore IMMEDIATELY begins to go away!  Just recently, I had the flu and was sick for a week.  Of course, I started to get a cold sore.  I took my faithful Lysine, and it immediately started to disappear.  Two days ago, I started to get what I thought were pimples below my lips, and above my chin.  Right on the area where one ends and the other begins.  There were several small sores, very spread out, so I didn't think much of it.  They tingled just a bit, but not enough to where I would recognize them as Herpes Simplex 1.  It dawned on me yesterday that they may be Herpes.  I took Lysine last night, and the only evidence of any sores are a few dried out red spots!!!If you do take Lysine for cold sores, I hope you have the same results I had.  I don't know it if would work for Herpes Simplex 2, but it wouldn't hurt to try!  I have not taken this herbal remedy by a physician.  However, I have not been told NOT to take them, either!  Use your own discretion and common sense.  When I take it, my initial does is 1500mg.  After that, I take 1000 mg twice per day until the outbreak is completely gone.I hope this helps those that cannot afford prescriptions.  I know I can't afford them, and the outbreak would be so brief, it's not worth the cost.  Try Lysine, or L-Lysine, and see what YOUR results are!

Other	bbdoll, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/13/2010 8:30:54 PM	I have used this for years to relieve mouth sores. On day my draining sinus were giving me a sore throat. I decided that, since that was no more than another mouth irritation, I took 2k mg of l-lysine in the am and 1k in the pm. By the next day, instead of losing my voice from the throat irritation, I no longer had a problem. 
Other	me, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/2/2010 8:06:31 PM	I was having frequent mouth sores that took about 10 days to heal.  It was painful to eat, and even painful to talk.  This supplement  has reduced the mouth sores to almost none, and those that do appear, heal within two or three days.  What a tremendous relief!
Other	Tracy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/15/2010 4:46:32 PM	I take L-Lysine to help with my cold sores. I take two each morning to keep them away.  If I get one I take two in am and two in pm. Before I started taking this med. I had cold sores every month that lasted a week to two weeks.  Now I get them if I skip L-lysine or if I get very sick.  I also use tea tree oil extract on surface of cold sore to dry it very quickly!!!!
Other		5	5	5			10/2/2009 2:12:22 PM	I suffer from a skin condition called Ecezma that is caused by a food allergy. Anything with citric acid, or vitimin C will cause breakouts on my feet, hands, head and neck.  They are not attractive at all when it happens.  I started taking L-Lysine and have watched the breakouts dissapear, and can enjoy eating the foods that cause them.  The only side effects that I have noticed is that if I have strained my self at work the L-lysine works to heal the muscles quickly causing some pain as if I have worked out very heavily.
