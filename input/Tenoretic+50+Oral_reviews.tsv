High Blood Pressure	keen follower, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	55-64	8/14/2012 7:42:10 AM	Have been on this drug for close to ten years but it has not brought my blood pressure to less than 140/80. Of late the blood pressure has even gone up to more than 140/80. The positive thing is that it has kept my blood pressure at reasonable levels because I have a stuborn blood pressure.

I have hyperthyroidism and it has increased my heart rate to an average of 165bpm any regular day (without activity) First day I took it: Heart Rate @ 129!!! Second day: 96 BPM!!!Been around normal ever since. I used to take Propranolol (80mg 4x a day) and it would only bring me down to 134 at the least this Tenoretic 50mg I take once a day. Amazing

But, now I have noticed that my hair is falling out and this is one of the side effects of Tenoretic. I also feel as though I have a bit of a heart flutter every now and then. I have anxiety and this med. has really been great at keeping my heart rate down, but I don't like the side effects.  Of course the anxiety could be causing the fluttering, but I dont't think so. I am going to have my physician change meds and see if I stop loosing hair.

High Blood Pressure	Deb B, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	8/19/2009 3:19:06 AM	After being on it coupled with Tenoretic for a couple of years it helped my high blood pressure well enough but this last march and april started having problems with my asthma. My doctor took me off of it but failed to wean me off of it. With-in a week I ended up in the ER with chest pains and ended up staying overnight. A couple of weeks later ended up back in ER with a irregular and rapid heart rate at time of 190+ beats per minute. That doctor placed me back on the atenolol at twice the dosage I was taking before but I am still having problems with fluttering in my chest/lower throat and am having problems with my lungs feeling raw when I am walking in cooler temps (it appears to be getting worse/more frequent even in warmer temps). would really like to get off of it but am afraid of possibly having a heart attack. Never had these problems before I started taking it. Would never have started taking it I had known about the danger of stopping it.Also makes me tired and have lack of energy.

It has kept my blood pressure in the normal range the whole time.  However, sometimes I suspect that my blood pressure increases in the evening, depending on the stress I'm experiencing or what I've eaten (i.e. very salty foods).  Overall, this medication has worked well for me. My doctor keeps an eye on my kidneys and other bodily functions through regular blood checks.

Also mowed the grass once and got very bad sunburn. Which is a first. Found out later it makes you very sensitive to bright light.
