Acne	mp, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	8/31/2012 10:43:46 PM	I've taken Doryx off and on for the last few years to clear up acne.  The side effects are awful- shortness of breath and nausea.  Because of the side effects I stopped taking it but needed a quick fix before my wedding.  Took it for two weeks before my wedding along with Epiduo (Which Ive been on for 2 years) and Duac and my skin looked radiant! This medicane really does work BUT don't know if it is really worth the side effects.
Acne	Hpark, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	6/28/2012 12:47:50 AM	Been on it for 2 weeks.  Extreme Itchy scalp.  Mild Whiteheads on face.  Will discontinue using in case of hair loss!
Acne Rosacea	sharminpet, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	6/15/2012 11:12:38 PM	Cleared up my rosacea great, but after a few weeks use got itchy legs, and several yeast and fungal infections. But the worst was when my body started aching like I got run over by a truck! Needless to say, I had to quit taking it.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/15/2012 12:23:08 PM	On day 4 of taking medication, I had bumps all over my face.  My body acne was worse, and I felt horrible. I clearly had an allergic reaction which doctor would not confirm.  Take caution with this medication. Very strong. Very hard to swallow.

Acne	GirlIAm, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	13-18	4/10/2012 10:04:18 PM	It works for acne really well but (Sorry for T.M.I) but I get monthly yeast infections because of it. I dont know if its just me, but that part sucks!! :(

Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	1/27/2012 3:43:46 AM	Prescribed by my dermatologist for my acne problems i have had for most of my life, noticing a lot of hair loss and had no idea why until i checked out all of the feedback! acne did not clear up as fast as i thought it would, no stomach problems and the pill is rectangular which is hard to swallow... also noticed my beautiful teeth are turning a horrible yellow color! NOT TAKING MY PILL TOMORROW!!! or ever again for that matter. i would rather have white teeth and my hair at 22 yrs old over my acne problems, im sure there is something else out there without all of the side effects!
Acne	Nicole, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	1/20/2012 2:19:40 PM	I only took this medicine for 10 days and had a bad reaction to it. I had a horrible cluster headaches and migraines for four of the ten days due to it. I also had problems using the bathroom. I would feel the need to go, but couldn't. The doctor's office told me to not take the medicine for a few days and then try it again. (I threw the meds away.) Make sure you get a list of the side effects of this med. 
Acne	Brian, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	13-18	12/9/2011 8:53:18 PM	I love it! My teen acne is clearing up pretty fast (been 2 weeks. I chew my pills than swallow even though it says not to but no side effects so far.
Acne	Carolina Yankee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/20/2011 10:51:49 PM	It took several months until Doryx worked, and by that point I was severely depressed, emotional, and miserable because of my stress-induced acne.  As a woman in my mid-thirties who recently quit my high-paying job to return to grad school and pursue my ideal career, I was amazed that the stress of school immediately launched me (and my skin) back to my college years of hellish zits.  We're talking cystic, painful lesions.  Once my derma prescribed Doryx, I was so hopeful and yet simultaneously disappointed that it took so long to work.  By month #3 I was about to discontinue it, but she encouraged me to stick it out.  I'm not sure if it is the Doryx or the Proactive (which I started at about month 3 of Doryx) that ultimately cleared my skin, but I'm afraid to change my routine now that I finally don't look like a monster.  My advice:  try Proactiv before ingesting any drugs.  At least you'll know if it works, and avoiding antibiotics is always a plus in my book.  Finally, my shortness of breath has been severe.  I have had chest x-rays, ultrasounds, and multiple dr appts to ascertain whether I was having a serious problem or just a SE of doryx.  Being a trainer and athlete, I was initially scared to death about these side effects, but after reading the other reviews, I think I'm willing to deal with the breathing issues to have clear skin.  Sounds vain, I know, but the impact of cystic acne on my self esteem was so great that this seems a small price to pay.  Be patient, take the pill, find the coupon, and give it time.  It's worth it when you can finally go make-up free after months/years of horrific acne.  Don't hesitate!
Acne	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female		10/28/2011 5:43:06 PM	I'm 23 and my acne has always been bad since I was a teenager. I have blemishes all over and I'm always breaking out. I done tried just about everything, soaps, creams, facial washes, etc. Recently I asked my physician what can he give me for my acne, he prescribed me 'Tretinoin Cream, USP, 0.025%'. At first this cream broke me out bad so I stopped using it for about 2 weeks. I finally went to the dermatologist and she prescribed me 'Differin', 'Doryx', and a facial wash. I take the Doryx in the morning on an empty stomach, then I use the Differin after I wash my face with Irish Spring Aloe and at night I mix the Differin with the Tretinoin. I been doing for a wk now and it is clearing up my skin pretty good. I cant wait to see the results after about a month.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/10/2011 8:39:41 PM	I had terrible 'Bacne' from pregnancy. Doryx was amazing, and cleared up everything in 2 mos. I had no side effects, and felt wonderful. Give it a chance, you will see a noticeable difference in a matter of a week. This drug works wonders!!!!!! 
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	8/25/2011 12:46:34 AM	I began taking Doryx one week ago for adult acne. Even though I always take it with food, I have felt nausea like morning sickness during pregnancy. I have lost handfuls of hair, felt exhausted and experienced pain in my wrist and shoulder. None of this ever happened before I started the medicine. I think I'm getting all of the side effects and none of the benefits.

Acne	believe me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/12/2011 12:47:40 AM	Significant depression, suicidal tendencies, disrupted menstrual cycle, weight gain and severely lethargic. My doctor said none of my side effects could be caused by the drug, but I NEVER had those problems prior or after I stopped taking the pills.
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	13-18	6/19/2011 11:20:15 AM	I'm 17 years old with cystic and moderate to severe acne. It started about 7 years ago and has held me back until now. Doryx helped within the first two days! no side effects like hair loss or heartburn and no skin irration at all! Immediately calmed my skins redness and cysts started to disappear! I was also prescribed ziana which is a topical gel that seems to help as well. I highly reccomend this for anyone with cystic acne it works magic on the skin!
Acne	DoryxSuxz, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	4/17/2011 12:45:56 AM	I have moderate acne and then my back started breaking out. My doctor prescribed doryx. The first week I was on it, my chin area and throat started breaking out...a whole bunch of huge pimples. Then my chest started getting little red pimples. Now, I have tons of acne marks on my chin and chest. No longer taking this med. 
Acne	kittensintow, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	4	4	Female	45-54	4/6/2011 10:27:25 PM	I'm giving Doryx to my 19 year old son who has severe cystic acne; he couldn't shave and it was getting worse.  It has begun to clear up.  The cystic acne is gone and the &quot;regular&quot; acne is beginning to go away.  I am a little worried about the problems others have had with esophageal pain, however he takes it with dinner and hasn't complained.  I'll be checking with the MD about this on our next visit.
Acne	David, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	35-44	3/8/2011 11:24:07 PM	I have taken this drug on and off for 3 years. It does work for controlling larger acne. However, I was just diagnosed with esophageal candidiasis (fungus in my esophagus) and both of the doctors I saw said it is most likely from taking Doryx for an extended period of time. I obviously will no longer be aking this medication.
Acne Rosacea	paige, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	3/8/2011 1:17:40 PM	My dermatologist prescribed it to manage my acne issues with rosachea.  I took this Rx for a week and then had a break-out.  I stopped taking it.  I told my Dermatologist that I wanted to take minocycline after a break-out instead of this.  The minocycline clears it up within a day or two.  I do not want to take antibiotics long term.  She said I didn't give this Rx long enough to work, but I am not trusting that it works if I broke out after a week of taking it.  
Acne	0-2 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	0-2	3/5/2011 8:38:25 PM	The first week I started taking this medication, i noticed my acne went away. The only side affect I had was dryness of where its applied. I ran out and did not get a refill, and my skin started breaking out again! 
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	2/24/2011 12:43:39 AM	I had adult acne associated with stress - around my chin and cheeks. I took Doryx which seemed to help clear the acne up pretty quickly (one week).  That's when the hair loss started. After 5 weeks on Doryx, I have been off for a month and I am still losing hair.  I had thick, long hair and now I am down to 1/4 of what I had. It falls out in handfuls.  I have never experienced such devastating side effects before with anything else.  I will never take this medication again.

I couldn't even write my name when I went to the emergency room on the 4th day. The emergency room dr. took me off it right away! My BP went from 128/80 (which was good for me,I am 64 yrs old and never had any med problems for over 15 years) to 172/80 The next Monday I went to a different clinic now I have to take nerve pills till I don't know how long. My BP is down as long as I take the nerve pills. That stuff really messed up my system!!I didn't use any medications,except 1 baby asprin at nite,vitamins, all in the evening at least 1 hour after Doxy, was very active,non drinker, non drug user,  PLEASE be careful with this, If I would of stopped (right away)when I noticed these things I could of saved my self all the problems I have now.
Acne	in PAIN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	25-34	9/18/2010 9:36:36 AM	My pharmacy notes said not to take it less than 10 minutes before lying down.  I think the note needs to be more explicit and mention 30 minutes like other places.  After 1 week on Doryx, I started to feel that something was stuck in my throat, then it progressed to painful throat/swallowing, then esophogus pains. I don't know how to describe it but it is awful, I don't want to eat and I am in a lot of pain. I stopped the medicine and the pain got worse (the damage was already done).  I am wondering if I have an ulcer or some other problem.  I went to my primary doc and they gave me a GI cocktail which didn't help at all and now I am taking a drug to coat my throat.  3 doses so far and I am not experiencing any relief at all.  This is related to the Doryx.  I hope this goes away soon as I am miserable.  Also, I noticed some joint pain, muscles weakness, lightheadedness, headaches, and got a yeast infection despite eating yogurt.

Acne	MME720, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	35-44	6/18/2010 5:57:37 PM	I'd used this drug 2 yrs ago at 15Omg and it worked wonders.  I was on it for 3 mos and it cleared up my mild acne very well.  No side effects except upset stomach if no food.  I did have an issue swallowing the whole pill, but it was worth it.  I had a flare up now, 2 yrs later and asked to go on it again but this time I'm seeing minimal, if any, positive results.  I have noticed I'm tired more than usual but no hair loss or anything else.  I do this in combination with Retin-A Micro and Benzylcin topicals at night and I'm disappointed.  I will be visiting my Derm again to ask for another Rx to get better results.  
Acne	jamitout, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/9/2010 1:10:20 AM	I had acne for about 3 years now and Doryx is the only med that works for me.  I just wanted to write a few notes to the people who have use this drug. This drug can be crushed and can be taken with or without food.  The information you read from the pharmacy is for the generic.  the generic is different because you have to take it with food and can not be crushed.  make sure you read to see if it has the doryx lable on the instructions and if not then it's a generic copy.  Also, my derm told me if I do experience any stomach problems then i should take it with food but i dont then you can take it without food.  just a little heads up.  
Bacterial Skin Infection - Yaws	hair loss please stop, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	6/1/2010 11:55:56 PM	I've been using Doryx for 2 months. After 2 weeks I started losing my hair. I'm at week 6 of massive daily hair loss. It just falls out when you comb it. My acne has cleared a little bit on my face but not on my neck. I definitely would not recommend this drug to anyone. I hope my hair loss stops soon, my hair is so thin. Scabs have formed on my scalp from the sun. I would not take this drug if I were you!!!! It's not worth the hair loss!!! I have quit taking it.
Acne	flutelou, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	5/31/2010 10:28:40 AM	My son has been on this medication for 6 months with no improvement to his acne. We were given, via the dermatologist, a discount card valid until 28 February 2010, since March the cost has been $428 per month and considering that Doryx 150mg per day has been completely ineffective I feel we should be reimbursed in total.
Acne	Dylan, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	1	2	Male	19-24	5/25/2010 4:47:53 AM	I'm 23, male from California.I started taking this drug about 3 years ago, when my acne topical meds just weren't cutting it or making any more progress on my acne. My doc said it would take until I was 24 to finally naturally stop having acne...I had all the commom side effects, nausea when on empty stomache, skin sensitivity to light, but slowly the side effects were getting worse. None of my doctors (californian and some of the best in dermatology) told me that the sun was so detrimental while taking these pills. STAY AWAY FROM THE SUN. I went to Hawaii for two weeks, had an acne reaction that took 1 year to clear up again, plus craters in my face from the scaring.Also, little known side effect of this 150 mg pill is that it can all of a sudden make your face extremely red (as if you just tanned) anytime/any part of your day. Once I stopped taking them (1 month ago) the symptoms (what seemd like hotflashes or something) stopped. Do not recommend this for your children, it is a dangerous drug, there are other methods of solving acne problems (diet, excercise, topicals). I'm now taking differen and am more or less clear
Acne	debro, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	13-18	5/17/2010 9:18:46 PM	My son has been using Sumaxin and Epiduo for at least 6 months.  His skin was doing great, when he started getting breakthrough acne.  Dermatologist put him on Doryx 3 days ago and his skin is looking fantastic.  Highly recommend it.
Acne	catsis, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4		45-54	5/13/2010 7:03:14 AM	This medication has worked wonderfully for me.I'm 47 and have hormonal acne.  I had deep cystic acne around my chin, neck, and some on cheeks.  The first month I used Doryx my acne seemed to get worse and right after taking the pill I felt some discomfort like heartburn.  At about week 4, the acne really improved and I no longer had the heartburn feeling.  Now I'm on month 3 and have no cysts, no acne!  My skin is more sensitive to the sun but I would definitely recommend this for hormonal cystic acne!
Acne	WLT9691, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	4/14/2010 4:24:58 PM	My doctor started me on Doryx and gave me some samples and a coupon that said I could get it for $25.  First, the pills are HUGE!  You can't break them up becasue it says not to in their literature because it ruins the pellets. I told my doctor that the coupon DID NOT work.  He then gave me a prescription for the exact same medicine, Monodox and a coupon to get 60 pills a month for $10!!!!!  And that is good for 12 months!  These are small pills too!  Monodox has been great!!  Save yourself some money and get the same drug for $10!!!!
Acne	Megan, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	13-18	4/13/2010 4:12:59 PM	I was perscribed Doryx for acne and have been taking it for a month. After about 2 weeks, I developed a yeast infection that went away with a prescription. After another week I noticed significant hair loss. I called the pharmacy and they did not have it listed as a side effect. But apparently others have experienced this also. I have stopped taking the medication, but it was effective in clearing up the acne. 
Acne	elm006, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/8/2010 4:32:25 PM	I took this medication to help with my skin and felt as though it did.  I did not have any side effects and would recommend this medication.
Acne	Greeneyedbabe, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	19-24	4/2/2010 11:23:50 AM	I'm 22 and I started taking this medicine in Oct 2009.  I took it for 3 months and my acne had cleared up so nicely and I started to get chemical peels for the scars left behind.  I was not smart though and decided to stop taking the medicine, because I thought 3 months was enough time and that the chemical peels would finish the job. Well all my acne came back! Worse than ever. I should have listen to the doctor and used it as long as he wanted me to. i'm back on it again and this time I'm going to stay on it for as long as they say. Only side effect was that if I didn't eat it with food I would vomit! I hated having to time it two hours before and after i ate! Ugh. 
Skin Infection	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	3/29/2010 5:03:03 AM	Severe stomach pain and heart burn so ahve had to stop taking it.
Acne	Luis,  Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male		2/28/2010 11:41:30 AM	I am 35 years old and have struggled with acne since I was 14 I just recently went to a dermatoligist and I was ready for accutane, my derm told me he had no problem putting me on accutane and since I had not tryed any pills before he though it might be better to try 150mg of doryx per day and epiduo at night I am know on my 7th day and i have not seen a new pimple since I started and the big cysts that I had are alredy healing. I am very pleased with my doctor's decision.

In fact, I am still experiencing breakouts. I am exasperated and have made an appointment (several weeks sooner than expected) with my healthcare provider because I am so dissatisfied.
Acne	Momof3, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	2	3	Female	35-44	1/15/2010 7:53:16 PM	My Daughter has been on Doryx for 8 weeks.  It cleared her cystic acne but not the pustular acne and red pimples.  Also, she experienced worsening of the acne in the biginning which the Doctor said would occur as her skin &quot;purged&quot; the infection.  Probably would continue the Doryx except it was causing stomach cramping, odd joint and tendon pain and was difficult to take w/o eating and w/o dairy.  Doctor switched her to Solodyn today, will see what that does. 
Acne	Desert-Dreams, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	12/6/2009 3:23:57 AM	I've been using Doryx (150mg) for a month now and it's helped reduce my acne to the point that I no longer have any pimples on my face. For the first three day I took it on an empty stomach and I immediately realized that that didn't work for me. I became very nauseous and had the munchies, but I couldn't eat because of the nausea. This drug gave me an awful yeast infection but I'm eating a lot of yoghurt and taking acidophilus to keep that in check. I feel that I'm always thirsty now and that my lips are always dry. I've also realized that my teeth have become a little yellow, but that can be easily fixed with some Crest WhiteStrips.

My skin started getting dry and itchy after I started taking the drug and now it is out of control.  I did not connect the dry skin to the drug until recently.  Needless to say, I stopped taking the drug.  Has anyone else experienced this side effect?
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	11/15/2009 9:46:03 PM	I love it! My dermatologist started me on it less than a week ago and I can tell my acne has been clearing up ever since. I am a teen involved in two sports and have had an oily and acne prone skin all my life.  I highly reccommend this drug especially to teens.
Acne	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	13-18	11/14/2009 3:08:07 AM	Great drug for treating mild, to moderate acne. Though, regardless of what your dermatologist tells you this drug should not be taken for long periods of time because even though it cleared my acne over the course of a year it gave me unusually high blood pressure for someone my age, loss of hair(Particularly in the front), and shortness of breath causing much discomfort at times. So be very careful with it and only take the drug for no more than six months at a time. Hope this helps.

Acne	Brookefin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	11/8/2009 7:03:24 PM	I only took this medication for two days. I had a severe headache the entire time on this medicine as well as cold chills, and vomiting. I also experienced sever chest pains while on Doryx. I would not recommend this to anyone.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	2	1	Female	25-34	11/5/2009 2:50:49 PM	I have been taking Doryx for almost 3 months now and have experienced extreme hairloss and trouble swallowing/tightening of the chest. Thanks to everyone for posting their comments, I was struggling to find answers to these questions.My recommendation is to ask your dermatologist for a different antibiotic. My acne has not improved while taking Doryx and its also pricey.

Acne	MG, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	9/23/2009 7:28:55 PM	Took for approx. 3weeks,my skin seemed a little less inflamed, had initial nausea,that stopped, but then got severe stomach and throat pain,been to the doctor twice, put on Protonix (for acid indigestion), Dr. doesn't think its Doryx, now wants me to see a specialist. I suspected Doryx so stopped taking it when I started the Protonix, its been 6 days and there is still pain. Can't figure out from Doryx website info what causes the throat pain side effect..is my throat burned or did it get an abrasion? If its an abrasion it will probably take some time to heal. Any thoughts out there?
Acne		4	4	1			9/19/2009 9:53:34 PM	My 18 year old daughter started taking Doryx around 6 months ago for acne.  While on this drug, she came down with mono and began suffering significant hair loss.  We attributed the hair loss to the mono as her dermatologist who prescribed the Doryx assured us that sometimes after an illness hair loss will occur.  Well, that was six months ago and the hair loss continued.  I knew something else was wrong.  She had every blood test under the sun and nothing checked out.  I decided to do some research on Doryx and found out that others had complained of hair loss.  I took my daughter off it and the hair loss stopped!  Why wouldn't the dermotologist immediately make that connection?  We had no idea that hair loss was a side effect; it wasn't listed in the literature.  But, I assure you, that if you begin losing your hair, get off Doryx immediately!!!

Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	8/3/2009 1:34:56 AM	I've been taking this medication for almost two months and has cleared my acne significantly.  I only experienced one side effect while taking doryx.  I've begun to find it difficult and a little painful to swallow.  Apparently, according to some online sources, this is a common side effect.  Personally, I think it's worth it.  My skin looks great. 
Acne	Ashley1991, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	7/5/2009 1:09:13 PM	This medication caused me to have a feeling of chest tightening and trouble breathing. I was treated by paramedics two days after I started the medication I was given oxygen and felt better. I called my and they said they doctors didn't think it was a side effect of Doryx. However, I ended up in the hospital a few days later. It was determined that doryx caused my symptoms and when I quit taking it 2 months ago have I never had any of these symptoms again

It worked very well for her.  I have been reading through the comments and want to know...WHERE DID PEOPLE FIND THIS DRUG CHEAP????  Our insurance refused to pay anything on it saying they don't cover acne treatment and that is what this drug is for....though it was NOT prescribed for that reason AND it costs almost $500 for 30 pills!!!!!  Where in Heaven's name did anyone find it for $50 for a 90 day supply?  I really need to know because I cannot afford $500 a month for this drug and she is to be on it for 4 more months.

Not sure if this is a side effect or not. No diarrhea.  I did have some nausea &amp; loss of appetite but nothing major.  I'm on a 10 day regimen for an upper respiratory infection &amp; hope that this drug will do the trick.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/26/2009 11:50:43 PM	At first I was apprenhensive to taking ANOTHER pill to help with me acne. I have tried taking other pils when I was younger, but at the beginning of the year my acne had stared to get pretty bad. So i went to my dermatologist and got my prescription and took my pills religiously for the next 4 months or so. Now my face looks like i never even had acne. Im so happy that i gave these pills a chance. I had no side effects at all. I definately recommend these to EVERYONE that is considering going on doryx!!

Acne	mmc2211, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Male	13-18	4/9/2009 2:40:11 PM	I began taking this medication in early February 2009 and it has been about 7 weeks. The medication is easy to use and very cheap, esspecially if you use the rebate found on the doryx website. As for results, I have not noticed any real change in my skin. I have mild to medium acne and it bagan breaking out badly in January, so my dermatologist gave me this medication and I will continue to take it, however I am not positive it is doing anything. I have had no negative symptoms and have taken it with and without food and have not felt sick at all.Basically, I would recommend it if your doctor gives it to you because, if your as desperate as me, anything helps!
Acne	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	13-18	3/30/2009 7:49:38 PM	I have been taking this medication for years now and it has had little affect on my acne. When I started taking it, I did notice a significant impact on the dryness of my skin. This in turn, did reduce my acne symptoms. I am somewhat satisfied with the results, but over time, it seems as though the effects have worn out. It never dramatically improved my symptoms and doesn't seem necessary for me to even continue taking it.
Acne	mygoalisclearskin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	3/22/2009 4:44:51 PM	I have only taking the pills for a few weeks. It's ok for me but I have notice my head is hurting more since taking Doryx and my taste buds have changed.
Skin Infection	jd, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Male	25-34	3/19/2009 9:58:07 PM	Doryx seems to be working well, but the pill (150mg) is large and difficult to swallow.  The only side effect noticed is that I may as well have been castrated.  Total loss of interest in sexual activity.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/19/2009 10:32:57 AM	I used to get the kind of acne that starts out under the skin and hurts a few days before you can even see it. Then when you can see it, it still takes about a week to fully get rid off and you're left with a scar even though you didn't pop it. My dermatologist prescribed this and I'll admit, I was skeptical. He said it would get worse before it got better. The day I saw him I had 2 or 3 large zits around my chin and mouth that were still under the skin and had yet to come out. To my surprise, it only got better. The zits went away in 2 days and never made it to the surface. I was shocked. I read someone else's review that said it causes yeast infections, which my doctor didn't warn me of. I had never had one before and didn't know quite what to expect. It's going on 5 weeks now and I did get a yeast infection. It sucks, but I will still keep taking this medication because it's working so well for my acne. Acne can be a life long battle and I'm just so thankful I found something that works, even if it has a few side effects that last a few days. If you are about to start taking this medication, my advise is to ALWAYS TAKE IT WITH FOOD. I took it once on an empty stomach and I ended up with a stomach ache that also made me feel hungry. I wanted to eat, but I didn't want to eat cause I thought I may vomit. Don't make this mistake.

I had horrible itching and scabs from it and the meds helped a LOT!  It's important to take as directed and ALWAYS be consistant on how U take the pills
Acne		2	4	2			12/28/2008 1:42:57 PM	Prescribed 100 mg of doryx to take once a day along with numerous creams and gels (tazorac, duac, differin, clindamycin)to treat cystic vulgaris acne.  Medical plan did not cover name brand. Therefore, was given the generic and took as prescribed.  Results were satisfactory, even though taken with above.  Maybe results were not positive because the generic brand is not as good as the name brand?

Acne	miss*hourglass, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	9/10/2008 9:27:59 PM	i have been taking this pill for almost a year now along with tazorac face cream and it has been great.i had to take this because i got an allergic reaction from a PETER THOMAS ROTH product i was using. i have lost my appetite and felling like throwing up but i have a lot of confidence again. its really hard when u have acne because u think everyone is staring at it so it feels great that it went  away like 95% and i have an even skin tone thanks to the tazorac. i also had a laser treatment done called smooth beam which also helped but it was very expensive $700.00!!! my teeth have also becoem a litle discolred since taking this medicine. overall (like with any drug you take) it will help treat your current problem but also cause new ones!!! GOOD LUCK

Acne	adri, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	8/18/2008 8:41:54 AM	i started using this medication in february when i couldnt stand anymore the large red painfull pimples in my face mostly around my cheeks. What i didn't like the most was that the pimples would be beside each other that they would combine by 2 or 3. after a week of using it, it cleared my skin.It did however irritate my skin whenever i would be in the sun for a while. since may i stopped using it because the only main side effect was sensitivity to the sun which summer was coming and i was going to mexico. I would just make sure it also doesnt effect birth control pill that u may be taking
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	19-24	7/19/2008 1:15:49 AM	I was prescribed this medicine for Cervicitis. I was told to take 100mg twice a day for 2 weeks. I revisited the doctor after the course of treatment, and any evidence of cervicitis was completely gone. I did, however, experience moderate to severe nausea if I did not consume a small meal prior to taking the pills. Overall, I found it worth the discomfort of the nausea to cure the infection. It's more expensive, but it has a lot less side effects than the generic, Doxycycline.
Acne	kismetangel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	7/10/2008 4:19:57 PM	I started taking Doryx about 3 months ago. My dermatologist started me out with a 2 weeks sample. Then I found a website....http://www.wcrx.com/products/doryx/ind ex.php, that offers a $50 rebate. I pay $60 for 90 day supply. So I really only had to pay $10. It works really well. I have seen a reduction in pimples and those I do get are very small and are gone within a day. I did get a yeast infection during the first month on it. Took 2 Diflucan and started taking a probiotic and I haven't had that problem since. I suggest this medication, if you have tried other oral antibiotics and they are not working. I am also having Beta-peels, which are improving my complexion. This is a pricey medication, but it is well worth it. I got my rebate check 4 weeks after submitting it (keep your original reciept). Make sure you eat before you take it. I have never had any stomach issues with it, but I know others have.
Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	19-24	6/8/2008 11:58:31 PM	Doryx has been a helpful drug and has helped clear my acne.  It cleared about 80 percent of it... The side effects are very confusing though... i have to take it with food or it will upset my stomach.. when i mean it upsets my stomach, i mean that it feels as though i am having &quot;heartburn&quot;... it also causes shortness of breath while i run... but it did the job and i am happy with the results
Bacterial Infection due to Deer Fly, Flea &amp;amp; Tick Bites	Leslysan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	2/15/2008 1:13:51 PM	I was initially prescribed a generic tatracycline and I had severe side effects, muscle and joint pain, headache. And it didn't work. I was then given Doryx delayed release tablets. The dr. said to give it at least 7 days, double dose. Lo and behold, it worked and no side effects. My rosacea was very very bad, made worse by any type of alcohol (sulfites)and any type of exposure to hot temperature. Doryx AND a topical ointment made it better. Also using Cerave and Cetaphil facial products helped a whole lot and made my skin very clean and very smooth.
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	13-18	2/9/2008 6:04:36 AM	I having been taking Doryx for almost 2 years for persistent acne.  It works pretty well, giving me clear-ish skin always except right before my period.  I take it in correlation with birth control pills.  The side affects where minimum until tonight, when I forgot and took a double dose on top of alcohol.  I have the shakes and nausea.  The hardest part about taking this pill is having to take it at a different time then a meal, but not within half and hour of bed.  However, I have GERD which makes it much more difficult to take any medications, and this is one ot the few I can tolerate.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/22/2008 4:52:48 PM	I started taking this medication about 1 week ago and have seen a reduction in the redness of my acne. My doctor told me that the acne might get worse before it got better and to give it about 5 weeks to work completely. I use this with a topical cream. I have noticed that it makes me very thirsty and from the neck down, my skin is really dry...so far so good...
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/12/2007 11:51:25 PM	Prior to taking Doryx, I would usually have anywhere from 5-10 large pimples on my face.  I was prescribed Doryx after seeing a dermatologist.  After about a month on the drug, I noticed a significant reduction in the amount of acne and after two months, was about 95% cured of problem and continue to be now a year later.This drug worked a miracle on my skin!  I've had acne for over 10 years and have never had alot of success with topical medications.  When I talk to people, I feel like they are looking at me and not my acne anymore.The occasional side effect I experienced were cramps when I took this drug on an empty stomach.

Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	11/26/2007 11:02:01 PM	This drug is awful!  I was prescribed it for mild adult acne and besides causing skin irritation, yeast infections, discoloration of teeth and nausea among other terrible side effects, it made my acne much worse than it was to begin with!  I stopped taking it after 5 weeks.  Do not take this medication!

It's taken my acne and made it about 10 times worse.  I've also used prescription topical cream in conjuction with it.  I've followed the directions exactly and never missed a dose.  Also, it's caused me to get numberous yeast infections.  Think twice before you go on Doryx.
