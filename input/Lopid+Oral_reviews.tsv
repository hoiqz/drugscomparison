I also take fish oil supplements.  Taking Lopid 30 minutes before eating is impossible unless I want to endure the worst acid-reflux imaginable.  Have to take it with food. Had recent blood test and levels are still in high range.

Ease of use is only drawback. Twice a day, 30 min prior to meals.  It is the remembering to take it at appropriate time that I am afraid I will forget.  But, it definitely works.  I have been taking it when my levels get too high for 3 yrs and am very satisfied with it.

I thought it was just stress, but I am forgetting songs I knew by heart and simple words I cant even spell correctly. Very scary. I will not take another pill after seeing all the side effects are related to this medication. I will stick to the high triglycerides first.

Tricor is generally taken once per day.  Taking Lopid 30 minutes before meals is difficult but drug is very effective.  I had upset stomach for a few days but it has gone away.  Taking Lopid not as burdensome as I must now take Metformin twice/day for Diabetes.

I stopped taking it for five days then tried again, but stopping some supplements like B-vitamins and tried again. Got the same pain in the same place. I haven't taken it since. Ironically, the mega-dose of Niacin I was taking actually did a better job. This may work for some, but if you have a blood relative, especially a parent/child/sibling who has tried this and could not tolerate it, there is a good chance you won't tolerate it, either. My mother tried taking Lopid and though her reaction was different, her intolerance was apparently telling in this case. She can't take aspirin, but I have no problem with it.

High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	45-54	1/1/2010 1:11:03 PM	I had high triglyceride (over 600) and very high risk levels of both LDL and C-reactive Protein.  After 90 days on Gemfibrozil, all blood levels are now listed as &quot;Optimal.&quot;  The only side effect I can possibly attribute to the drug is some lethargy, and some sleeplessness, however I can't be certain that the drug was the cause. I'm willing to be that anyone who had stomach issues didn't read the directions and drink a significant amount of water after taking the medication.  Makes a HUGE difference.

No way could I drive and take it and was suppose to take it twice daily and just took it once a day due to how it made me feel. I do not recommend this drug.

EXTREME irritability, fatigue and general aches were so bad that I would rather keep my high triglycerides than take this medicine.  Most people can probably tolerate this drug but I could not. I eventually reduced my triglycerides through altering my diet.  Reducing refined carbohydrates and adding oat bran, fresh grapefruits and oranges and vegetable salads brought my numbers into the normal range down from the 400s.
