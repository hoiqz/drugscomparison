Overweight	ems714, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/26/2011 1:59:00 AM	First, let me tell you about myself. I am 5' 3&quot; and I WAS 150 pounds which according to BMI charts, I was considered overweight. I had an immense appetite and didn't exercise much. I had also taken Phentermine in the past and was admitted in the hospital for cardiac arrhythmias and anxiety. After the phentermine experience, I was a little apprehensive about weight loss meds. I retrieved Sibutramine in Mexico by a pharmasict who boasted NO side effects and guaranteed weight loss so I figured I'd give it a shot. I LOVE THIS DRUG. I went from 150 to 135 pounds in 2 weeks. This medication helped me eat smaller portions at mealtimes and decreased my desire for greasy fast food. I did however experience a few very minkr side effects that do not interfere much. After taking this medication, my bowel habits went from 4 a week to about 2 a week, i do experience very minor almost unnoticeable palpitations and in the beginning, i had a few episodes ofinsomnia. Along with cutting the junk food, i stopped eating after 7pm and increased my water intake. I think if you really are looking to lose weight, you should try this medication especially if you don't want the trembly shaky feeling you get with other meds like phentermine or other stimulants. Good luck and hope this helps!

Does anyone know if this drug will make you test positive for amphetamines on a urinalysis? Some other site reviews state this but I cannot find if its true. I am taking it but I will be joining the Navy and do not want to appear like a drug user.

Side effects do change by day. sometimes i have dry mouth and funny taste others, may be hearth palpitations but overall i feel great, I no longer have the cravings i used to have and i already lost 10 pounds in 22 days taking this medication.

Overweight	Happysocks, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	10/6/2008 12:37:18 PM	of course everyone is different and will have different reactions, but for me it has been rgeat. i have not had any side affects. My craving for food has gone away to the point where I forget to eat sometimes, which then I might get a headache which for me is normal if I dont eat. Ultimately it all comes down to determination and will power. No pill will ever be the solution, but it can help.
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	6/25/2008 11:38:31 AM	I started taking this medication to lose weight. Unfortunately, my appetite did not decrease at all. Instead, I was anxious and nervous all of the time, my palms were always sweaty, my mood changed drastically. The side effect that bothered me most was the insomnia- I literally didn't sleep for days, and when I did, it wasn't a solid sleep.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	1/10/2008 9:32:47 AM	I took Meridia under the advice of my physcian and lost approximately 45 pounds in about 8 months.  I also added exercise about 5 days a week.  This totally curbed by hunger.  My only complaint is that when I stopped taking it, my hunger returned and it is very hard to maintain my current weight now!  I am still exercising, but I am hungry all the time!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/23/2007 12:12:10 AM	I started to use it, and let me tell you I am one of those persons that get really nervous about taking weight control pills.  The fist day I guess it was more excitement than anything else but, I felt a little hyper my heart was beating faster than usual.  The next day I did not have any symptoms.  It is my second refill and I have lost 10 lbs.  My cravings that I would usually get are gone.  Overeating has stopped.  My energy lever has gone from zero to 10 being 10 the highest.  I can even say that it has relived me of my depression.  I would definite recommend it.
