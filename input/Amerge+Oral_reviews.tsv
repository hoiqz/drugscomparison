Migraine Headache	Dan, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	4/27/2012 3:48:10 AM	This is my first time trying Amerge. Now, 1 hour after 2nd dose, pain=9. Eye pain and throbbing, sensitivity to light and sound are all unchanged. Not going to take any further doses. It did not work at all for me personally. Will call my Doctor in the morning and hopefully try something else.

It did not do anything to take away the pain and it gave me a side effect of making me feel like I was having something similar to a hotflash.  Neuro said it may not work everytime so I will try it for one more month, but if it does not work again and side effect continues I will not take this medication again.

Migraine Headache	Blessed, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/5/2010 7:56:59 PM	I have had migraines for years. I have tried serveral migraine medicines and they have not worked as well as Amerge. I take it when I FIRST notice one coming on. If I wait to late then it takes longer to take it away. It does make me VERY tired and I have to lay down when taking it, it helps to lay down anyhow. Chocolate, vinegar (pickles etc.), sourcream, cinnamon(the spice)and some nuts are a few of my triggers of a migraine. I have fibromyalgia and Cinnamon (the spice)causes my muscles to hurt and contract. 
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/19/2009 8:23:25 PM	I have been suffering migraines for a few years now and Amerge is the only thing that has worked for me. I can actually function on days when I would have normally been stuck in bed all day. One time I did have the side effects of being hot and having my heart race, but overall it is a wonderful drug. Maxalt and some others did nothing for me.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	10/16/2009 4:01:26 PM	I have been on Amerge for about 5 years.  It generally works within 2 hours.  I do feel lethargic sometimes but it is worth the relief I get from Amerge.  It is expensive but I have insurance.  In the beginning I was filling my prescription every 30 days (6 pills)- now it more like every 90+ days.  It pays to know your triggers.
Migraine Headache	hereiam, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	10/14/2009 3:10:54 PM	I take Amerge when I start feeling a migraine trigger and I feel nothing but some lithargy and I end up taking a second one four hours later. No change except for that I am very fatigued and the pain is STILL full blown and I am trying to give in to the fatigue and sleep, but the pain in my head and ear keeps me awake. Originally, I was on Maxalt, didn't work, so my physician put me on Amerge. She deduced migraines were menstrual related. They are NOT. They come at anytime, no rhyme or reason.

(I had gotten up with a headache and took an Amerge.) They did all sorts of tests and couldn't find anything, so finally concluded it was a reaction to the Amerge. I will not take it again. 
Migraine Headache	J. Jacobsen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	8/23/2009 9:35:53 PM	I have suffered from migraines for over 30 years.  I have hormonal changes (menstrual + ovulation)triggers plus others such as foods.  Amerge is the only triptan that has worked for me.  Mostly because it takes 2+ hrs to work.  Inmitrex gives me inmidiate chest pains.  I take Amerge at the onset of an attack, which is sometimes during the night when I wake up with &quot;the feeling&quot;.  If I don't take it within 15-20 minutes of the onset, the migraine develops, although mush controlled, and I usually require a second dose.  Because of  the many triggers, I have months when I can live with as little as 1 Amerge and others when I require as many a 8-9 2.5 Mg pills.  Until last week, my insurance only paid for 3 pills and now they approved 8 a month.  If I loose my insurace I would have to cut in family expenses to cover for this medicine, otherwise I am literally disabled.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	8/5/2009 12:51:54 PM	I took this for a persistant headache and my nurologist gave it to me and suggested I take it to see how it worked. It caused some upset stomach but other than that it took my headache away for the most part. I'm still fighting my headache but my nurologist thinks its sleep apnea and this is just a temporary fix.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/29/2009 4:44:44 PM	My doctor told me that this would take a while to start working, and to begin taking it the week of my period when I know that I will have a migraine for 3-5 days.  It seems to have blocked the migraine.  I can't believe there is something that is actually working, as I've tried almost all triptans out there.  This one doesn't make me sick like Imitrex &amp; Maxalt either.

Migraine Headache	jaynedowe, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/27/2009 4:08:01 AM	I took the pill one time when my neurologist wanted me to try a different medication for my hormone migraines that last days.  But with only one pill I had the most horrible stabbing stomach pains which felt like my insides were being torn open.  I called my neuologist who perscribed the pill and she said that I had a rare but serious side effect, but she never had this reaction in her patients yet.   Unfortunatly all I could do is suffer in pain for hours in a fetal position waiting until the medicine left my system.  And it didn't help the migraine either.   
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/26/2009 9:31:12 PM	I get a migraine monthly and within 45 minute of taking this medication, I am pain free and able to continue on with my day. It is expensive but well worth it to have no pain
Migraine Headache	vanessa5, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	3/1/2009 9:11:21 PM	I had some success with Amerge. It would generally relieve my headache but then it would return 12-24 hours later. I would also feel depressed and moody while taking it, and generally sleepy. Didn't work for me but wortha try for others.

It's way too expensive. I'm even on disability because migraines are so severe.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/11/2009 4:03:42 PM	As soon as the blind spot appears I take one Amerge pill.  The blind spot enlarges into an aura and goes across my field of vision and then goes away within 20-30 minutes.  I do not get any real headaches with the aura---just strong feelings of anxiety and wondering if more auras will come.  Usually it is one and done. Rarely do I have to take another Amerge.  I went 4 months without any and then had four within a week.  Can't seem to get a handle on why they come for me.  Many times while asleep I dream I have the aura and wake up around 4:00 AM to find out I actually do have it.  Then I take an Amerge and try to go back to sleep and overcome the anxiety.  Have been using Amerge for yeas--carry one in my pocket at all times to take as soon as blind spot appears.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	2/11/2009 9:08:49 AM	New to this medication.  Had to take 3 doses and use alot of ice but finally eased the pain.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/2/2009 11:18:16 AM	this medicine works without making me sicker as others do. But I wish the cost was cheaper. I have to pay for each pill and they are expensive. But it is the only medication that works so effectively.
Migraine Headache	janem, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/15/2008 7:33:10 PM	this is the longest lasting tryptan available and the only one that has worked for me.  I take with 3 advil, otherwise it does not work.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/12/2008 10:08:51 AM	Works very well if I take it at the onset of the migraine and not wait.
Other	Eve Garcia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/8/2008 1:37:59 PM	I have been taking this medication for migraine pain for a couple of years (1mg pill for about 2-3 yrs). Initially, all it took was one pill and poof the pain was gone, almost immediately. Now I have to, at times, take the max (5mg) to relieve the pain. Overall it works, takes a bit of time to take effect and more than one dose for me; but I like that I hardly feel any sides effects and can at the very least manage my day and for the most part the migraine is completely gone by the end of the day. So far this has been the only medication to help relieve the pain for me. Although I have continuously increased my doses since I started taking it, I would continue to take it.

Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/12/2008 1:12:49 PM	I have tried a few other medicines for migraines and Amerge is the only one that really works for me.  Sometimes, I have to take more than another and take motrin with it if my headache is really intense but it will go away.

Migraine Headache	 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		5/7/2008 11:52:36 PM	in 4 years I have not had to go to the ER for a &quot;hypo&quot; for a migraine headache, Amerge always works and only one or maybe two times I had to use the second pill in 4 hours.  Very happy with this medication, doesn't make me feel tired or fussy, and I can go on with my day.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/24/2008 12:26:08 PM	This works on even my most severe migraine headaches. My only complaint is that it takes at least 1 hour before I feel any relief, but it's comforting to have such a reliable treatment available.

I have since learned to manage my triggers but when I do get a migraine one low dose amerge works within 2 hours.  I have gone from 9 pills a month to only 3 to 4.  This pill has been my savior.

Very rarely do I take a second one.  It takes two hours to begin easing my headaches though.   If I catch it early enough, it is great.

Recently BS/BC has rejected my use of this drug.  I am at a loss as what to take now.  I have taken all of the other drugs and none of them work in preventing the headaches, just work when I get a headache. I need help on this.

In the 7 yrs I've been on the medication I've only needed to take 5 mgs within 24 hours twice.  One dose normally takes care of my most severe headache.
