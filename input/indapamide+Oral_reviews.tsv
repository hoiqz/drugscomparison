High Blood Pressure	6grandkids, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/3/2010 3:32:37 PM	I have been taking the lower dose pill of Indapamide for over 5 yrs. with good results and no problems.  I am sure to eat plenty of vegetables to keep potassium levels up, and usually drink a small can of low sodium V-8 which is very high in potassium.

Absolutely preferable to any Thiazide. Thiazides increase weight, LDL, TRIG, ...much more which you can never recover from. Drains most of potassium so need K supplements plus Spironolactone. 1.25 mg/d drops my systolic bp by 6 mmHg. I am taking 2.5 mg/d.
