Pain	grammyjo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	8/18/2012 4:00:01 PM	I have been on Hydrodone, 7.5/750 for about 8 years for a combination of fibromyalgia, hernia, and arthritis pain. According to my pharmacy, they are not going to manufacture this dosage anymore, so my last refill was for Vicodin 5/350s.  I am extremely tired now, almost flulike symptoms, and feel horrible. It seems to help the pain a bit, but not as well as the other Rx.  I love the fact that I don't have as much aceteminophen going into my body, because I have been very concerned about my liver and kidneys lately, but it's almost like I'm withdrawing from the other med.  Is that a possibility?

I am scared of the liver involvment, even tho my tests do not show signs of this. I have had 11 vertebroplasties and have to limit any activity that could cause more fractures. What other mild medication can I substitute for Hydrocodone -APAP 5-325 mg. I take 5 of them per day.
Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/4/2012 8:58:23 AM	I started this about 2 mths ago for chronic back pain (I've had 5 major back surgeries &amp; I also have a spinal cord stimulator)it has help me a lot.  I have tried everything and this seems to take the pain away for a while.  Trust me I have tried just about everything for the pain, but I'm sure like all the rest, the effectiveness of this will wear off, but for right now I am grateful for it working.  I also just started going to a NEW pain clinic and I'm very happy with the treatment and the doctors there!  I also have all the rods, screws &amp; pins put in my back, had all my lumber disks replaced, so I always have some kind of pain, which I believe I will have to live with forever.  I also take Flexeril for muscle spasms in my back and leg..so the combination of both these medicines really help.  I hope I have help someone with the information I just provided.  Hope everyone out there finds the relief from pain as I have!  Have a great day everyone!

However, for some of us, it is a life improving solution for extreme and chronic pain.

Pain	Rusty, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	5/14/2012 4:50:02 PM	I've been on vicodin (5/500) since a car accident in 2007, Dr prescribed 2 tabs every 4 hours. If you do the math, that's 12 tabs a day. Way more than the 4000 mg/day of acetaminophen recommended. Now I'm limited to 4 tabs a day. This dosage doesn't deal with the pain in the lower back and right leg. Next visit to doctor's office I will suggest increasing the pain part to 10 mg instead of 5 mg. Since when should the patient have to suggest to the doctor? The psychiatrist suggested switching to Norco. Hope it's more effective than Vicodin.

It actually is HYDROCOD/ACET 10/325 MG.  Q 4-6 Hrs., PRN.  1 TAB as prescribed is not very effective.  2 TABS. in addition to 2 TBS. Tramadol 50 MG. does a &quot;FAIR&quot; job of releaving pain in my neck, lower LUMBAR spine, ALL joints, wrists, around thumbs.  Took HYDROCOD/ACET 750 M.G. for many years without Tramadol 50 MG.

I am a pain patient and in the begining it worked  ok for me however vicodin products have never been that effective for me , but my pain dr wanted to &quot;reset&quot; my body before changing to something else. I have now been on this with morphine ER 30 mg 2 a day and I am now seeing very minimal relief if any at all . When I started on it I got a little more relief but they were wearing off fast and now I am lucky to make it to four hours a day .  I am thinking of talking to my pain dr about changing me back to what I know works which is percocet . I hope this med works for some people because if it doesn't don't feel bad I heard from a nurse a while ago that there is a percentile of people that this drug just does not do anything for them at all . It is like they did not take anything . So if something doesn't work then make sure you find something that will because it is no fun waking up every morning and having to face the day knowing your pain will only get worse as the day goes on . If your dr won't help you find one that will listen and help. WE pay them to help us so they should and to those out there who abuse pills well need I say that your the reason that chronic pain patients are treated like criminals when in fact we NEED our meds and are serious about it and not just getting high . It is you we have to thank for making it so hard to get any help at all .

The only downside is that it makes me a little dizzy and loopy feeling, and for times when I really need to deal with pain (like at work) feeling loopy is a little inconvenient.

Had allergic reactions to most other pain meds, especially those containing codeine.  When Darvocet was pulled from the market, I was devastated.  Didn't think that I would find anything that would work as well.  Tried Vicodin E.S., and it never took the pain away completely, always had a dull ache. When the Doctor prescribed Norco 325/10, I was amazed at how quickly and how well it worked and continues to do so.

Went through procedure of injecting cement into crack. Most pain meds make me sick, nauseated. This med, if taken with food, does not make me feel sick. Must take every 4 hrs. or pain hits hard. It has really helped me. Been taking for 2wks now, hopping to stop soon.

This medication has given me my life back. I have had 2 back surgeries now have 2 rods, spacers screws etc. and arthritis in my back. it relieves my pain and i have never had any problems with addiction. if you take for pain your addiction is decreased. take as directed and dont adjust the meds on your own and you should be fine. if i do get some addiction from it, i would rather have that then being unable to walk etc. always ask yourself, are you taking it for the pain. ive stopped my meds before and really only thing that happens is i HAVE PAIN and lots of it. ill stick to taking my meds. :)

I have fibromyalgia and I stay in chronic pain. I also like the fact that the Tylenol is not so high. I would get hot once the pill kicked in it helped me greatly with pain to the point that I could finally get some sleep.

But from what I've read; If pain is treated in early stages often times it can prevent the pain from escolating to pain requiring stronger pain meds.

Pain	Jake, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/2/2011 4:24:29 AM	I've been taking Norco 10/325 for 6 months now because of pain associated with osteo arthritis.  Prior to this time I was using vicidin for approx 4 months.  Originally I was diagnosed with gout and the pain was severe and I'm sure I had gout but taking the typical gout med (endomythicin?) an MD then a poditrist prescribed, it really didbn't do anything for me, until an orthopedic diagnosed my problem as being osteo arthritis.  Now I did have a severe knee injury 25 years ago (I'm 54)...fractured left tibea plateau.  this DO also prescribed Celebrex which really helped me.  Now actually, my MD is the one who is prescribing and monitoring my Norco usage...the DO wanted me to see a pain mangement Dr. but I couldn't afford their prices ($350 initial visit)...so I have been using Norco 10/325 3X's day and I do not need anymore than that dose.  As others here have said, it enables me to live w/o pain, and I've had severe arthritic pain w/o Norco and no pain using Norco.  FWIW, some months back I tired tapering off my 3X's a day dosage, by using only twice daily.  Guess what?  That didn't work, and I used twice daily for almost a week.  I had pain once again so I went back to 3X's/day...and I mentioned this to my MD who just shook his head and told me I should have known better.  There was a time I felt down on myself for having to use this pain medication but not anymore.  I can walk w/o experiencing pain whereas before w/o using this medication, I felt severe pain which is no fun plus, not using Norco, I couldn't function well.  I had a hard time walking, and I was in pain, but not anymore using Norco 3X's/day.  Before I forget to emtnion...most of the pain I felt was in my left knee but I also felt pain in my right knee to, and both of my feet...and my feet used to swell, even while using endomythicin...but Celebrex cleared up the swelling.  I'm using 200 milligrams of Celebrex daily along with Norco 10/325 3X's/day...I should mention, I do not consume alcohol at all

Not a good time, though having my middle finger in a splint has been very entertaining. Slicing machines are devious and will tear you up if given the chance, so be careful.The medication didn't take the pain away completely, but it does make it manageable.I can't tell if it's from real pain relief or from getting knocked silly by the codeine or both.I do have some pretty impressive nausea, so keep a look out for that.

I have weaned myself down to 2 - 3 pills per day. My side effects; constipation, mood swings, anxiety and nausea. I plan to wean myself off completely in the near future because the mood swings and anxiety are starting to effect my quality of life. This medication is highly addictive and extremely difficult to stop using. For anyone who has a history of recreational drug use or even a family history of addiction, I recomend trying a different approach to pain management.

When I take one, the achiness goes away, that worries me.  Otherwise I am pleased with the results.

Pain	Meganbuggs1977, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/24/2011 5:39:30 AM	I have been taking Norco 10/325 for cronic kidney stone pain over the past couple of years off and on. I used to take Vicodin before, but had to take 2 pills. Now I only have to take 1 and there is a lot less tylenol in it, which reduces the risk of liver damage. I hate taking pills, and Norco is pretty small in size compared to the Vicodin. So it's easier to swollow and much more effective. I see all of these other reviews from people who have gotten addicted to it. As long as you take the medication as directed and don't abuse it you'll be fine. If it becomes less effective over time.... talk to your doctor about switching meds or changing the dose. Don't start taking more and more of it, because thats how you get addicted. I have never abused the drug and only take the medication when needed. As long as you follow the dosing directions and don't abuse it, this is an overall great pain reliever. Also I have absolutely no side effects. This medication doesn't even make me drowsy.

Pain	LivingDayByDay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	2/6/2011 7:50:15 AM	ive been on some form of pain med for 30yrs. over 10 yrs ago, i was prescribed 5 80mg of Oxycontin a day for 2 yrs and then was taken down to lortab 500, which did nothing after the nasty oxycontin i was dependant on when I had to switch doctors. i have tried several pain meds since which after the high doses of oxys, i just as well been taken Advil.I finally found a doctor who gives me 8 Noro 10-325, along with a 75 strength Fentanyl patch for the last two yrs, although the Norco dosent work as well anymore, Im blessed to get what I do, however  i cannot take any of the new generics because there is a big difference in manufacturing. Watson had the patent on lortab and almost all of it is generic now. Now they are trying to switch the Watson Norco 10-325 to generic cause drug companies can now make the generic form. I agree with many of you, i have to double my dosage to get the same amount of relief. i wish i could take generic, I have no prescription insurance and my total cost for my meds in 2010 was 6829.00. im on disability and this month due to the extreme utility bills going to have to choose between heat and electric or the meds i need to function. I also have 4 other meds that i take. Sorry for the novel, but it was nice to see that im not the only one who knows that generics are not the same, but they tell ya there is no difference. I guess those of us who are on chronic pain management, rather than short term acute, notice this more so. Thanks for reading, I wish you all as many tolerable pain days and more pain free days as posssible.

Don't let 'em put you on Norco !

Have to keep ahead of it and watch the time. It is very effective, and I can keep my wits and function pretty well mentally, but I do get a bit drowsy. Would definitely recommend it. No side effects.

I am supposed to use it until my surgery is scheduled either next week or the one after.  I originally was taken 2 pills (10-325) every 6 hours and upon my refill the oncall dr lowered the dose to 1/2 to 1 pill every 4-6 hours.  It was working wonders on the initial regimen, but getting little relief on the lower dose.  Will be talking to my dr as soon as he is back in the office.  USE CAUTION WHEN TAKING PAIN PILLS EVERYONE, PLEASE!

I first had my left hip replaced at age 35, next I had a lumbar laminectomy on L3-L1(3 levels). Then at age 40 my rt hip went bad and it too was replaced and I am now going on my 4th hip on that side along with another rt leg surgery for heterotoipc osification, bony tumors in my quad muscle from the trauma in that leg. All of these surgeries has cause severe hip &amp; right leg pain due to nerve damage and scar sever scar tissues. I went to see a pain management specialist and he has been performing caudal epidurals in my lumbar spine and prescribed MS Contin 30mg 2x a day with Norco 10/325 for &quot;breakthrough pain. At first he had me on Percocet for the breakthrough pain, that was effective for about 9 months but soon after it became ineffective and he switched me to the Norco which I say has been a God send. I still receive the epidurals every other month with the monthly pain med refills, these treatments have given me my active life back so that I may go to the gym and return to teaching martial arts.

This is a very effective and safe drug and is no more addictive than any other medication.  Use it responsibly and it can make life so much better.  MSM is a natural product that also relieves pain and swelling---get it at any health food store, often it will do the trick even without Norco.  But whatever you do, stay the hell away from the NAISDs.  They bleed your stomach and feed the greed of the drug industry.  Any Doctor who thinks NAISD's are okay and preferable to Norco is crazy, so find another doctor.
Pain	Erin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	10/8/2010 10:57:21 AM	I was given (2) norcos in the E.R. to the addition of Toridol, and the norco worked within 45 mins and completely relieved the pain in my neck, throat and body (From an unknown infection to my right tonsil).  About an hour after it started working I was so nauseous and sick to my stomach, I help back several boubts of gagging and vomiting until I could get home.  Once I got home and ate something, the nausea went away and I went to sleep.  Woke up in the morning with some nausea from these Norcos, but not as severe.  Works great for pain, you MUST take with a decent amount of food!!!!

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	25-34	10/5/2010 4:50:21 PM	I was hospitalized for five days for a severe sinus infection at age 27.  My Dr. at the time perscribed 10/325 Norco twice every 6 hours. (on top of IV pain medication, Delauded)  It was very effective for the pain, yet highly addictive. My old Dr. just kept re-filling the Norco months after I was released from the hospital without seeing me or talking to me other than 1 follow-up visit the week I was released.  I didn't realize that I was addicted until I tried to stop taking it.  I became violently ill: horrible migraines, vomiting, and a general feeling like I was hit by a bus.  I lasted less than 12 hours before deciding to take it again.  I have spent the last 8 months seeing a new Dr. and weaning myself off the drug.  He took me off slowly due to my chronic migraine issues and anxiety.  I went from 10mg twice every 6 hours down to 5mg once or twice a day slowly.  I could tell when the addiction broke.  I felt like the fog in my head lifted.  Today is my second day being off of it completely and although I am no longer in severe pain, I miss it constantly and the high I used to get from it.  I wonder if I will ever stop craving it.  Certainly it is effective for pain and I don't recall any side effects at all, but please be careful when using this drug.  I am just thankful that I didn't end up in in-patient re-hab or lose my job over this.  Please try something less potent and less addictive for pain before using such an addicitve narcotic.  I realize it is a godsend to chronic pain patients, but  unfortunatly for me, my Dr. went right to the max dosage for my 110 lb self, without even discussing addiction or trying less potent pain killers. Now, when I have real pain, the Norco does nothing. If it hadn't been for my willpower and research on my own...I don't know where I would be today.

I had better results of pain relief before the brands were switched. I don't understand why if something is working for a patient with chronic pain , the doctor suddenly changes the medications or usage of your pain reliever. In the long run you have to go back and make another appointment or run to various drug stores to find what you were changed to. In other words, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!Debbie Jones

Be very careful if you feel itchy or if your skin feels as if it is on fire.  Unfortunately that fiery problem was typical of my surgery, but the skin problems took place over my entire body, not in the localized area of my incision. Initially I was given Benedryl to relieve the symptoms.  But finally a doctor who was familiar with this particular side effect of this drug had it discontinued immediately.  Now I am on Darvocet, which doesn't work nearly as well, but does not have the risk of an allergic reaction or liver damage.
Pain	mindtrvlr, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	65-74	9/18/2010 10:58:19 PM	USE ONLY THE BRAND NAME OR THE GENERIC WATSON, WHICH LOOKS THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL. IT IS AN EXCELLENT PAIN RELIEVER, BUT THERE ARE GENERICS, OF IT OUT THERE  THAT DO PRACTICALLY NOTHING. There is something funny going on with generic norco, and this is something I think the average consumer should know. Different people respond differently to different manufacturer's norco generics. I personally prefer the Watson brand, and always find good, quick pain relief from them. However, two or three times I have had to fill the script I have at a different pharmacy and have gotten Qualitest brand instead. These do not work half as well. I could take double the amount of Qualitest to cut the same amount of pain as the Watson brand is able to eliminate. I once thought they were placebos and the other time I took them I thought I was in a flare because the pain was still so excruciating. Now I know it is simply a difference in brand. So know your brands, shop around, and don't always assume it's your body that is different. Not all generics are equal. If anyone else has noticed similar issues with different norco generic manufacturers, I would encourage you to share your thoughts, because I though my condition had worsened until I got online and did a lot of research.

Works well after about 30 mins. What I like most is, it does not affect my head. I cannot even tell I take it. Vicodan messes with my head and does not work as well for the pain. My wife who takes vicodan tried my norco and agreed. She also found it last longer
Pain	mylifesback, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	25-34	7/13/2010 5:37:33 AM	I am a male and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia since 2005 im 31 years old, and felt as if i was 81 i did not want to get out of bed i couldn't barely take the time to even play with my kids but was prescribed norco 5mg-325apap, and wow what a difference i feel like im getting my life back i DO NOT abuse my pills and will not take more than my doctor prescibed which is 1 to 2 a day im tellin you this pill has worked wonders i tried percocet once and that was enough for me i had a bad panic attack, and vicodin i have some trouble breathing, lorcet is actually i think the best because some reason i have no side effects at all with that, the norco does give me lots of energy which i don't mind but tonight for some reason which is like 12 hours after taking 1 and a half earlier im starting to have a little bit of trouble breathing and i am also prescibed xanax which i was really worried because the xanax wasn't helping because i believe i was having a panic attack its now like 1 and a half hours after taking my xanax im finally starting to calm down, but norco has by far worked the best for my pain and i like the face it has less tylenol in it so i don't ruin my liver, but i am definatley worried about withdrawl if my doc takes me off suddenly, but i was so happy i actually cried because i feel like my life has been coming back and love my doctor for giving me my life back, never tried fetanyl or methadone or oxycontin and i never ever would i am no drug addict by no means, but give norco a try IT WORKS GREAT FOR PAIN

It tends to take about 30 to 45 minutes to kick in, but when it does, I have no pain.  (I was prescribed the medication for chronic neck pain).  My only problem with this medication is that along with the relief of pain, about 3 hours or so after taking it, I have this burst of energy.  Also, if I take it even as early as 3 pm, I have problems going to sleep at night.  It seems to keep me awake.

My Dr.tried 20mg of morphine and after several months I quit takeing it because it did not help.  I stopped cold turky and had no problems.  I have had 18 ortho opperations with multiple joint replacements.  With four norco a day and three morphine a ady they provided little relif so what should I be taking?  I now need both feet worked on, knees replaced and they want to put in a morphine pump for my lower back.  Any advice? Jim Riberto

While I was in the hospital I was given very low doses of Diloden and complained that it was not relieving the pain.  I was switched to Norco Oral  10/325 and it helped some.  After being released from the hospital my script was for 2 tablets every four hours.  It seemed to work for about a hour and a half but then I was right back in the same severe pain again.  I spoke to my Doc and he said this was the best he could do.

Pain	45-54 Male  (Patient) 	2	3	3	Male	45-54	5/29/2010 12:58:01 PM	Have had numerous surgeries over the years and have been physically dependent on pain meds for years, ie. percocets 10mg x 9 day plus somas. I wanted to get off but couldn't.. Finally, I found Suboxone and went through all my withdrawls in an hour or two. Since then I've taken it to help keep me off the pain meds but at times I have to go back (depending on what injury is flaring up) to taking pain meds. Suboxone is a God-send. You don't toss and turn all night and feel like you're on fire. For those of you who have experienced this it is truly terrible. Anyway, don't be afraid to take pain meds and getting addicted. If you want to get back off of them after your pain subsides it is not a problem with Suboxone. I can't tell you how much I have benefited from both pain meds and Suboxone as I have been physically dependent/addicted to pain meds at various times of my life. But the bottom line is if you have to take pain meds, do so until you don't really have to, then seek out a Suboxone clinic (it is carefully regulated) and get free again from the pain meds. Suboxone has also helped somewhat with nominal pain for me. There is nothing wrong with taking pain meds to &quot;live&quot; your life. Just get back off them as soon as you can or they will destroy your life like some of the other comments have stated. With Suboxone, you're not chained to the meds and you can get yourself off them when you're ready and the base issues have been resolved through surgery or therapy. If you feel trapped and alone and always worried about having enough meds to make it through the month (like I have been), try Suboxone. It will help you overcome it without the nightmares of withdrawl. God bless and you're not alone

I have tried many other pain releivers and didnt work as effective. It is best to take the med before the pain gets worse. I can take it with or without food.  But I suggest to drink alot of water after taking the med. If taken for a long period of time and suddenly stop, the side effects are diarria, chills, and nausia. Talk to your Dr before stopping therepy. Iam very happy with this medication, and suggets to every one that has moderate to severe pain to try this medication. Like always keep it locked away so noone can abuse the prescription......
Pain	LPShuntgonebad, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/15/2010 1:32:09 PM	About 2 years ago I had LP shunt surgery and was given Norco 10/325 for my recovery.  Then recently I had severe pain, went to ER and was told my shunt was deviated.  The ER gave me oxy and sent me home.  I couldn't stand the oxy so my surgeon gave me Norco again to eleviate the pain until surgery could be scheduled.  Now with that being said, I have been on Norco almost 2 months straight now and haven't been scheduled for surgery.  It is a great drug but for those of us who would rather have the problem fixed then just be given something to hush us up it is important to keep on your dr.  I call my surgeon every other day to bug him....The effects of long time use are so not worth it.

I am Disabled,Hi blood pressure ,Iritable Bowel Syndrome) car accident ,5 herniated discs ,nerve damage,pinched nerved  ,bleeding ulcer (from taking Plavix for 2 weeks) had a heart attack in 2005 ,and have suffered from Cronic Anxiety/ANXIETY attacks since Childhood. Im no Dr , Im writing this from My expirences with pain/etc and Meds that help ME. and I &quot;cannot stand&quot; to see others suffer from pain ...its for alot of us stops your life and even small tasks are hard to do. I have just about NO &quot;Side Effects&quot; from the Pain meds that I have to take. It took me a while to get the right mix of meds to get , about %70 pain relief. We are ALL DIFFERENT .... meds word different for everyone.I am aware that most Meds can be habit forming or have side effects , but for me Im lucky. ( keep in mind ..sugar,caffiene/etc ,and so many other things are habit forming and/or bad for us)  I take 16 mg of hydromorphone every 4 hours ,for baqck,leg pain nerve pain (from the car accident) as well as  at times Ill take less and take 8mg hydromorphone(this med has NO Tylenol) with norco 10/325 ,and 1 Soma tab ,and it helps ,it even help me withthe tightness in my chest from the Anxiety.Once the pain meds wear off ITS SO BAD ,i sometimes cry because the pain is so bad( Im not embaressed to say ,and Im a grown man) The Many Dr's Ive seen over the yrs have all told me surgery is not an option , had surgery on my left arm because the nerve in my elbow was crushed in the car accident..the surgery just stopped the Atrophy from spreading. No other surgerys will help. even qwith the pain killers , I cant remember the last time I ever got a good night sleep , without waking up in pain. it saddens me alot (hey I am sensitive to people suffering) to read about people in severe pain  and even worse when

It helps the pain and he tries to take as little as posisble, and is probably not taking it correctly, but the worst side effect is the horrible anger and mood swings.  His Pain Management Dr. is of no help.  It's now gotten to the point where one of the Drs. lackeys just gives my husband a Rx and he's out the door for another 2 months.  Some Paint Management!! What is he managing?  Getting in as many patients a day as he can? When I go with my husband to his appts, I try to bring us his problems and side effects, but at that time, my husband is usually on good behaviour and downplays his problems, and they kind of laugh it off.  Next appt, I'm going to insist we see the Dr. and something is done about this.  My husband was not this bad on Oxycontin!

The side effects are minimal as opposed to the R.A. drugs they want to give you (cancer, stroke,gastrointestinal bleeding to name a few) After three years I do feel somewhat dependant on them. I do believe that this is a great treatment plan since there is no known cure for R.A. I did stop using them once to see how much pain I was in and it was substantial. Effective 90% of the time

Even when taken with a meal it made me very sick to my stomach.  Stopped taking it the day after surgery, being in pain was better than being on the verge of vomiting.  Have taken Vicodin in the past and it never made me ill.  Don't quite understand why Norco did.

I have come to the realization that I am now dependent and withdrawals start about every 6 hours.  I do not overdose. My whole body is in pain now and it is getting worse.  There is no way to just stop the meds....I have to find a way to detox......Be careful and always be in control of your own health care. Just because you take your meds as prescribed does not mean that you won't become dependent.

I have been to numerous Dr's and tried many of the pain medications out there.  Norco worked the best, and I tried a bunch of them. Some of the other pain medications costed me a lot for my co-pay, and then didn't work.  But I have heard of a lot of people getting addicted, so be careful.  Works great for me though!!  
Pain	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/8/2009 10:19:33 PM	I was surprised at how effective this drug was, and how little I had to take to obtain results for my chronic back pain. I too was afraid of addiction, but have had no problems. I can't believe anyone would write that it ruined their life. I feel it has saved me from surgery. My 92 year old mother, who would never take anything for pain, feels the same way. 
Pain	Al Noch, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	35-44	12/5/2009 12:03:28 PM	I began taking Norco 10/325 a few years ago after a car accident.  I'd had a bad lower back for about 10 years, but the accident left me with severe pain in my neck and shoulders as well.  For a year first round of Norco was not good! I was getting 90 a month, I was taking up to 3 a day, getting totally high and moody at work (thank goodness I was in sales and not operating a forklift)..and then coming down at night with a potent muscle relaxant called Flexiril. The Dr. wasn't doing anything to help accept prescribe more pills.  So I stopped going to see him, and now see another one who helps me with her Physical Therapist.  Now I may take one Flexiril every couple of months when my pain is tremendous, and take just ONE Norco in the morning, no more than that.  I feel I am dependent on it, as I get tired, and grouchy when I go a day without it.  But I can live with taking one a day for now.As many others say in these reviews, PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH THIS DRUG!  It is so easy to become addicted to it.  If you take more than one or at most two a day you are in danger of becoming a slave to it.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	11/1/2009 7:02:07 PM	I have chronic back pain, which goes into my neck and down my legs. It also causes pain in my knees and arms. This medicine works well for me &amp; takes away the pain. The only problem is it is highly addictive and the longer you are taking this medication, the less effective it is. This meaning over time you need to take more and more pills which increases your risk of dependency. Norco definitely helps me get through the day with minumum pain.

Using an average of five 10/325 tablets a day. Constipation side effects are the worst. I use fiber, Miralax and 2 stool softeners per day. If not, it's suppositories and enemas. Have to be sure and use Norco ahead of anticipated pain. Once pain starts, it's hard for Norco to break through. I was using Vicodin for about six months before the surgery and Norco gives more relief with fewer side effects.

I find that at higher doses (6)it is great for depression, and social anxiety.  When I run out it causes mild depression for 1 day or so then I don't miss it until my refill.
Pain	BrokenFirefighter, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	9/15/2009 3:03:24 PM	I am a disabled fire fighter I was hurt on the job. A roof fell ontop of me...anyways I have been thriough many surgerys and live with horrible pain. I have tried EVERYTHING!! and it ends up that I am alleric to most pain meds. I started taking Norco several years ago and it works great Its so wierd cuz I could take 6 percocets and it barely touches my pain I take 2-3 norco and it helps my pain so much. I do take 10-11 a day which is alot but i keep it under 12 a day on very bad days Thank god I have the same Dr who also did my surgerys ,when i tell other Dr.like my (PC)doc they flip out with the amout I take a day,but I dont take anything but the norco and ambian.My pain is overwhelming and its hard to just get up outta bed everyday if it wasnt for the norco I dont know what I would do. Alot of DRs nowadays dont understand PAIN So always be upfront with your Drs and clearly MAKE them understand what kind of pain you are in dont walk away with not being heard.I did that many years and lived with this pain until I just couldnt take it anymore. I mean and i am dealing with WC who just give me the worst time about paying for my meds. My career is over at 36 i shouldnt be denied basic things to just live like a normal person. I say to those trying norco try taking 1/2 at first and take it as directed I have seen may folks get all screwed up on this medication. Good luck to everyone out there with pain...sorry this was so long but i wanted to let people know they are never alone..Thanks for your time

At least on this med I can function and go on about my daily life without feeling &quot;drugged up&quot;.  At times, it does make me a little lightheaded but as long as I get up slowly, I am usually ok.  I absolutely reccomend this med to anyone suffering from severe abdominal pain relating to female abdominal pain!  It works wonders!

Pain	vegimite, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	8/27/2009 4:57:15 PM	I have been on Norco 10/325 for over 10 yrs now for osteoarthritis and a bad disk in my lumbar spine.  Though I have had to increase the dosage periodically over the years to maintain pain control, Norco is the best pain med for me.  I was tried on Morphine, Oxycontin and a couple of others, but Norco is the one that would allow me to actually function, since I had 2 kids in diapers and 2 in puberty when I was diagnosed.  I have had no side effects from Norco at all.  The one thing, however, is that there is a difference in the generics! The Watson brand (yellow tablet) is the one that works for me, but is now a special order from my medical plan.  For some reason the white Mallinkrodt(sp?) pill just doesn't work as well.  I have been told I will be on pain control for life, and Norco is the ticket.  The bad thing is that I am now at my daily maximum for acetaminophen and can no longer increase my Norco intake and will have to augment with other medications for breakthrough pain.  Please, WATSON, make a Norco with NO acetaminophen for those of us who need it!
Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	8/25/2009 2:17:43 PM	I have been taking Norco now for 4 months due to severe back pain, I have degenerative disc disease and I blew out one of my discs...most days it hurts just to get out of bed, let alone carrying on with life, i am constantly thinking about my back pain, i couldn't sit still..after I was diagnosed, they put me on NORCO,  I have tried tramadol as well, but that really makes me feel awful, cant eat, cant sleep, sucks..but the NORCO is a godsend, I take about 6 a day when I am in the most pain, I feel like a new person, it lets me do the things i want to do, exercise, play softball, golf, bowl, etc pain free..it does give you a boost and I can see how people can get addicted..I stopped cold turkey for about a week and there are definitely some withdrawal symptoms, mostly sweating, chills and general discomfort so be careful with it, but if used correctly, it can change your life...if you need to use pain meds..dont continually take norco, try and switch up so you dont get used to it or addicted, i was using tramadol and norco, but I dont recommend tramadol for severe pain, and if you want to eat normally, i just take tylenol on the days i dont take norco, it helps, but not like the NORCO...just be careful when using it

Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	8/3/2009 3:47:16 PM	I have been taking Norco 325 for about 3 years now.  I was diagnosed with MS about 11 years ago and never had the pain I currently have now.  I take 2 tablets every 6 hours.  I have noticed the drop in relief, so my doctor has also put me on a Duragesic Patch 100 mcg which I change every 48 hours.  I too like many others was scared of the possiblity of addiction at first, but I do have my life back now and that is priceless.  If the pain stops, I will stop the medication according to my doctors.  I believe if you truly need pain relief, there is nothing wrong with taking pain medications.  What other choice does one have to live and function like a normal person.  My only concern at this point is anyone new to the medication should only take the minimum amount needed to relieve the pain you are in at the time because you may need room to increase the dose as it may become less effective over time.  Be Well!!

Im being treated for lower back siatica disk damage. surgery is in my future but im trying to avoid that by all cost.

Pain	Allan, 55-64 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4		55-64	6/29/2009 2:49:36 PM	I have been taking Norco for 5 years to relieve chronic back pain from compression fracture of L4-5.It is more effective if taken before severe pain onset. My only side effect is constipation if I do not drink lots of water daily.It has made it possible to live my life again, mostly free of pain. Occasionally Iquit it for a day or 2 just to clear my body of all medications,-I have no trouble with any addictive feelings or mood swings as some have said.  It also contains less tylenol than vicodin, a concern with higher dosage. I need to take a high dose(1000/325) but am able to exercise and be mostly free of pain when taking it. I am still very active, enabled by beating the constant(chronic)pain I have without it

And if you snap them in half your only taking 175 Mg Tylenol for 5mg of Hydrocodone. It works - I'm glad my doc put me on this regiman.

Took norco the 1st day after surgery I took (1 pill every three hrs) 2nd day 1/2 pill every 4 hrs.  That afternoon I developed a bad headache, nausea, lightheadedness and could not eat for the next 8 hrs.  I stopped taking the noro and switched to regular tylenol.  The headache disappeared 8hrs later and the nausea got better also.  I'd rather deal with the pain versus feeling aweful.  My body just can't tolerate any type of a narcotic.

My Dr. initially persribed Darvocet, which didn't give me much, if any, relief.  Norco did the trick.  Only had to take 2 doses to get me through the first/worst day...then went back to the Darvocet.  Norco made me dizzy &amp; sleepy and did upset my stomach somewhat, but, it took care of my pain.

After a while rx becomes less effective, so I try to stop and use others awhile. Vicodine is too harsh for me, even 1/2 if I must for spasms. Arthritis is a tough one.

During the day I take a half of a Norco 10-325 every 2 hrs b/c I get a headache if not. It doesn't fully take away my pain, and I can't sleep using it at night. For the night, I take Morphine 30 mg. Nothing takes away the pain, just makes it a little more bearable to get through the day with the three kids and school. I had a 2 surgeries at L5-S1 and one at L4-L5 which left me with hypersensitivity in my leg. I have been in constant severe pain for 7 years. (Remember, it could be worse! I've been blessed!)

I've been given stronger meds such as dilaudid (sp?) but it was just too harsh on my stomach and made me itch constantly.  I take 1 10/325 every 4-6 hrs around the clock, meaning I will set an alarm to wake in the middle of the night if I'm sleeping, to keep my levels between 3 and 5 out of 10. If not for this med, I'd be at a constant 10 of 10!  I've had to now go see a &quot;pain specialist&quot; in order to get my medications, and most pharmacies (such as Walgreen's and CVS)here in TX will not fill the Rx from those clinics so I have to go to the fly by night pharmacies and pay 3x the amount it should cost, but when in pain, you do what you have to do.  It's a shame that people in real pain have to go to such extremes because there are those out there who just want to &quot;get high&quot; and don't really need the meds.  I just paid almost $150 for a month's supply of 120 today!  That's highway robbery!  But I'm just grateful that I can still afford it for now and treat my pain, because without it, I could not function normally whatsoever.  Just drink plenty of water, exercise often and take no more than prescribed and you'll be fine.

Pain		4	4	4			2/17/2009 1:29:23 PM	This drug is very addictive!  doctors prescribe this like its candy. Just as they do vicodin.  If your in pain, its likely because you have other symptoms that can be dealt with naturally.  These drugs are all very harmful and watching someone go through withdrawal is gut wrenching.

Then I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia last year.  I have since quit taking the norco, trying only the lyrica, but I am still having alot of pain.  Over all, the norco worked better for me than any of the other medications.  I absolutely hate oxycoton; it does not work for me and leaves me disoriented.  With norco, I could do things again.  But, I am giving this lyrica every oportunity first before asking for the norco back.

The pain is lessened since the surgery but I couldn't make it without the Norco for breakthrough pain.  I take 1-2 every 4 hours like clockwork and it seems to be helping,

No one had insurance, I was on a bicycle, now I have nerve damage to my left shoulder, and my knee. Norco was helping me greatly. But the the DEA took care of that, I could only go to Drs that would bill me everyday its an effort just to get out of bed, and these crooks ruined it for myself and the only pain medication that helped me. Before they start labeling people, you think thay'd use there heads and find out why someone is taking this pain medication. But no they just ruin you and the ones that use this medication for Fun, they keep having fun, and people like myself live in the most horrible pain ever, I cannot afford insurance so I could stay with one Dr. so thank you DEA for making whatever time I have here on earth for screwing me, and god knows how many other people in severe pain with your little red flags. But I bet you boys can get what ever you want.

After 4 days of using this pain medication and on a skedual whether I needed it or not, the pain becqame undercontrol and my life became more normal and was more easy to fight condition causing the pain. Thanx to my Doctor!!! She believed me, new I needed pain med and gave it. The doctor before her did nothing. She let me suffer and cry and crawl in pain till I fired her and got this new one! Thank God there are still doctors that know Pain pills are not the enemy, it's the users. Now I take one pain pill in morning and usually need no more. Soon it will be none I hope, but with Shingles and rheumatoid arthritis, one never knows.

Refills were endless for more than 3 years, while consuming 6-8 per day. Great for pain, terrible for life. Withdrawal was 72 hours + of absolute hell! The thought of withdrawal scared me from quitting. My Dr. felt like a dealer after a while. Still in pain, but not addicted. Careful what you wish for, a stoned existence is a waste.

After finding myself in the ER at 3 in the morrning, the Doctor wrote me a script for this med. It really works in conjuction with the antibiotics. Overall I am very pleased with this med for my sinus infection, it really takes the pain away.

Pain	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/26/2008 6:28:24 AM	I was given a small &quot;starter&quot; bottle of Norco to take home  from the ER following an accidental injury. The injury was very painful, and the Norco was very helpful in relieving both the acute pain of the wound and the body aches that followed. After the sample (10 pills) ran out, I had to get a new prescription for pain relief medication from my doctor while the wound was still healing, but the Norco did a great job of holding me over in the meantime.
Pain	kgermani@comcast.net, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/21/2008 6:57:38 AM	I have taken Norco 10/325 for several years for Crohn's Disease and Fibromyalgia.  I prefer it to other meds such as Avinza (Morphine time release).  I just works best for my pain levels (6-8).  Some people just can't take it (makes them feel jumpy/hyper).  Everyone is different so not everyone is going to have the same response. Make sure to not only talk to your doctor, but do some research! Read reviews!  YOU are ultimately responsible for your health.  Be assertive and ask questions. I take 1-2 tabs every 6hrs.  I KNOW I am addicted.  I'll deal with that when the time comes, but it beats being bed-ridden.  Even with the Norco I have bad days that keep me in bed.  Remember to start with small dosage, even if it's 1/2 tab every 6 hrs until you know how you'll respond.  Good luck and God Bless.

I started taking it approx 2 years ago for severe back problems.  This drug is like alchol the more you take the more you need to continue to get the same desired affect.  At my highest i was taking over 60 milligrams a day.  I became physically dependant on it and have lost my career because of this drug.  The withdraw symptoms were horrible and i would not wish them on anyone.  I currently am enrolled in rehab.  Great for pain, just be careful with this drug please.

Face was on fire and my cheeks actually felt almost bruised like they'd been slapped. The pain it helped wasn't adequate to offset the pain it caused so I quit taking it.

Pain	fibrohero, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/9/2008 4:00:09 PM	I have been taking Norco for years for treatment of Fibromyalgia and RSD pain (plus a few other fun things). I have fairly severe nerve damage and the pain is horrendous without meds. Before I found a doctor who would actually treat my pain, I wanted to give up. Taking the meds gave me back my life. I had to deal with the predjudice people have against people who take long-term pain meds and had to get over the fear of addiction. When the meds lose their effectiveness, I have my doc change me to a different med for a month or so and then switch back to the Norco. I have found that it just works the best for me. I have tried oxycontin, but have found that taking it longer than a few weeks the side effects are too severe. If you are taking Norco short-term, the risk of addiction isn't so bad. If you are taking this (or any narcotic) long-term, just be smart about it. If you find you are seeking other drugs or doctors, check yourself and get help if you need it. If you have a long-term illness like I have, get over the fact that you have to take narcotics and make the others in your life get over it, too. Norco gave me back my life. I appreciate the fact that there is something with few side effects that can help me this much.

I was originally taking Darvocet N-100 and it was helping some, but then was switched to Norco 325. It worked very well with me only taking 1 tab. 3X a day. Now I can't function good without it and am waiting for my refills which have been delayed. I've experienced minor withdrawl symptoms which are worse for me at night &amp; nothing helps my pain as well as the Norco did.

Pain	Zigie's dad, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/9/2008 9:11:37 PM	I was taking Norco 10/350 for about a year for lower back/leg pain. After a while, effectivnes started to diminish and found myself taking more to maintain... 3-4/day. After a year, wanted to see if I could do without it, but had developed somewhat of a phys/ mental dependency. Went to Dr. and here is what we did. Slowly started to reduce amount taken by approx 1/2 pill every 5 days. It took some willpower and a determination to quit, but it worked. In about 20-25 days, you're done. To help with some of the withdrawal side effects, I used Ibuprofen 600mg 1-2/day and .5mg of Ativan/lorezapam 2/day and then slowly took less of those. Drink lots of water and exercise if possible. Toward the end, I was taking 1/2 Norco about 1 -2 hrs before bedtime and didn't get the restless legs. Overall, Norco worked for me, but be carefull, one can really start to like the opiate high and sense of euphoria. I can see how someone with a compulsive personality can get into trouble with this stuff after several weeks. In general, it takes about 3 weeks to develope a dependency and about 3 weeks to reverse it. Again, the reversal took a moderate amount of willingness to do so, but wasn't really that difficult or uncomfortable.

I was prescribed lortab 10/500 for the last year. For about 5 years before I was prescribed Lorcet 10/650 by a previous &quot;Pain Specialist&quot; I have taken norco for one month after my Dr's worries about too much &quot;tylonel&quot; in my medication. I'm sorry to say that this medication is a huge drop in effectiveness from lorcet, The concern is that in 10 years if i were to continue such a high dose of &quot;Tylonal&quot; {acemethasomething} I would need a liver transplant A little info for those who may be wondering why they may have been prescribed this medication in the same way.

Side Affects; rash, itch, ache eyes (like hangover/dehydration) I took lots of water, No BM in over 6 days, massive gas, urine control (may be surgery related?). I was also prescribed Docusate Sodium to ward off constipation, some of the side affects may be from that. What ever they were putting in my IV was better.

Began with 5/500 Vicodin from Dr - then moved up to Norco 10/350 because less acetomenaphen (sp?) and I can cut in 1/2 and save money. These work much better at cutting off most severe neck pain faster than 'weaker' vicodin. Less of the nonnarcotic pain reliever in the pills is less of a danger to stomach/liver. My MD is very liberal with Rx - but will make me stick to my schedule if I try to refill early, usually, unless it is the occasional VACATION SUPPLY. If you need in an 'emergency', that is a good request to make. You can even rebill your insurance b/c an early refill is often not covered - you submit paperwork and they *should* reimburse you. I take 5 - 7 NORCO 10/350 per day and I can function, drive, dress, shower and not be totally stressed and upset because of severe pain. Good luck and I'm sorry this is so long - just wanted to share details/tips.Only downside is that I have to be careful to enuciate my words, as I can tend to speak slower (not slurry) when on these (or any Rx painkiller. Hang in there.

I now have some painful spinal problems that affect my leg and hip, and although I've read that Norco/Vicodin aren't supposed to be effective for that, it certainly is for me.  I've been taking it for years (once a day in the A.M.) and I wouldn't be able to work without it.

Pain	onedovehawk, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	4/27/2008 10:51:08 AM	I have had a pinched nerve and then after one plus years it was finally diagnosed and surgery performed. But, then the nerve was still rubbing up against a disc and was causing even more pain then before, had another surgery, still hurting, I had been taking percocet for over a year so just a few weeks ago, my doctor switched me to norco. It works much better acutally gives me enough relief to get through the day, Can I take ibuprofen with this norco? My doctor said norco does not have tylenol in it like vicoden does?

Pain	fancyauntie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/4/2008 3:03:12 PM	I have been taking Norco 10/325 &amp; 7.5/325 for years, I guess overall it did the job, but over the past 2 years the pain has gone from worse to unbearable. I am currently using the Fentanyl Patch 100mcg and taking both strengths of Norco for breakthrough pain, and unfortunately nothing is working anymore. Side effects for me were constipation, numbness and tingling in hands, swelling in ankles and feet, ringing in ears, and itching.

Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	3/18/2008 12:02:40 AM	I had a bad ankle accident and was prescribed Norco for pain, and it was a life saver.  Worst pain I have had thus far, and not long after they gave it to me in the ER I was feeling great. I was a bit dizzy and so on, so it should be taken with food, and I also experienced weird dreams. A few days after taking the drug, I found that I had to take two pills for it to work effectively. In all, it worked well.

Now taking NORCO for the pain, gives me a funny nauseated feeling, also could be more effective on the pain. When taking before going to sleep, unable going back to sleep after waking up in the middle of night. Also causing the weardest dreams. Recommend taking with food directly before goimg to sleep, should keep pain away and you sleeping for approx. 5-6 hours.

Pain	pokerpro, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/22/2008 4:34:45 PM	I had surgery on the nerves in my elbow and lower arm.  I was on Norco for 3 months for pain folling the surgery and it worked very well for me.  The surgery was not a success but norco controlled the pain from the nerves regenerating themselves, which makes you feel like your arm is on fire, extremely painful.  The only problem I had with norco was the fact that it did give me very vivid nightmares, which I hadn't had since I was a child, and also the feeling that if I wasn't careful I could become addicted, because other than the nightmares there were no side effects,which is not the case with me when I take Vicodin, which makes me feel either sick to my stomache or hung over the next day, as if I had been out drinking.  Overall I think norco is very effective and would use it again.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/18/2008 11:40:19 PM	I've taken this for about the last 3 yrs for endometriosis and chronic back pain.  I'd been on the 7.5/325 dosage for 2 1/2 yrs then had to move up to the 10/325 dosage due to it having become less effective.  I've never had an issues taking it on an empty stomach, and that's the best way to do so for the effectiveness to remain the same.  My dr and I both agree that I'm at a low risk for dependency due to the way I take my meds., so I haven't had to worry about that either.  I used to take vicodin 7.5/750 and switched to Norco to lessen the chances of liver damage down the road. Many ppl feel that this is a very strong drug, but in the ultimate scheme of things it's really not.  There are many meds that are stronger on the market (eg OxyContin, Fentynol) and when combined with NSAID's its effects are that much better. I have found that most GP's and family drs will refer u to see a pain mgmt dr for ongoing treatment, and they want to see u every 2-4 wks for refills.  If u have ongoing conditions this can get costly, but the medicine is worth it to relieve ur pain. I highly reccommend it for anyone who needs pain relief and has a fear of addiction.

Pain	GM47wa, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	55-64	2/15/2008 11:50:04 PM	I was just put on this today (Norco 325-10MG Tab) to replace Loritab 10mg. The doctor said it was better because it doesn't have as much Tylenol in it as Loritab 10's that can cause Liver trouble on down the road. If anyone has used both these pain-killers, would you please let me know which is best for spinal cracked vertebre pain.   Thanks,

I have been taking Norco which is really helping with the pain.  The side effects include itching and sleeping is not great.  The pain never fully goes away but at least it is dulled a lot.

Pain	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	2/3/2008 11:42:49 AM	I have been taking this for about a year and it seems to work well, the only draw back is, it seems that my body gets immune to the dosage and then I take more for the same pain relief effect. I wish there was something ou there that I could take for my diverticulosis that would subside the pain and let me live a normal life. I am afraid that after taking Norco for so long that it will stop working for me and then there won't be anything thing out there that is as strong and easy on my stomache as Norco.

This is the first pain reliever I've tried that actually takes all the pain away! It makes me pretty &quot;dopey&quot; though, so I only take it at night... however, sometimes I have a hard time falling asleep afterwards or have very bizarre dreams...not sure if those are side effects, but I'm willing to put up with them since it helps with the cramps so much.

Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	12/8/2007 3:23:21 PM	Norco and Viccadin.  Not sure how to spell that, bot effect everyone differantly.  Personally for my back pain I find norco to help.  I am not sure why but generic watson brand works best for me.  The side effects for me are not really much other than a calming feeling.  Watch not to get addicted to the pill.  Some get sleepy, some get sick, some get high.  Personally those feelings depend on the person.  Take on with food and see, then you will know how your body reacts.  also I would try to take as low of a dose as possible as the body builds up a resistance to it and increasing the dose is necessary long term.  All in all it is a good drug if you can take it.  I can tak it on an empty stomach and it works even better.  This drug is the same thing as viccodin only stronger in a sense that you can take more hydrocodone and not so much tynol and save your liver a bit.  If it works it is a good drug, take it as prescribed and you should not be in much pain, if you are tell the dr and ask him to increase your dose.

Plus has reduced the nausea caused from taking so many pills to get the same amount of hydrocodone which had a high combined amount of acet.

I still have the pain, sometimes severe, after two back surgeries.  I find that Norco is, at most, able to moderate the pain, not eliminate it.  I think my body does not react to pain relievers as much as others, since my husband gets dizzy with Tylonol Three, while I feel no effect.
