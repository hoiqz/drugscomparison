Constipation to the point of being hospitalized has happened more than just a few times. Have been taking Relistor for almost 2 years now. Its great. I use it every day along with Amitiza and generic stool softeners.  I do not go every day but usually every other day.  Only problem so far is sometimes it gives me the runs non stop. Would rather that than the pain, vomiting, bleeding and almost passing out due to the constipation.  Dont know long term info on this but I will take the chances. Recommend it with other meds, Miralax, Amitiza, stool softners, etc.

At first, the results were great but now not so much.  Can anyone suggest something that would help me. Thank you

After using it and feeling so much better, I must write this.  I now see a pain management specialist after being given opiates by my back surgeon for years.  I am not end stage anything and not to have been given this years ago is just a crime.  I have been on strong pain meds with only laxatives and enemas for relief.  There is no shortage of pain medications that are prescribed every day so why is this saved only for those who are end stage?  When I first used Relistor, it was too good to be true and it has worked every time.  A laxative is usually needed to get parastalsis going, but it not a concern as to whether I will get relief or not.  Relistor does work and works well.  It seems that not enough info is given to doctors, ie, surgeons and pain manangment physicians. I told my doctor about what I had read and he needed to look it up in the PDR. He wrote a script with no hesitation. This information should be made known to all physicians, especially those who prescribe opiates and whose patients are having the constipation that goes with taking the much needed pain medication prescribed. Inform  physicians that this medication does exist and one does not need to be dying to get the relief that Relistor provides.  Ask as I did and I will bet that most prescribing physicians are not aware that Relistor exists or of just how Relistor can give back some quality to life. My own physician, as I said needed to look up the drug. Treating intractable pain is hard enough, but the constipation can be taken away easily with Relistor.   
Opiate Pain Medication causing Severe Constipation	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/1/2011 6:25:35 AM	After years of constipation and always feeling bloated and not wanting to eat as I should, I came upon this med by accident.  It is a miracle.  I will be on pain meds because of back surgeries probably for the rest of my life.  I do take sennokot S and miralax with it and I use Relistor daily to avoid any slowing of the smooth muscle of my intestine.  It works for me in 10-15 minutes.  My physician sees no reason not to use it every day since there is no risk of dependency unlike strong stimulant laxatives. With chronic back pain, being constipated is one less problem I now deal with.  This should be offered to EVERY patient who takes opiates, rather than having to depend on laxatives which may or may not work and which will cause cramping. Loose stools is the least of my concerns.

Finally, after being correctly diagnosed by a GI MD from the University of Louisville medical school. I was treated conservatively--laxatives, stool softeners, huge doses of natural fiber, etc.--with little effect.  The application requires injections into the thighs; however, as a diabetic, I'm used to administering Rx via hypodermic needles. Although it can be slightly uncomfortable at times, compared to the fissure- and hemorrhoid-inducing stools and 1.5-hour long trips to the bathroom, which also exacerbate my back spasms and pain, the pain of the shot is nothing to worry about. It is highly recommended that you maintain the use of stool softeners because you may be able to use the injections every 3rd or even 4th day, an important consideration given the expense of this medication. You will have to test its effectiveness on your own. This is a wonder drug if you've suffered the type of constipation described by me and others who require the use of large doses of opiate-based pain medications to live a somewhat normal life. Relistor works extremely well if you can afford it and get a proper diagnosis.

Was doing 2-3hrs of enemas a day. Now do 1 shot 12mg/.6ml every other day. I use Equate (Walmart) stool softener &amp; suppositories. This medicine is giving me my life back. Remember this drug, however, reverses all opiods in the system. This was a shock. Pain that was unbelievable. My system is adjusting. Started taking this drug in June 2009. You never know if it will work in 5 minutes or 1 day. I move around to get it to work faster. My hair is getting brittle. Is this one of the side effects? Not sure. This just came up 2 days ago. I tap the needle since it hurts so much. I don't just keep pushing the syringe. If you stop &amp; go I can tolerate it much better.If I take the shot &amp; am having trouble, I use suppositories. They help.

Due to chronic abdominal pain as a result of end-stage live disease and AIDS, I finally caved and went the opioid pain reliever route.  At first, I was prescribed Lactulose and Amitiza, but they seemed to &quot;poop out&quot; (couldn't help it-LOL) and became ineffective.  So, 8mg injection this morning around 11:30 and no effect yet and it's 6:30pm.  I do have a MAD headache and horrible pain now in my lower back.  I will try perhaps a stool softener and hopefully things will start to happen.

Took 3 hrs to complete objective. Some crapping and general discomfort, vomiting,completly exhausted,headache but it worked. I ate a light dinner, cereal for breakfast. Start the whole thing again, only this time I'll do a dose tomorrow.

Also, I had to stay on the stool softeners in order to get the most effective treatment; otherwise, the brick-like consistency was not going away. However, since I was vomiting as a result of the severity and quantity of the constipation, anything that helped create bowel movements was needed and appreciated. I suspect that I need to be on a regular dose for this to work as it should.

Constipation is a painful side effect for most people, but because I suffer from chronic pelvic pain, constipation is extremely painful for me.Unfortunately natural and/or gentle laxatives were not strong enough for me, and strong laxatives were too hard on my system, so nothing was working for me... until now.Although it is too soon to say for certain, it appears that Relistor has answered many of my prayers.  I have just started the treatments and so I am just taking a little less than the 4 ml dose, and am only taking it twice a week.  But so far, each time I have had my shot, I have had a normal bowel movement within one hour afterwards.The down side, is that I am deathly afraid of needles.  But if it continues to work, it is a fear I will overcome.  As far as shots go - it is a thin needle and the kits come with great a little disposable, retractable needle and vial that makes it very easy to administer... unless... like me...  you are a baby with needles!  Of course I am worried as Relistor is so new, and I am worried about whether this is a long term solution.  I am very eager to see continued research as it is shared with us. Ultimately, I wish I did not need the pain meds, and then I wouldn't need the Relistor.  But unfortunately, right now that is not an option for me.  So until my medical team comes up with a better solution, I have found a way for my stomach to be able to tolerate the pain meds.  Overall, if you are struggling with constipation as a result of pain medications, this very well could be the solution for you... it has been for me.~Chronic Pelvic Pain Sufferer
Other	kajones177, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	8/24/2008 8:17:14 PM	The intended use stated in the pt handout, PDR and online is misleading and could cause some pts to refuse the tx. I have a pt hospitalized now with Ogilvie's Syndrome that took some convincing and explaining off-label use of meds. There are many other conditions this is used to treat but in todays environment with this pork-barrel &quot;War on Drugs&quot;, just to mention narcotics causes most patients to refuse the meds for fear of being looked upon as a &quot;drug user&quot; or after they hear the word narcotic, all they know is addiction. Considering most pts are elderly, after all the brainwashing by the FDA, mention narcotic, their almost autotomic response is NO! I'd suggest making it clear to your patients what off-label use of these drugs means and why it says narcotics. This pts idea of heavy narcotic use if 5mg OxyIR bid, and she feels guilty if she takes one at night because &quot;she had one that morning&quot;. This is with a broken elbow implant, terrible cramps and pain from gastric problems, an NG tube, multiple IVs, the dr gives her 1000mg Tylenol for pain, once gave her Toradol/Tylenol, but she's afraid she's becoming addicted because &quot;they started me on this medication because they said I take narcotics and that's why I'm sick&quot;. This is ridiculous-too many reasons for peristolosis interference other than narcotic usage. Come on Wyeth, you paid enough to get the FDA to fast track it in March instead of the usual seven year research, surely you can come up with better indications for usage! Really disappointed in Wyeth-but then again, they've already made their money back from Medicare Part D (the retail cost went up 300%)!
