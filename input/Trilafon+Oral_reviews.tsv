I still after 3 years continue to suffer the side effects related to this medicine after being off it (i.e. sun sensitivity, irregular period (1 per 3 months), irregular heart beat (racing), sexual problems (i.e. pain in certain areas and lack of sexual fluids mainly), and eye twitches in my right eye (more so when angry or upset but do have twitches when I feel fine)) just to name a few.

This was before SSRI medications were available.  I was also prescribed Haldol, though I was not violent nor was I hallucinating or out of control.  I developed galactorrhea (breast milk) which continued until I went through menopause, and while taking this medication could not stay awake more than 6-8 hours a day, had trouble urinating, trouble reading, trouble focusing my eyes and felt overmedicated.  This is a dangerous drug if used for anything other than psychoses or severe problems.  I am listing my age as the age I was when I received this medication, not the age I am now.

Schizophrenia	Bibi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/24/2010 10:33:06 AM	I have schizoaffective disorder and I was showing symptoms of beginning a mental breakdown where the meds that I had been taking for a few years that were effective in my treatment had a breakthru and I was experiencing extremely high mania; not sleeping for 4 days straight, eating very little, talking fast and excessively, making poor decisions and my behavior was not appropriate for social situations (even talking to friends on the phone or chatting on the computer).I began to crash in to a deep depression and put my children in family care of my loved ones, gave my puppy away to someone?, fell asleep for 3 days straight and when I awoke called my psychiatrist who immediately started me on Trilafon. Typically I would have been in the hospital within days and for no less than a 6 week visit.  I called my psychiatrist everyday and he monitored my progress over the phone reassuring me all the way.  Within a week I could feel my thoughts clear and the physical distortion that pulled at my (head/brain) also affecting my eyesight and heavy depressive symptoms including manic and depression at once where I wanted to sleep for days while I also wanted to socialize endlessly on the computer.  By two weeks I was back to &quot;normal&quot; and functioning perfectly caring for my 1 year old and other 2 young children by myself.  After about 3 months I lowered this med down from 12 mg to 2 mg.  I have stayed on 2 mg during the rest of the year.It is Spring again, I have had some symptoms that could lead in to this again. I have raised my dosage to 4 mg to see if this offsets the nauseated feeling I have; which often times is a first symptom for me that I need my meds adjusted.  Today I feel better mood and physical wise.  We'll see how this goes and I am check in with my psychiatrist about this as well.

I can use it every single night without her fearing I might become addicted, since I suffer from addiction issues along with depression and anxiety. I'm surprised to see what's it's intended uses are for, as I don't need it for any of those reasons. She is always prescribing medications &quot;off book&quot;. So be warned, this medicine will absolutely make you tired, I am an insomniac and this puts me right to sleep.
