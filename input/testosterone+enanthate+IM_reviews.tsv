Testosterone cypionate crystalizes in 10 ml bottles whereas enanthate doesn't.

It never worked well for me and stopped working all together a few months ago. I switched to 100mg/week of TE and now wish I had been on injections the whole time. My T levels went from 365 to 731 and I feel 100% better.  Endurance, muscle mass, and libido have improved dramatically and ED has almost disappeared in just 3 months.

Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	25-34	5/21/2010 9:25:25 PM	I have been in treatment for about 2 1/2 months using both the androgel for 1 1/2 (daily 5mg) and now I have received three shots of 100mg of testosterone without results using any of the two methods. I will start my next appointment with an injecition of 200mg and kind of scare about this increase in the treatment.

Helped with sleep &amp; concentration &amp; mood.  Libido still low but otherwise beneficial.  Have a tingling in upper back that I haven't found an answer for.  Overall, satisfied.

I have used the testerone replacement patch and the gel, with little effect.  But I have been using the injection for two weeks now and I have seen a big difference in many areas in my daily activities.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/24/2009 8:57:06 PM	I am a 49 year old female who has been treated for Chronic Fatigue &amp; Fibromyalgia for about 13 years.  I had a complete hysterectomy 15 years ago and always felt that my problems were related to hormone imbalance. Even though I have an OB-Gyn prescribing progesterone, estrogen, DHEA, &amp; testosterone, I was finally prescribed this testosterone and WOW!  Suddenly I feel good again &amp; want sex!  I have felt lousy for so long, this is just incredible!  I started on 1cc per week, and now take .3cc per week plus a cream.  I feel like I'm 30 again.  Maybe my husband needs some to keep up with me.
Deficiency of Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone	Wayne, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/22/2008 10:51:11 PM	I am a 45 year old man utilizing 2 cc's a week and I feel Great! No hair loss, libito &amp; erections like I was a kid.  In addition, I had previously taken Ambian CR because I couldn't sleep.  Within (3) weeks at 2 cc's (2) units in a 5 ml syringe, I was/am sleeping like a baby without the ambian CR!  I have further benifited by a dramatic sence of wellbeing.  
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	35-44	1/23/2008 12:35:52 AM	I was percribed this to replace my test. levels.  As they were lower than average causing some problems.  My symptoms subsided but my hair started to fall out and I could only sleep for four (4) hours a night. I gained very little weight and was taking 250mg in 1cc per week.  It helped to resolve some but not all the problems I was having.
