Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	3/11/2011 11:07:42 PM	Second round of chemo for my husband. This time he's being given carboplatin IV along with Alimta IV. First time in 2006 he was given Carboplatin IV, Avastin and had to take Tarceva daily (pill form).Too soon to tell if this combination is effective. His appetite is good, no nausea, no hair loss this time. Will do x-ray later this month and go for third treatment. One more treatment after that. I believe in &quot;miracles&quot;. This thing called &quot;cancer&quot; will go into remission.

Now he has anemia and neutropenia? but neither are in dangerous category.  His appetite is starting to come back and he has only a little nausea with Alimta.  So far we are very pleased, but he will have scans after his next round on the 23rd of Nov. 2010 and we will better know how it's doing.  Renegade, is this your first time Chemo or maintenance or just second line Chemo?

My cancer was tumors around the lymph nodes of my bronchial tubes. So far, no serious side effects other than a little tiredness.  Have had 2 PET scans and both results have been NO CANCER! PRAISE GOD!

Noticed some weakness and ill feelings starting 4 days after treatment and lasting for a week.  Had nausea but proton pump inhibitors worked fine.  Am starting Tarseva so must eliminate Prevacid and find another means to control vomiting
Other	freeme, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		11/24/2009 3:15:35 PM	I have all the classical symptons. It has zaped me from the start. I have taken one dose with the next one in a week. Never have I been so weak. Hoping this drug helps me and others.Wondering if the drug is worth the pain.Perhaps if the outcome is good I will report differently, but if it doesn't then taking this isn't worth all the suffering. I rather just let the cancer take its course and let the life cycle end.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	kingden, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	55-64	7/6/2008 9:55:00 PM	It's hard for me to rate Alimta because I've only had 1 treatment.  This is my second chemo session.  My cancer was only in remission for about 6 months.  I have a ton of mouth sores and I also have a skin rash.  I'm somewhat depressed, but I think that's more from the fact that I have to go thru chemo again more than the drug causing the problem.  I;m also very tired.  I hope tht this time works for me and I pray that I never have to have chemo again.  I'm praying that Alimta does the trick, no matter what the side effects.
Other	mgmsr, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	65-74	3/19/2008 8:06:29 AM	I've had it twice and all I can see is that the lymph Nodes in my neck are getting bigger and more sore, and my COPD has gotten worse.  Two days before my first treatment I did 20min on a treadmill and lifted weights for 1/2 hour, and did Cardio after that for 20min.. Now I can't walk across the  room.
