Painful Periods	Cin, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	5/10/2012 9:03:29 AM	I use this medication for severe menstrual pain and it has worked great. I have to take it before the pain gets too bad because if I wait until I am in killer pain, the medicine takes too long to start working. Overall I would recommend it.

Pain	wildangel, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	8/28/2011 9:57:15 AM	Helps with the sciatic pain from spinal stenosis but about 5-6 hours after taking I get terrible gas pains and heartburn.  Talked to Pharmacist today and he suggested taking Prilosec with it but I don't know if I want to take so many meds..  Will wait and talk to Dr. and probably stop taking the Zipsor as the stomach pain is worse than the back pain it is helping.

I have taken several anti-inflamatory drugs (with not much success)and 2 injections in my heal. Pain and inflamation was bad in the morn and would get worse during the day. My Dr. give me a sample of Zipsor and within hours the pain was getting better. After 1 week the pain and inflamation is almost gone.

I have severe pain in my feet and could hardly walk for any length of time.  I take only one pill a day and I am able to walk normal and not limp and grit my teeth like I had previously.  I love the fact I can get up in the morning and walk without pain.

Pain	TH, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	4/14/2011 5:20:48 PM	I injured the pyriformis muscle playing golf and developed the pyriformis syndrome with acute sciatica.  The pain was almost unbearable. Zipsor took about an hour to start to work but it worked great as a pain killer and anti-inflamatory.  Had no side effects, drowziness or sleepiness like I have with other pain killers. It does give a mellow feeling which seems to relax me to a comfortable degree.

I was prescribed a combination of Zipsor and Skelaxin.  The combination provided no discernible reduction in pain.  However, I did experience substantial stomach and intestinal pain.  The gastrointestinal pain ceased within 12 hours of the last dose of Zipsor.  Overall, this was a rather unpleasant experience.

Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	9/5/2010 5:18:33 PM	I was given a sample by my orthopedist to see if it would help with a congenital and degenerative neck problem. Then I was given a prescription, it worked for a little while, but the effectiveness is on the weak side. I am still in a great deal of pain, even with the current dosage of 4 pills a day. My pain did subside for the first couple of weeks, but has returned to ranging from 5 to 10 on a daily basis. Looks like it's back to square one for me.
