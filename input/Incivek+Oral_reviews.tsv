Chronic Hepatitis C	Grateful.CB1961, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	6/29/2012 5:41:30 AM	Diagnosed with hep C around 1997 give or take.  I started the triple therapy on Christmas night 12/25/11.  I just completed the treatment on 06/01/12.  I took the incivek 3x daily, ribavirin 2x daily and pegasys shots once per week on Fridays.  In 4 weeks the virus had cleared my body and has remained clear.  Side effects for me were the rashes periodically, I had a hard time taking the 20 grams of fat 3x daily, but I did it.  The anal itching and anal pain was a biggy for me. Very painful at times.  I only had one episode for a week of the flu like symptoms where my body ached and I could hardly walk.  I was able to take Aleve, and it solved the problem.  Overall, I did not experience the horrific side effects that are talked about, but I know people that did.  I am now waiting on my 6 month f/u to ensure that my body has maintained the viral load of (undetectable).  God Bless Everyone, and do what you have to do for yourself.

Chronic Hepatitis C	Cowboy, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Male	55-64	3/30/2012 8:21:13 PM	Most brutal thing I've ever gone through. 4 trips to ER because I couldn't catch my breath and thought I was having a heart attack as well as a severe allergic reaction that caused my face to swell and turn bright red. The cough, shortness of breath, anemia,fatigue and severe rash from head to bottom of the feet was unbearable, just to mention the rough side effects. Finished the 12 weeks of incivek but Dr stopped all treatment as a result of the allergic reaction. Doing weeekly blood work to measure viral load but so far, it's maintaining negative. Not sure that I would do this again after these side effects. The Hep C I have was dormant and the treatment almost killed me.

Was not able to eat in order to take med. I have lost 36lds in 2 months.Since I stopped I have barely eaten any food in the past 6 days. I get very weak, dizzy and tired.

Not able to taste any food and sometimes not able to take med because of it along with the nausea. Body is weak and short of breath even walking in house. It is hard I'm trying to hang in there for next 5 weeks, I'm trying.

My biggest problem is not having any taste for food. Sometime because of the nausea I'm not able to take it. I have very dry skin and get very weak and tired when walking in house or going out. I am trying to hang in there. This treatment (now with the incivek) for me is very hard.
Chronic Hepatitis C	RABBIT, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	45-54	2/15/2012 2:17:25 PM	I WAS PARTIAL RESPONDER ON PRIOR TREATMENT. VIRUS WAS UNDETECTABLE AFTER 1 MONTH &amp; 3 MONTHS. HAVE HAD H-ROIDS, RASH, AND FATIQUE. GETS ALOT BETTER AFTER 3 MONTHS ON INCIVEK. MY ADVICE IS DRINK LOTS OF WATER, H-ROID SUPOSITORIES AND WALKING. ONE HAS TO BE STRONG AND FIGHT THE DEMON OF SELF PITY.
Chronic Hepatitis C	Medinah Mike, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	4	Male	45-54	2/11/2012 3:13:35 PM	Completed Incivek last week for 12 weeks. IngestingFat 3 times a day was much harder than I thought. Self injection with interferon is also hard, but getting used to it. Had hep c for 20+ yrs cured in 4 wks to negative counts. Rectal burning was bad, am still getting groin itch &amp; peeling of skin in this area only. Smoking small amounts of marijuana, &amp; daily hot tubs got me thru it. I looked like the walking dead while taking Incivek, pale, angry, driving to work in a blurr, sleeping 2 hours at a time, lots of time laying on the couch, weight gain, mild rash on back, elbows, tongue swelling. I needed a ton of water, day &amp; nite. My doctors comments about Incivek, it's a dirty drug, 13 trials for a replacement due out by 2014, without interferon. Told me any future patients telling to wait till 2014. 1 patient was off in 2 weeks blood count to low, another had the rash continue after treatment was finished. I was on a schedule of 6am 2pm, 10 pm, bought a speaking alarm for meds on amazon.com, that helped a lot. Doctor lessend ribravrin from 6 pills to 4 for 2 weeks, back on full dose now. Doctor also preordered another injection for bringing up blood count, luckily I did not need. After 12 weeks I am much stronger off the drug now within a week. Procrastination was a major problem, stopped cleaning the house, paying bills on time, being with friends, everyone kept saying they want the old me back. If I had more than my job as a major responsibility I would have not made. I had no idea how tough it was going to be taking 12 pills a day, and a weekly injection could be. Having sex 1 time a week was exhausting. Doctor offered zoloft but I was not willing to take even more drugs. Doctor said there is a 20% chance will comeback. Family friend support helps, but I did mostly alone. I was getting weekly blood tests, that's tough when they can not find any veins to draw from. Hopefully this helps, I am a guy 52 yrs old. Be strong.
Chronic Hepatitis C	Carla, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	65-74	1/16/2012 5:59:51 PM	This treatment is brutal.  It felt like acid poured on my anus.  Finally, after suffering severe rash &amp; pain I was prescribed a cortisone cream.  The most help was from the pharmacist who got me a RX for stomach medication, that really helped the stomach pain, nausea, diarhhea, &amp; lack of appetite.  The rash manifests itself like a bee sting followed by intense itching. It happens all over your body, in ears, nose, eyes, privates, scalp, feet and entire torso/extremities.  I've been covered with Kelog for months.  Fatigue/weakness is horrible to the point I could not walk more than 10 steps.  Fever &amp; shivering chills.  I'm done w/it and waiting for the viral count.  It was amazingly low the 1st month - we'll see.  If you are going to start this tx, be aware you will be very sick.  
Chronic Hepatitis C	Dk, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/22/2011 3:35:08 PM	After 4 weeks my viral load went to 0, I'm finished with my 12 weeks now only 38 to go on the other drugs. This treatment is hard on the stomach and the itching is hard to take. I have no rash but it feels like fiberglass insulation on your skin along with bite like feelings. Hope this goes away since I'm off of Incivek and my viral load stays in the negative for the 6 months after treatment stops. Thanks for letting me talk about this, family can't grasp what you go through on this treatment.
Chronic Hepatitis C	PK, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	55-64	10/10/2011 5:04:25 PM	One week after starting incivek I had anal ulcers from the acidic nature of the drug and the pain was unbearable in the anal area as diarea was also the side effect plus burning and itching. I made it through but not without pain medication. It went away after the 12 weeks so I know it was the drug. When you start make sure you have a medication for diarea and a prescription for pain meds.
