Migraine Headache	summerluvr2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/17/2012 9:01:34 PM	As usual, a medication is unavailable when it works perfectly!  I have been suffering from migraines for 28 years.  I can not take the new class of migraine medications like Imetrex and Zomig due to shortness of breath.  Since it is not available anymore, my doctor prescribed Fioricet, which works just as good as Cafergot.

In April the manufacturer, G&amp;W Laboratories, Inc., made it available to Walgreens.  I just got my supply after trying many other drug treatments without success.  Check out www.gwlabs.com  Good luck to all of my fellow migraine sufferers!

I never got relief until I was prescribed Cafergot in my late 20's. I've taken it for years and can't do without it!I wonder why they took it off the market and if anyone has found anything close to it...if so please share.

Cluster Headache	basicjon, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	5/23/2011 2:04:27 PM	My cluster headaches have occured on and off for the past 25 years.  Now that caffergot is unavailable, I've experienced headaches more often and more severe.  On a flight home from Chicago, I was ready to open the door and jump out.  If I had been home I would have aske my wife to take me to the emergency room.  Now its back to the doctors office and going through all the old rememdies (verapemil, narcotics, imitrix etc.) which I've already tried with little effect.  My doctor refuses to prescribe it because of the increased risk of heart attack.  I used to take caffergot when taking viagra, since viagra almost always triggers a cluster headache. With caffergot, I pretty much had my headaches under contol.  Now, I'm living in dread of the next hour long headache.

Migraine Headache	shelby60, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/14/2011 5:59:59 PM	I began taking this product in 1970.  It has worked for me all these years and nothing else does it.  I take one w/2ibuprofen at onset and in an hour it's gone.  Without this, I am afraid I will be literally disabled. I am frantic to find a generic or the original.  I have never had any negative side effects in all this time. PLEASE release this medicine.  Thousands are depending on it.

Migraine Headache	suzzz, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	9/4/2010 5:40:52 PM	I suffered terribly from migraines for about 10 years, trying pill after pill, doctor after doctor, all of which I would just throw up and not get any relief from. I finally went to one doctor who suggested Caforgot in the suppositories, which I immediately was interested because I thought it would not make me throw up! so now its been about 20 years and I am still totally amazed that after using 1/8 of a suppository, my headache is gone in 10 minutes. Its too bad that not many people can take it because if you have any medical problems, you can not use it. It has been a miracle for me. I can cut one suppository into 8 pieces and thats all I need, just 1/8 and rarely need 2 pieces. 1/2 a supp. was way too much and really made me feel like I was &quot;drugged&quot; for about a half hour! Cutting them up really make the cost tolerable too.
Migraine Headache		5	5	5			8/23/2010 6:53:13 AM	I recently returned to Australia to find that I could no longer get Cafergot on prescription from the chemists as they no longer stocked it.I have since found out that you can get Cafergot tablets made here in Australia. There is a company called PCCA who sell the ingredients for Cafergot to certain chemists who then make up the tablets on request. These chemists are called Compounding Chemists. If you log onto the PCCA site (www.pccarx.com) it gives you a telephone number to call (1300 722 269) and they will let you know where your nearest Compounding Chemist is. You do need to have doctors prescription. I had a script for Cafergot plus 5 repeats and was able to get all 120 tablets together from a Compounding Chemist in Lindfield, NSW. They still cost the same as they did in the chemists  120 tablets cost me $120.
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/30/2010 3:01:47 PM	I started using cafergot when I was 15 now in my 40 It has worked great for me. I  only have to take one and within 1-2 hrs headache is gone. It does irritate my stomach a little. But I found if I drink plenty of water it helps.  A few years ago I tried one of the newer drugs but it didnt not work as well for me. 
Migraine Headache	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	6/18/2010 9:33:10 AM	In reply to slf who wrote below that the suppositories are too strong, I suggest that she cuts the suppositories in half.  My doctor told me to keep them in the fridge, and when needed, I cut a suppository in half, wrap the remaining half in foil and return to the fridge.  If you find that is still too strong for you, you could try using 1/3 at a time.  Makes them last longer!  Good luck!
Migraine Headache	slf, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/11/2010 7:05:51 PM	I have taken cafergot tablets for a number of years with good effect. Why discontinue this product. I tried the suppositories but because they were so much stronger ended up with heart palpitations and irreg. heart rate. Be very careful when trying the suppositories. I have no idea how I will manage now without the tablets.

I have been taking it for a number of years now and I am DEVASTATED that it is no longer being made. I would love to know why they make the suppositories but not the tablets.

Migraine Headache	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/26/2010 2:24:54 AM	Further to my comment on 6 January, this morning I woke with the beginning of a migraine and knew that today was the day to trial the Cafergot Suppositories kept in the fridge. Because I usually take 1 tablet (1mg), I cut the 2mg suppository in half, wrapped half in foil and returned to the fridge. Inserted the other half and for about 3/4 hour managed to resist the urge to go to the toilet. My half cafergot suppository worked OK and I now feel well again. Honestly, I would prefer to take Cafergot Tablets, but taking Cafergot Suppositories is preferable to experimenting with other medications. Hope they continue to produce them, or better still, bring back the tablets.
Migraine Headache	Patricia amole, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/24/2010 2:22:39 PM	Cafergot (ergotamine) more effective than the new drugs such as imitrex.  propranolol and topamax were not effective.  I have taken ergotamine for over 20 years.  ergotamine is cheaper than imitrex.

It gives me instant relief and I don't know what I am going to do if it doesn't come back on the market. I would like to knoe the reason it has been discontinued.
Migraine Headache	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/6/2010 12:31:10 AM	I dread the thought of life without Cafergot Tablets. After suffering Migraine Headaches for years without finding a cure, it was heaven to finally be prescribed Cafergot which I have taken for over 10 years. I take 1 tablet at the onset of a Migraine and now rarely even have to go to bed or vomit like I did previously. On an average I use about 50 tablets per year without any tingling in fingers or feet. Now I can no longer get the Tablets, my Dr just prescribed Suppositories which are still in stock. Have not used them yet. Please start manufacturing the Cafergot Tablets again and put them on the PBS so more sufferers can enjoy their benefits.

I am concerned now that it has been taken off the market &amp; I don't know how I will manage. Have just tried topamax, and think I would prefer the migraine. Can anyone help or suggest something. I have about a months supply left. It has been suggested that my headaches are &quot;rebound&quot;, but whatever, they still need treatmentOld Timer

It seems to alleviate my headaches the same way that Imitrex does if I take it early enough.  But I am careful about taking too much since a Physician's Assistant told me about the moderate to serious side effects.

Once I went to the ER and saw a new doctor.  He was alarmed to hear how much and how long I had been taking this Cafergot. He was so alarmed, as he had seen the effects of this med. He said you hace already taken too much, don't ever take another Cafergot as long as you live! The side effects he told me about, the way my toes and fingers would feel. Well,that is what I am experiencing. Now is there anybody out there who can identify with me?? Please share with me how you are handling this?I already have some numbness in my toes and a small amt. in my hands.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/27/2008 9:31:47 AM	I suffer from chronic migraines, and this medication has been very effective for me. But as with any prescription med, be very careful with the dosage.  I have been on it for a long time, and have found that after a while, one is not enough, so I need two.  Then I need it more often. That has led to rebound headaches and I have had to &quot;detox&quot; myself from cafergot from time to time. My neurologist works with me,and substitutes a triptan med for me, which though not as effective for me, is also beneficial.  Just be careful when you are taking this medication...watch the dosage.

I usually lie down in a dark place and pratice relaxing even sleeping if poss after I take it. It works within the hour. I keep an extra few in my purse in case I get stuck at work and a migraine starts. SOmetimes I need two if I have waited to long to take it in the first place or somethmes the migraines just starts out that bad. If after 30 minutes from taking the first pill I do not have at least the edge off, I take another. I swear by cafergot.
