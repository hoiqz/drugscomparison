It reeled me in but I had drooling, the &quot;Haldol shuffle&quot; and my legs would jerk upon waking.  That was four years ago.  Now I am back on it and not having ANY EPS.  Strange, it does sedate me some but none of htose other symptoms came back.  Weird!!

Schizophrenia	knowbetternow, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Male	45-54	11/30/2011 10:10:01 PM	I don't know the original diagnosis at the time I was taking Haldol. My actual diagnosis which I later found out was schizo-affective. This medicine caused my head to twist to the side from a muscle spasm, my tongue to hang out of the side of my mouth, and drooled when these things happened. My heart was racing and I was scared half to death. I already had enough fear because of my condition.  I also experienced blurred vision. I was on numerous medications after Haloperidol until they found the right one. Abilify has helped me the most out of all that I had taken. In case this doesn't allow me to pick more than one category, after 20 years of being diagnosed, I am a healthcare worker and am working on a degree in counseling.

Schizophrenia	JNKAsso, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Male	19-24	8/8/2011 1:22:44 AM	My 23 year old son was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was prescribed Haldol (Haloperidol).  The medicine seemed to help his symptoms; however, it caused his pallet to swell and hang down his throat nearly causing him to asphyxiate.  I researched the medication and found that long term use of this medicine and mostly all antipsychotic medications causes frontal lobe shrinkage and will eventually leave the patien worse off.  I urge everyone to continue to seek alternative treament and we all need to stand together and fight for more funding to find a solution to mental illness.

Schizophrenia	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	9/15/2010 11:07:07 PM	I have been taking Haldol off and on  for the last 19 years. I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia when I was 29 and hospitalized. I was given Haldol and it worked fairly quickly (within 1week). Now when I start feeling paranoid, I take up to 2mg - 10mg as needed. Usually over the weekend because it causes drowsiness and a feeling of being sedated. I do have some muscle problem with my face and do not know if this is related to the Haldol or Seroquel or Lamictal that I am taking. The raised cheek problem does appear to be neurological. I am currently under a doctors care and checking this out.

They upped your dose of Temazepam becaue Haldol makes you feel real speedy.  The Neurontin is a depressant/anti-depressant and it probably been increased for the same reason.I hope that helps.God Bless.

It is an anti-psychotic but yet it makes you tired and agitated! So, overall it is a good treatment for Tourette's as long as you can manage the side effects.
