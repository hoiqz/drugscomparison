It is good. I take it everyday. I got spotting while regulating to it,but it had gotten better. The only Problem is not having a period every month makes my cramps horrible and my bleeding really heavy, But i'd rather that than switching a lot and be unprotected.
Birth Control	Kels, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	8/4/2012 2:53:08 PM	I was on ortho tri-cyclin before I started Jolessa. My gyno just switched me to this birth control so I would have lighter and less periods. I loved it until I got to the middle of the second pack. I started spotting, and now I am still spotting and have one more pill left before starting the third pack! I have heard that this is normal and will go away, but my migraines have worsened and my sex drive is pretty much at zero right now. Also, there is always that worry (with the four periods/year) that you are pregnant, even if you take the pill regularly. Spotting doesn't necessarily mean you're not pregnant!
Birth Control	b., 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	7/22/2012 1:15:47 PM	I went on Jolessa in high school because I was getting very irregular, frequent periods -- once I was down to once every two weeks! And my PMS was terrible. Since going on Jolessa my periods have been lighter, less painful, and obviously much less frequent. I use it both b/c of my weird periods and for birth control now. Can't recommend it enough. Obv. you have to find a pill that works for YOU, though!
Other	thatwouldbemejennifer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	7/15/2012 12:51:54 PM	I've been on Jolessa since July 1st to reduce my periods bc since April, I have been having issues w ovarian cysts. I'm 36, healthy, non-smoker/drinker. However, I have been experiencing this level of sadness that I do not like; and is not me! I'm getting married on Sept 1st and my level of excitement has decreased and my level of energy has decreased. Totally opposite of me. My fiance has even noticed that my emotional state is not what it was. Also, my sex drive is about nil. That is very frustrating for both of us. and even when we do have relations, it's different than it used to be. i don't get it. I've considering weighing my options of suffering the pain of my recent periods and being in and out of the doctor's; or finishing this 3 month pack and going thru w/ ablation after the wedding. Is it safe to just stop taking the pill? or are there vitamins out there that i can take to counteract these side effects?
Other	mzb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	7/14/2012 12:50:02 PM	Taking Jolessa with the intent to minimize severe period discomfort and a heavy monthly flow, so that during menstruation I can have minimal distractions, ie stay at work, think, etc.First pack: 25 days straight bleeding, day 21,22, bleeding through super tampons and pads. Day 24, bleeding out blood clots, cramping like food poisoning, extreme bloating. Discharge like a horror film. Very noticeable weight gain, probably 15lbs on the first 8 weeks of the pack. Taking a 5'-10&quot; frame from 130 to 145, and not a frame that ever puts on weight, so it's quite abnormal. In addition, it definitely effects your mood, I'd say anger being the most present emotion, like all the time! I hate you Jolessa makers, how dare you think this is an acceptable drug for women.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/13/2012 12:04:16 AM	Actually helped alot for me. I used to have heavy periods every 2-3 weeks for 5 days with sever cramps, nausea, upset stomach and hot flashes. Now I have a moderate to light period with no nausea, stomach upsets no where near as bad and no random sweating for 5 or less days.
Birth Control	smstoker3, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	4/30/2012 3:28:06 PM	This is the worst birth control I've ever been on! I have endometreosis and as a result, I have terrible cramps. The doctor I go to has put me on three different pills in the last year-and-a-half. This is my third. As soon as I started the second pack, I started having discolored discharge and bleeding. I bled for almost two weeks! Also, I'm always craving things and have seen significant weight gain, even when dieting and exercising. I agree with another reviewer: this drug shouldn't be on the market. My hormones are going crazy. I've been having days where I can barely get out of bed from depressing thoughts that I know aren't logical, yet can't shake. I'd much rather have a period and be stuck in bed with cramps! Don't take this drug!

Other	Gina, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/31/2012 10:20:47 PM	I have been taking this pill for almost 3 years now.  I was diagnosed with severe ovarian cysts and every month when I would ovulate I was in severe pain, bad enough to be sent to the hospital.   I was orignally on Seasonal and had alot of break thru bleeding, cramping and mood swings.  My doctor switched me to the Jolessa and I have not had a problem while on it.  About 6 months I had surgery and stopped the BC only to have the pain from the cysts return.  This pill has been a life saver for me.  Not only is it birth control but it has helped control the pain from my cysts.

I've taken Jolessa (the generic) for a few years now. Recently I've been cramping all the time and having heavy bleeding for days on end. I don't feel like this is normal at all. I never had the issue before and nothing about the way I have taken it has changed. I am switching to something else. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	1/24/2012 4:03:43 PM	I had very irregular, painful, heavy periods until getting on Seasonale.  I switched over to this generic (Jolessa) and have not had any major issues.  I occasionally have light spotting in between cycles, but it has lightened my periods SIGNIFICANTLY, eases PMS, and makes my periods very predictable.

Once I started my second pack, I started bleeding and I have been bleedig for almost a month now.  It has my hormones all screwed up and I have been clotting like crazy.  I have been to 3 different doctors thinking something else was wrong, but each doctor confirmed that it is my hormones out of wack. I think this pill should not be sold.  I rather have a period each month.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	25-34	12/6/2011 8:51:22 PM	I have been taking jolessa for almost six months now and the side effects are really getting to me. I have had nearly constant bleeding--lighter some days and heavier other times--that requires a liner at all times and sometimes more. The worst side effect for me is it has made me feel really down all the time--in a bad mood or generally sad, when I very rarely felt that way before. I stopped taking  this pill 3 days ago and this morning I felt like a totally different person. I think I am going to give up the pill altogether for awhile; the side effects are worse than having periods.

I have only had 1 week (1st wk of Sept.) where I had no bleeding.  Bleed every day so I have to use a pad and have cramps, backache and clotting on and off.  OBGYN says to be patient and give the pill a chance but for how long.  UUGGHHH!!!  Have non-cancerous fibroids and had a d&amp;c last yr. which didn't help very long.  Considering Gynecare Thermachoice or Ablation.

I'm only on my 7th week of taking it, but I have not had any problems. No spotting or breakthrough bleeding. I have noticed some acne but nothing too bad compared to what I had before. I have also noticed a loss in appetite but nothing too extravagent. Still have a very active sex life. My boobs have been tender and have grown in size within the first week or so. I was on seasonique a few years ago and had nothing but problems, I was bleeding constantly and absolutely hated it! Jolessa is amazing!! Definitely recommend!! &#220; 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	7/13/2011 5:09:22 PM	I've been on jolessa for about a year now and so far it's been great. after having VERY bad experiences with other birth controls i finally found one that works. The first pack that you take, you will most likely get your period for most of the last month in the pack. For me, once my body got used to it (by the third pack I used) everything was perfect. it was getting through those first few packs that was the problem. I haven't had mood swings or cramping, unlike most birth control medicine i've taken. I gained a little bit of weight but barely enough for people to notice. My periods have been really light and i never see spotting between periods
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	6/23/2011 7:19:32 AM	I started bleeding around my 4th week of pills and haven't stopped yet. I called my doctor and she basically told me to tough it out because if I stop taking the pill, it will be worse.  I'm so ridiculously angry that I've been bleeding for so long, I can't even stand it. It's disgusting and awful and WON'T STOP.  I'm crying all the time too. For no reason.  This pill is making me insane. 
Birth Control	music4life, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/8/2011 9:23:29 PM	I have been on Jolessa for about 5 months. I was on Seasonique for a year before that. I decided to do a 3 month pack for less periods because my periods were horrible. Cramps like crazy that would cause migraines that would cause me to vomit. Seasoniuqe was great and Jolessa has work just as well. Cramps are no where as bad as they used to. The only side effect i could say is that I've been a little mor emoitional. Even the saddest little story in a cartoon movie makes me tear up. Other than that, It's worked well for me.
Birth Control	supernurse, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	4/24/2011 1:26:03 AM	the fewer periods advertised in there tv commercial made this seem like the miracle bc pill.  i'm on my second pack now. the first month being on it, i had bleeding the entire month......like you do when you are on day 2 of your menses. that was the last bleeding i've had. it makes me a little nervous because i keep feeling as if i could be pregnant because i take this drug different times of the day..i work nights. i don't get the spotting like they talked about. i did get the lovely weight gain. and i never thought about asking for pharmaceutical intervention for depression til now.i've never had depression issues before. it has to be this drug swaying me this way. i do have decreased interest in sex. perhaps thats how they prevent pregnancies ;-)  but, in all seriousness.........i'm looking for something different. i'm generally very up in spirit and to see myself slipping into a depressive state scares me. and, i refuse to let it happen or to be on meds to treat it. if i still feel low while being off jolessa i'll keep you posted. i had the implanon for 2yrs before switching to jolessa. i switched because i was still lactating for 2yrs after i stopped breastfeeding my son!  they should've informed me to not have this inserted until i stopped lactating. i'm considering having the implanon again. it's a device inserted in your arm, lasts 3yrs.no shots,  no pills, no side effects..........unless of course you start it right after having a baby. and,  you don't feel it in your arm. perfect for those that haven't had children yet.

I have had irregular spotting and full periods when i was not supposed to this whole time and has proved to be a nightmare instead of a saving grace. I have not had any migranes, cramping or other effects reported, but the bleeding is enough to have me at the point where i am going to switch the next time i see my doctor. It is not healthy to just stop taking any medication without consulting your doctor first! Nursing school is actually rubbing off LOL

I had been using Yaz for several years and then all the bad press came out about it and I decided to switch. I teach school and sometimes its hard to find coverage for my classroom so I can slip out and use the restroom during the day, so managing a period isn't easy and I decided to try the 3 month pill. At first, I loved it, for the first two packs, now I am becoming upset. The last two packs, the whole last month I have had breakthrough bleeding that varies from light spotting to a full blown period, cramps and all. And you never know when it's going to happen. I haven't noticed the problems with acne and lowered libido that some have mentioned but I have noticed my breasts are getting larger and I get random cravings to want to eat. I have never been like that. And I have been tested, at home and by and MD for pregnancy and all were negetive. I have my yearly physical in a week and I am asking to be changed!!! I do not recommend this BC

The first few months are rough with the constant bleeding, bloating, headaches, and low sex drive but after the third month the bleeding isn't too bad and you feel more regulated. Your sex drive comes back two fold and things are good :D
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	11/21/2010 9:49:13 PM	Started taking this med to try and lessen my migraines from 12+ times per year to 4+ times per year. I enjoy only having my period every 3 months but my headaches are more frequent than before and i have no sex drive during the first month. i have been on them for about 8 months and plan on switching when i finish this pack. I also had one pregnancy scare and learned that i could not take a pregnancy test at home until my period was actually due-- meaning i was going to have to wait another 6 weeks to test. Had to get a blood test which was negative and i attribute the scare to the side effects of this drug. (breast tenderness, frequent urination, nausea...)just don't think its worth it, i would rather have my period every month. this low sex drive is not fun.

But the second month has been horrible.  Ihave had a full blown period for 3 weeks and still going strong.  Not sure what to do, I plan to at least finish out the pack.

I have found that side effects are minimized when you take your pill at exactly the same time each day.... seems silly but it worked for me.  Very happy with this pill.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	10/8/2010 6:55:16 PM	I've taking it for about 2 and half months and I am not happy with the side effects at all.  The first month was very good and with very little side effects as I continued to take it my breasts became very tender and my break through spotting became full blown periods daily.  I have terrible night sweats where I wake up and my bed is soaked from my neck down to my waist and my even my hair is wet!!  I have cramps, and infrequent acne which is a lot to me since I never had acne before.  I use to sleep alot once I first started it but that has went away. Not happy with all the side effects, have requested a  change in birth control.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	9/20/2010 1:03:31 PM	I switched to Jolessa because my wedding is coming up and I didn't want to worry about having my period for the wedding or the honeymoon. However, the side effects are really starting to take its toll on me and I'm only on my second month. I am already an emotional person and I have been extremely moody. I feel very tired and useless a lot of the time. I've had very tender breasts and been bloated. My face has been breaking out a lot. And I think worst of all my sex drive is pretty much nonexistent. I find that I'm even getting irritated while trying to be intimate with my fiance. I am hoping to switch asap.

No bleeding problems between periods and helped my heavy bleeding. Gained about 10 pounds. It helped my migraines and moodiness. But now the headaches are returning and also the moodiness and bloating. I have been getting brown spots on my face when in the sun, I would say its from the pill.

I have been on Jolessa for about a year, and at first everything was fine, minor breakthrough bleeding, but other than that perfect. In April, I went in to have an eye exam, and they found severe eye irration. I have been on Restasis now for 6 months, and the Opthomologist says that the pills may be the cause for eye irritation. I saw today in the pill info, that it can cause problems with contacts, and I hope that my dr. can help with changing my meds. I loved only having 4 periods a year :(.

After reading all these reviews I am really freaked out to take it. Are any of these side effects permanant??? And how much does the non generic cost? Is this pill really worth the savings?
Other	Lita, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	5/20/2010 2:55:38 PM	I have been on this medication twice. The first time was like a dream; barely any spotting, and having my period only once out of every 3 months? Awesome.I began having problems when I ran out of medication, though. I take Jolessa not really for the birth control, but for my terrible cramps. When I stopped taking it the first time, I later developed serious pain in my stomach area, probably cramp-related.The 2nd time (and the current time) I am on Jolessa, it's a little different. I'm not sure why. My acne has finally cleared up, after 21 years (though that could be because I'm kicked off the soda habit too)--but it's like a miracle.I am having a lot of spotting right now, though, and it's a little early in the month as to when my period would be. Other than ruining a lot of my underwear, I'm all right with it. I used to get terrible headaches and really weird mood swings, but I've been pretty normal since being on the pill (much to my fiance's satisfaction).About those who gave negative reviews: different people have different reactions to different medication. A lot of the reviews I read were people who switched meds. Jolessa was my first BC--I did try Ortho Tri Cyclen but that didn't prevent cramps or anything--so Jolessa has really worked well for me.

I have not had any increased appetite, weight gain or moodiness so that part's nice. I thought I'd like the idea of having a period less often since I dont plan on getting pregnant. I'm not sure that I will continue taking it if my periods do not slow down. 
Other	NOT HAPPY, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	13-18	4/20/2010 5:34:51 PM	I have only been taking this b.c. pill for two months and am thouroughly dissapointed. this is the second pill i've been on due to extreme pms and horrible periods. I thought it would be great only having my period four times a year. however i have had my period for the past two weeks...and i shouldnt be having it at all. also i've broken out all over my body. my cramps are just as bad as usual and i'm very emotional. I though that this was my body just getting used to the extended time without my period...but after reading all of these reviews i now see that it's just a bad generic. 
Birth Control	TrinaMae, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	4/20/2010 8:37:11 AM	I am finishing up my second 90 day pack of Jolessa and have gained nearly 20 pounds since I have been using it. I have an uncontrollable appetite. Its terrible. On top of that, during the last 3 weeks of the first pack (before the placebo's) I was on my period. The WHOLE time. It's happening again with this second pack. Also, I am extremely moody ALL the time and have absolutely no sex drive whatsoever. Like a 95 year old woman. I'm going to change my bc at the end of this week, it is terrible. The only thing that I liked about it was that it cleared up my face really well. But so do other birth controls. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	4/3/2010 9:50:05 PM	I am nearing the end of the first 90 day pack and have been satisfied with this med. I've not taken BCP before and was told to expect some nausea, which happened the first week.  However, I am not on the sugar pills yet but have been lightly bleeding and cramping for the past two days - as if i were on my period.  I would recommend this product.

Its only been about 4 weeks and Im stopping this ASAP. Dont take- I have never had issues with any BC before this and I have been on seasonale for 6 years.

Everyone has their moments but I will be talking to my doctor about switching my BC.

My nurse practioner told me it would help my endometreosious. The first 3months I experienced some break through bleeding and I through up almost every single day for three weeks. I take a mild ADHD medicine. I figured out they do not mix. I have gotten blood clots in my legs and shortness of breath a couple times. I am off and on nautios. I have never had a weak stomach and have an extremely high pain tolerence. This is the first birth control that has me freaked. When I had the break between taking the next three month pill package I didn't have a period. When I started taking them again I began to bleed. It's been two months in a row of EVERY DAY bleeding for me! I throw up here and there still. But I'M SICK OF HAVING MY PERIOD, BEING SICK, AND VERY MOODY AND EMOTIONAL. I'M GOING TO STOP TAKING JOLESSA ASAP! BE AFRAID BE VERY AFRAID. PS. I did go in for a pelvic and vaginal ultra-sound..NORMAL. I'm 23.
Birth Control	mtngirl4, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	35-44	3/1/2010 7:52:39 PM	I have been on Jolessa for over a year.  Great only having periods 4 times a year, but noticed that I have gained about 10 pounds and have never had a weight issue.  Also mood swings, fatigue, bloating. After feeling ill and tons of bloodwork coming out normal, I am suspecting some of my health issues are due to this pill.  My gyn says it's not related to the pill, but after reading all of these reviews I don't believe her.  I just switched to ParaGard IUD, so hoping getting off the hormones will help.

Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	12/17/2009 2:06:14 AM	I've been on Jolessa for maybe 5 years and I've never had a problem. I did gain some weight over time, but I didn't think it was from the pill. I've always been a little moody, but I've been off of it for two weeks and OMG I feel so much better. My sex drive is much better and I haven't been nearly as moody. I was EXTREMELY moody while on the pill. Also, this past summer I started getting white patches on my skin that didn't tan. I lost the pigment and I burned being in the sun. Normally I get quite dark in the summer and always laid out in the sun with no problem. My Dermatologist said it was a fungus that normally is from the scalp. I had to get treated for that, but it didn't go away. Now he's telling me it might be vitiligo, but it doesn't quite look like it. Now I'm thinking it might be from this pill. After reading all these reviews, I think I'm going to find something else.

Birth Control	19-24	2	3	1		19-24	10/18/2009 1:58:29 PM	I'm on my 3rd month of Jolessa. I've got about another 2 weeks until my first period, but I've been breakthrough bleeding for 3 weeks already. I've had several abnormal mood swings and it's also been affecting my sex life.*Most recently I've started to have a difficult time breathing. Feeling breathless and not feeling like I'm getting enough air and gasping. Also, slight wheezing now.. Has anyone else experienced this?It just doesn't seem worth it..

I also have a lot of pregnancy scares with this pill I think a lot has to do with the really tender breasts and funky feelings down below. I also have felt random extrem pain in my legs. My next visit I am asking to be taken off and swithced.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	7/27/2009 12:57:35 PM	My doctor changed my bcp to jolessa to try to help my migraines.I didn't really have many problems with it the first three month pack just some weight gain and lowered sex drive.The migraines seemed to get a little better. But when I went to the second three month pack my period started and has not stopped - I'm in my third month of it now. I have gained more weight, have no sex drive, i have cramping all the time and my migraines are worse now than they were before i started taking it. I have an appointment with my doctor to be switched to something else. I have had a very bad experience with this medication and would not recommend it. 
Birth Control	pbj, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	7/26/2009 11:39:04 AM	No weight gain.  Darker skin above upper lip (AHHH!!), relieved by a skin lightner, but annoying to have to do this.  Large acne pimples often and pores clogged (like blackheads) on nose and chin, neither of which I ever had before (when on ortho-tri-cyclen). Also, period started 3 weeks early - light for two of those weeks and 3rd week was full period.  Not having a period for 9 weeks is nice, but then dealing with it for 3 weeks is annoying and in my opinion no different than just having a period each month of the 3 month period as on a normal monthly pill.  I am going back to ortho-tri-cyclen now, bummed about monthly period, but anxious for better skin and the dark spot above lip to go away.  Can't wait for development of a 3 month pill that works better!
Birth Control	emeeks88, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	7/19/2009 11:50:25 PM	I have only been on this pill for about 2 months, but I haven't really had any of the side effects and it has been very nice  not having a period every month. Right at first, I had a problem with cramping and feeling sick to my stomach, but that is to be expected switching to any new bcp. I had a light breakthrough bleeding right at the end of my first month, but it really was barely even noticeable. I really like Jolessa and would recommend it.

This pill works great. But now out of nowhere i'm having having bleeding and it will not stop. What is really up with this pill. It seems like it works for a year and then you bleed to death. 
Birth Control	25-34	4	4	2		25-34	6/30/2009 3:26:46 PM	About a year after using this pill I noticed a white patch on my chest in the summer.  It went away after the summer but has returned 3-fold on my back this year...along with heavy spotting.  When I looked up my symptoms WebMD named it a side effect of my birth control pill.  It's apparently a nontranmissible fungus.  Now I have to switch pills and treat my skin too!  I wished this pill worked flawlessly, but I don't recommend it.  
Birth Control	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	4	3		25-34	6/30/2009 3:17:27 PM	Like other reviewers, I also liked this pill at first.  It did decrease my migraines and I had no problems with it until now...about 1.5yrs or use.  I experience tender breasts and spotting (never had before) and can't lose weight no matter what I try.  I kept testing for pregnancy, I was so confused!  These reviews have helped me.  I hope this helps others.
Birth Control	kks, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	5/1/2009 12:15:38 AM	I have been on Seasonale/Jolessa for about 3 years. In the beginning, I loved only having my period 4 times a year.  However, over the last year I have had increased breakthrough bleeding, which I never had before, and more frequent migraines - at least one a week.  I have also noticed more moodiness, depression, and increased acne, which had also never been a problem.  I think it is time for a switch. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	4/14/2009 2:30:51 PM	I am switching back to my original pill (Necon 777) after reviewing this Jolessa for almost a year. I had quite a few break-outs (acne - which I've never had before). I have a &quot;weird&quot; pain in my lower abdomen, increase in fluids, some other issues I don't want to put in writing. I wanted to remove my monthly cycle to see if it would prevent migraine headaches; it did not. i actually experience them more frequently with aura. as far as the period itself I could &quot;really tell it was coming&quot; as far as PMS goes which i didn't have before. My periods were fine on the previous pills - regular, light, four days etc. now when they do come it feels like it way in advance. I recommend this for anyone who does not have side-effects in the first three months. you won't know unless you try. if it weren't for complexion and the above mentioned side effects this pill would have been great for me.

I have gained a TON of weight and cannot seem to lose it regardless of how little I eat or how much I exercise. I have also experienced mood swings and depression, as well as a decrease in my sex drive. This prescription and I simply do not mix and I am switching back to Yaz. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	3/26/2009 5:57:01 PM	I finished my first month. I have gained a couple pounds, been bloated, cramping, moody, my acne is terrible. I feel absolutely awful. But no breakthrough. My headaches have increased (which i already had severe tension headaches/migraines, and am on a prescription for them). So far, I am afraid it will not work, even though I use other methods of bc. I am very unhappy....

Other	jen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	2/11/2009 9:27:55 PM	I have been on Jolessa for 1 1/2 yrs. It was working very well to not have a period every month- only 4 a yr. I have to agree with some comments that YES take it at the same time every day. I decided to take it after my surgery for endometriosis. I wondered why they never mentioned taking an extended month pill before. I am taking my last month-into it 9 days. I am bleeding every three days for the first month and a half and now every day. I have been extremely stressed out about other life things. On the 3 month pack before this one my doctor and I decided to skip the period week and just go right on with the next pack of pills-bad idea! My period is light but spotting, cramps, moody, my ovaries are hurting again-I have cyste on them. I am going to have a total hysterectomy now. Cannot do this anymore. I am scared thou have not made the Appt yet. Just some info, Doc says that the pill lowers your absorbtion of b vitamins when you take it so that can help cause moodiness. Just a tip

I am on the last month of my second cycle and I have gained 12 lbs.  I work out daily and have been on WeightWatchers and still no weight loss.  My breast are always tender and sore.  Not to mention they have increase from a 36D or 36DD.  I am constantly moody and have lowered sex drive.  My first 3 month pack I had horrible cramps and break thru bleeding that lasted a whole month. I have now developed horrible acne and unwanted thick black facial hair.I am looking for another pill.  I thought not having a period every month would be great; however, they are worse than they were before I even started BC and I have them almost every month anyway!

I do not recommend this pill and I plan on switching to a new one.

I was enlisted, so my doctor wrote me the script because it would my my time on-duty much easier. The only problem I've had in the last 3 years has come up recently. I just haven't had my period. At all, no breakthrough bleeding, no spotting, nothing. And 3 negative pregnancy tests-2 at home one at my doctors. Right now I'm off it completely to see if there'll be any changes. Oh and another thing, I don't recommend taking this BCP with Cipro. You'll become even more sensative to light, and it's &quot;effectiveness&quot; (as my doctor put it) will be like not taking any BCP at all. Otherwise, I love it, it's simple and easy to use like the other BCPs I've been on, the only differences are clearer skin, fewer periods and for most (including myself) lighter less painful periods.

It's as easy to use as any bcp but my period isn't any lighter and usually I have heavy spotting,like my period, during the active months. Actually I'm on here trying to find a different pill...
Birth Control	dither1987, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	11/3/2008 4:38:29 PM	I normally get my prescription refilled at Wal-Mart and when I last got it refilled, they switched on me yet again. The first time they switched was when I was on Seasonale. They switched me to the generic brand Quasense, which caused no problems. The first week of taking Jolessa I had tenderness in one nipple. When I went to my doctor for a yearly visit I told her about the tenderness and some breakthrough bleeding. She said if there were any more problems to let her know. Now I'm having pain in my hips and more breakthrough bleeding. I really wish Wal-Mart would let me know about switching again. I am definetly calling my doctor about this.
Birth Control	LASpice, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	10/29/2008 5:28:09 PM	I have been taking Seasonale/jolessa for a few years now. I've always had break-through bleeding about a week before my actual period, so it last for more like two weeks. Just recently (possibly due to already being depressed), my depression and anxiety has been extremely amplified. It lists angry and frustration - I was literally lashing out over THEE smallest thing. A rare side effect that occurred with me was also a sensitivity to sunlight. I am very pale and burn easily, so it never occurred to me until recently that this is why this issue occurred - i couldn't be out in direct sunlight for more than a half hour without getting extreme headaches and nausea. I'm switching to a new pill next week, and I cannot wait since i've forgotten what it's like to feel &quot;normal.&quot;
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	10/29/2008 12:22:37 AM	I wouldn't exactly know if this birth control has been effective seeing as I use a condom every time I have intercourse, but I assume it would be just fine. My major complaint is bleeding. I usually had very light periods lasting less than four days. When on Yaz (on Yaz/Yasmin for approximately three years before making the switch), I just skipped the placebo pills and continued on to the normal pills, every three months or so taking the placebo pills to start my period. That worked just fine. On Jolessa, however, the pill that is supposedly giving you a three month cycle, this has not worked whatsoever. First pack was just fine, worked as my Yaz always had. Second month into the second pack, I start my period on the second week. Continued into the first week of the third pack. Bleeding stopped for about four to five days and lo and behold it started again. I am still currently bleeding and I have finally reached the placebo pills at the end. That is approximately eight weeks of normal 'period' type bleeding. I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow. I would absolutely NOT recommend this pill to anyone. Hopefully namebrand does me better.

Birth Control	AMS, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	9/24/2008 10:19:03 AM	I have only been on Jolessa for a month, and with any pill had some side effects.  No spotting (which is very common with this pill), but very tender breasts and mood changes.  I have tried SEVERAL pills and these side effects are minor compared to some and hopefully are temporary.  I do worry about pregnancy more because I am not having a period.  I would rather take an occasional pregnancy test than have a period every month though.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	25-34	9/10/2008 10:45:20 PM	I was on this before and didn't have any problems. I started taking this again 10 days ago because I was diagnosed with MS and shouldn't get pregnant while taking the medication. my breasts are very tender. The last time they were this tender I was pregnant with my 2nd child. I have to go in for blood work for my new primary care and will ask for a pregnancy test as well just too be on the safe side. If this persists I will find alternative birth control. I already have a hard time with bras and this makes it that much worse to wear one.  
Birth Control	anonymous, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	8/23/2008 7:36:59 PM	I was on seasonale for 3 years. THen, the pharmacy gave me Jolessa (the generic version).  I am now pregnant &amp; do not know when my date of conception was.  My doctor said that she does not trust generic birth control, because shes seen this many times. 
Other	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	19-24	8/12/2008 3:21:42 PM	I agree that this pill does make you worry you are pregnant. I recently switched from Seasonique to this one only because I ran out of the seasonique. It has been a week on this new pill and I am nauseous and moody. I would think I am pregnant but that is a for sure no. With most birth control pills, I think it takes a few months before your body adjusts to the hormones and you get used to it.
Birth Control	BrAnDY, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	7/7/2008 11:15:27 AM	I am on my second 3mo. pack of Jolessa. I have had breakthrough bleeding, not severe, very light. Minor weight gain, overall mood is improved, no severe headaches. Works best when taken at the same time every day, had light period at end of first three months. very little cramping so far. have taken yaz (hated!) and ortho tri/lo before and overall i like this so far, except for the light spotting, which i hope improves as my body adjusts to the 3mo cycle.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	4	4	4	Female	19-24	4/15/2008 8:31:37 PM	I have been taking this drug for about 3 yrs now and it has worked very well. It did take a full year to get into my system and I did have break through bleeding during this time. After that I have maybe had one or two incidents of break through bleeding. It works really well if you take it at the exact same time everyday.

Birth Control	Bre, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	2/5/2008 7:20:02 PM	I switched from Ortho tri cyclin lo to. This is my first pack. I find it easy to use. But I have noticed increased, extreme headaches. I have at least 2 a week. And I have had a little spotting, but that is listed as a side-effect for the first couple months. I have decided to switch due to the headaches but I haven't noticed any other side effects.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	19-24	12/3/2007 7:48:26 PM	I was already on ortho tri-cyclen before I switched to this one. I have not had any spotting or bleeding. But I have noticed an overal decreased sexual drive. I was put on this medication to decrease my periods due to the fact that I get a migrane every time I have a period. I am due for my first period next month. This pill does cause you to worry that you may be pregnant. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	4/5/2008 9:10:40 PM	Um I gained about 8 lbs within the first month of taking this drug, I also had mood swings mostly from bitchy to bitchier. I also had a lot of breakthrough bleeding
Birth Control		3	5	2			11/6/2007 4:06:43 PM	I had sort of a bad experience with Jolessa.  After talking to my dr. she decided that I was an unusual case however.  I was on Jolessa for 1 year and had breakthrough bleeding with every pack.  The bleeding lasted anywhere from 3-7 weeks, which defeats the purpose of taking an extended cycle pill.  However, I did not have a problem with mood swings, weight gain, acne or anything like that.
