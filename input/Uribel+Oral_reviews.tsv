I wasn't diagnosed with IC but after doing much of my own research it seems to be the only answer to my problem. This medication works fantastically for me. The burning, pressure, and spasms are completely gone. However, it's 2:30 am right now &amp; I am unable to sleep because my heart is fluttering &amp; it is difficult for me to take deep breaths. I have serious anxiety right now &amp; I'm wondering if it's because of this medication. Although this medication works fantastic for me, it's not worth losing sleep over. I'm going to call my doctor in the morning &amp; see if there's something else I can get.

It really worked for my symptoms of bladder pain and frequency.  After about two weeks of taking it with my other meds, I was found to have an irregular heartbeat.  I had so much chest pain, I thought I was having a heart attack.  It woke me up in the middle of the night.

It isn't my only med, but it is the most important one I take. That, and my daily bladder instillations. At first I had side effects that lasted for about 3-4 months... they included terrible bloating and weight gain. After gaining 15lbs I knew Uribel had slowed my metabolism and peristalsis down to the point I was gaining weight. I changed my diet and lost the 15lbs in 2 weeks. The bloating and fullness feeling in my stomach and gut finally eased up after several months. WELL WORTH the wait for it, as I couldn't function without it.Unless you are suffering from adverse/allergic reactions to a drug it is best to give it a few months for your body to adjust and your side effects subside. I have no side effects from Uribel that I can tell anymore. Occasionally I feel full but it's due to me eating too much. :o) I do take hydroxyzine to help with any mild itching for rash I may have from Uribel, but again, MILD. And WELL WORTH it given the freedom Uribel has given me.I currently take Uribel, hydroxyzine, baclofen, hyoscyamine(as needed if in major flare), flonase, pseudophedrine, probiotics, calcium carbonate w/vit D, and my bladder instillations which contains.. marcaine, heparin, and gentamycin.

Once medication was out of my system the dry mouth went away.I was put on this in conjunction with 60 mg of Sanctura xr. not sure if it was the combo or not.

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	8/1/2011 4:36:19 PM	I began taking Uribel for painful urination.  I didn't really feel any relief.  After 2 days, I begain having heart flutters and ended up in the ER.  Very scary...I would never take this again because I believe this drug caused the problem.  I'm a healthy 40 year old and never felt anything like that before.
Other	aging gracefully, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/21/2011 11:24:57 PM	This drug has worked great.  I am very sensitive to various medications and can very easily get heart palpitations, but have not with this.  Have had no side affects at all.  It was extremely helpful when first getting diagnosed and have depended on it during more that one of my flare-ups since.  Don't know what I would do without it.
Other	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female		4/29/2011 5:11:59 PM	This is the first time I took Uribel (for UTI) - &amp; I'll never take it again. I was absolutely exhausted, had a massive headache, and couldn't speak clearly. 10 hours after I took the last dose, those symptoms were gone (thankfully).

Tried samples from Dr. but my insurance doesn't cover it and I can't afford it as it is very expensive. Hopefully the insurance will reconsider soon as it is a miracle! Too bad it is so expensive.
