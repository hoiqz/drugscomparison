Other	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female		10/18/2009 4:50:03 PM	My mother was prescribed Rocaltrol after a pelvic fracture.  The ER Dr. said to take 2 weeks, she went to nursing home and they kept giving it. She continued to lose strenght and became highly anxious and somewhat dilusional.  I finally found out and had it stopped.  In about 10 days, she started to clear up mentally and regain strenght.  I am so glad they stopped this drug or I believe she would now be dead.
Low Amount of Calcium in the Blood	317537, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/6/2009 11:00:36 PM	I had thyroids, parathyroids removed because I have Endrocrin neo-plasia type II-a. And was put on rocaltrol. And the calcium levels stayed in the normal range, I changed medical plans and could only get calcatrol and my calcium levels were always to low, and the Dr. would increase the calcium dosage up and up. I told the new Dr. when I was on rocaltrol I didn't need to take all this calcium. He changed my prescription to rocaltrol and my calcium levels started falling back into the normal ranges again with only 5 315mg citracal tablets a day. I've been taking these medications for 15 yrs. now. I went into get an x-ray on a knee That I messed Up and the DR. made a comment that I had very nice bone structure.

Also, my (usually controlled) arthritis pain became intolerable. I stopped the drug and already in 24 hrs, I feel so much better.
Other	PatF, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/4/2009 10:04:50 PM	Around 1994, I requested this drug for my mother who had severe osteoporosis.  Her GP prescribed it and renewed the prescription but didn't tell me that my mother needed to have blood tests to monitor this medication.  She became delusional and couldn't walk. My brother put her in a nursing home.  I removed her and took her to a gerontologist who did blood work.  She was rushed to the ER.  The rocaltrol had bound calcium up in her system.  Her kidneys were about to calcify.  It took about ten days for them to flush this medication out of her system.  
Condition caused by Low Levels of Parathyroid Hormone	Sonflower, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/16/2009 6:00:47 PM	I am 9 months post opp of a &quot;Complete Thyroidectomy/Parathyroidectomy Tumor Removel&quot; My three remaining Parathyroid Glands are dormant, therefore I am lacking PTH. Without PTH, one is unable to absorb calcium. I take Calcitriol, in place of PTH, for calcium absorbtion. This drug is literally a life saver!!
Other	peg, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	5/31/2009 7:02:07 PM	I took it twice for low calcium from my parathyroid surgery. It kept my calcium up, but I had a very painful headache over my right ear. And I had a metal taste in my mouth.It was awful. So I went back to taking lots of calcium pills. I thought I had a tumor in my head. Had mri and it was fine, so the only thing I was doing different was the calcitriol. So I stopped.
Vitamin D Deficiency	mitsar24, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/17/2009 6:39:53 PM	I have been taking this med since I had my thyroid removed 3 years ago.  I had cancer and when they did the cancer surgery the thyroid was removed and my parathyroid should have taken over and it didn't.  If it weren't for this drug my body would be numb and I would have muscle spasms constantly.  It has been a lifesaver!!
Vitamin D Deficiency	Siriusmind57, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/19/2009 2:51:42 PM	I took this medication for 35 years.  This drug saved my live.  My Parathyroids were removed during my Thyroidectomy.  I'm thankful I have found an alternative that I don't have to take it anymore.  I'm very thankful it was there when I needed it.
Condition caused by Low Levels of Parathyroid Hormone	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/4/2008 10:20:07 PM	I have had hypoparathyroidism for almost 20 years.  This drug has literally saved my life.  I'm glad that there's now a generic version, simply for cost reasons.  I see my endocrinologist every 6 months to get bloodwork done and see if my dosage needs 'tweaked', but rocaltrol is truly a wonder drug.
