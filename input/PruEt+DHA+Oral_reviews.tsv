Pregnancy	leanne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	19-24	9/8/2010 8:59:21 PM	I still can't believe how ANNOYING this product is to take.  My doctor prescribed it to me during my pregnancy and it has been nothing but an inconvenience.  You aren't supposed to take it with food, so it made my stomach super upset.  You can't take it with dairy, you have to take it around the same time every day, etc.  I feel like my days revolve around my stupid prenatal vitamins.  I want a vitamin I can take with food without reducing its effectiveness.  I understand you can't take iron with calcium because calcium cancels it out, so WHY is there calcium and iron in the same pill then??? It doesn't make any sense to me.

Pregnancy		4	2	2			8/16/2010 9:32:24 AM	Like others, I've taken this vitamin at night but experience different/unusual symptoms. For me, it causes what seems like restless leg symdrome in addition to mild indigestion. It drives me crazy when I try to go to sleep!! When I take a somewhat comparable OTC prenatal vitamin, I'm fine. Perhaps I'm having a mild allergic reaction to this brand?? PruEt has changed it's brand name by the way to PR Natal (FYI).

The puking is 100% a result of the vitamin as it happens about 10 minutes after taking it. Other than when taking this vitamin, I have not puked at all during pregnancy. It makes no difference if you eat food with this -- same bad result.
Pregnancy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	11/22/2009 9:52:29 PM	This medication was awful!!!  I took it everynight before bed because it was supposed to keep your stomach from getting upset.  My stomach was upset and oh my the fishy taste you get when it starts to break down.  I have almost thrown up because of it.  I am requesting a new medication from my doctor ASAP.

I had no problems with swallowing the pills, no problems with nausea or any &quot;fish-like&quot; after taste burps.  I don't have any suggestions for those who did experience those negative symptoms other than to have your Dr. prescribe another type of prenatal vitamin.  I have no complaints.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	9/15/2009 6:33:38 PM	My doctor put me on a prenatal for the combo of nutrients based on my condition and I went with the generic to save $$. I havent had any issues with it. I take it a few hours after dinner and about 30 minutes before bed. If I take it too early before bed Ill notice a slight upset stomach, so Im thinking I wouldnt be happy taking it during the day.
Pregnancy	consumerofpills, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	8/12/2009 9:44:54 AM	The problem with this generic is the DHA pills are huge and dissolve in a way that they come back on you in the form of nasty little fishy tasting burps (okay, I guess technically they burps are algae tasting because that is where DHA is derived from).  For me, a person who hates the taste of seafood, I feel like I want to gag when the burps (which are frequent) emerge.  The only thing I've found that helps to diminish the burping is to eat a banana at the same time you take the pills, but they still don't totally go away.  
Pregnancy	Melissa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	7/20/2009 10:13:46 AM	I was taking DuetDHA, which I was very satisfied with--no nausea whatsoever. But then the pharmacy gave me PruetDHA--supposedly the generic, and it was terrible. I felt nauseous every time I took it, and the fish oil seems to seep out of the capsules, leaving a terrible taste in my mouth and making the pills practically impossible to choke down without gagging. Now I am back on DuetDHA and the nausea is gone. These two vitamins are not the same--perhaps they contain the same ingredients, but the way they are formulated clearly differs. The DuetDHA is far superior.

Pregnancy	soundofyourheartbeat, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	4/18/2009 11:15:33 PM	I started this medicine quite recently, and right after I drank the called-for 8 ounces of water, I drank a very fruity slushy. The entire day, I didn't experience any kind of fish oil disgusting tasting burps, but let's all remember: burps aren't supposed to taste good anyway. And for those who got sick, did yours say &quot;May be taken with a small snack if stomach upsets&quot; because mine did, and I didn't get sick either...Read all of the instructions!
Pregnancy	firsttimemom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	4/18/2009 9:22:50 PM	I felt sick after taking this vitamin everytime. And oh the fist taste after(when you burp) is disgusting!
Pregnancy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	4/6/2009 6:39:20 PM	I got very sick while taking this vitamin.  I followed the instructions to the T and still found myself barely able to  move because I thought I'd be sick.
Other	arinkat, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	3/28/2009 11:45:22 AM	I haven't experienced the fish oil tasting burps, but I find the restrictions of when to take this drug difficult.  I have to take it first thing in the morning, and then wait two hours to eat/drink anything with caffeine or dairy.  It has made my breakfasts quite interesting.  Making this drug more user friendly would be my only suggestion.
Pregnancy		5	5	4			3/23/2009 3:46:24 PM	I, too, have tasted fish oil after a burp and have had upset stomach/diarrhea occasionally.  I like the multi-vitamin and fish oil/Omega-3 component.
