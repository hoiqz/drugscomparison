I can't prove that it is the cause of my weight loss of 70 lbs but my muscle mass has definately improved, tummy is much flatter and shoulders, legs and arms looks like it did 15 years ago. libido has also increased. I use a 20 guage needle to draw out of bottle and a 25 guage to inject in thigh, no pain at all. Moodiness has diminished greatly and I feel &quot;more like a man&quot; than I have in years.

The morning &quot;pick up&quot; goes away quickly, and soon enough you just feel normal and less depressed or unsure of yourself than you once did.

I went for two years wondering where my sex drive had gone, working out 3 hours of cardio and 3 hours of weight lifting a week loosing not an ounce of body fat on a 2000 calorie low carb low fat diet, suffered planar fascietus, carple tunnel syndrome and stiff joints, and severe moodiness.Within 3 weeks of my weekly injections of 100 mg weekly, all symptons were reversed except the body fat. I went from 18% body fat down to 12% over the following three months with the same workout routine I had been using to no evail prior to testosterone Cypionate replacement.This is a cure, not a treatment. Swear by it, changed my life for the better. Will use for the rest of my life. The only side effect is occassional unwanted erections.

My T level was at 188. I was tired. weak and generally feeling run down. My doctor noticed the low levels and we worked through three months of injections starting at 1 cc/two weeks. I am now at 1.2cc each week, my wife gives me my weekly injections.Eight months into the program my T level is at 865. My fatigue symptoms are nonexistent. After starting a weight program I have gained 14 lbs of lean muscle. I look (according to others) and feel great. My love life has improved dramatically, and my wife thanks me, often.Coupled with a vegetarian life style, sensible exercise, and sufficient protein intake, I am at peak fitness and health. My suggestion- find a doctor willing to work with you to promote well being and get those levels checked, you will be glad you did!

I was one testical undecended from birth that was not working at all and had been removed about 6 years ago. I had my levels tested then, and was in the 200 range. I used androgel which caused a skin rash, and after having complications with my other testicle and having to have it removed, the doctors decided on cypionate injections. The only body mass large enough I had to take the injection in was the in the buttocks which made it difficult to self inject. The shots boosted my levels as high in the beggining to the 800 to 1000 level and then after getting the dose corrected, it leveled out to around 700 at the peak. The injections helped with everything, energy, libido, muscle mass, chest and facial hair, and health in general. Didn't help with my X-wife!!! She wasn't ready for the changed me.   Only problem I've had is that after 2 years of injections, my levels have steadily dropped off. I have a weekly shot that has varied from 1.2 to .75ml and get tested two days afterwards. On the 3rd year I have had a steady decrease in the levels and even ywo readings of ZERO for the lab. The doctors can't figure it out. If anyone out there has had similar results and what they found to help, please rely. I'm taking DHEA suppliments now due to low levels there too.

The original reason my dr gave it to me is because I always said how tired I was and had leg cramps and no matter how much exercise i did my weight wouldnt come down from 200 (I am a vegetarian) and my blood sugars were still in the 100's despite medication for years. I was also diagnose as being bipolar about 11 years ago and have been on every single drug for that and depression, and I mean every drug. Nothing at all worked. I never wanted to get out of bed and was not interested in sex at all, not even masturbation. On a whim , my dr had my levels checks and they were 62. He rechecked it with a result of 64. He thinks that I have had Low test for years and that was the cause of my mood swings and depression and thats the reason the drugs werent working, because they were treating a problem i didnt have. Everyone says to inject yourself in the rear, but I have been injecting myself in the deltoid with no problem. The only thing I notice is about 10 minutes later i feel a sort of high and my blood pressure goes up, but I have learned to time my bp meds to help with that. I honestly havent noticed anything negative yet other than that. I am still waiting to see if anything good happens. i do know my restless leg has completely stopped and my insulin seems to be working better. I am taking 100cc a week.

From the first shot,I felt way better.My anti ageing doc prescribed this when my test levels were 305. He says thats the test level of a 80 year old man. Ignorant docs will say 305 is normal..but it isnt! I was tired all the time, moody and depressed with no sex drive at all. But now, just 2 weeks into therapy,Im horny all the time, have great sex with my wife and feel very enerrgetic.I take shots every 3 days, this prevents the roller coaster effect so many complain of. And all of my chest hair,beard and body hair that I lost is growing in very thick again. I also take arimidex 3 times a week to prevent man boobs from sprouting and to keep the test from converting to estrogen.This is vital, and if your doc wont give it to you or prescribe it correctly and proper doseage you need to find an anti ageing doctor..they know best and wont hesitate to prescribe enough to have an effect.Gels and creams and patches wont give much help so dont waste your time with that crap.Overall, I feel great like im 18 again and im 40!

That's about 225 mg/ml weekly. I feel like I'm 18 again and I'm 40. I'm horny all the time and always in a good mood. Lots of energy! My beard is filling in and my body hair is growing everywhere. Taking a shot every 3 days prevents the rollercoaster effect. Also, make sure you take arimidex 3 times a week to keep your excess test from converting to estrogen and then u end up with man boobs and such. For those of you getting small doses every 2 weeks or monthly u need 2 find a new doc as that's way to low doesage. Get an anti aging doc, they know the importance of correct test therapy. I just feel like a new man no complaints from me !

Level of 209 and Im a young age of 29. I saw my Dr for a lack of energy (I could sleep 12 hours and still be tired) not having a libido whats so ever. (No sex in 7 months and my fianc&#233;e thinks I dont find her attractive and was over it all!) I was also always in a bad mood, always. So my Dr thought I had depression and put on an Rx for that. I felt it made me feelWorse, so I stopped taking it and told him. I did some research on my own on the Internet to see what I could find and found it might be low testosterone. So I had my primary care Dr do the level test and it was the 209. He sent me to the endocrinologist and she did a full blood hormone test and found that all levels where right but my testosterone and at the time I was tested that time it was 224.My 1st shot that my Fianc&#233;e gave to me did not make me feel to different. I did find that I had more energy or at least did not feel like sitting around like I did before. My mood has changed from being negative to being quite happy... I do not sleep all night and morning and have a better outlook on my everyday life. I am waiting for my sexual appetite to come back as is my other half but Im 2 weeks in and very optimistic. I will be tested before I take my 2nd dose to calibrate my levels but things are looking up. Please.... Please do not hesitate to get your levels tested if you show signs that you have read in all the testimonies. It does not matter if your young like me or older. You really dont know the impact that your hormones will have on you till you are low and get it fixed!!

I am the man who first started taking the medicine only a few days ago (in a different post that you can read on here). I promised myself that I would get back to this website and write about how I am doing now that I have been taking this medicine for around 6 months now. I originally went from 1 1/2cc every 2 weeks to 2 1/2 cc every 2 weeks. I am feeling GREAT. My wife has noticed that I Have a more &quot;upright&quot; stance when I stand up, my shoulders are more rolled back, I have lost about 15 pounds of fat and gained about 15 pounds of muscle! On an emotional level, I have taken anything from anxiety medicine to paxil and ever since I have started my testosterone, I have never felt better about myself! This has been the greatest drug I have ever been prescribed! Not to mention it boosts up my sex drive as well so my wife is very happy too. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this drug. Thank GOD for my doctor for finding out that my levels were so low (among other things) and prescribing this to me! Don't suffer! And don't be afraid to use the shot- you will get used to it after a few times and it will be just as easy as taking a vitamin. Good luck to all and thank you! :)

The suspected reason is opiate maintenance treatment, which can reduce or stop your body from being able to produce its own testosterone. I can definitely say that it has made an enormous difference in my libido. Before starting injections, I hadn't wanted sex in over 3 years. My wife was ready for divorce. I've been on it for 3 months know, and I think my wife is ready to start hiding my testosterone vial from me.   On the flip side, on my last visit to my MD, my testosterone levels looked good, but my estrogen levels had become elevated. The Doc says this is sometimes caused by these injections, and now we are trying to adjust dosage to compensate. Haven't really noticed any difference in energy levels, but I'm perfectly happy being back from the land of the nuetered. Don't suffer, if you suspect symptoms, get your levels tested, you'll be glad you did

Absence of Testicles	GOBLUE, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male		11/28/2008 10:57:32 PM	an injury at the age of 13 caused permanebt loss of the testicles. I have been on testosterone treatment since 26 ( 50 years).injections were used until 2ooo when patches were tried which caused a skin reaction. next salve was used which was a mess and dis not seem to enter the systen effectively. back ti injection came in 2004. this methid has proved to be far the best. intected at a rate or 200ml biweekly.Improved strength and mental attidude are only two of the noticible benefits. The sexual side is also positive.

Other	Ty, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	10/17/2008 12:36:12 AM	I first started taking this medication only a few days ago. The first shot of it was given by my doctor when he showed me how to properly give myself a shot. After only an hour of being on the medication, I started feeling better! I thought that it was just because I was so happy to be on testosterone, but in fact, it helped my depression which is an underlined problem and not a main problem that I am having!I have had massive trauma to my back in my life, have been in chronic pain, have had trauma to my testicles, and also I am hoping to gain muscle in my back because I do not have any (due to so much pain in my back). I am really hoping that this will work and I am praying that I will gain some muscle in my back and lose some of the extra fat in my belly. Even though I have only been on this a few days, I am already feeling better on a emotional level and I sure do hope that it will work for building muscle and raising my testosterone levels to a normal range again. The doctor said that I will be on this medicine for the rest of my life.I take 1 1/2cc every 2 weeks for now, and he said that I will be bumped up to 2cc every 2 weeks next month. It seems to be a wonder drug from what I have read and what I have already gained by using this medicine! Thank God for doctors because I feel great already! :)

Other	Craven Moorehead, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	5	4	Male	35-44	9/8/2008 1:05:47 PM	I'm on this drug for low testosterone and elevated estrogen levels. I've been doing my cycles for the past 100 days and have noticed an increase in sexual libido, more facial hair growth, weight loss, muscle growth, a stronger body odors when sweating, increase in assertiveness or aggression and a loss in sleep time. I have very little change or even a slight decrease in energy. I've also noticed a slight decrease in the amount of sperm produced.As for the use of the drug, once you get over the needle phobia aspects, it is very easy to use and is not painful. My dose is low (150 mg.), so Im not anticipating and damage to internal organs or muscle ligaments and I take the drug as prescribed (1x every 6 days). As for the conflicting studies Ive read about the use of anabolic steroids, it appears that you will find the pros and cons about any drug or treatment for whatever ails you. Overall, I do feel better for taking this treatment as prescribed by my doctor.

Other	Keller28, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	5/13/2008 2:07:45 PM	I'm 28 yrs old male with extremely low testosterone levels, and just started the injections a week ago.  I inject 1 ML (200mg) every week, and have found that injecting the RX is much easier than I originally thought.  It took about 3 days to start feeling the effects, and about 4 days after that the 1st dose peaks.  On top of the testosterone injections, my DR has prescribed estrogen blockers to minimize side effects, because the body turns testosterone into estrogen.  So far I have tons more energy, contentration is better, sex drive up, depression gone, and increased confidence. The only side effect I've noticed is that I have woken up with a bad headache for two days which Advil took care of.  I wish that I was prescribed this sooner, because it seemed as though the two doctors I went to were scared to prescribe it even though all tests/labs showed I needed it!

It does a lot for my quality of life and I'm very glad its around.  Sex drive, energy mood all great.  If its not lasting long enough (as another poster described) speak to your Doctor and ask to adjust either the dose of frequency of injections.  Don't suffer in silence.
Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male	35-44	2/9/2008 1:26:47 AM	I use this drug to prevent HIV wasting, basically loss of muscle mass and to keep fat from overtaking my body.  It does a good job of this, but the fact that it has to be injected is inconvenient.  I am not willing to inject myself, therefore I must visit my doctor's office every time I need an injection.  Also, in addition to this being by FAR the most effective delivery mechanism, it's the only one that my insurance will pay for 100%, because I am getting it through my doctor, not the pharmacy.  Androgel and Testim were the methods I'd tried before this and they worked less effectively and my insurance jacked the price up on them so high that I couldn't afford them anymore.

Other	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	9/26/2007 10:45:02 AM	I have hypogonadism. My body makes and extremely low amount of testosterone and that is the purpose for taking this medication. The one thing I caution is that it does not last as long as they say it should in me. They say it should last about 2-3 weeks but it only lasts about 10 days before I start to notice the effects of low levels of testosterone again. I still wait the last four days because this is not a drug to be misused. However, used properly, it will give wonderful results.
