It seems to be working pretty good but wears off way to quick. I am supposed to take it every 4-6 hours but after 2-2 1/2 hours it begins to wear off.

Cough	Robin, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/5/2009 11:08:20 PM	I felt it worked as well as Tussionex and possibly even better since it does have the sudafed in it to help with the congestion too. It does seem to wear off in about 6 hours though, and my prescription was for every 8 hours.
