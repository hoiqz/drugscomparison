Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection	jinx, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/22/2012 1:57:45 PM	Day 3 of a 7 day course of treatment. I was hesitant after reading others reviews of how nauseated they were, thankfully, I have not had any side effects. No nausea, but then, I take the pills WITH food, whether I'm hungry or not. Lots of water as recommended. I think its going to be ok.

Still have sinus infection.  Be careful taking this drug.
Other	joeeeee, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	25-34	3/14/2012 9:50:40 PM	Well, I took it Septra DS for Prostatitis.It was either that other Cipro which has way worse side affects. Lots of fatigue with this one since the the day i started taking it. I drank 2 litres of water a day. To flush out my system. Its not a feel good drug..but short term pain for long term gain.
Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection	SeptraSick, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	2/15/2012 12:06:00 PM	I was prescribed the generic form of Septra DS for a UTI/Kidney Infection and am on day 8 of 10 of the medication (1 pill twice a day). I am experiencing extreme fatigue, body aches, neck pain, headache, and loss of appetite. I feel these side effects are not life threatening and will continue until I'm finished to fight off the infection, however, I don't know why they still prescribe this pill. It is horrible and makes me feel so sick.  Luckily, I am not nauseous - I don't think I'd be able to handle that. I am anxious to get retested for my infection and HOPE that this pill has done its job, especially since I've been put through hell by taking it. I am so sluggish at work all I want to do is stay in bed or soad in hot water to make my aches go away. I will NEVER again take this medicine. I wish I had known to ask the Dr. about the side effects, but just assumed since he prescribed it that they were mild.  Boy was I wrong. Good luck to those on it now.
Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection	Percy27, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	2/2/2012 1:05:13 AM	I've been taking this medication for 6 days now. Yesterday I got migraine early in the morning and one day later I still have it. I  woke up during midnight feeling very anxious, like needing to move my arms and legs continuously. Can't sleep at all. I don't think I'll be taking this medicine again.
Other	seeker_kat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	3	Female	45-54	1/20/2012 6:56:59 AM	I have been on this med for two rounds.  Ihave had severe loss of any desire to eat whatsoever. When I do eat there is very little taste. This last four days has been real difficult due to extreme nausea after taking dose.  Headaches unlike any before.  Blurred vision.  Last night I thought I would never ever stop feeling sick after eating dinner (half of home cooked hamburger)  Between having to sit on the tolet and hug the trash can I swore if I lived through it I would not take that pill again.  This also happened the night before last with a little soup and half sandwich of turkey.  Wasn't the food.  I cannot imagine taking this pill again.

Skin Infection	Enigma, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	2	5	Male	19-24	11/30/2011 6:44:09 PM	I've had severe acne since my early teens and not until my dermatologist put me on Septra DS did the acne clear up. No over-the-counter product ever helped, because Acne Vulgaris is a skin infection. Apparently this antibiotic treats many infections and diseases, but if anyone suffers from severe acne, this medication is probably the solution -- and much safer than the dangerous Accutane. The side effects I've experienced from taking Septra DS (double dose) was stomach pain and discomfort, which abated in time.

I went to a gynecologist and was given a pill and cream to treat it. The yeast infection went away for a few days but then came right back. I then went to a health food store and was told to take probiotics. After a week of taking them my yeast infection finally went away! Be careful when getting off this medication. I would recommend taking probiotics. My doctor never warned me that a yeast infection could be a side effect and when I told her about it she just got very defensive.

I was originally taking 800mg a day for severe cystic acne. My mom is 53 and still gets cysts. Unfortunately mine are not going away anytime soon. I have worked with my Derm and do blood tests once a year. But take 400mg every three days and have been cyst free for years. I do go through a month long test period every year to see if they come back, and sure enough, like clock work about 5 days off and i have cysts in my face, neck, arms, and just about everywhere else if i am off long enough. and then i have to get cortizone shots to take them down. I have never had even 1 side effect with this drug. It is my miracle, i work in a salon and am know for my radiant skin. Thanks Septra!!!!

It does make me tired and, at times, I will get headaches but the side effects are very tolerable and much better than dealing with painful UTIs.
Sinus Irritation and Congestion		1	1	1			3/5/2011 4:11:51 PM	I was prescribed this for a sinus infection. The first night I took the medicine, it gave me the worst headache and extreme nausea. I was up all night getting sick. I had the doctor change my antibiotic immediately the next day!

After about a week, all of a sudden I was getting sweating of my hair.  The hair on the back of my head was so wet you thought I just washed it.  I thought maybe I was going through memopause or something because it never happened before and I never had menopause but thought it migh be starting. About 3 days later I got flushed, perspired so all my clothes were wet and very clamy and again my hair was soaking wet.  When I got home I took my clothes off and every part of my body covered with clothes had a sporatic rash.  The rash now is on my whole torso.  I looks like a case of prickly heat that children get.  I went to Dr.  who looked at it and automatically said it was a typical allergic reaction to the Septra.  He said to stop taking the medication, gave me a shot of cortisone and said to take benedry over the counter.  That was Friday and today is Sunday.  I am no better.  Now I can't stand the itching and have to wait until tomorrow to see Dr.  I will never take this med again.  I have spayed bactine to try to ease itching.  Nothing is helping.  I stopped the Septra on Friday and this is Sunday so I know it must still be in my system. I am trying not to scratch but sometimes I have to give in.  Please if you get any indication about sweating or clamy, please stop taking before the rash occurs.  I don't want anyone to go through what I am going through.
Bacterial Urinary Tract Infection	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	13-18	2/12/2011 12:25:04 PM	I was prescribed this medication for my bladder/urinary tract infection with a seven day dose, taking the pill twice a day. I have had all of the &quot;flu like symptoms&quot; thanks to this pill. Waking up in the middle of the night with chills, 102 degree fever, vomiting,muscle aches and on the last day of taking the medication I broke out in hives all over my body. I would not recommend this medication to anyone! I trusted my doctor and took it without question. I really wish I would have read the reviews before taking it. There are plenty of other antibiotics out there that work just as well without the side effects. Stay away from this one!

It did clear infection but not worth it! 7 days of feeling bad, no way, there's other antibiotics out there.

Was taking for cystitis, don't know which kind.  Caused Severe joint pain, inability to sleep, diahrrea started after 5 days, abdominal pain, skin hurt, eyeballs hurt, black stools started 3rd day after stopping  treatment.  I think this drug was too strong &amp; overkill for an almost 66 year old woman.  Was supposed to take for 7 days &amp; I did my best to stay with it, took it with food &amp; yoghurt &amp; lactinex to stall off any yeast infection &amp; took all but the last pill.  I couldn't face another pain filled sleepless night.  Within 24 hours of last dose I felt almost back to normal, but then the black stools started &amp; now it will be more medicine of some kind to counteract that.  My urine didn't show infection, but I had burning symptoms &amp; frequent urge to urinate.

Okay for one day, then the fever, night sweats, chills, hot flashes, sore joints, and hives started. I thought I just had a cold,and got flea bites from my doggie, until I did some research, to find out these are allergic reaction symptoms. I have called my doctor, and finally got a call from her receptionist a day later, saying &quot;maybe&quot; I should stop taking it, and to come in and see them &quot;in a week or so&quot;. Needless to say, I will never take this medicine again, or give this doctor any more of my business!

Coli Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/15/2010 10:10:02 PM	I have been taking this medication daily for almost three months now, and have had absolutely NO side effects. I'm really surprised at all the negative reviews. It was my only option for antibiotics to take--I have four kidneys so that makes me suceptible to UTI's. I'm a nursing mother, too, so it had to be safe for the baby. Plus I'm allergic to several kinds of antibiotics, and this one was the only one that worked with that as well as being what the bacteria was sensitive to. I basically have to take this every day indefinitely. I can try to take it every other day after I've been infection free for awhile.

I woke up with a horrible one 2 days ago and had to go to the ER yesterday. The doctor gave me Septra and Pyridium for it. The only side effects I have are loss of appetite, drowsiness, dizziness, and headache. I would take all those symptoms as long as the infection goes away! Plus, you're supposed to rest and drink lots of water, so the symptoms aren't really bothersome.

Urinary Tract Infection due to E. Coli Bacteria	Tamara127, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	9/11/2009 1:56:04 PM	Because of recurrent bladder infection (The last one I had was 3 weeks ago) the doctor prescribed me a different antibiotic than the last one. It works well, my UTI symptoms went away. However I had nausea, dizziness, fatigue and a headache. I did feel better after eating a light lunch though. So I think, even though this medication says you can take it with or without food, it should be taken with food.

She vomited the rest of the day. After speaking w/the pharmacist I found out I should have split dose into 2. I tried that too with no improvement, the Dr. changed her Med to Amox. Turns out Septra wouldn't have cured the E.coli, so I'm glad she didn't have to finish it.

I stopped taking it and have had nausea and been vomiting, loss of appetite, and STILL the painful urge to have to urinate. The doctors guess it may have caused an intestinal infection and a yeast infection. I will never take this antibiotic again.
