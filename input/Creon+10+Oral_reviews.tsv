I feel better and my two main ailments are almost completly gone. Citrucel helps with the constipation. I still suffer from bloating in the stomach and fatige. I'm also on Bentyl. I have constant gastritis and this is the best I've been since my gallbladder was removed. I'm hoping to get better and healthier with this med.

He had to take 3-4 Creon 10 for his food to digest. The Creon digested his food, but he always had nausea and vomiting about 30 minutes to 1 hour afterwards. But, when he vomited it was always liquids.  He has taken about 8 chemo (Gemzar)treatments, so I had him to cut the Creon to 2 with each meal, and 1 with a snack.He has not had any vomiting since the dosage has been decreased.  New that the vomiting has subsided he has gain 11 lbs., and is doing remarkably well.

Take four w/each meal and two or three with a snack. Started in Aug 1985 till present.  Usually have cramping after first meal in morning (lower left quadrant)Usually four trips to bathroom, then bowel settles down for the rest of the day.  If I don't eat 6 or 7 times a day. cramping returns, but not as harsh. Then again passes..I've held steady at 184 pounds, and eat anything I want. I do take Tramadol for discomfort when riding in a car/lawnmower etc.. the constant vibration is bothersome, this eases of the discomfort. I can physically do about anything I want.

Had more blood work done, MRCP, Gastroscopy, all normal except my lipase which continued to remain high.  I have been on this for a week, and have had no stomach problems at all.  My specialist's intent is to &quot;rest&quot; my organs/digestive track, and then see if I still need the medication or not.
