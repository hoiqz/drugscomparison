The Zanfel took away the itching and began reducing the impacted area on the first application. It came back the second and third days but I just reapplied and it went away again. Only side effect is that part of my leg still had a numbing feeling 2 montsh later. The stuff saved me!

The only reason why I'm posting is because I saw all the negative comments. I got poison ivy 4 days ago and my breakout looks pretty bad. Its just on my forearms though. I just applied the product exactly how they said, and did scrub for the full 3 minutes. Its been 1 hour and the itching is 95% gone and its looking 95% better already. I'm very impressed and the money for it was well worth it to me.

Zanfel was gritty and difficult to work into a paste. Itching stopped while applying the paste but returned as soon as I washed the grit away. Definitely not worth the money or time. Anti itch creme and Benadryl worked much better.

It feels good initially because of th grit in the wash - it doesn't take a dermatologist to figure out that rubbing sandpaper on poison ivy is going to feel good.  After that, I saw and felt no improvement and in fact, things continued to get worse.  My doctor said that essentially, no over-the-counter products are effective, you just have to wait out the rash or get on steroids.

Severe irratation/ itching from waist down. Bought this very expensive creme out of despiration.Very difficult to work into paste, itching continues for almost 1hr then returns in about 3hrs. Tube does not go far and relief was minimal.  Never again! Benedryl just as good.

I found it was about as effective as Calomine Lotion.

Needless to say the location of my irritation was not pleasent. The it h was almost unbearable...and I found myself pouring extremely hot water over my privates many times a day (yes this does temporarily provide a relief to the itching) but I needed more. I came across Zanfeldecided to buy an overpriced box of this stuff. After getting home and opening the box I felt ripped off....this tube was so small. Then I tried. This stuff was amazing! After taking a shower n using it on my genital area the itchy was completely gone and the product has a grit to it which allowed me scratch myself during application (heavenly)  within an hour after my shower I could see my sores dried up considerably and all were dried by the next morning with no itching returning.

It stopped the itching and speading immediately ( thank goodness ) Dried out all areas real good ! I would definitely use it again. Need to ask pharmicist for it as it is NOT on the counter.
