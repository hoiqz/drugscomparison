I eventually passed out while I was driving my car (luckily only going 10mph)and was taken off the thorazine.

I have been taking it now for almost a month. I had taken myself off Seroquel XR because it has made me gain about 50 lbs. I went from being under weight to extreme over weight.  I have not lost any weight yet since I have been on thorazine. I'm hoping It will start coming off soon. I'm going to give it another month or so to drop atleast 10 pounds. I will have to try another medication if the weight from the seroquel xr does not come off. It will be a bummer if I have to get off thorazine because it has helped my anxiety and mood a ton!!! Medications effect each and every individual differently. Just don't give up on trying to find one that works for you. I am a firm believer that medicine can help you live a happy productive life. Good luck to everyone out there!

I have had sleep problems since i was 13. I have been on every medication they make for my insomnia. Ambien, remeron, lunesta just to name a few but nothing worked. untill my dr put me on thorazine. it takes about an hour to kick in and lets me sleep all the way through the night. I dont wake up during the night, i dont wake up groggy the next morning. its a life saver! i am absoutly satisfied with this medication.

Its one side effect has been sleepiness, which helps me get to sleep at night. I have had trouble doing normal thinking when on a large dosage so I've worked to get my dosage down to a satisfactory level. Now my thinking is clearer and I still have the tranquilizing effect which keeps me sane. I'm wondering now, though, if it is causing me the extreme fatigue I am feeling.

This medicine, along with phenytoin (for seizures) helped me to think straight. However, I now feel like I have no personality and I am always tired. I'm not psychotic anymore, but I'm not normal either. I can't think like I used to, but at least I am not extremely confused anymore.
