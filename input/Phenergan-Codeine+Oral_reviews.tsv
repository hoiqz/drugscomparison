Cold Symptoms	kimmie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/14/2010 1:08:51 AM	I used this for a sore throat and post nasal drip cough and found that this is the only stuff that actually worked for me.  I use this only at night due to the fact that this makes me EXTREMELY sleepy...

Provided that you don't have any nausea when takinhg it, it works to calm an upset stomach. It also works pretty well for sllergies &amp; sinus congestion.
Cough	NA17kb, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	2/14/2009 2:07:49 AM	I have taken this medication a couple times for when I have had a serious respiratory infection that caused excessive coughing. The coughing was so violent at times that it sometimes set off my gag reflex, causing me to vomit. Phenergan w/ codeine in cough syrup form did wonders for my cough. I was finally able to sleep through the night without keeping myself and my spouse up. I never felt compelled to use this drug at other times, although i can see why someone would. It does cause drowsiness and makes you a little loopy. All in all I'm very happy with this medication. I have chronic bronchitis that flares up in the winter and accompanies a common cold, so knowing that this drug is out there and works so effectively makes me feel better.
