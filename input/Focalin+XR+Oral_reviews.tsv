The suppressed appetite was extreme. My son would not eat anything for atleast 8 hours after taking the meds. Also my son talked uncomfortable slow while on this medication.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	LA-ADHD, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	1	2	Female	35-44	6/30/2012 11:58:18 AM	Last year I was prescribed Concerta for ADHD, the constant mental state I've been in since childhood (I'm 40). Over the years, I adapted to the scatter-brained, distracted feeling of ADHD -- don't like it but I've used it productively, successfully (juggling lots of work and activity at once). The more destructive symptom of ADHD is the constant chasing a rush (of dopamine) and the anxiety and depression that follows when rush is over.Taking the meds doesn't help me focus as much as give me a euphoric high, it is speed after all. I feel like I'm on a smaller dose of a street drug like speed or cocaine. Can't imagine giving it to kids. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	3-6 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	4	2	Male	3-6	6/15/2012 8:54:38 PM	My 5 yr old son was just diagnosed with ADHD and this is his first drug he has been on. So far not sure how it is working. He is on the 5mg and I have to mix it into apple sauce since he can't swallow the capsule. The first day on it I thought it was working because I took him to a local fair and he was awesome. But that may have been because he was having fun riding rides. No different at summer camp that his teachers have said. Still having a few melt downs and being physical with peers. Going to give it one more week to see if it works.

I like this medicine but he has been complaining about stomach pain,soft stool and blurred vision. He also is a bit agitated for about 40 mint when it wears off and then he is hyper for about 2 or 3 hr I send him to play basketball during that time. But I think I am going to wait it out a few more weeks and see if the symptoms go away..My main concern is the blurred vision.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	13-18	5/13/2012 12:38:51 PM	I was diagnosed with ADHD in 3rd grade. Before then I did poorly in school and had no ability  to focus. After I started taking Concerta my school performance increased. However, Concerta had very severe side effects. Quite often I would forget to eat some days because I did not feel hungry although I should have been. I switched to Focalin XR a few years ago (currently at a 40mg dose, combined with 5mg-10mg of short acting depending on the day) the school performance has still been great but now I do not experience the same level of side effects. I noticed that someone asked if when taking the medication you experience nausea. Yes, if you have nothing on your stomach you will experience severe nausea and stomach pain for about 1-2 minutes when the medication is kicking in. One other thing to note, my hands and feat sweat an abnormal amount when I am on the medication. But other than that, I am currently in all honors and AP classes and have a 4.5 gpa. I would not have this without the medication. The benefits outweigh the downsides in my mind. I would recommend it to anyone struggling with ADHD.

For the past six months he's not had one good day at school. The Dr. prescribed 5mg a day. The first day I saw a different child. We spent two hours in a waiting room and he sat quietly reading and playing his PSP. About six hours after the first dose, he complained of being very hot, so hot that he was going to vomit. After I made him more comfortable, he immediately came down with a migraine. Day 2 he crashed out only after a couple of hours and had increased anxiety. Scared of natural disasters and he made the comment that he did not feel safe with me. He felt as though I was going to leave him. He was very paranoid and scared to death of everything. I'm not giving him the meds on the weekend. I plan to try again on Monday and if he still has issues, I will contact the doctor to try a different medication. Anyone have any suggestions?

After then it works fine. at a low dose, i am fine. when the meds dose was 10mg i was an emotionless zombie. 5mg is fine. My ADD is almost gone now.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	4/11/2012 3:21:52 AM	I was diagnosed with ADHD my second year of college.  Since being diagnosed and starting 20mg XR a day I have figured out my own patterns of adjusting to the medicine.  To start, I was told that it lasts only 8 hours.  Honestly, I feel the effects for 12-15+.  I have to manage when I take it or else it affects my eating and sleeping pattens.  With it I have seen an improvement in my grades, so it does out way the side-effects.  I want to make clear that it has helped tremendously in my college career, my only advice is to make sure you or your child are on a strict regulated schedule, that way you will there will be a diminished chance for side effects.

He also has a great deal of anxiety along with ADHD.  We have seen very good results as far as behavior.  He is doing better in school.  He says he feels a lot less anxious when taking it and the &quot;channels aren't changing in his brain&quot;. We notice his interactions with us and others is much better when taking medication.  His impulse control is greatly reduced!  Our only concern is that he does experience a &quot;come down&quot; usually around 8PM (he usually takes about 7AM).  If we are home he does fine, but if he is out he sometimes gets very anxious and nervous for about an hour until it completely wears off.  However, the positive results far out weigh this occasional problem.  It is VERY expensive and there doesn't seem to be much help for middle class families who do have insurance coverage but not much for medications.  We have decided it is worth the cost, but definitely a sacrifice in the wallet!  Wonder about children who have families that don't have the option do, very sad.

When I first started the medication it was almost as if the brakes were being applied to the multitude of thoughts that would run through my mind so that I could more easily focus on the item that I wanted to address.The same thing occured when listening to a conversation from someone that was speaking to me.It does not eliminate all those extra thought distractions but it has defintely reduced them significantly so that I can focus better.I like others wish that we would of had this type of medication and understanding of ADHD when we were growing up but at least it's comforting to know that our children and grandchildren will have a chance to address it in a more positive way in the future.

Her teacher told us she would walk around the room while she was teaching, talk out, write her words going down the page, not across, it was awful! She simply was not teachable, and retained very little from that first year. Over the summer we started her on Focalin XR 10mg. This year so far, she is the star student in her first grade class! The change has been amazing. My only complaint the medicine wears off after school, and she is wired up for the rest of the day. She has trouble &quot;winding down&quot; and getting to sleep. I use Melatonin occasionally, but it often leaves her groggy the next day, wished we could find a better solution. Very concerned about stated side effects; affects growth rate and adult height and the potential for future addictive tendencies.

My son is 8, but we have been struggling and going through testing with this as well as a speech delay since the age of 2, hoping he would out grow the issues we face and knowing he was too young to diagnose and being afraid to medicate so early. he received speech therapy from the age 2-almost 5, and started kindergarten with out speech therapy. His behavior started becoming an issue between the ages of 2-3 (which i felt could have been a result of not being understood with his speech delay). At the age of 5 we finalized with the doctors saying he was too young to diagnose, with thoughts of him out growing the issues, and contacting them later if needed. We have delt with a LOT of behavior issues in school, including suspension in 1st grade, several disiplinary notes, meetings held at school, etc. My son is now in 3rd grade and is expressing verbally how hard it is to control himself. We have decided to try medication after being able to think on it for 3 years and my son noticing things within himself. This is only day 2 of taking meds and the first one we have tried, i will update as we go along, i have pretty much made myself sick trying to be observant on how this is effecting my son, and trying to distingish regular from irregular side effects. i know i am not the only one, so i will update.

Boys will be boys, but he was WAY beyond a typical, energetic kid.  We stopped going to church because Sunday school teachers had him in time-out most of the class and couldn't handle him. I didn't go to the grocery alone with him, only if my husband could be there to help corral him. Our pediatricians nurse suggested that he needed more discipline.  I started crying! I said, &quot;He spends most of his time in time out, we've even tried spanking, rewarding doesn't work, I can't friggin' discipline him any more than I do!  FYI- his 8 year old brother has NEVER been in trouble at school, is always polite, I knew it wasn't our parenting.  Our son needed help.  He's not a bad kid, he's just impulsive and can't focus or control himself. We started on Concerta and got major symptom relief.  However, after 6 months my son had actually lost weight and he had major trouble falling asleep(like up until midnight). We switched to Focalin XR. He eats, gains weight, and sleeps!!! We are very pleased. He's on 10mg at 7:00am and has to take a 2.5mg(non-XR) around 2-3pm because it wears off.  I just called the Dr. to discuss trying 15 mg XR in the morn because he is struggling a bit in kindergarten with following the rules, focusing, etc.  He's still worlds better than before the medication!  Basically, we like Focalin more than Concerta because his true personality still shines through(not a zombie), he eats great, and he sleeps better.  Once we get the dosage fine tuned I know he'll be good to go. I wish he didn't need any medication, but I'm thankful we have found something to help our son.  He's not the &quot;bad kid&quot; anymore. People get to know the real him and that's a beautiful thing!

For me, the Focalin XR works the best since I don't have to remember to take it 4 hours later. I take 1 40mg Focalin XR per day, or 2x20mg Focalin XR.  The only side effect I notice, is that I have post-nasal drip, and this drug seems to make it much worse about 1 hour after taking it.  Usually it involves me throwing up until I can get rid of the phlegm, then I'm fine.  But Focalin works so well, I just deal with it.   I'm working with my allergist to see if there is anything else that can be done for the post-nasal drip.All-in-all, I love Focalin XR.  I just wish it was generic already. :)
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Happy Dad, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	4	Male	3-6	6/26/2011 8:01:04 PM	6-year old boy, 115% height, 120% weight, sensory-seeker, I.E.P.; 2x OT, 2X Speech, 2X Counseling, 98% G&amp;T, diagnosed as hyperactive/impulsive w/ no separate attention disorder.  5mg Focalin XR made considerable improvements at home but little discernable difference at school.  10mg made instantaneous improvement at school.  Model student who now looks forward to school and interacting with classmates. Initially emotionally unsettled but much more able to articulate his feelings and frustrations.  Regained his emotional equilibrium after a few days.  No personality change.  Side affects are loss of appetite (a good thing for his size), difficulty falling to sleep (1/2 tab of 3mg melatonin works).  He takes a med holiday on weekends and the summer but I am almost tempted to keep him on but won't.  I feed him well in the morning to help him get thru the day and have snacks at the ready after school.  We got lucky... I hope you do too.

Finally when he was in 1st grade we got to our breaking point and really had ne other choice. He had tried many different meds and none of them worked very well for him finally I took him to a neurologist and he put him on focalin XR and also informed me that he has touretts that was causing his ticks (I thoughts that his ticks were from the meds but the meds just made them worse) so now he is on the Focalin and colonidine for the ticks and he is doing much better and doesnt get into fights at school for the kids making fun of him for his ticks. I recomend Focalin to people that I talk to that have kids with ADHD all of the time.

I used to take Concerta 135mg until last summer where I switched to Focalin XR 30mg. The decrease in appetite ceased. Also, I could sleep when on the medication. This may be because I am used to it and the side effects that stimulants have but it is nice. Also to those who ask why there child cant sleep. It is because the medication lasts 12-15 hours and is a stimulant so it will keep them up. Don't use the XR if it is past 11am use the normal focalin or they wont sleep. I also twitch and have shaky hands but it is not that bad. My school performance has increased dramatically since I started taking medication for ADHD. I would recommend this medication.

He was on Vyvanse but it started not working as well &amp; we could not up the dosage because of side effects.  He is on Focalin 10 mg and it works great until it wears off late afternoon.  I think we may have to increase to 20 mg to prolong the effect.

Idk, I really just cant help it. It helps me focus though. I'm just amazes that people give this to there 6-9 year old kids... Is it really that necessary that they take it so they can focus better in 1st grade? I wish when I was 6-9 my parents would have tried helping me train and control the problem instead of just putting me on pills, I feel almost a reliance on them now. I'm 17, and I've taken almost all the more popular adhd pills. I can't blame my parents I guess because they thought they were doing the right thing but I really wish they would've spent more time trying to train me or help me focus with therapy or anything before giving me these drugs that have quite obviously changed the very core of who I am over the course of 7+ years. These drugs do something to your brain, I can feel it, I just wish I would've been accepted for what I was... A hyper kid. Now I'm 17 and I never gained the ability to really focus on my own, always relied on medication and I feel like I'm a step behind everyone else my age and it makes it hard to quit taking medication. I don't know, I plan on quitting after college, I try not to take it during summers, there's no need for that. My friends all notice there's a huge difference in my personality when I'm not taking it. I'm more lively and approachable.

Wince a happy loving active child, it turned her into a robot like kid. Her expressions changed. Aches and pains all over her body happened daily.Disabilitating headaches were a daily thing.She was also beginning to have a numbness feeling in her hands and feet. Weird.What it did good - her teacher was happy. She didn't have to help the kid to accomplish her tasks. My thought today - after giving Focalin for 1 1/2 year to my second grade child is that the pill definitely speed them up.But that is how these pills are called, right? Speed.I do not think it helped the child. Even though she finished her work independently, she would have finished the same work with a little more teacher attention without the pill.There is a book - ADHD Fraud - that opened my eyes.The only thing the pill accomplish is to let the teacher have a better life. It destroys the child brain - shrinks it over time - and also changes the child healthy heart into a diseased one, with physical changes.What we got out of the experience - change the child school before you dope your child. Focalin is a dope and the results only benefit the teacher.Give the teacher a speed pill and keep the children unharmed.My child will not be in a pill anymore.She does have a slow nature and giving her speed drugs won't change her nature.The side effects are not worthy.And your doctor will not tell you that.As a matter of fact, my child doctor doped his own child everyday. I cannot understand that.I think we will be changing pediatrician also.SAY NO TO DRUGS - including FOCALIN.It is bad for your child.Change the school or even homeschool before you speed her up.Just a thought.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Ugh., 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	13-18	4/5/2011 3:25:52 PM	When I take Focalin XR (20 mg), I'm not as hyperactive. I feel drained of life, my mouth gets dry, I lose my appetite, I have NO desire to be talked to, and overall just feel like dying. When I first take it, the next three or four hours are alright. I am more calm, and I stay on task better. But by the time I get to my afternoon classes (where I tend to not have as much work) I start to feel like a zombie. Such as right now. Weird thing is, when I do work I don't have such a strong feeling. Like right now for example, typing this is kind of like work so I'm not wanting to jump in front of traffic as much. I guess you have to fight it, I don't know. From around 4:00pm to 9:00pm I literally just want to die and regret ever taking the medication. I take one at about 7 am and another at lunch (about 11am). I'm 17 and 140lbs if that has anything to do with it.

He started out on 5 mg of Adderall XR which did not work for him. He was very emotional, crying over everything and very angry when the drug wore off(which was only about 6 hours. After trying AdderalXR for a month we switched him to Focalin  XR. I saw results the first day. He is very focused, very talkative, is able to retain information from his school day and is not moody at all. There is no crash for him with Focalin XR. He does have a loss of appetite but we let him eat whatever he wants once it wears off. I find it works for about 8 hours. There isn't a generic drug yet so it is expensive, we pay 75.00 a month and the pharmacist says it is hard to get so we usually have to submit to pharmacy about a week before we need it.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	medicmommy, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Male	3-6	2/16/2011 3:28:18 PM	My son was diagnosed with ADHD at age 5. I struggled to keep him on non-stimulant medications and we tried every variation possible but they just did not work well for him. Finally we started him on FocalinXR 5mg. and immediately noticed a big difference both at school and at home, however it seemed to wear off right about the time he gets home. We decided to up the dosage to 10 mg. He has been on this medication going on 2 months now and is doing great! Night and day difference. He is doing great in school and a lot better at home too! I have a amazing son, I love being around him SO much more when his ADHD is under is under control! (: 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Tampa Mom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/28/2010 1:02:48 PM	My daughter was diagnosed with ADHD a couple months before she turned six. She was very smart and always knew the answers to everything the teacher asked, but was constantly in trouble in school because she could not sit still and could not follow directions. At home, we frequently had to deal with her temper tantrums and big meltdowns. We couldn't figure out what set her off. Her Kindergarten teacher suspected that she had ADHD and suggested that we seek a specialist for diagnoses. She was correct. The neurologist diagnosed my daughter with ADHD and prescribed her the 5 mg Focalin XR. She tried it for a week but it didn't have any noticeable effect on her. The doctor then increased the dosage to 10 mg. The effect was dramatic. It was like an on/off switch. When the medication went into effect, she was very reticent. I didn't like it because it's almost like she's completely a different person. However, she was able to sit still in class, follow directions, and concentrate on what she was doing. It boosted her self confidence because she stopped getting in trouble in school and as a result, she's more popular with the other kids. She is now 8 1/2 and is still on the same 10 mg dosage. Over time, the effect of the 10 mg medication did seem to lessen but I think she's now at a perfect balance. She is less reticent but is still able to focus in school. One major side effect of the medication is loss of appetite. She does not eat much, if any, at lunch time when the medication is in effect, so I always make sure that she eats a big, healthy breakfast before school. By dinner time, the medication has worn off, so she gets her healthy appetite back.

Her concentration during school has improved greatly. But, if she misses a pill, you can really tell. Also, the medication seems to wear off by the time she gets home from school. I have a very difficult time getting her to do her homework at home. I'm thinking maybe she needs another dose in the afternoon.

So far, we see great results in his focus and memory.  However, it is giving him severe stomach aches and vomiting once it begins to wear off.  Has anyone else experienced this?  The doctor's nurse told us to keep giving it and it would get better.  I am not so sure about this.  Could the dosage be too high?  He weighs 89 pounds.

The doctor upped his dose to 10mg &amp; he seems better but having bad temper tantrums &amp; saying he is going to kill himself.  We took him off of the medication &amp; are trying a natural holistic medicine that is working much better.

We both take 10mg daily for ADHD. I might need to increase my dosage since the effects are wearing off by noon if I take it at 7. BEST THING WE EVER DID! We can do things one at a time. We don't flit around doing a million things. We have learned how to plan short term and long term tasks/goals. Our personalities have not changed at all. We did not lose our appetites. I wish I had this when I was younger so that I could have sat still and paid attention to school and social activities with less self-interruption. We both noticed a difference the first day. No headaches or prolonged weird feelings. First and second day I experienced a total of 3 moments (2 seconds) of dizziness. It did not affect my job performance or ability to remain working with my students. I can honestly say that this medication has made a huge difference in our lives. Being able to sort out my thoughts and follow along in class, conversations, and my own stream of consciousness has truly improved my life. My son is less impulsive and is able to control his behaviors better.

I was told he had no problems.  He has been on Focalin 5 mg since november of 2009, in the afternoon after the medicine would wear off or he had not taken it his temper was the same or almost worse, it seems to get worse the older he gets, especially after the medication wears off.  Does well in school, but at about 4pm, watch out.  The doctor put him on 10 mg xr at 3pm, he was so sick with a headache and nausea he could not sit up, he also said he could not stop crossing his eyes.  If someone has this same dosage and problem please let me know what helps in the afternoon.

Within the last two weeks I have felt horrible. I keep crying uncontrollably, such as getting ready for work or school. I freak out about small issues. I don't even find that it's helping with my concentration and I just started another semester at college so I'm very frustrated that this isn't working. I feel more depressed than I ever have in my life and it's since I started taking these pills. Plus I've had horrible migraines everyday.

We eventually stopped and went back to the short acting Ritilin tablets, which so far have worked the very best. (Well, actually the Daytrana patch *worked* the very best, but it gave him a very uncomfortable rash)

I was prescribed this medication for MILD loss of concentration, lack of motivation and extreme lethargy. If anyone can please tell me if they have experienced any improvements with the symptoms I am experiencing i would greatly appreciate it. What also worries me is that i do take antidepressants (ssri's specifically) and am very concerned about the increase in anxiety people have experienced while on Focalin.

He interacts with other children now. He is the teachers helper this week and is involving himself in learning his alphabet and writing his name. He has not had any of the side effects. this medicine really helped him and I am very glad his dr. prescribed him this instead of something like ridalin.

This is the first med he has tried. His Dr insisted on putting him on 10 mg along with 5 mg of Abilify for his agressive behavior in school along with being defiant and socially detachment from others.  In the first three days we saw a drastic improvement, his teacher was not even aware that he was in the classroom.  She stated that he was so calm and focused, didn't blurt out in the class, did not get mad when he stated the wrong answer in class and begin beating himself in the head. At functions he began speaking to people instead of  rolling his eyes, balling up his fist telling them to get away or stay from him.  Sometimes he would just be sitting and get mad for no reason. He takes the focalin 10 mg around 6:15 am he catches the school bus around 6:25 (he eats breakfast before he takes his meds) the meds usually wear off around 4pm.  He takes the Abilify 5 mg approx. 6:00pm to control his aggressive behavior as of now they are working perfect together for him.  Yes he does experience dry mouth, a few headaches in which we give him a dose of childrens tylenol. when the focalin wears off he gets extremely hungry he has gained 3 lbs in 5 months.  He himself can tell the difference and feels better about taking the meds.  In his words &quot;Mom, I'm not tangle up and confused in the head anymore&quot;. He had an appointment last week and the Dr. increased him to 15 mg because he is playing football and with the medication wearing off at 4pm and he is not from practice or a game until around 8:30 we will see if this hurts or help.  I will keep you posted. Our next appointment is in two weeks. Meanwhile continue to pray while using and searching for the right meds.

I started with Focalin XR 5mg - my mind still wondered some, but over all it worked great.  I had a one month check up and decided to try 10mg (didn't help, I was too overfocused, couldn't concentrate, I felt angry and aggitated.  I have a new prescription to go back to 5mg, so we will see how that works.  I would highly recommend Focalin XR.

He is a GT student and in the top of his class.  I have had so many people tell me of how well behaved my son is.  I tell them they should have seen him 2 years ago.  He is like a completly different child when it comes to behavior and attention.  I have not seen this medication effect who he is.  It did not make him droppy or sad looking.  He is still a happy go lucky kid that can focus.  He is even is a Chess Club (#1 at his school) where he has to be still and quite during competions.

My 6 yr. old son started 5mg 2 days ago.  He's really warm temp. is 98-99.  He's complaining of a headache.  I gave him tylenol.  I'm going to call the pharmacist.  I pray the side effects are minimal and subside.  He was just recently diagnosed w/ HDHD, but we've been having issues w/ his behavior in various environments (Day Care, Pre-K, School, After School Care, Summer Camp etc...  We've tried different solutions and this is our 1st w/ meds.  I pray it works and doesn't cause other issues.  He's been a physcially healthy kid.

He only takes it in the morning and takes a short extended 5mg tab to get through nightly homework.  He is not hungery while on the drug and sleeps fine at night.  When the meds wear off he is starving.  The only side effect I noticed that others haven't is he chews his nails now or picks at his toe nails if socks are off, which drives my husband crazy.  He is the regular height for a 9 year old, and weighs 68 pounds.  His teachers can notice if we miss a day, since he can't even write a sentance easily.  Definately worth the money for us!

It started out great for him. He focused so well, and was successful at school and at home. He took it for about 5 months with no major issues. Then he became EXTREMELY ANGRY when the med wore off. My son turned VIOLENT and SCARY. We have stopped the med. He took 10 mg. in the am with an additional 10 in the afternoon if necessary. HORRIBLE results.

The first being ritalin the second vivanace and now focalin xr. I must say the focalin xr has been a great experience. It has fewer side effects and is more effective than the other two. I did not have a good experience with vivance. I would recommend this drug to those on the standard form of ritalin or adderall or metadate. I also noticed that the effect from the drop off of this med is better than ritalin and I sleep much better.

However, there are some side effects that are most likely due to the fact that I am on 3 of the 20mg pills. I usually experience a loss of appetite at lunch and I occasionly feel lightheaded and dizzy. I was also prescribed Clonidine with the focalin. The Clonidine is some kind of blood pressure medication that helps relax me at the end of the day so I can sleep. Overall I feel the drug has helped me.

He started with 10mg and went up to 20mg about a year ago. His teacher this year said that was to much for him and he lost his spark so we put back at 15mg. He is doing well now but can have playground issues when irritated by other kids. He is not a big eater for lunch when on it but eats well at night. No weight lost but sems very forgetful and lots of daytime wetting and some nighttime bedwetting. Seems to heave put on lots of weight this last 8 months. I can tell that it has worn off after school but don't mind i can handle that. I just want him to be able to function and concentrate in school.  He likes that he is not distruptive anymore and loves to be able to understand what is being taught. Sleeps well but only concerned about daytime wetting. I like the fact that he can go without it on weekends and in the summer if needed without side effects and I feel better knowing he can give his body a break.

I loved the way I was able to focus but noticed many of the side effects the other reviews mentioned (the main problem was crashing around lunch). I spoke with my doctor and he told me to take another at lunch. I have done this for a full week now and it has made a huge difference during the day, but I haven't slept hardly all week while taking sleep aids. I have always had a hard time sleeping but this seems to make it much worse. For someone who does not have the sleep problems, I believe this could be a great solution to thier ADD.

So doesn't seem to feel the urge to go when she needs to. Were not for sure if this a side affect of the medicine or not. This comes and goes but has been happening for a month now.

He takes Focalin XR 20mg at 6:00 am Monday-Friday. We have noticed that the medicine is wearing off around lunch time. The last few classes of the day are very difficult for him to get through. He gets sleepy and shuts down. By the time he gets home he is a total mess. Agressive, angry and very demanding. He is hungry and wants to eat everything he sees. Homework is a nightmare that is if he remembers it.NO ONE wants to be around him. It is affecting our home life and school. The medicine is very expensive $167.00 for 30 pills. Doctor recommended trying Ritalin. They have a generic form but the side effects are scarey. Does anyone have any suggestions?

He appears to be doing well at school but has always been a a/b student regardless of his lack of concentration or inability to sit still. His social skills are improving and he has some friends that come over where as before they steered clear of him. He does not drum with his fingers anymore but he is complaining of dry mouth and headaches as well as being very irritable and explosive in the evening. He still procrastinates in doing homework but will sit and read a book for an hour or two each evening. He is experiencing some difficulty in going to sleep. calling the Dr to see if we need to up his meds to 10mg instead of 5mg.

He does not eat during the day, he eats alot of food when the medicine wears off and he is always thirsty. He has not had any problems with sleep, just the behavior after the medicine wears off, dr has told me to give him a different medm but for us that is way too expensive since Foc does not have a generic. FocalinXR10 is one of the most expensive ADHD meds out there and the price has not been decreased and it looks like the company who makes it will not be lowering the price anytime soon.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	7-12 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	3	5	2	Male	7-12	9/10/2008 1:39:43 PM	My 7 year old son was on Focalin for 16 months.  We started out with the 15 mg dose, but increased it after it was wearing off before school ended.  At the 20 mg dose we were getting about 9 hrs coverage which was great and he was doing excellent in school academically, however he started to shut down socially.  My son does have an autistic spectrum disorder as well and the focalin just intensified his anxiety and withdrawn behaviors.  I was very pleased with how he was preforming academically, but felt he had become a zombie and was really my son.  Parents need to beware of this type of behavior.  We decreased back to 15 mg to see if the behaviors subsided some and there was marked improvement in his social behaviors.  We have since decided that the risk of blunted or withdrawn behaviors developing was not worth the excellent coverage we were getting and have discontinued the use of this medication.  We are currently working to find another medication that will provide the length of coverage as well as the results for focuse and attention without losing the little boy in the process.

Other	KomplikatedJetta, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	6/25/2008 7:32:04 PM	I have a major pain disorder, and I'm forced to take a bunch of opiates, like OxyContin, and Fentanyl. I asked my psychiatrist about something like Ritalin becuase of the sleepiness I experience, as well as the &quot;brain fog&quot;. It works great, I can finally concentrate on my schoolwork and not procrastanate on important things. I'm on the lowest dose, 5mg, which might need to be tweaked a bit between now and the fall semester. All I can say is that it as worked wonders and not only does it keep me awake for approxamately 8-10 hours, the focusing is dramatically better than before.

It has helped greatly with her ADHD.  My daughter has severe R.A.D (reactive attachment disorder) and severe O.D.D (oppositional defiant disorder), which is why she continues to have behavior problems at home and school...but since using the Focalin, she is now able to concentrate so she can achieve an education and focus in her daily life.  I have been very pleased with Focalin XR.  She also uses Seroquel...this is used to help with her lack of impulse control.  Due to my daughter being a foster child from 8months to 4 years old...she has a lot of behavioral issues and problems.  She came to me on many medications.  I had a new doctor re-evaluate her, and the Focalin XR combined with Seroquel have been helping her reach a better quality of life!!

( Being that I have ADD and was on Ritalin when I was in school.... hated it, by the way!) Anyway, he's only been on Focalin XR extended release 5 mgs for three days, but his teacher and I have seen a dramatic changes in his behavior, schoolwork and overall demeanor. I know that it's early, But... his sleeping has also changed. He's much better! I don't think I will keep him on it because of the risk of dependency, but at least to get him through the early school years hopefully will be good enough.Good Luck.

Thus far his school work has improved.  I question just how many parents out there research natural herbal medicinces and try them first before a chemical drug.  That would have been my choice first if I had custody of my son.  I think to many parents are just dupped by the medical profession into believing drugs are the answer to everything!

I always had problems finishing things nothing big more like oganization skills.  I never understood how other poeple stayed so focused on things.  Now I know it feels great.

My son was going to be held back in the 1st grade if he did not show any improvement fast. And this medicine is working very well he can pay attention and actually can sit still to do his work, his teacher is AMAZED! and is very proud to see him doing so good. However, coming off the medication is terrible! he gets angry, mean, and uncontrollable sometimes, I think that after the school year is over I will change the medicine to something else.

Before concerta i took ritalin but I can't take meds twice a day at my highschool. The medication does what it says i can sit still and get things done but i lack all personality and it really hinders my social life and it seems to amplify my sleeping problems. I now use Melatonin to help me fall asleep but i think i needed this before the focalin anyways. I have moved to only taking it if i know i will really need it a specific day but i try to stay off of it and control it myself which i have not been able to do until recently. I highly suggest you try to control yourself once you get to be 15-16 but until then this is a great resource. Oh it also causes some unbearable dry mouth

I think Concerta helped more with the ADHD symptoms, but considering the side effects, overall I am more satisfied with the Focalin.  My son states he likes the Focalin 20 mg the best out of all the other drugs he has tried-Straterra, Concerta 54 mg and Vyvance 10 mg.  There was often a noticeable irritable time in the evenings when the medicine was wearing off.

He was hitting, pinching, spitting, not minding, disrupting class, etc.  After several sessions with a counselor, we decided that medication was necessary.  He started on Focalin XR in December and has shown great improvement. He is on 5mg, once a day.  As for side effects, he lost one pound the first month, but gained two the second.  He has no trouble going to sleep, or any other side effects.  However, we are now into month 3 and I truly believe we need to up the dosage.  The last couple of days he has had had outbreaks of bad behavior, not at school, but at home.  He is rebellious, sassy, and sometimes mean.  The Focalin is supposed to be an 8-10 hour relief, but when it wears off, we all know it.  Sometimes, it happens after he has had the meds, but these &quot;fits&quot; usually only last about 10 minutes and then he is fine.  Has anyone else had this problem?

He is performing much better at school, making all A's.  However, there are a few side affects that we have noticed that aren't listed on the drug info sheet.  Such as, moodiness and constipation.  He eats and sleeps well, has not lost any weight so far.  However, he does have to take Miralax daily for constipation.  Hoping the moodiness wears off when he becomes adjusted to the medication.  He is currently taking 10 mg each morning.

He is doing great on it.  We decided to switch him from Strattera because of his not eating.  He is a very small 8 yr old, about 45 pounds.  Since switching to Focalin XR, I can't seem to keep enough food in the house.  Very excited about this drug not giving him the side effects that all the others had.  This med also does not seem to cause the sleepiness that the others do.  He has put on about 5 pounds since starting this med.  Hopefully it will continue to work.  Also not having the problems with aggression like the other meds seem to give him.

Started with 5mg now on 10mg.  Is doing much better, not acting up in class as much, when she gets upset , she is much easier to calm down. Is much more focused on things she is doing, She  can not swollow the pills, so we open them and sprinkle over a spoon full of chocolate pudding. At first we even had a problem getting her to take that, but I made a game out of it, I bet her she couldn't take it before I counted to 10, it was gone before i even got to 2, quick drink of water after and  we are good to go. It was causing some appitate loss, so we give it to her after she eats breakfest, works great.  Good Luck

She also takes Neurontin (Gabapentin) which helps with the anxiety side effect.  The only downside is her lack of appetite for half the day.  Then she's ravenous the rest of the day.

I noticed in 2nd grade she was struggling with paying attention and completing daily work. She is now in 4th grade and has a work ethic that I feel does not require her to take this medication any longer. So I do feel it is not a long term medication. She has not taken it in 6 weeks and is still doing well in school.

He has ADHD that seriously hampered his learning.  Before we decided to put him on this medication he was failing 1st grade and had to be put on an IEP (Individialived Evaluation Plan) where they found he had a learning disablity due to behavior and attention problems.  Now he is performing at above grade average and is no longer considered to have a learning disability.  I do not want to be a cheerleading mother for this drug, I myself wonder everyday if I am doing the right thing for my son long term.  But the short term does not lie and he could definitely not have the success he is having without the medication.  He tells me this as well.  He knows when the medicine wears off, which is about 4:30pm.  So far he is confident in his ability to control himself at school to learn, and is working on peer relations.  My son could not tolerate concerta or adderall.  They made him mean and aggressive.  So I guess as far as it goes, which is for the last 2 years, this medication works very well in treating my sons ADHD.
