The side effects are nasty, but within 3 days the incision began to heal and is doing very well.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	35-44	2/10/2011 5:25:29 PM	After breaking my leg in a car accident, surgery was performed and a metal rod screwed to the tibia to stabilize for healing.Several weeks later, a low level infection evolved of uncertain origins. Doctors agreed that it could be a reaction to one or more metals in the rod, and started Daptomycin to &quot;buy time&quot; for the leg to heal.I've been on it for about three weeks. So far, no obvious problems with the meds, although I am usually tired, but some days, not so much. I have allergies to many typical antibiotics, so I was surprised and happy when the dapto seemed to work with my system okay. I have appreciated having my pic line although once in a while, the tape around it itches, but it really hasn't been a big deal. My white cell count is &quot;under control&quot; and my bones continue to heal. Surgery to remove the metal from my leg is imminent, and then I can go back to my normal life. :)

Other	mcmuff, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	55-64	4/17/2010 9:01:43 PM	Used this after being diagnosed with MRSA and nothing else worked, even in combination. This drug actually saved my life, though I was afraid of taking it due to a family history of kidney problems. Only real side fx were no appetite and now my hair is falling out (still, 4 months later), though may be from stress of illness and not med. I had a pic line for administration. Hated that the most.

Other	Roxanne, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	55-64	10/14/2009 8:58:46 PM	Prescribed for post-op bacterial infection in right leg.  Infection cultured as ordinary skin flora and resulted in copious site drainage and an incision that would not heal.  Dapto prescribed after two I%D procedures (in attempts to promote healing and kill off bacterial infection).  Self-administered via IV infusion through midline port once daily.  Nausea and that &quot;sea sick&quot; feeling only side effect.  Incision finally healed after six weeks and after seven weeks of Dapto treatment, I transitioned to long-term oral antibiotic treatment.

Used for six weeks, became severley anemic. Almost requiring a blood transfusion. I was very nauseous &amp; could not eat lost 41 pounds in a 6 week period. I was also on a 3 week regiment of Zyvox prior to IV Daptomyicin. I was very allergic to Zyvox.

Ater getting out of the hopsial, I went to an infusion clinic daily for my dose.  I must say that the antibiotic started working right away for me.  I am allergic to most other common antibiotics, but had no reaction to this drug.

Complicated Skin Infection due to Staphyloccus Aureus Bacteria	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	9/27/2008 6:02:49 AM	This medication was given to me after a 3 week treatment on vancomycin.  I was given this as an alternative b/c the vancomycin was yielding low white blood cells.  Upon administration the medicine did not show any reaction; however, within about 6 hours I began to get a rash on my chest.  The rash spread over my entire torso area, back, and upper legs.  In some places the rash was so bad that it just appeared solid red.  My face swelled up and even the sides of my nose became blistered.  The rash is itchy and uncomfortable.  Even after 24 hours the swelling and rash are very evident, if not worse.  It feels as though I have gotten a severe sunburn.  Taking benadryl has seemed to keep the rash/swelling from getting worse, but it has not help it go away.  I am not allergic to any other medications to my knowledge and this was the first reaction I have had like this.  The medication was delivered via a picc line.
Blood Infection caused by Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteria		1	1	1			3/28/2008 3:41:34 PM	I had an allergic reaction to this medication, I couldn't trun my head, couldn't lift my head up, felt like there was acid running down my iv line, instant headache, it made my whole body hurt and I had no energy. It has only been on the market for a year and they do not know all of the side effects of the drug.The night that I stopped the drip on my iv line I honestly thought I was having a stroke because I had this large bump on the left side of my neck.
