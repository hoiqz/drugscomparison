Pain	Crissy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/11/2012 11:22:39 AM	I am taking this drug for pain associated with degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis.  When taking high doses it is effective but when I changed docs I was given a lower dose and am experiencing the pain again.  I do not recommend this for anyone with addictions, as your body probably WILL become dependent if used for an extended period of time.  Without it, I am very ill, vomiting and diarrhea and such.

I suffer from back pain caused from an abusived marriage. Suffered in alot of pain till I was gived this drug. I am on a time release pill. And it has worked great for me but this drug isn't for everyone. I can function with no drowseness or sleepyness. But I forgot to call in a refill and by the second day I was deathly ill. Never knew I could get so sick. I learned my lesson never to do that again.

Although, sometimes I seem to need more to survive. I have also suffered from migraine headaches since I was fifteen and years ago I was prescribed Zomig by a neurologist and it has helped unbelieveably.  I used to end up on the ER regularly for years to be be put on an IV with meds to get rid of the migraine.  I have not been to the ER since I went on Zomig. Before Zomig he had be try the Imitrex injections which also worked.  Morophine may help with migraine pain but Zomig stops the pain from happening.  You take it at the first sign of a migraine.  I would suggest you discuss this with your doctor.  It's better not to get the pain at all. 
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/22/2009 10:52:17 PM	I have been using morphine due to two herniated discs in my lower back.  I am in constant pain on a daily basis.  Since I have been on morphine for 2 months now, I have not been in as much pain.  However, this medication does make me extremely tired and I sometimes find myself having difficulting keeping my eyes open during the day.  I also make sure that I eat before taking this medicine, otherwise I start to feel sick to stomach and have hot flashes.  Overall, I have not had any major side effects from this medication and it is helping to manage my level of pain.
