My GYN started me on 0.5 and I put a patch on last night.  I was hoping for a miracle but I did not notice one bit of difference.  Perhaps I am too inpatient.  I will give it a couple of weeks to see if this is the patch for me.

The only negative is the weight gain - 20 lbs in the first 2 years and can not get rid of it no matter what I have tried - still better than hot flashes.

Within hours I felt amazing. I could actually see me again. Happy smiling and no hot flashes. Lost about 4lbs the first week because I really enjoy doing things again. So far best thing to happen to me in years

As my mother said somebody turned on the switch and I became alive again. For about a month I suffered with fatigue and exhaustion, loss of hair, irritability and poor memory. Everything has changed for the better. About a week ago my doctor tried to lower my does to .05 from .01 and I noticed the decrease fairly soon. I could not stay awake and had no energy. Hopefully one day my does can be lowered. I have experienced no side effect since being on this patch for about a month. I was put on patch about 6 months of having a total adominal hysterectomy but leaving my ovaires. I had cervical cancer. I never though I would be on HRT @ 38 but it has really improved the quality of my life. I feel like I'm living and not just existing.

The gyn who prescribed the patch said all of the above issues had nothing to do with the patch, my pcp says it all to do with the patch and wants me off of it, at this point, I am totally confused!

I used it for 1 yr and everything was fine.  At about 13 mths post surgery I noticed I had several very red blisters right were the outline of the patch was.  In a matter of days I was in surgery having a staph infection lanced and packed.  Very bad experience.  Got off patch/hormonne for 1 yr and felt I needed it again so I once again tried the vivelle dot.  The night I put my 3rd patch on ( Sunday) I had horrible itching,swelling and hardness in the insided of my legs and vaginal area to the point where I had a hard time walking and couldn't wear clothes. After sits baths and much pampering the swelling went down.  The 4th patch I put on which was about 8 hrs late (Friday, 4am)starting causing side effects within an hour.  I began getting enormous hives all over my body and sever itching.  I got chest pains and felt I was gonna pass out so I went to the ER.  By the time I got there my lips and tongue were also swollen. They immediately started an IV and gave me different types of medicines to stop the side effects.  They also used an epipen on me.  Within a couple of hours all the selling went down but the hives were still visible for the rest of the day. I could tell they were pretty alarmed when they would examine the insided of my mouth.  During this time I had chest pains, severe cramping like menestral cramps, heavy chest, faint feeling, and itched like if I were in a bed of ants. Very scary and horrible thing.  I forgot to say that within an hour of my itching I was suspecting the patch and so I googled it and then ripped it off.  I literally had to rip it off and my skin almost came off with it.  After I began to recover in the ER I told the doc about the Sunday night episode and realized that both time these effects began to occur within an hours of changing my Vivelle dot. And also, the staph infection the year before so I am guess I CAN NOT USE THIS PATCH EVER AGAIN..

I change the patches on Mon &amp; Thurs. It's easier to remember than every 4 days.The easiest way for me to take the patch off is in the shower. The only problem so far is the weight gain/bloated feeling..

I am on 0.025 mg. Tried natural remedies first; nothing worked for the hot flashes. Vivelle works great but have tried weaning off a number of times due to low dosage anyway and expense and length of time on it. Weaning was moving to only 1 patch a week and then 1/2 patch a week, only to have hot flashes increase steadily over several months until I must resume. I am wondering if having had a hysterectomy will not allow a weaning off. Most post menopausal women's uterus'es begin making a weaker version of estrogen which their bodies eventually adjust to but not so obviously with hysterectomy. Lastly in recent months, after applying a new patch, I have horrible hot flashes for about 36 hours and then it tapers off.  Wondering if that is due to too much estrogen with new application...not sure.

Finally consented to trying Vivelle and Promethium. LOVE IT. Wierd headaches occasionally when due for a new patch and weight is up just a touch, but I now have been on it for 3 weeks and have energy to run, lift and calmness to do my yoga. So much less irritable and without the chronic and horrific hot flashes my sleep is deep and restorative. I hope this lasts. I have osteoporosis too  now which is due to chronic low Vit D and calcium and eating a meat based diet. So now a vegetarian with flavoring of meat occasionally and think eating that way will avoid weight gain. I resisted HRT for 4 years, wish I started sooner. Now I can work without fearing those sweating episodes and fogged memory.

I had a complete hysterectomy 7 years ago and have suffered all of the side effects including unbearable hot flashes, weight gain, painful intercourse due to vaginal dryness and atrophy.  Also, loss of libido.  I have been using this in addition to Wellbutrin that my physician has prescribed and I feel so much better.  Night flashes are gone, I am sleeping better, I began an exercise program and have actually lost 18 pounds.  Desire has returned and intercourse is no longer painful.  For me this has been so much better than oral estrogen replacement.

I started out with .5 and then went to 1. I can always tell when I've missed my time to switch the patch as I get really moody and annoyed by everything but the main complaint is I've gained about 8lbs since I started taking it and diet and exercise don't seem to be taking it off. I also have back aches almost daily and my hair has thinned. I'm only 34 and I feel way older. I also have no desire for sex and I'm always exhausted. I want to get off of it and take something that would be more herbal than a HRT med because I also tested positive for the BRACA1/BRACA2 gene which indicates I have the breast cancer gene and this won't help it any. I need guidance on this. Please help!!

I started HRT patch right after my operation. It has stopped the hot flashes but I still have mood swings and I have gained alot of weight, wasn't sure if it was middle age. I am 46 years old now, but after reading others reviews for this drug, it makes me wonder if it has been this drug! I apply a patch once a week due to the expensive price. It seems to keep the hot flashes away as long as I have one on, but if I go without for more than 2 weeks. I start getting continuous hot flashes and irritability. My Dr wants me to get off of them due to the long time I have been on them due to my long term use and the health risks to me, but I feel like I still need them to control my menopausal symptoms and stay sane! I'm still trying to decide whats next for me. are there Any natural treatments that will help??

After starting the Vivelle Dot, I started to feel like my old self again.  I am much happier, &amp; little things that used to send me into retreating to my bed don't even bother me now.  I smile again!  I have positive conversations with people.  My husband has noticed a drastic change in my attitude as well.  As a matter of fact, I've even started thinking about sex again!  I would hate to think that I have been misdiagnosed for all this time with depression, when all I needed was hormone replacement therapy.  Why didn't someone listen to me sooner?

I started having severe and very frequent hot flashes 2 years ago. Dr. put me on Premarin. It did not work well and made me very nauseous. Then put me on Enjuvia, another pill. That did not work either. After researching online, I asked the Dr. to put me on Vivelle because it bypasses the digestive tract and liver and goes directly into the blood stream. What a difference! I can now function normally again. I must work full time and was afraid I would no longer be able to work because of debilitating hot flashes and fatigue. This medication has significantly improved my quality of life. I have gained weight,which many others have reported, but I feel so much better in general I will deal with the weight gain for as long as I need to take this medication.

I'm now on a compounding pharmacy's vaginal cream with testosterone and estrogen which has improved vaginal walls greatly and really boosted libido). I found my PA by calling a compounding pharmacy and asking for names. Suzanne Somers' books proved very helpful, especially The Sexy Years (despite the goofy name). The Dot is way better than oral estrogen, but a bad, almost constant back ache has me thinking this might be the cause. My advise: If you haven't tried the Dot and are having bad hot flashes and brain fogginess, try it. If you stay with it, try applying a fresh patch every 4 days. It makes sense since they say apply 2 per week. Instead of choosing Monday and Wednesday, for instance, sit down with a calendar and count 4 days per patch, write the date on the patch and leave the next one out on your dresser or by the sink.

Developed vaginal problems last year.  Diagnosed with yeast infections a couple times but when they cleared up, still had an itchy, raw vagina - not enough lubrication and creams did not help.  After working with gyn and primary care docs, went to another gyn and was prescribed V-DOT. Symptons did not seem to cease and was put on VAGIFEM a month last WITH the V-DOT. Noticed lubrication is returning but not fast enough me for me!  Keep wondering if I have to follow this routine rest of my life or will I be able to stop at some point.  I have too many medical routines as it is and I am not that old.

Endometriosis apparently. Okay, hadn't studied up on what I would be facing with a full-hysto... Needless to say I was very scared at what I would be facing. I wanted to go the &quot;natural route&quot; but no good~ Tried the estrogen pills~ HORRIBLE!! Side effects to beat the band!!! I am one of those people who &quot;don't tolerate medications well&quot;.  My system is very sensitive to ANY medications, so nothing was working and I was trying everything.  Finally, this patch (.1)~ I felt like this was my miracle! Nope it's been about a year and 1/2, and I am dizzy to the point I can't function.  It took this long for this symptom to arise, but I'm going to have to lessen the dose for sure. Weight gain hasn't been bad, and as far as my sex drive~ it hasn't existed since the surgery no matter what I have tried.  It's the surgery as far as I'm concerned, not the medications..  I don't miss the sex drive, because I'm to the point now that I don't care about it at all! &lt;-Not good for a marriage..But he TRIES to be understanding.  At any rate, It was helpful reading others' experiences, so I thought I would add my own.  Take care!

No sleep, unabel to make a decision. Mood swings, crying, irritable, hot flashes. You name it, was like PMS but 10 times worse all the time. Finally saw my GYN she said &quot;Menopause&quot;! and gived me some samples of Vivelle dot 0.1 along with Progeseron. What a life saver, I am feeling much better, but noticing my weight going up very rapidly, specially in the abdominal area. Don't want to stop the medication but if this continues I would have to reconsider other options!Is there any outhere? I feel that there is not enough research being done about this very serious health issue for women. We are left to be our own doctors facing this horrible life changing experience. And the obtions we have are just as bad, like risk of cancer, wight gain and if you read the side effects of the medication the list is very long and risky!I just turned 52 wighted 125 before the meds been taking it for 6 weeks, but now my clothes hardly fits now...GRRRR...Help!

At the same time, my mood swings were awful, I really felt out of control and was really afraid that I was going out of my mind! I would cry for no reason, I couldn't shake off little things - forget the big things. I scared myself when I really started wondering if I could go on like this. I called my gyno and she eventually prescribed Vivelle dot and promethrium (?) the first 12 days of the month. What a relief - still have the hot flashes, but only 4-5 a day and not nearly as bad as before; I feel better, my mood is more stable, I feel calmer, better able to handle things, it's amazing. I typically avoid medications of any kind, but I am glad that I tried this. For anyone out there who is experiencing symptoms of menopause like I did, I would recommend trying this. I've been taking it for 3-4 months and have had no side effects, but am aware of the dangers and will continue to be monitored while on the medications.

I've gained 30lbs since I had my surgery back in December of 2009 and I'm having a hard time loosing the weight.  I've stopped taking the patch for now and using a herbal treatment, which seems to help the hot flashes plus exercising and watching what I eat and portions.  I like the patch a lot. I just wish the weight gain wasn't one of the side effects!

I have experienced some weight gain (3-5 lbs) and some hair loss.  I do believe the dot is the cause of this but unless these two symptoms get markedly worse, i will continue on the patch.

I hate the fact that I've gained about 15 lbs. since beginning the HRT about 1-1/2 yrs. ago. I run at least 15-20 miles per week, work out on machines, and have almost completely cut out snacks. Also, I eat more veggies and fruit. I can't lose any of the weight that is mostly in my abdomen. I am embarrassed even for my husband to see my flab! Does anyone know of any other remedy for hot flashes that won't cause weight gain? I also have indigestion and am bloated most of the time.

I have been using the Vivelle Patch for over a year now since my total hysterectomy and it has been the best thing ever!!!  I call it my &quot;happy patch&quot;! Before starting the patch I was a total wreck!!  Physically and mentally!! Since starting this patch I have lost almost 20 pounds...and I don't even work out!!   Since the hysterectomy I have changed my out- look on life and my diet and now I am a junior size 9 and wearing &quot;skinny jeans&quot;...I was wearing women's sizes 16 and 18 on occasion!!  So far there are no side effects what so ever!  The only complaint is (the cost)(it's very high)  that my insurance use to pay for 3 months now they charge for 3 months and I get only 2 months supply...I am trying to find a cheaper pharmacy...the one I use is the one where I work that the insurance recommends!!!  Bad idea!!  For me I was able to get  rid of the Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil...I tried them all and nothing worked for me until I got a new OBGYN and got rid of the anti depressants and went on the DOT!!!!!  Talk to your doctor.  I even have a better more fulfilling sex life!

I started it immediately post op and have had no problems.  It is easy and effective.  I gained 10 lbs. and could have gained more but I watch my portion sizes.  Weight gain is common after this type of surgery with or without HRT. It took about six months for my libido to readjust.  Before the hysterectomy I was having urgency and frequency and these resolved after the surgery and HRT.  I highly recommend this drug.

The doctor recommended a total because my family history of ovarian cancer, I was already perimenopausal and I suffered migraine headaches along with irregular periods.  I was immediately placed on this patch after surgery and the migraine headaches stopped.  I have only experienced hot flashes 1-2 days when my doctor switched me to the EvaMist spray after I complained that the patch wasn't staying on.  I immediately stopped using the spray and switched back to the patch.  I sometimes have to replace more than twice per week because it starts falling off. Since getting back on the patch, I have not experienced hot flashes, night sweats, headaches, etc.  I sleep like a baby.  HOWEVER, I have gained a lot of weight in the mid-section and can't button any of my pants.  I have always been a runner and watched my food intake.  In the past this always kept me with a flat stomache (even after child) and I have been able to maintain my petite frame -- not so now with the patch.  I am practically starving myself to no avail.  I have also had fluid retention in legs, hands and face (to the point that I look like I've been crying), tender breasts, anxiety and breaking out around my chin area.  I will be switching back to spray tomorrow and gradually wean myself off of HRT by using natural support.

The key to minimizing side effects with this and all other medication is to take the smallest dosage that works. I use the.025 mg dosage, and do not experience any side effects. One time the dot came off without my knowing it.  I live in AZ, where anyone can think that she has a hot flash 8 months of the year!

I can not really address that issue yet, however I was waking up several times a night, laying around all day (when off), hating to exercise bec of sweating all the time.  Now, since the last wk of taking, I have so much energy, I'm sleeping 8-9 hrs with no interruption until AM, I have a lot of pepp, and have even restarted exercising at home.  It was miraculous to go grocery shopping yesterday, and return home with makeup still in place, and not having sweated at all.  I will watch the wt carefully, but I think without this I was gaining wt and too tired to even consider exercise or many other activities.  I have noticed a lot of ovary area soreness since about the 2nd or 3rd day - not sure what that is??? Will see gyn in 2 mos..Anyone else have soreness, like bruised feeling in both sides of lower abdomen?

I was furious as it was effecting my whole body, work, health mental state relationships and so on. So I decided that it was now in my hands to start being responsible for my health.  I found a book that dealt with menopause with layman details about the process and what in my test confirmed my menopausal state and to what degree, confirming my need for HRT therapy. I followed the instructions in the book made an appointment with the nurse practioner and communicated to her in medical terms that alerted her to the fact that I had seriously researched the subject. We concluded our question and answer session and I left the exam room with a script for Vivelle Patches and had immediate results.  The lesson for me was that I must research, research and get answers to the ? why I am having this problem, working together as a team with the doctor, pharmasist and any other health professional so as to make a change for a healthier me.   It is a lot of work but I am all the better for it. Since then I have had other health bouts but again back to the web and lots of research and again working with the doctors, phamcy and asking lots of ? In the end take responsibility for your decision.

I was told to wear the patch below my belly button in my lower abdomen.  I had a reaction to the glue..ie..i was constanly scratching the area and ended up with raw patches.  Dr. advised me I could put them on my backside, again below the belly button line.  I got along great, very little irritation.  After serveral months wearing it this way, I started having back pain off and on.  It finally got to the point that it was so bad, I was in tears.  My joints were stiff, it hurt to mow my lawn, ervrything just ached very deep!  Lots of fatigue also.  Talked to my Dr. at my annual checkup..told me the fatigue was due to menopause!  Blew the whole thing off.  I have been to the chiropractor, a massage therapist, taking different supplements for fatigue which have helped.  Even was thinking I had Fibromyalgia, and maybe I do.  Long story short, I moved the patch to the front region and my back pain eased alomost overnight!  I know it will take some time to get my system straightened out, but am feeling much better in just a few days.  I have talked to a my chiropractor and my fitness trainer, and they agree that this reaction is a real possiblity. I plan on talking to my GYN next visit and with my local MD.

The patch worked for me when other methods did not. I have used the .1 patch following a hysterectomy at age 42. The worst symptoms were severe mood swings, depression, as well as hot flashes. First I took premarin pills and they did nothing. My family doctor had me try zoloft for the depression &amp; anxiety and although it did help I could not function sometimes. I pleaded with my ob/gyn to help me, I was afraid I was going to lose my marriage. The patch has leveled everything out. I hope I can keep taking it for a long time!
Primary Ovarian Failure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/17/2009 2:27:04 PM	Before taking this drug, I was having crazy mood swings and hot flashes.  Now I am much more emotionally stable, have no more hot flashes or night sweats, have increased sex drive.  I do need a lower dose due to the breast tenderness I'm experiencing, but have been satisfied overall with the drug.

I had posted already, but after being off of this patch for 2 weeks: I have lost 14!!! LBS.  Have no more tearfulness. Realize I was getting yeast infections which is not normal for me.  I am no longer short of breath, my breasts no longer hurt.  I'm not getting facial hair as I was.  I could go on and on.There are other patches, in fact I used one since 1996 without a single issue.  ON the CANCER issue. I had surgery in 2005 for a RARE Sarcoma of the Vulva.  My doctor is the doc who created the Robotics Surgical Technique for ONC/GNY at UNC in NC.  He along with my primary GYN (of 25 yrs) both agree the patches are  not the threat to us as pill form estrogen- UNLESS you have a strong family history of cancer.

Used another Patch without any issues since 1996 surgery, switched to VDot last year- began experiencing night sweats, day sweats, emotional, anxious and being open and honest kept having a vaginal odor- it occurred to me to try my old patch.  All is normal once again.  I changed as the Vdot was $10.00 less, I'll pay the extra from now on. Wish you ladies well.  Use shea butter for the adhesive, better on your skin than alcohol. I also love the 1x week vs. 2x a week which I see is difficult for others as well.

I am very happy with vivelle-dot! I am losing weight with diet and exercise and feel very well overall--optimistic and evergetic. Femring lost potency for me after only five weeks (it is supposed to last 12 weeks) and premarin is horse derived estrogen and had the effect of dulling my intelligence and energy level and making my appearance less attractive in the contours of my face. I do not have any side effects that I can detect on vivelle-dot My blood pressure is normal, I am sleeping well, and I my sex drive is up. For the first time since my surgery 5 years ago, I feel more like my old self. I do have some short term memory issues, but my memory is better on vivelle than on premarin (so far as I remember)--by far. It is hard to sort out side effects of HRT from the effects of menopause. I try to be mindful of that. Since I switched to vivelle-dot, many friends and students have commented (without knowing about the change) that I look much healthier and happier. I am a happy HRT camper.

By 1 p.m. I was dizzy, everyone sounded to me like far away echoes. My legs and arms were like noodles. I felt drunk without having the booze. Headache and neckpain and red hot face. After trying to figure out what was happening to me, I remembered I'd put the patch on that morning. Called my dr. to find out if it was just a beginning flush and I would get used to it. Dr. said she'd never heard of symptoms like what I was having, to remove the patch and try again in a few days. But from what I've read online, the symptoms I had were the symptoms alot of women have using this medication. I would like to know if the effects I was having will mellow/even out or is that the way you feel on the patch?

In fact I know I will need to quit sometime soon but really do dread going back to the symptons I was having. So far so good.

I didn't realize how many hot flashes I was having and how bad they were until I started this patch and I didn't have them anymore.  It has helped with 98%.  I do forget to change it and sometimes even forget to put another one on.  I read a review on here where someone asked about heart flutter.  That's actually the reason I was looking at this site.  I do have heart flutter the first couple of days I put the patch on if I've left it off for a few days.  I was wondering if this was a side effect of the drug or just a coincidence.

Very easy to use and I remember every Thursday and Sunday is my patch change day - I change mine in the evening - I leave it in my pajama drawer and it's easy to remember.

Began with patches, and switched to HRT creams for 6 years.  Returned to vivelle dot .1 about 2 years ago. I have never really had uncomfortable symptoms, so it must be helping with that. I have experienced negative side effects, such as hair loss and memory loss.  I thought I could live with it....the last 6 months my hair has thinnned to about half of what I had previously. This has caused severe depression. Am now concerned about dementia, as this is now listed as a side effect on the enclosed materials.  My obgyn says he has patients in their 70's on the vivelle dot. My thyroid doctor is terrified for me.

Together these two medicines are slowly transforming my body, and I couldnt be happier.It has been a month on the patch and i do notice some upset stomach and a light but persistant headache.i loath to take anything for these side effects. to make a long story short, the patches are working exactly as my endocrinologist said they would.

I started the patch immediately after the surgery and have never had a hot flash. I haven't experienced the weight gain that others mention, but I'm also very active (exercise 5-6 days/week). Only issue: I sometimes forget to change the patch on the correct day. When this happens I get crazy mood swings fairly quickly. My sex-drive is almost non-existent, but I attribute that to the hysterectomy more than the patch.

I have a hard time remembering which day because of the twice a week thing.  I try to stretch it to every 4 days-then I forget what day I'm supposed to change it.  I am 52 now and I have frequent migraine headaches.  I started on 0.1mg but am down to 0.025mg hoping my headaches will get better.  I wonder after reading other reports if the weight gain I have experienced over the past few years has been due to the patch or is it just age.  I have found that baby oil takes off the adhesive but it would be nice if they gave you an adhesive remover in with the patches.

I did not gain any weight in the first 7 years but 2 years ago at age 53 I all of a sudden put on 20 lbs but have since taken off 15. I am planning to stop taking as soon as I finish this prescription because my co-pay has gone from $20 to $45. If symtoms return as severely as before I started taking it I will then start ordering it from Canada where it is cheaper than my co-pay. I would recommend the Vivelle Dot over any other hrt.

Tried all the &quot;natural remedies&quot; and none worked for me. I spend the first 3 months on various dosages until I got to 0.1 which has been working for me for the last 2 months now. The only bad side effect is weight gain, I have gained about 10 lbs in the last 3 months. I am losing weight with the help of diet supplements and have been fairly successful. As far as the adhesive ring left on the skin after removal I found that baby oil applied to the ring immediately after removal has been very effective.

It took some time to adjust it to where the heat flashes stopped but we found that plateau. However I have experienced horrendous hair loss and fluid retention. My dr and I have have gone round and round but the only new medication introduced to my system has been vivelle dot so it is the only thing it could be. I have had my thyroid checked and a full physical. This medication is making my hair come out in clumps. I complained about the fluid retention enough to get a drug called spironolactone. I am 100% serious, I lost 20 pounds of fluids! The Vivelle dot patch was causing me to retain very unhealthy amts of fluid. I love my GYN but I think I am going to go to my regular dr and discuss alternative menopause treatments, right now my GYN is talking about putting me on birth control, Yaz. I am not too comfortable with that being that I have no ovaries and no uterus and am not comfortable with they symptoms birth control pills cause. I just wanted to share my experience with this drug. Hairloss and serious fluid retention and a few break thru flashes.

I also noticed if I forget to change my patch for a week or so, I get depressed. As for weight gain, I'm not sure if this patch caused it or is a result of having no ovaries. Since 1999, I gained 40 pounds-been on Vivelle since 2003, also would advise to check Vitamin D level.

My doctor put me on it because my estrogen was very low and I hadn't started my period.  Now, I know exactly when I will start and it has worked perfectly since I started using it.

Primary Ovarian Failure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	12/29/2008 9:30:56 PM	Started using Vitelle Patch .1mg about a month ago. I am 42 y/o that was diagnosed with premature ovarian failure.  I struggled w/severe hotflashes day and night and no sleep for 2 years.  Tried all kinds of herbal remedies etc as I was trying to get pregnant.  So far the dot has pretty much eliminated hot flashes, and I am sleeping much better.  Still wake up about once per night to use restroom, and sometimes due to hot flashes.  My complaint is that I have developed some pretty bad acne on my chin region, and feel like I am still gaining weight - which has been happening for the past couple years when first diagnosed w/premature ovarian failure. Read that the drug activelle a combo of estrogen and progestin does not cause acne and may consider trying this because I still have a uterus and have to take progesterone 10 days per month while on the patch.  Has anyone else used activelle? thanks

The patch was very successful in relieving those symptoms, but within 6 mos of using the patch I developed a cyst in my breast-the cyst was removed &amp; dx benign, but my surgeon recommended to not restart use of the patch.

I didn't have any problem other than the weight gain!! I couldn't handle that so I did some research and found something called BLACK COHOSH. It's a natural whole herb that promotes Menopausal health,you can find it at the drug store or at wal-mart with the vitamin and herbs. I take one capsule every night, after about 3 or 4 days I stopped having the hot flashes at night and I don't have the mood swings.  I also take ST.JOHNS WORT twice a day for mood enhancement. So for any of you ladies who are wanting to stop using your patches you may want to try these 2 items....oh yea... no vaginal dryness either, My husband loves that!

Due to my age I take a combination of the a pill and the Vivelle-Dot. With this replacement I do find that I have an increased appetite.  I must remain on appetite suppressants.  I came off of them recently and gained eight pounds in two weeks.  I have also experienced the lowest drop in sexual drive since being on this medication.

I exercise minimum of 5 days a week.  I ride my bike about 50 miles a week.  I stay on a weight-watcher's diet plan and still can't lose the 10 pounds I want.  I am not overweight, but want to keep my weight down due to a family history of diabetes, stroke, cholesterol problems, high blood pressure and heart disease.  Is there another patch that won't cause this weight gain?
Primary Ovarian Failure	slowly shrinking, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	10/7/2008 12:58:51 PM	Due to loosing 1 1/2 inches of hight, my OB/GYN put me on VD to prevent me from loosing any more bone mass. I am only 44 years old and have had a full hysterectomy 6 years ago. It was after this I have lost my height. I have been on Vd now for about 2 months and I can tell about the weight gain and bloated stomach. Since starting this med, I am always hungry where I was not before. I get lightheaded and dizzy with it. Is there something else that would help without all of these side affects? Slowly shrinking...

It controlled my hot flashes, but I had weight gain and could not lose it. I just recently discontinued use of the dot after using it for a year. After (5) days I have lost a few pounds w/o even trying.  I now use estroven to control the hot flashes which works well.

I was put on it immediately after surgery so I really didn't have much chance to have any menopausal symptoms. At first they had me on a 1.0 patch which made my eyeballs bulge or swell. It was too much &amp; so I had them lower the dose.      I have really not had any bad side effects except maybe headaches (which are hard to say if its because of the estrogen or not).I have had however for the last two years trouble with high triglyceride levels and so I have asked them to lower me to the lowest Vivelle Dot Patch of .03 dosage and we'll see if that will help.      I have tried a couple of times during the nine years to wean myself off of the patch but I end up continuing because of discomfort &amp; edgyness. I have talked to my gynocologist &amp; brought articles to her at my yearly check-ups about my concerns with the negative effects from estrogen but she seems to feel that I should continue with using them. Apparently she sees no harm in the long term therapy.      I have annual mamograms, have been on high blood pressure medication since age 39, &amp; have had no obvious side effects other than the high triglycerides (and I don't know if that is due to taking the estrogen or other factors). It has been a few years since I have had my heart checked out but I have had it checked twice in the nine years since I was put on estrogen. Everything checked out fine when those tests were done.      With so much variations on opinion about Estrogen therapy within the medical community it is really hard to make a decision that we can feel comfortable with. All I can add is the experience I have been through &amp; if it helps someone then it was worth the time to share information.

On the Dot my menopausal symptoms have reappeared after 10 years. I was on the same-strength (.075) Vivelle regular (big) patch after going through menopause. I used that bigger patch for 10 years. It was great. I rarely had hot flashes and never had any of the other horrible menopausal effects I had before hormone replacement. My health and energy on that patch was very good. I am now 57. The manufacturer has discontinued the regular Vivelle patch and now offers only the Dot. I feel I get no estrogen at all on the Dot. I have heard other women say the same thing. I will have to find another brand of big patch.

Started taking 5 mg of Ambien to help me sleep. Now 2 1/2 years later my night sweats have subsided dramatically, hot flashes have changed to warm flushes with less frequency and decreased Ambien to 2.5 mg. Went to new doctor that said I have been through the worst but using a low dosage estrogen patch may still help. I've used it for three weeks and I've started having night sweats again with more warm flushes and I'm not sleeping even using the Ambien. Plus the first week I have severe itching on my abdomen. What's going on?

I have mild hot flashes off and on but nothing that can't be managed very easily. The patch is very easy to use. At first I was afraid that it would come off but after 7 months I no longer put a bandaid over it cause it stays put. The only thing is that it stays on so well that you have a ring around where it was once you take it off.
