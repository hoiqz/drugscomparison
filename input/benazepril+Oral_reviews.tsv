High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	2/25/2012 9:51:29 PM	20 mg x 1 daily with water pill. After taking for one month, I have noticed the following side effects that I HOPE will get better in time. Hair Loss (it was not my imagination after all),nausea,vomited twice,moderate to severe lightheadness,GAS(sometimes painful).I have learned taking this med with food helps the nausea, and I will switch to taking at night to see if the stomach problems will be less severe. I know I need to take this med, but I am not too happy with the side effects!
High Blood Pressure	Queenkitty, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	1/17/2012 2:13:17 PM	I have Sjogrens Disease which causes dry mouth and throat. My dr should never have prescribed this drug. I have been coughing continually, sometimes to the point of vomiting, and been blaming it on Sjogrens. I have been unusually fatigued, nauseous and miserable for 4 mos, and see now that it is Benazepril that is the problem. I stopped taking it today. I see my dr in 2 days and intend to chew him out thoroughly. THIS IS A BAD MEDICATION

I have been to my doctor's twice for treatment which included 60mg of predisone, simbacort and a nebulizer.  I finally go to my throat doctor and he discovers it's the Benazepril all along!  I suffered for three month's with this cough and it was so bad, I had headaches,upset stomach and just plain tired.  TAKE THIS MEDICINE OFF THE  MARKET NOW!!!!!!!

This medication has worked better than the Diovan and I was shocked! I had severe edema in my legs and with this med it is almost gone. I do not know how much weight I have lost in my legs but its significant. I am always going to the bathroom but to lose the water weight makes me feel better. I am quite happy with the results.

I was a basket case after about 2 weeks and called the Dr. to change medications. After all the problems that I had with this med my BP never came down. Read these reviews and see how many other people had bad reactions to this drug, you will be amazed! I am now on Metopolol tartrate and waiting to see the effectiveness of it. Generics are cheaper not only in money but ingredients as well, because Insurance Co won't pay for the better drugs, that have better results and less side effects. Words from my Doctor himself ! He called them high end drugs and my insurace co would not pay for them.

After 6 days of taking this, I ended up at ER with monitors, x-rays, blood tests, EKG, etc.  Drs. said &quot;everything fine&quot;  Frightening.  I cut dosage down to 10mgs. Still having irregular hard beats, dry cough, runny nose and being tired.  I Take no other meds at all.  This is not working for me after taking it regularly for 23 days.  I take it at night, and it is very hard to sleep since apparently, it makes my heart beat so irregular.  Will ask Dr. to change medication.  The worry I go through is far worse than having high B/P.  It is good that it helps some people.  Just because it doesn't seem to work for me in the short-term, doesnt mean that it won't help others. I guess we all have a different chemistry...I know a person should not just stop taking a medication without consulting a Dr., but I will be discontinuing taking this as of today...

I've been on it now for 4 weeks, and BP is averaging 140/95.  Maybe it needs more time to work for me?  My side effects have been blurred vision (for 8 hours after taking it), drowsiness (same period), decrease in energy level, but all-in-all, nothing too serious or unbearable.  CAUTION: DO NOT DRINK EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL AND THEN TAKE YOUR PILL AN HOUR LATER! - after doing this, I had no energy whatsoever to get out of bed (took the pill at 11PM, couldn't get up until noon the next day - all I had was a whiskey glass full of red wine).

After a while the side effects seemed to settle down.  The dosage crept up over the years and HCTZ dropped.  Been on 40mg almost 2 years.  All during the time on benazepril, I've had a persistant cough I attributed to post nasal drip/allergies...bronchitis 2x past winter.  I've had swollen ankles for over two months, nausea/GERD that requires Prevacid for over 1 year, swollen eyelids for few weeks until one swelled shut.  Dr wants me to take Diovan (can't take calcium channel or BETA blockers for the severe side effects).  I think I will try the exercise and life style changes and monitor bp before I start the new meds.

I asked my internist as well as looked up the contraindications to benazepril and it did not state acne. I am an Clinical Esthetician and deal with acne all day long. I tried everything (accept accutane) and nothing worked. It became so severe I stopped the medication. Within 5 days the acne stopped and the (acne) rash healed. Needless to say my blood pressure is stable also!

My blood pressure is still high. I have experienced sinus pain, muscle twitching, joint and back pain, and dry cough and fast heart rate. The doctor said the pills were NOT causing the problem so I have gone thru countless test to find the problem. I just run out of these pills over the weekend and couldn't get a new prescription for them until Monday. Guess what? sinuses have cleared up and muscles stopped twitching and heart rate has slowed down. Going the tell Doctor the news!

High Blood Pressure	slidewinder, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/26/2008 2:43:56 AM	My pressure this morning was 160/114.  This is consistant with the last month or so.  I took my first pill at about noon.  I checked my pressure at 11:30pm and it is at 105/82.  This is a little scary as I did not expect results this dramatic this quickly.  Is this at all normal?

I believe this may be causing me to cough regularly, but not sure if this can be the reason.  Might be my cat :(  Other than that, I don't think I've had any side effects.

If I want to know something, I'd better find out for myself. Do not have boutique insurance. Doctor inaccessible, nurse practitioner has an attitude and I'm stuck with this duo.  Turnover in nurses.  Current nurse must have been the only one to agree to the pay scale!  Doctor is packing and stacking patients.  Runs the through in five to seven minutes after a two-hour wait.  Just PAY before you leave whether you're happy or not with the sevice you got.
