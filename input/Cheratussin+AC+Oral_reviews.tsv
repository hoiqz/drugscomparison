Cough	mandina, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	5/20/2012 1:48:40 PM	Not the best tasting medicine, but it has helped me.  I'm taking it due to cough and sore throat associated with sinisitis.  I've had more productive coughs and my throat no longer hurts.  Unlike many others, it hasn't made me drowsy and only upsets my stomach if it's empty.

I waited until about 10 at night because I wasn't sure how long it would take for the drowsiness to kick in, and I have children I wanted to be asleep first.  After about 10:30 I was out and slept all night, no coughing!  I woke up feeling great!

Cough	Johnson, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	6/8/2011 1:58:25 PM	After having a serious cough, swelling of throat for over two weeks I was prescribed this along with an antibiotic.  This medicine doesn't work.  I felt that nyquil was more effective.  I don't understand why doctors prescribe codeine.  I thought it was just me, but i've found that many other people find that it is ineffective. Silly doctors, codeine is for kids... Now, time to call the doctor and get the leery eye because i'm asking for a &quot;stronger medicine&quot;.  Here's an idea, don't prescribe crappy medicine when someone says they've been sick for two weeks. Better yet, deregulate all drugs and let people make their own decision as to what they can consume. Pretty soon, they'll be prescribing asprin for a broken arm.  Hey, maybe if your lucky they bump you up to motrin, but that'll require the leery eye from your doctor. That's right, get back in your assigned work area johnson, and get back to work cause your not free...
Cough	Carol W, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	4/27/2011 3:44:41 PM	My prescription called for taking 1 tsp at night and would cause severe drowsiness...I was wide awake and while it did calm the cough for a few hours I would get up with fits of coughing. I would not recommend this product...I actually found Robitussin DM to work as well if not better when I took this every 4 hrs.  
Other	mdads86, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	4/27/2011 1:22:20 AM	Was prescribed for a cough, but did absolutely nothing for me.  Hours after taking, I called the doc back and asked for something different so I could finally get some rest.  Worthless cough syrup; tastes horrible too.

Doctor prescribed this medicine to help ease the cough and get some rest. I took the 1 tsp as the doctor prescribed. Having been up since 3 am, I was hoping to get some rest. I wasnt the least bit sleepy. I was wide awake coughing again and have been up since 3 am. :(

I was congested and my nose was pouring mucous. This medication dried my sinuses up and stopped me from coughing at night. I really was glad my doc prescribed this for me.
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	2/24/2011 12:33:53 AM	This makes me cough more frequently and much harder.  It also does NOT help me sleep at all. Probably because I am up all night coughing still.  
Cough	Anon97, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	2/20/2011 1:49:18 AM	Prescribed this drug for cough associated with bronchitis and possible atypical pneumonia.  Does very little to ease the cough and does not even make me tired.  Easily one of the single worst prescription drugs I have ever been on, in terms of its complete uselessness.
Cough	DeborahInAl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/7/2011 2:04:23 AM	2 tsp. was prescribe but I only take 1 tsp. every 4 hrs. in case it comes back sooner. Which it hasn't during the last 24 hrs. The dropper I have make it very easy to swallow. It just doesn't help me sleep as much as I had hoped. I'm exhausted.

This medication had to be the worse tasting medicine ever. It didn't at all ease the coughing. I had to take it at night. I'd wake up every 1 1/2 feeling so weird and hot. I didn't like it at all.

Other	Charlie Eppes, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	35-44	9/19/2010 12:37:12 AM	I was just prescribed this medication last night.  What you all (the reviewers) have to realize, is that medications don't work the same for everyone, so everyone will have a different experience with it.  Now, while I have just started taking it last night for Pneumonia, I have noticed that it has eased my coughing and I am bringing up more phlegm.  I also get tired, but not really enough for a good night's sleep.  I did get a good nap in today though.  I agree about the taste though.  It tastes AWFUL!  I mix it with strawberry or chocolate milk.  That seems to work for me.  I still taste the medicine, but it's not so bad.  I am itching in the genital area though, so I have started Monistat, but that is to be expected.  We should all EXPECT to have SOME kind of SIDE EFFECT.  It's normal.  So while it may not work for some of you, it doesn't mean that it won't work for no one!
Cough	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	45-54	8/3/2010 10:25:17 AM	this medicine tastes like motor oil. somewhat helps cough though not as well as hydrocodone-homatropine and hydricodone taste much better.

Cough	sleepless at 230am, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	5/4/2010 5:29:44 AM	15 min. after taking the prescribed dosage I got severe abdominal pain (heartburn worse than I've EVER experienced) and vomiting.  It did stop the cough for the 3 hours I had the severe pain, it wasn't worth it, I would much rather suffer through the coughing than have that kind of pain again.  I am calling the doctor in the morning to see about getting something different, this Rx tasted horrible to boot!
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/4/2010 4:36:57 AM	This medicine was given to me for a cold virus to stop the coughing.  Doesn't work at all for me!  The taste is just disgusting and I am still coughing up a storm so much that I puke!  I even had them add codeine to it to help me sleep, but that doesn't even put me to sleep!  Now I am going on week 2 almost 3 of this cold virus and I feel even worse than before...still hacking away and sore throat now on top of this cold virus!

It helps me sleep at night by stopping my cough. During the day I still cough but not as hard. Some cough is good to help get phlem out. The taste doesn't even bother me. Not all meds can taste good. I suffer with chronic broncitis and asthma.

Cough	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	1/7/2010 6:41:01 PM	It works great for controlling the cough without too much sleepiness/dizziness, but I had to rate it as 'somewhat difficult' to use because the taste is so almighty FOUL. After a few incidents where the bad taste made me gag I finally hit on using a cepacol oral anesthetic lozenge before taking the syrup - cuts some of the bad taste.

My cough keeps me awake and disturbs my co-workers. 24 hours after taking this I began coughing up mucus and discharging mucus from sinuses. While it is gross, nothing else helps the phlem come out.
Cough	betternow, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	45-54	9/6/2009 4:19:24 PM	Because of the taste of the medicine it is a lot more difficult to take it knowing the the taste will last in your mouth for some time. other than that the medicine works pretty good.

I've had tuxxinex (sp?) b4 with broncitis &amp; that didn't do this crap! Even the grapey tasting syrup doesn't do it either. While I've found grape syrup not as great on cough but the thick fruity tasting tuxxinex is good (just abit stronger when I took 1st time (I was cocky about it, thought it couldn't be that strong)..umm wrong!! Kicked my butt! It did wrk though! Has any1 else had such a pain stomach or back when u took this Chertussin AC?? If so please post...thanks.
Cough	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	25-34	6/3/2009 12:32:51 PM	Absolutely Useless!!!  I might as well drink a glass of water and hit myself in the throat, then try to sleep.  Makes the cough more frequent, more intense, and NOT even drowsy after dose.  I am writing this 4 hours after I took it, I just got out of bed with no sleep but a worse sore throat than I had 5 hours ago.  Terrible Med.

Then start taking it again. Otherwise it seems to work pretty well. I am also taking Z-pack for my bronchitus, not sure if this is spelled right.

Cough	kel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	3/6/2009 3:45:40 PM	works pretty well and is available over the counter at your local pharmacy(although you must sign for it). Since there is no prescription needed to obtain this medicine, I found that it was a much cheaper way to kick that cough. Hope this helps!
Cold Symptoms	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/5/2009 1:21:52 AM	Reading the other reviews I really think it may depend on your personal symptoms ect. I had immediate relief from taking this after barely sleeping for a week due to a severe cold. By the second dose I was no longer hearing the gurgling when I breathed and when I layed down to sleep, for the first time in about 5 days I was able to lay flat. The only problem I have had is that I get migraines and Codine can cause migraines so I have had a pretty good headache any time I let it go past the 4 hour mark. For the relief, the headache is worth it.
Cough	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	3/1/2009 11:22:38 PM	It's a lot better than anything over-the-counter for as far as cough meds go.  It doesn't totally take away the cough but it certainly helps me sleep the night through when I get a cold...which is frequent because I'm a teacher and catch everything the kids have.  The only problem is that I end up having to &quot;swig&quot; it for it to work.  Which turns out to be about 2 times the recommended doseage.  I wake up well rested and feel fine.  It's no miracle cure but it's a good thing to have around the house when a cold pops up.

I immediately had terrible sweats and my face was flushed within 15 minutes of taking it. I coughed more and woke up quite a bit during the night. Benzonatate was much better and I wasn't so bloody droggy. 
Cough	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/22/2009 9:43:18 PM	This medication works wonders compared to over the counter drugs.

Cough	65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Male	65-74	1/28/2009 12:35:27 AM	Actually, my dear hard headed wife is taking it. I am not at all impressed with her Pulmonologist. I went with her to the first and second appointments and told him that she coughs most of the night and seems to sleep through most of it. I can not sleep at all when she is coughing, and would like for her to have a stronger medication at least for a few nights. BTW I am a pharmacist. When I told him that I could not sleep for her coughing, his snide remark was, &quot;Well go sleep in another room!&quot; That does not get to the cause of this unusual, unnecessary cough. She has had scans and the gament. He said that he MEANT that she was to use NOTHING with a scent. He gave her a long list including Clorox, deodorant, cremes, lotions, soaps, even cooking foods. I am destitute, mainly becaujse I am afraid that there is an under lying cause that will continue to do more harm. Her DEAR ENT wants her to see another specialist, Get this, &quot;She does not want to hurt the drs feelings!&quot; I LOVE her dearly and cannot imagine my life without her, especially after 38 years, three precious children, and two preciouis grandchildren. Her DEAR ENT did give her a new RX for Rutuss, but she is afraid to take more than a few doses of such a strong med. I TRY to tell her that just a few nights would get that ole cough center quieted down and she may not need any more. It is 12:30 AM now. She is in the bed asleep coughing, I am here almost in tears considering what may be the real problem. PLEASE pray for her and me.

Cough	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	11/6/2008 11:44:33 AM	Having Asthmatic Bronchitis, my doctor Rx'd this because I could not sleep due to coughing.I took my first dose and went to bed very early expecting to finally have a good night's sleep. It made my cough WORSE! I coughed violently all night and was extremely sore from coughing. Everytime I coughed, it was painful through my ribcage.

Cough	Cough cough, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/7/2008 5:56:53 PM	I had a cough that remained one month after my initial cold. I would cough everytime I laughed or talked a lot. When I finally went to the doctor, he said I had some congestion. I didn't realize this because my nose was not runny or sneezing. This medication started working from day 1, that was 4 days ago. I was taking it a few hours before I went to sleep. I barely cough now and can sleep better.
Cough	MB, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	7/5/2008 10:43:30 AM	I had a dry tickle that set off a mostly unproductive coughing fit after (I thought) I was done with a cold and an intermittent sore throat. I couldn't lay flat on my back or I'd hear a gurgle in my chest. The only position that gave me any relief was sitting up and leaning forward. I got some sleep by dragging a folding chair over to an ironing board with a pillow on it and putting my head down.I was prescribed Levaquin (antibiotic), Cheratussin AC syrup (codeine and Guaifenesin), Proair inhailer and told to get a chest x-ray. I assume it isn't pneumonia since I didn't get a call back after 3 days.Of all of the presciptions, the Cheratussin was the workhorse on the symptoms. When they say take it with liquids they aren't kidding. It will seem that the cough is worse but it makes it VERY productive in a matter of minutes so have the kleenex handy. The more crap you get rid of the better. If it makes you feel queazy I found that having some saltine crackers helped dramatically.

However, I do sleep fairly well at night when I take it right before bed.

Cough	melissa1234, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/11/2008 6:52:53 PM	I've read all the comments about the taste, and it's not that bad. I've certainly had worse. I'd says DayQuil or Nyquil is worse. As far as the reactions of making people vomit, abdominal pain, etc. Those symptoms are different for everyone, and may have just been an allergic reaction. So far it's worked better than others. 
Cold Symptoms	Brenda, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	3/25/2008 1:12:29 AM	While this medicine stopped my cough and urge to cough soon after taking, it only lasted 4 hours so I had to get up in the middle of the night to take again. Still, four hours of sleep at a time is better than what I had been getting, so I'll take it. But it is pretty amazing that the label says to take it every 4-6 hours as needed and it lasts exactly 4 hours for me. Tastes bad; have a cracker ready to eat!

Cough	SIck as a dog, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/16/2008 5:58:16 PM	I took the dose prescribed to me and within a half an hour I was violently ill... my cough had actually worsened and I started to vomit. I did not sleep a wink!!! Tossed and turned ALLLLL night. The next day I felt worse than before I took it. I thought it looked too watery for a cough &quot;syrup&quot; so I called my Dr to make sure the pharmacy gave me the correct medication. They said they did...? Tastes horrible and I will NEVER use again. What a waste of $!!!!
Cough	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	1/5/2008 8:20:37 PM	I have not had good luck with this drug.
