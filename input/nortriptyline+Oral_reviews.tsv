I still get headaches but not as frequently or severly.  It has side effects that I actually really loved.  I slept MUCH better on it and I found myself to be far less neurotic.  My dr. told me to take it at night, but I found that it made me wired.  I take it in the morning and it doesn't make me sleepy  but at night when I go to sleep I fall right to sleep (not normal for me, but very welcome).  Only side effect that I did not like was the increased heart rate.  I work out a lot and it sometimes scared me.  I am used to it now however.

It was prescribed for my chronic back pain and I was taking 20 mg a night. It has done nothing to help the pain but I continued. Dr. increased it to 30mg 30 days ago and again, no pain relief. But I have become a screaming banshee who cries over TV commercials. I also have gained about 40 pounds. I've been beating myself up over that until I read this blog and see that it's a common side effect.  Needless to say, I am telling my doctor &quot;No more&quot; and will wean myself off this medication. There is no upside for me, just major downsides.

Neuropathic Pain	--,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female		5/14/2012 8:26:37 PM	I have been taking nortriptyline for over 15 yrs. for nerve pain.  It has helped somewhat along with neurontin.  Although the medication has only helped me a little, It did take away my daily headaches and that was a pleasure.  I have had dry mouth, weight gain and a couple of other side effects.  Not mentioned in the medication info is that you have to make sure that the pill is swallowed well.  Right now I swalloedd the capsule and it did not go all the way down.  The capsule opened up in my upper esophagus and I got a tremedous amount of burning accompanied by some difficulty swallowing my own saliva and vomiting. The pill has opened in my esophagus in the past and I could taste the horrible medication in my mouth, but some milk and mouth rinse would alleviate the symptoms. My throat feels like it is swollen.  My breathing is Ok though. Has anyone else had this experience? It's a scary thing.

The side effects were horrible. I had hallucinations about a week after starting to use it. I also started to have a hard time getting back to a normal sleeping schedule while using it. My anxiety was higher than normal. And I'm very sorry to say that after 2-3 weeks I started having suicidal thought, had a seizure, and then had to be rushed to the hospital in intensive care for 3 days.The medication did help with the pain, but the side effects were far too much for my body to handle. It also didn't help that I didn't have an attentive doctor. I certainly don't think everyone will react this badly from the medication, but I highly advise that you have a doctor that doesn't underplay the possible side effects if you choose to use it. If you are using it and start to have odd side effects after a week please report them immediately and don't think they'll get better (for me they just got worse). And if you're doctor thinks you're overreacting, seek a second opinion or go to the hospital. I wish I was never given this drug, it nearly killed me.

My hands and arms would hurt so badly that I could barely function.  I've been taking this medicine for about a month now and I'm virtually pain free.  I have no side effects except for a little dry mouth (which may be from allergy meds).  Sometimes I have a little anxiety but I was anxious before I took the medicine.  Also, I've lost weight.  I highly recommend it.  I'm not the type of person who wants to take medication but I did need pain relief to be able to function.  The side effects were minimal and worth it.

I had daily migraines along wtih motion sickness and dizziness. Debilitating! Could not do ordinary daily tasks or work a job. Even had to stop driving.  Also have an autoimmune disorder that includes joint and muscle pain so that I could not rest at night.  It was decided that I would try the nortriptyline to resolve both chronic pain issues.  With each day, month, year my migraines got better and better until I was migraine free by the 2nd year I was on this medication. Rarely do I have a migraine let alone a headache now. I believe that it has also helped my other chronic pains as well. I may have gained some weight and have chronic constipation as side effects of this medication, but it is well worth it!

After surgery I improved somewhat but the migraines continued.  My neurologist tried several different drugs .. several different combinations but the only one that has worked so far is 40mg of Propranolol(20 mg am / 20 mg pm) and 10-20 mg of Nortiptyline (taken about two hours before bed).  I do have strange dreams from time to time and I do have some crying jags once and awhile but for the most part it's been fantastic!  I've been taking it for about seven weeks now and have only had two horrible migraines (down from usually two - three a week!).  I haven't experienced any of the other side effects that have been mentioned here.  I'm really hoping that it continues to work as I haven't been this &quot;comfortable&quot; in a long, long time. Best of luck to those suffering.

I now require 10-12 hours of sleep.  I can fall asleep at any time.  I have no motivation to do anything fun or entertaining.  The first week, I was severely depressed.  The second week, my need for sleep went from 10-12 hours to 8-10 hours.  It slightly increases anxiety.  It does not improve concentration.  No one has mentioned that it increased depression and anxiety while decreased motivation and never touched concentration, so I thought I was going crazy or maybe just having a rough personal life.  This is week 3 now, and I still have yet to see this medication benefit my life.  I also find it strange that people take it for neuropathic pain, because I have had one hell of an eye ache since I've started.  There is a warm sensation... which is a benign side effect.  The only other side effect I have experienced is nightmares and vivid dreams.  The worst side effect has been the depression, and the most annoying has been the increased need for sleep.  I may have gained some weight from an increase in desire for sweets.  For some, this would be a deal-breaker, but if I can sit down and do something productive for once, it would all be worth it.  My form of ADHD is not untreatable... other medications with high side effect profiles have worked.  I have yet to try Selegiline, and recent studies are looking positive for the treatment for Adult ADHD.  I will move on from this drug once the pills run out and still have found no obvious benefit.  I have yet to find someone with only ADHD-PI benefit from this drug.  I honestly don't see how it would benefit those suffering from depression, I have had quite a miserable experience so far, especially that first week.

Neuropathic Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	2	5	Male	35-44	5/15/2011 5:42:20 PM	Chronic migraines, chronic pain, and depression. After reading others symptoms, I was apprehensive about taking this drug. I was unable to work or do much of anything between the constant pain and provoking migraines so severe they would require hospitalization only after I had vomited everything possible to allow travel. i could often not slow or stop them with the best migraine meds, and they would continue for days or even weeks right prior to starting nortriptyline. The side affects can be intense at first. I was started at 40mg 1 hour before bed. Each week I increased 20 or 25mg til i was at 100mg. My miraines were gone (now only minor headaches controlled with a couple advil) and i was back at work 4-6 hours a day. However, the side effects were unbearable, I thought I would have to stop. I didnt even know who I was or what I was doing, thoughts raced, I had to hang on to things often until my balance was stable, my stomach was beyond constipation, mouth was so dry i had to keep water and gum close day and night, and it took all of my focus to drive or try to communicate with anyone. I truly felt like I was losing my mind at this dose. My dose dropped to 75mg and within a few days everything came back into focus. Every symptom lessened to an acceptable level and I was still working most of the time and free of migraines. The only problem now was I had severe depression from the injury i had been trying to recover from for over four years. So under doctors care I slowly incresed dose 25mg. to where I am now at 150mg. (This medicine treats depression at 100mg and higher dose) With each increase side effects worsen temporarely but managabley, and you can always decrease dose until you can manage. Work with your Dr. You will probably also need to see a physcologist to help you stay grounded if you are prescribed higher doses.

Seems to lessen the pain in the bottom of my feet but do not like the feeling from taking the drug.

The first pill last night went ok, however 30 to 40 minutes after my 50 mg pill this evening, I am experiencing severe stomach burning.  I was prescribed this medication for an oversensitive esophagus but this burning is scaring me.  I plan to phone the doctor in the morning.
Other	??, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female		5/2/2011 2:55:02 PM	I  took it I think because the doctor (gastroenterologist) thought it would help with nausea and bowel problem over four years, where i lost quite a lot of weight.  It seems to help this condition (nausea went away)but leaves me with a terrible feeling in the morning (anxious, hand shaking so i can't write, and dry mouth.(Dry mouth can be accounted for by other medications i think in my case.

Other	MyEarsRing, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	55-64	4/8/2011 9:51:52 PM	Was taking 10mg once a day to treat tinnitus, ringing in the ears. I couldn't tell any difference for sure, it was subtle, but the drug made my throat way down my neck sore inside. I stopped taking it, sore throat went away. I started it up again, sore throat came back. Sore throat is what I'd call moderate, but was pretty uncomfortable. Doctor said to quit taking the med due to the sore throat, that the sore throat could indicate something (very complex) and that I should stop taking the med. After I stopped taking it a few days later the tinnitus got noticeably worse. At this point I realized the drug had worked some and had made the symptoms less severe, but it was no cure. Sore throat was slower to go away the 2nd time coming off the drug. Sore throat is not a normal one caused by a virus etc., it's deep down in my throat. Also felt irritable and tired after coming off the drug which is somewhat odd considering the extremely small dosage of 10mg. Perhaps it was just my annoyance at it not working better for me.

Next two nights, I fall asleep, but wake up with panic attacks and then can't sleep.  I did feel better physically, but I will be stopping medication because its not worth the nervous, anxious feelings I am experiencing.
Depression	Jenna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/30/2011 11:15:34 AM	I started out on 25mg had some spacey moments at first but that went away.  Moved up to 50mg after about a week.  I loved this medicine it made me feel happy, calm, no sexual side effects.  But of course just my luck it broke my face out in a horrible rash that steadily got worse, so now I have to come off it.  I'm VERY disappointed! I was holding out hope that the rash would go away, but it didn't.

Other	grumples5, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	2/11/2011 9:16:44 PM	For over 15 years, I suffered severe head pain with my monthly period.  In just the last two years, I developed an auroa prior to the start of my period.  I would smell a constant sooty smell.  It was to the point I was having severe panic attacks.  I was put on 25mg and did help a little, but was put to 50mg and worked great!  However, I am now suffering from numbness and tingling and soreness in my toes.  This feeling is to the point I can't sleep.  Just today, they lowered my dosage back to the 25mg.  I was just wondering if anyone else experience this side effect.  I am worried that the strong smell will return.
Other	Nita, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	2/11/2011 2:10:20 AM	I was originally prescribed this drug after my mother died and I didn't want to break out crying at work and home (upset others).Dr put me up to 50mg and was going to raise me gradually to 500mg and I said no. I can't believe I'm actually taking a higher dose than others who have severe pain. I didn't think I had side effects (except some sleepiness)so I just stayed on it until I ran out recently and no Dr. I thought it was time anyway. Then for the last 11 days I've had bad head pain, neck pain, lower back and the worst was constant nausea. It wouldn't let up. Went to Urgent Care and they think it's withdrawal and could take longer. I never had headaches and nausea before. And I've gained over 80 lbs, now I know the big reason why. I have fibromyalgia but Ultram and Naproxen help me with that. And they help if I have foot pain from diabetes. If I need to go on it later in life, I will at a lower dose if possible. I am sorry so many have bad problems; keep looking for other alternatives if it doesn't work for you. It depends on the doctors you get too. I'm glad I had a good one for fibromyalgia and gave me medicine that works for so many things (internal medicine). Nausia med helped me last night and today so hope I can kick this soon.

Sleep better, cope better, happier all the way around....on the side: dry mouth..now pregnant, don't know what I will do if I'm taken off...
Other	rb0411, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/9/2011 6:41:30 PM	I was placed on this medicine in conjunction with Topimax for migraines. My does started from 1 pill and progressed to a final dosage of 3 pills at bedtime. My migraine frequency went from 8-10 per month to 3-4 per month. It was a blessing however, it has caused severe gastro problems for me. I have tried several OTC remedies. So now after 3 months of use, my doc is pulling me off and trying something different. The side effects outweighed the pro's in this case but I encourage any migraine sufferers to try the Topimax/nortriptilyne combo. Perhaps you won't have the side effects I had to the extent that I am having them. I also had a huge decrease of libido and have gained a few pounds. It figures that I find a med that helps my core problem and causes many other problems :(

I have been taking it for 2 weeks 10mg now for chronic 24/7 headaches I have experienced for the past year.  The pain relief has been wonderful!  It has also relieved chronic lower back pain due to disc degen and injury.  Dry mouth makes me drink a lot of water, no biggie.  I'm much calmer and able to focus more.   I am much LESS moody and irritable - contrary to other reports.  Much more calm, cool and collective.  I have LESS appetite and have lost a little weight - contrary to other reports. I no longer feel the need for NSAIDS. Life is great!

Taking 50mg at after dinner for 4 months.I also take hydrocodone for pain control. If I do not take an Ambien cr before bed I have extremely vivid dreams where I am in danger. When I take the Ambien I sleep thru the night. I also suffer from migraines and after reading peoples comments I realized I have almost no migraines and if I do they are less severe. I have dry mouth and constipation from all the drugs. My husband says I am in a better mood now. The fibro pain severity comes and goes. I am now taking physical therapy to strengthten my core muscles and I can climb stairs so much better. Will continue with this regimine until it doesn't seem to work. I also can't say a word for a few seconds and have a bit of fibro fog but all in all I am doing okay.

Started slow doses, one and increasing to five pills a night over a month, backed off to four&gt; this was most confortable dose and not so drowsy in morning. Nortryptlene also effective in insomnia and now sleep through most nights. About every 10 days a migraine starts, I add an imatrex for two or three days and the headaches disappear. Best treatment and results I've had ever and will continue, hopefully to decrease the dosage and eventually be free of headaches.

For 25+ yrs suffered nerve pain from neck down back &amp; left leg to big toe after a car accident. Tried many meds for pain all made my feel wrong in one way or another. Finally Dx'd as sciatica.  I can now tolerate being touched &amp; experience much lower pain levels. Good as anti-depressant also as in last 4 mths I have been Dx'd w/ COPD, obstructive sleep apnea &amp; breast cancer but I still find joy everyday. Helps w/ lymph node removal pain in arm (they cut the nerve bundle when remove lymph nodes).  Worked my way up to 50mgs nightly - took appx 6 wks to take affect.  Missed a few nights &amp; nerve pain returned.  Weight gain? Yes.  Dry mouth?  Not from this med, but there's nothing like sleeping w/ a face mask blowing 22mph into mouth for sleep apnea to make your mouth dry (even w/ a humidifier). Mood swings? Less than before I started taking. Constipation? I try to eat yogurt every day as a sweet snack. This med won't work overnight &amp; it isn't a cure, but as a maintainence medication I wouldn't want to live without it.

Depression	jackque60, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	65-74	8/3/2010 11:47:46 PM	I have been depressed all my life, however it was not till I was 21 that a major episodeI have run the gammet of drugs over the years to no avail.  However, I was able to control my moods until a divorce.  At the age of 29 I had my first majoy episode,, and was treated with drugs and therapy for a short period.  A new wife helped greatly for a while.  I used alcohol to treat myself for many years, but graduated from AA and the depression came backDue to a turn coat friend, I had my third episode sober, smoking free, and off drugs.  I for the first time could not take life as it was and took an overdose of Xanax.  Luckyly it was discovered immediatedly and I was cleaned out and sent to lock up for 7 days observation.  I came out taking 300mg of Wellbutrin for 3 years and 1 year of therapy.  However, the occassional thought of suicide  still occured.  My doctor put me on 50mg of Nortriptyline at night along with Clomapin for anxiety and 300 mg of Wellbutrin during the day.  I now sleep through the night and am a little weak in the mornings with a dry mouth, but it get better as the day goes by.  I solved the constipation by taking 3-4 magnesiom tables daily.  My suicidal thought are under control as I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't have that many days left on earth and I want to finally enjoy them.  A little dry mouth or constipation I can handle, suicide I cannot handle.  It is a premanent solution for a temperary problem.

I started on 10mg &amp; have been on it for 16 months; the neuro just up'd me to 25mg and I'm already constipated. My decrease in sexual desire makes sense now as well as my dry mouth. It also explains why I have trouble getting up in the morning. I have a 3 yr old that I have to take care of; I may go back to 10mg/day or may even try something else. On the up side, it did relieve the 24/7 migraine I had for 45 days.

Doctor just upped my dose to 150mg about 2 weeks ago.  I have gained weight but the worse thing is my breast hurt. I thought I may have breast cancer until I researched the side affects. All the info I have found (and spoke to pharmacist) say this is VERY rare.  My doctor told me this is not true but it is the newest meds I take so I say it has to be the reason.  I just cannot find out the long term affects if I continue taking this medicine as my doctor has suggested.  Anyone know?  The breast pain is unbearable.

Worked well for a while, than in 99 was put on Wellburtin 150 for ADD, up dose to 300m but still did not fell the full potential for this drug, up dose to 450 mg good for 2 weeks then back to old feelings of not wanting to do anything.  Going out &amp; mixing w/friends was never a problem on any of these drugs. Now Dr has put me on Savella 12.5 introduction dose.  Hope this works - have been depressed for 35 years.

It was horrible.  I cried EVERYDAY (that is not me)  It has not helped decrease my headaches.  It has only changed me into a crazy woman.  I am going to discontinue using this medication.

Other	Sherry, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	35-44	6/6/2010 1:07:02 AM	I stopped taking this medication 4 weeks ago and have had a terrible headache constantly  I was on the medication for chronic pain issues.. not headaches.  This has been awful!  I would not recommend starting this drug without a very thorough explanation from your physician.  I would never have started this drug if I had any idea how painful it would be to stop.  This headache is worse than the chronic pain I deal with on a normal basis.  As a side not, I do not enjoy taking medication and am currently going through acupuncture treatments for pain mgt, as opposed to the meds my Kaiser physicians try to jam down my throat!  I am tired of Western treatment that basically consists of taking drugs to dull the pain and not treat the source.
Neuropathic Pain	WorkingWoman, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	6/4/2010 8:35:46 AM	After reading all reviews, I've discovered I'm not alone.  I take this drug for migraines.  Getting used to the feeling tired, can't get up, dry mouth, and weight gain, was the pits.  After six months of taking 25mg a night, the migraines intensity was greatly reduced.  Dr.told me to take 2 pills at night for help with frequency.  Didn't work. Still have at least two migraines a month &amp; not related to hormones. The symptoms were really bad.  I return to one a night and feel so much better. I see dr 6/8.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/29/2010 6:40:10 PM	I was prescribed this medication about 10 days ago for sleep and anxiety- it has done nothing to help me sleep at night but it has caused severe hand tremors, dry mouth, physical exhaustion (cant even blow dry my hair without having to sit down and rest), craving of sweets (I rarely ever eat candy but I finished a bag of Hersheys Bliss chocolates in two days) and mood swings (either extreme bouts of anger with minimal provocation or will burst into tears over nothing).  I am happy for those that have found relief from their ailments through this medication but I very highly suggest that new users keep a daily log to monitor any unusual behaviors, thoughts, or emotions and see your Dr. immediately if anything abnormal causes concern.

If you don't have heart problems and start having heart fluttering, palpatations, irregular beating...stop taking it and go to the doctor or hospital.  I didn't have heart problems, and only after 3 days of 10 mg. a day, I started having an irregular heart beat.  My doc did a EKG and said I had abnormal QT rhythms and never to this medication or anything like it again. That was 3 days ago.  I go for a follow-up EKG in 4 days. Scary stuff!  Beware.

I do get bad spouts of dry mouth, but I just carry gum or a bottle of water with me. I'd rather do that than have the three migraines a week I was getting. I believe this med helps counteract some of the side effects of the Topamax. Alone it does not work well to prevent migraines, but this combination is a god-send.

I had some post surgerical depression as I ended up with a vision disabilty after my last big surgery.  My spouse left me three weeks after brain surgery.  I was really feeling quite depressed.  The doctor started me on Zoloft but I just felt empty, no emotion at all.  So then a neurologists put me on a low dose of Nortriptylene and I felt much better.  I have been on it now for 7+ years and haven't had any problems at all.

When  I started taking about 30 mg a day I was so pleased because I could finally sleep, and I dreamt too.  Now I am also taking lyrica and have been cutting down on my nortriptyline.  I am finding it hard to get to sleep again and it is so important to get a good nights sleep. My doctor said that the lyrica should also help me sleep but so far it hasn't. Both drugs have helped me handle my pain so I am a fan of both.  Weight gain is starting to be a problem though and its hard to do excercise because it causes so much pain.  I guess I am doomed one way or the other.

I was taking 10-15 OTC pain relievers a day for the regular headaches and would have to go to the emergency room once a month or so to get an injection for migraines that would knock me out till the next day. I'm down to about 2-3 regular headaches a week and I'll still get a migraine about every 2-3 months (and I have Relpax for that now). So for what it was prescribed to do, it has done great. The side effects I have noticed are trouble sleeping, bouts of dizziness and decreased sex drive. I was also diagnosed with depression in '95 and have been on several different meds over the years, but have not been on anything for that for about 4 years. Since I started the Nortriptyline over a year ago, 50 mg at night, my depression is actually coming back. I just read today that Nortriptyline is also used for depression, but up to 3 times the dosage I am taking for headaches. I will be talking with my DR about my options going forward since my depression (bad enough that I feel I need to go back on a medication)is now a reoccurring thing that is coming around way more often than I (and my family) am comfortable with.But for the headaches, this has been the only med that gives me this much relief.

The drug took care of the unbalanced feeling. I have been on it over a year and if I ever miss a dosage, it takes 3 to 4 days to get back to normal (normal is 90% for me currently). The headaches were a result of a sleep disorder. This drup worked for me on the unbalanced feeling.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	8/8/2009 12:37:51 AM	I was on this 20 years. It did help me function b/c I had depression and anxiety and insomnia. I was able to go to college and get a job but after many years on it I developed problems.  I now have gastroparesis and IBS. Most DR.s say this med helps the stomach but slows the intestines but since I've been off it 5 months all of my problesm with digestion  from swallowing all the way down to eliminating have improved. I had also developed reoccurring infections in my lymph nodes and exhaustion to the point of sleeping 17 hours a day. This too has improved but not gone away since being off the med. I'm guessing that my body has changed as I have aged making this not the right medicine for me anymore but it helped for many years. When I first started it it was a relief to me not to wake in the middle of the night in full blown panic attacks, and to feel calmer. No other med has worked as well but I have to say goodbye b/c the infections in my lymph nodes and the exhaustion is too much to deal with. Some people say they felt foggy on it but I never did. I felt electrified without it, and normal with it. It calmed me, and in emergencies, it really stopped full blown panic attacks. Dr.s say I shouldn't take it as it is dangerous but what antidepressant isn't? Am considering Lexapro now, but after being drug free for 5 months I feel physically healthier and am wondering if the trade off is worth it. I am depressed. I have no....no desire to do anything. No drive. No hope. No pill is magic but what if it helps? No way to know but to try. As long as it isn't liver/heart/kidney/nervous system damaging I guess comming off would stop the negative effects. Plus I'm waiting to completely come back from the Cymbalta which nearly killed me.

It has been a miracle drug for my back spasm/pain.  When I first began 10mg I could feel 6&quot; of my back relax and I as I raised to 50mg the relief worked up my spine.  It doesn't make me sleepy or foggy the next day.  One doctor wanted me to try Amitriptyline and I was foggy and hung over the next day.  I was thankful that the doctors at Mayo Clinic started me on Nortriptyline as I get relief and no side effects.

Depression	ddprib, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	35-44	7/18/2009 9:18:35 PM	The primary reason of me taking this is for sleep deprivation with a secondary reason for depression.  Prior to this medication, I was taking (3) 50mg tablets of amitriptyline at dinner as they take quite awhile to take effect. Amitriptyline definately works better than the Nortriptyline for sleep if taken at dinner time and not bedtime. I take Zanax 3 times a day also, so I don't know if they cause anxiety.  I had to get off of the Amitriptyline because it makes it very difficult to get up at an early time like going to work.  The Amitriptyline started making me listless and depressed during the day also and then my Dr. put me on Nortriptyline as it makes it easier on getting up in the morning and having more energy during the day.  I would advise anybody taking Nortriptyline or Amitriptyline to read all the precautions here on WebMD as it gave me alot of information of all of the side effects along with other health problems you may have as Diabeties, etc.that is listed and let your Dr. know about many other body issues you may have including Diabeties, etc. I am more well of on Nortriptyline than Amitriptyline, unless you just want to sleep night and day.  In closing, I just urge you to read all of the information they provide here on WebMD. About 90% of the info. provided between the 2 medicines is the same.

It worked immediately (at 25 mg) on my migraine.  When I escalated to 50mg, I began having side effects:very dry mouth, heart rate above 100, and constipation. Two weeks ago, I was stepped down to 25mg/day, and the side efects have almost disappeared.  If the 25mg dose can continue to stave off my migraines, I'll be a very happy camper. A very good drug in my estimation -- and generic, to boot!

The one side effect I've noticed is a severe reduction in loss of appetite.  I'm not complaining since I'm trying to lose weight, but I'm wondering if everyone else who says they've gained weight also had a loss of appetite?  I had a funky thing happen with my vision about 4 days after but I'm not sure if it was related.

It helped a lot with that, actually I never had any while I was on it. But, shortly after I started taking the pills I instantly started having side effects such as:mood &amp; behavior changes, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, feeling impulsive, irritable, agitated, aggressive, restless, depressed, &amp; started having thoughts of hurting/killing myself. -Finally after all that built up on me I finally gave in to the pain &amp; tried to kill myself....After being in the hospital for 3 days and dealing with all of that, they finally got all of it out of my system &amp; I was me again.~I DO NOT  recommend that anyone use this for any reason!!! Its very dangerous! -Thank God my life was saved because I dont and didnt want to die, honestly on that pill I felt like a zombie and I didnt know what I was doing nor did I have any control.Now that its out of my system I feel free and a lot, A LOT, happier!

She is only taking 10 mg each night. I'm hoping she doesn't have the side effects everyone is talking about. I wasn't able to attend her doctors appointment, but I hope the doctor explained all of the side effects to my husband. I really need to keep an eye on her and ask if she has any of the symptoms.

Every doctor seemed to ignore that pain, and focused on my hypothyroidism, weight, and other health issues. Finally, my newest doctor hit upon this medication, and it gave me my life back! I took this med for quite a few years. Now, I have facial neuralgia and am attempting a anti-seizure medicine, which apparently is dangerous when combined with Nortriptyline. So I must give it up. I hope the headaches don't recur. Side effects were dry mouth (remained whole time I took meds), trouble urinating, and possibly weight gain (though I fought that battle before I took this drug).

However, this dosage upset my severe IBS beyond belief and caused me to gain weight. I am currently in the process of being weened off of this drug, the migraines have returned, and I feel absolutely horrible (mentally and physically).

The first few days I was using it I felt very tired in the afternoon, But after about a week it really started to help lessen the symtoms of my condition. Less anxiety, no aches or pain, better consentraction/focus, more energy, happier, less irratable, more ease falling asleep, and I was do much better in school. When ever I exercise or reading I felt a pleasant tingling sensation, a side effect but an enjoyable one. Exercising also increased the benefits of the medication. The side effects usually were not to bad, dry mouth and strange taste in the morning, dizziness after standing up, faster heartbeat, and slightly high blood pressure. I never had any sexual problems, but I have noticed a lowered sex drive. About 1 to 2 times a month at night after taking my dose I start to have what I would describe as &quot;closed-eye visuals&quot;, very strange and sometimes scary, I also sometimes wake in the night and when I started to fall back asleep after a brief amount of time I would feel an unpleasant strong &quot;prickly&quot; felling in my brain, followed by the strange dreams, which seemed overpowering as if I was still awake. Overall for me the benefits outweighted the side effects.

Neuropathic Pain	Was Confused, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	45-54	2/12/2009 2:44:01 PM	While my pain level has been greatly reduced to a level which allows me to function, I now struggle with weight gain, which I gained in spite of daily exercise and strict diet.  Until I read other reviews on this site, I could not figure out where the weight gain was coming from.  I also dream like there is no tomorrow between this medication and the amitryptilene I am also taking.  I was on 50 mg of each 1 time per day and I have now cut back to 25 mg of each/day, hoping to still manage my pain but lose the weight gain....It seems there is always a trade off when taking any medication; a symptom is treated and others pop up.
Depression	cheylou, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/2/2009 2:22:01 AM	I take 25mg tablet at bedtime.  overtime I have had to take zopiclone for sleep, since the side effect of noratrypline is insomnia. I have ringing in ears, but considering that I have tried all previous SSRI drugs and suicide did reoccur because of those drugs.  I am left with two choices ameltryapline or noratrypline. So far at low doses it' very good.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	1/21/2009 2:46:52 AM	My mother was taking this medicine for her depression. She was on it for a little over a year. She committed suicide while on this medication...ironically...this medication is what she used for the suicide...she took an intentional overdose. I suppose that everyone is different and responds different to medication but I have read some other's comments about extreme mood changes in their loved ones. Then there are other reports stating everything is working great. I have always found it strange that the very medications they use to treat depression can actually make it worse. Most antidepressants now actually have warnings about causing a deeper level of depression and actually causing thoughts of suicide in some people...even in those who have never considered suicide previously. Doesn't make sense to me...but I am not a doctor nor a chemist who make these drugs. Hooray to those of you that find relief in this medicine and I have deep sympathies for those who have seen themselves or their loved ones go further downhill. It is rough to witness someone's pain and suffering like that.

Seems to help and I am sleeping very well. Dry mouth almost unbearable -- hope that calms. The peeing issue is there but no other side effects -- could it be power of suggestion as Dr mentioned only those two sides. I also have Morton's Neuroma which has lessened (many thanks to the arch support insert).

He said it will help with the dry mouth and save her teeth from falling out. Having just paid $6K for braces... we will keep the Trident coming!!Thank you everyone for your input.

While it worked for the migraines, I have found that I have gained 35 pounds.  I have been diligent in my eating habits and have also joined a gym - working out 4-5 times a week.  The weight has remained at the high level.  With this in mind, I have found myself more depressed, as I don't look good.

The doc said go to 50 mg. Now I have suck severe hearburn and a headache that I am no longer taking this med Please anyone read up on your meds because sometimes it is best to deal with other things, like kidney pain then to go through severe heartburn &amp; migraine. This is hell, I rather deal with my severe kidney pain then this mess.

Other	catkotrosa,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female		9/8/2008 2:49:12 PM	I was put on nortriptyline because of back pain.  At the time I was also on Prozac for about 10 years with no problems.  I started to get symptoms of left leg tremor and then I began to stumble and fall for no apparent reason.  I also had mental symptoms of word finding difficulties.  I could not balance my check book, write checks and then send them off.  I do medical transcription and I was unable to do that.  I told my doctor of the symptoms and asked about the nortriptyline.  He again was not worried about the medication.  I was sent for several MRIs in various parts of my body.  At no time did anyone suggest the nortriptyline was to blame and I was not in any condition to think what the problems were caused by.  Finally, I accidentally forgot to take the nortriptyline for a week and began to feel better, at which point I realized that the nortriptyline had been the culprit all along.  I received a letter from the hospital apologizing for the mistake and for the length of time it took to find the cause (5 months).
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	9/2/2008 9:19:15 AM	I was given this medication for the treatment of migraines.  It has helped to keep the migraines so they are not as severe or frequent, but the side effects are horrible.  I've been on the medication for over 2 months and every time I try to increase the dosage my heart starts racing (resting pulse rate of 130+ on 30 mg) and I have horrible heartburn.  I am insisting that I be taken off this medication since it scares me to have my heart rate so high, especially since I work out almost every day and it's almost impossible to keep my heart rate in the 'zone' when it's so high to start with.  I feel like a heart attack waiting to happen.

I used to get them 3-4 times a week, and I would get severe pain behing my eyes and towards the back of my head. My doctor only wanted me to take 10 mg, because i have a little build, and I am younger. This medicaton has worked wonders. I no longer get the tension headaches, and I can continue on with my daily activities. I dont want to be on his drug forever, so Im thinking about stopping th usage of this drug within a few years.

I don't like this medication at all. I'm supposed to up the dosage by 10mg every 3 days until I reach 50mg and take it at bed time. I'm currently at 30mg and can't sleep at night. I have insomnia and this is making it worse. I'm also real moody and irritable. I am asking to be taken off this medication because it's interfering with my job. I tired all day but can't sleep at night. Everyone says I look like I'm feeling better but I'm not, my head just doesn't hurt as bad. I would not recomend this medication to anyone for any reason.

The worst side affect for me is constipation. I went up to 40 mg and recently have been brought down to 30 mg and then 20 mg.

Neuropathic Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	45-54	7/27/2008 8:20:35 PM	I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy almost 31/2 yrs. ago. I started with Neurontin, Lyrica, and Cymbalta. None of them helped the pain. I had some success with amitryptyline for about 3 months 2 years ago. It gradually quit working. I tried to avoid taking opiates but had no other options. I started with 5mg hydrocodone 4/day. Because of constipation the neurologist switched to oxycodone. He upped the dosage to 7.5mg 4/day then 10mg 4/day. This helped a lot for about a year. I then gradually felt the pain coming back. I switched neurologists for another opinion. She lowered the oxycodone to 7.5 and I started with 25mg/day Nortriptyline then 50mg and finally 75mg. After a week at 75 mg I began having trouble urinating. It got so bad that I couldn't go for almost 8 hours. I'm back to my primary care tomorrow to talk about other alternative treatments. I have seen a pain mgmt specialist he wants me to see another neuro and possibly get setup with the Spinal Cord Stimulation unit. I'm fearful of that until someone convinces me that it is safe. I am so tired of all this. I have been to over a dozen doctors and none seem to understand or care about chronic pain.

I am taking 30mg each night. It seemed to kick in after 6 weeks and I did not have a headache for 16 days- a miracle for me. Unfortunately it did not last and shortly after I was back to headaches 3-4 each week. I called my Doctor yesterday and he is weaning me off these and I am going to try a similar drug called Amitriptyline. I hope that it will work for me. The major side effects I had on Nortriptyline was dry mouth when I woke up and constipation. Good Luck!

In switching to Nortriptyline, I was to continue taking the fluoxetine and replace one pill at a time with the nortriptyline up to 100mg.  I've gotten up to 75mg but the side effects are making me crazy.  The dry mouth is so bad that my lips stick to my teeth, my tongue sticks to the inside of my mouth and my tongue burns when I eat.  Also, even more concerning is the blurred vision.  I've always had 20/20 vision and all of the sudden in the last week, I can read normal type.  I had to go to the drugstore and buy the cheater glasses so that I can continue to work.  Dr says to reduce the dose until no side effect are felt and then try increasing the dosage again.

So I made the mistake and stopped taking it for 2 days. I was originally put on it for headaches that weren't related to migrains or cluster headaches. But I've been researching this medication more and have noticed that my headaches could possibly be related to depression (not sure). I've noticed that I'm a lot happier now, and just today (after about 2 weeks of being on it) I didn't get a headache all day. So I finally feel that the medication is taking effect. My doctor also had put me on the lowest dose possible, and after my MRI's and MRA's my headaches were still unknown and the medication wasn't working with only one pill a night. So she upped my dose to 2 pills a night and it's been working amazingly.

Depression	Beth, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	4/27/2008 8:01:45 PM	I was prescribed this medication for chronic treatment-resistant depression. Have taken SSRIs, and an MAOI with little success. This medication has increased my fatigue, so that I'm sleeping 12+ hrs a day, and still feel tired. Instead of solely decreasing the depression, the med seems to numb all of my emotional responses.  I am less tearful but more apathetic. Also I've noticed increased irritability. I have had ongoing headaches seemingly related to the depression and tension, and haven't noticed any difference in the severity or frequency of those headaches since taking the medication. I've had extremely dry mouth and increased thirst since starting the medication, along with increased appetite.  I've only been on the medication a short period of time (two weeks), but I think that my doctor will probably take me off the medication when I go back for my next appointment.

Neuropathic Pain	none, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	4/17/2008 2:07:38 AM	I have been taking this medicine just over a  week now for severe headaches I would get every other day. Within a few days, it has worked somewhat, i feel there is a headache there, but it doesnt feel as bad and feels like something is trying to mask the pain. But none-the-less it does help for the most part, as I have since only had 2 headaches.

Neuropathic Pain	Solice,  Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female		3/16/2008 10:24:06 PM	I had severe headaches that would last 24/7 for weeks at a time.  I was at the end of my rope.  The only way I could stop the pain was to go to the hosiptal and get a Compazine i.v.  I'd go home and sleep it off and a day later the headache would come back.  If I weren't a mother I would have considered ending it. Absolutely nothing else worked. When I started taking this drug I had very strange dreams at first. You might want to start on a low dose and work up to a higher dosage.  This medication helped my headaches within 24 hours. If you are desparate enough you will try anything and the dreams were weird, but I'd choose them over the pain anytime.  The dreams went away and now if I miss the medication for 2 or more days the headaches come back.  It is a lifesaver.

Depression	Ripar00, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	45-54	3/11/2008 4:40:07 PM	After trying 8 different SSRI's I stopped taking all of them. For a couple of week's I felt good. Then I rebounded back with Depresion and Anxiety. Not that any of the other drugs helped much. Trazadone did for awhile. then the side effects kicked in. When I stopped the drugs, I started having brain freezes. little shocks evry time I moved my eyes or head. Sometimes 40-50 a minute. They lasted for about 6 weeks. Tey didn't stop until my Dr. (a new Dr.) had me start Nortriptyline. He started me on 10mgs, which is a very, very small dose. The brain freezes stopped right away. It took a little time and I have worked up to 50 mgs. I am not depressed hardly at all anymore. My anxiety is still there but is managable. My outlook on things is a lot better. Besides a little blurred vision, I am not having any side effects.

Other	Annie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	25-34	3/6/2008 10:50:09 AM	My psychiatrist put me on this medication to relieve anxiety and to help me sleep through the night.  I was waking up w/ panic attacks in the middle of the night, but now the Nortriptylin has helped w/ that part of it.  But I am still feeling lightheaded, weak and fatigue throughout the day.  I have been told that all of these are side effects, but how long do the side effects last?  I am only taking 10 mg each night and have been for the past 5 days.  Do the side effects generally last longer than 1 week?  Help me.  Will I ever feel better?  Thank you.

Doc told me to take one 50mg pill at night right before bed.  I have hardly slept at all.  I used to take .5mg of xanax and had no trouble sleeping, just waking up.  Has this helped anyone who has trouble with sleeping/anxiety?  Has anyone been prescribed it in this sort of dosage (ie one big dose a day)?  Should I give it a little longer?  Still waiting to hear back from the doc.

I also have severe constipation, dry mouth, and am constantly hungry.  It relieved my depression and helped with the frequency of migraines, but the weight gain isn't worth it.

I had pancreatitis and it messed up the nerves in my stomach to the point where I could not hold down food. The day after I began this medicine my stomach actually growled - which it had not done for three months. I went through five doctors and many tests, diagnosis, and treatments until this medicine was prescribed.

I was having pain and tingling most of the time down my right shoulder and arm, but after a couple of weeks on the medication the pain and tingling went away.  I've now been taking it for two months with no problems.  It does make you a little lethargic in the morning, but nothing that a little caffeine can't help.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/4/2008 1:45:34 PM	After suffering nerve pain for three years along with depression, my Dr. prescribed this drug for me.  At 25mg I saw an improvement.  However, when I attempt to increase my dose to 50mg. I experience increased pain.  The worst thing for me is that ever since I began the medicine, I have experienced sever fatigue!  I'm sleeping 10-12 hours at a time and have no energy when I'm awake.  My every movement is forced.  I'm taking all kinds of OTC vitamins and energy related supplements, but they help very little.  Any suggestions are appreciated.  
Neuropathic Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	1/2/2008 2:51:01 PM	i use this medicine for migraines. it has helped more as a sleeping aid than for my migraines. i have to take it about 2-3 hrs before i got to bed. im not sure if its the drug that makes me feel drowsy or me having to be to wk so early but its not easy getting up taking this medicine. i have to set the alarm 2 1/2 hrs before acutally having to get up. i dont take it @ night when i have had anything w/alcohol that day because it doubles the effects. overall, this medicine takes the edges off w/the mirgraines but diff. doesn't keep them at bay.

I've had dosage increased twice and both times with superb effectiveness. However, the numbness on my right forearm and tingling suggest that I might need to increase dosage again which probably will not happen.  I might have to go to another scription or have another scription added to the nortriptyline to make it more effective.Overall, I would love for my body to be able to use this drug because it is so effective for both the tingling and numbness caused by the neuropathy.

My pain is reduced to almost none and I am sleeping a little better. HOWEVER, I have an extremely dry mouth and horrible metallic taste most of the time now.  As a teacher, it is hard to chew gum or suck on hard candy while I am working. Plus, it has cause constipation.  I never had issues with depression before, but now I am extremely moody and crying a lot. It has helped what it was prescribed for, but has created other problems.

After three days on the medication I had severe seizures. 8 months after quiting the medication I am still having severe seizures and can no longer work or care for my 3 children. Use extreme caution and very low doses. Think this medication through before use. Talk it over with your doctor and family seriously before begining use.

I also have a slight bulde in two of the discs in my lower back. It's been about 5-6 weeks since I started this prescription, but my Dr. told me I might have to give it 8-10 weeks to see if I would benifit from it. I also tried Cymbalta for 3 weeks prior to that, but didn't see any improvement.(not sure if that was long enough) It's my understanding that these types of anti-depressants are also often prescribed for nerve conditions/pain. Hope this helps.

Which may or may not be a part of the brain your pain is stemming from or should I say transmitted threw or to. So sorry , hope this helps. Don't give up! Demand a change of meds or see another dr.
