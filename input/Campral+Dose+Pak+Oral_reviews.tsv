Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	Moman, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	9/30/2010 7:28:15 PM	Have been taking this med for two weeks now and have no thought of drinking.  Even had dinner at a local bar that I went to all the time and didn't want to or need to drink.  The gas issues is up there but a small price to pay for not drinking.  Recommended big time.

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/13/2010 10:31:56 AM	I quit drinking on my own 7 years ago and started drinking again 6 months ago. I have been taking this medication for 2 1/2 weeks and my craving are gone. I would recommend this for anyone needing help with cravings atleast try it. The only side effects I have is lots of energy, my house is spotless. I only take 3 pills a day not six, but I only weigh 90lbs my doctor said six a day I will let him know when I have my check-up that 3 is working for me. I know with this medication I will quit again and wont make the mistake of believing you can quit for years and be cured. Once you quit it has to be forever, if you try to social drink you will end up being a heavy drinker again very quickly, I learned my lesson, but without help for my cravings I dont think I would be sober today. Good luck and stay strong.

Habit of Drinking Too Much Alcohol	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	5/3/2009 5:50:31 AM	I tried Campral 3 years ago and can still remember it working well at the time. However, for whatever reason, I deliberately chose to drink even though I didn't really want to. I probably wasn't ready to give up my relationship with alcohol. Afterward, I quit taking it which was probably because Campral loses its effectiveness when drinking on it. I made this mistake at the cost of much physical and emotional stress as well as more alcohol related problems mounting up over the last 3 years. For quit some time, I have been stubbornly trying to quit on my own but finally decided to go back to that prescription. It's day 5, and the drug seems to have kicked in. My mental state is like night and day, and I didn't experience any cravings yesterday. By now, I would still be fighting it tooth and nail not to drink, especially if I had to work the next day. My doctor prescribed 1 pill 3 times a day for the first week followed by 2 pills 3 times a day thereafter. He said I may or may not have to take it the rest of my life. However, given the stakes, I plan to chose the former even if I get the feeling that I don't need it anymore or experience some of the side effects that others have commented about. My doctor also prescribed Fluoxetine (Prozac)to me in the case that I don't feel better emotionally after 3 weeks of Campral; I came to the doctor feeling pretty depressed. I'm thinking I may not need the anti-depressent afterall, but that's just my case. I rate this drug with 5 stars across the board with the assumption that it continues to work it's magic. I don't plan on discontinuing due to any of the petty side effects mentioned because, for me, the side effects of drinking are much more unbearable. I also plan to take it with the 3 meals a day so that I don't make the mistake of forgetting doses which people on other review sites mention can be problematic and led to their discontinued due use due to frustration. Why didn't I begin taking this again earlier??

Been in and out of AA for the past 4 years, 2 detox and 3 outpatient.  This has worked wonders. Been clean and sober for 5 months

So far it has helped.I was hoping to get some more feedback from someone who has taken it for a longer period of time.  I also wanted to know if anyone has experienced Diarheaa as a side effect and if it was a temp. thing.
