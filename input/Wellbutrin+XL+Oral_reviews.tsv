Depression	Nobody special, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	8/31/2012 10:44:07 PM	Tried using it a couple times in the past 5 yrs either for depression or smoking cessation (and sometimes both).  Was on 300mgs XR each time &amp; I managed to stay on it for at least a month (often 2-3) every time, but this stuff just turns me into a lazy sloth no matter what!.  Some people seem to be under the impression that its a stimulant but no way (I am actually on add meds so I know the difference): just wait until you've been on it for a full month, then you'll see! You'll see that it's like any other antidepressant in that it turns you into an apathetic zombie only you'll be way less choosy and you'll eat anything in sight.  I also found that this stuff DID NOT help my ADD in ANY way, but then again I actually have add for reals and am not just self-diagnosing myself.  I believe this could help calm hyperactivity though, so maybe it's good ADHD.

I asked my doctor about Wellbutrin XL as it is different than a lot of the &quot;common&quot; anit depressants because it effects your brain differently. I felt better on Wellburtin in less than 2 weeks. Yes I got a little &quot;bouncy&quot; and &quot;overly excited&quot; but that's why we're taking these drugs right...TO BE HAPPY AND NOT DEPRESSED!!!! I get out more, I enjoy walking my dog more it's not a &quot;chore&quot; as it used to be. I know there's no &quot;magic pill&quot; but for me it's been great and I've been on it ALL from Prozac to Paxil to Zoloft to Prestique to Cymbalta so I think I know what I'm talking about here!!!

Depression	JPear70, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	8/10/2012 5:51:38 PM	I live in the Pacific Northwest and wanted something to help with long winter depression and day to day anxieties and issues. I have taken SSRI's and didn't like the sexual side effects so I asked my dr about taking Wellbutrin. I was told to take one 150mg for 3 days and then take two thereafter (300mg). On day one slight annoying headache, no appetite. Day two in the evening I got agitated, shaky, couldn't focus or able to think about what words to put together, heart racing, still didn't want to eat. My husband said it was like I was on speed. In the middle of the night woke up drenched in sweat. Next morning eyes and head hurt. Hard to concentrate, foggy head and still unable to think and put words together. Decided to quit taking. Today I was looking at the bottle and it says these are 300mg tabs. If I took these as my dr told me AND as it says on the bottle I would have been taking 600mg by day four!!! I need to find out who messed this one up, dr or pharmacy. Good lesson to really read those pill bottles closely! Thank goodness I stopped them...who knows if I would have even seen that before I got to day four. I won't even pursue a lesser dosage. Too scared of it all now. If I really wanted to take meth I can get that anywhere without a  prescription! But keep in mind everyone handles these meds differently. Apparently this one is not for me.

It didn't help me to quit smoking, I did lose a few pounds in the beginning though.  After taking for a week or so I start having trouble sleeping at night. I'm wide awake after 4 hours of sleep but it only lasts for a couple of weeks and then I sleep fine.  They both make me a little scatter brained but especially the 300mg.  It's hard to concentrate.  But as far as the depression goes its great.  The GENERIC did not work AT ALL!  I've had many rounds with my insurance getting them to pay for the name brand but the generic simply did nothing for me.  My doctor had to call them and write on the prescription &quot;Name brand medically necessary&quot;.  Increase thirst is the only side affect.  It's easy to wean yourself off of these. I don't recommend quitting cold turkey.  Hope this helps someone.

I started this drug and it has done wonders! it has helped me to stop smokine, i have lost 30 lbs because I dont want to eat all the time.  and it has givin me energy so I have been working out again.  I dont dwell on issues any longer like I used to and it has helped me to prioitize what is important.  I have more of a level head rather than feeling like every problem was a huge issue. most importanty I laugh again.  it has increased my sex drive and I realize the important things in life.  I was feeling like being a mother was more of a chore, now I enjoy spending time with my family again.  I would recomend this drug to someone that is depressed and or wants to quit smoking.  I have had very little side effects.  I do get headaches more freakenly but it is much better than what I was feeling prior to being on the drug.

I did notice that I was irritable when I first started the medication, but that wore off. It mostly helps with the depression, somewhat for the anxiety. It's helped me lose 25 lbs (with the help of diet &amp; exercise). Overall, you don't feel as hungry. Definitely helps with the sex drive! It's by far the best one of all the other meds I've tried, has made a world of a difference in my life. I don't usually have a problem with sleeping, but I take it in the morning.

Depression	Survivor, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/30/2012 12:13:22 PM	At my psychiatrist request I tried Paxil then Zoloft, what a disaster that was. Horrible felt worse. She then put me on Wellbutrin, thank god. This was my magic pill. After my moms passing and other bad circumstances I realized I was seriously  depressed. I tolerated the pill very well. In no time I felt wonderful better than I ever felt. My sex life was great too, and since this natural type of energy helps boost the kind of neurotransmitter needed for optimal happiness, I was on cloud nine. I was able to go back to college and concentrate on things that were important rather than to dwell and fuel bad thoughts that kill me rather than aid me. I love this antidepressant, however; word of caution it might not be for everybody and all types of mental disorders. Use with caution and ward off any bad thoughts while your brain gets used to it.  Cognitive therapy and weekly psychotherapy helps a lot as well.

First thing I noticed on the second day of taking it was that I was unusually short of breath, and my heart started being quickly randomly throughout the day. On the fifth day I woke up with a sore left arm, and the pain spread to the left side of my chest. Developed chest pressure and that continued on for the full 8 days that I took the medication and ended when I went off the medicine. My anxiety also seemed to have increased; I could never calm down and my body always felt heavy. However, the only somewhat positive thing I can mention is that I felt that this medicine kind of woke me up a bit; before I was pretty numb, but I started feeling again. The side effects were enough to make me go off of it within 8 days. I hope to try the name brand Wellbutrin to see if there is an improvement. 
Depression	Claire, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	6/19/2012 12:00:58 PM	This works. I've always been mildly depressed. When younger, controlled mostly with exercise, bcp's. Finally tried WB 150 XL. Even though I do feel a bit cloudy-headed overall, i don't dwell on problems like before. But feel I can be focused when I need to be. I take when go to bed and I don't have insomnia, nor do I wake up real groggy (which was a problem when I initially tried taking it in the morning). Agree that you MUST stay with name brand, or try &quot;Watson&quot; generic. &quot;Teva&quot; is horrendous though. Ruined one of my vacations when the pharmacy switched me from Watson to Teva and I didn't realize there would be a difference but it was an awful experience. I do prefer name brand though. I don't understand why it has to be so expensive.

Wellbutrin gave me energy, I lost a good amount of weight, wasn't sleeping as much. No negative side effects annoying enough to even mention. What I enjoyed the most was not being in the pit. All Ive felt all my life is despair. No drug can make someone happy but this one lifted me up out of the horrible pit and gave me a chance at life.

Depression	LizinVegas, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/31/2012 12:55:56 PM	This drug is doing a great job for me. I have been on it for 12 years. I originally took 150mg once a day; moved up to twice a day but switched to 300mg slow release so I wouldn't forget to take one of the doses. I tried so many different drugs over the past 20 years that I've lost count and the side affects were often horrific. Once my psychologist recommended Wellbutrin and my psychiatrist concurred I have never switched and it is the only anti-depressant I take. I also dropped 20 lbs of the 30 the other drugs had caused me to gain. It has helped with ADD, SAD and the all encompassing symptoms of depression. There have been a few times during the years when I was unable to take it for several days in a row and you could tell but just one dose and I was back up feeling great. I'm sorry it doesn't work for everyone; it has so few uncomfortable side affects when compared to some of the newer drugs. But for those who have found relief I can tell you that after all these years I still have found relief. (My husband calls them my happy pills!)

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/24/2012 2:58:57 PM	Tried Celexa for a while but its side effects were too severe, I quit taking it. Foggy head, slow thought process, disinterest in sexual relations, minimal positive effects. I am quitting smoking and may be Bipolar so we tried Wellbutrin XL, 150mg. Severely decreases my interest in cigarettes/nicotine. Does not affect my thought processes [after the first week or two], my intimate life, or my sleep [provided i take it in the morning]. I do seem to drop things more often, but that declines as time goes on. I feel normal. It's the perfect medication for me. I recommend discussing it with your doctor to anyone with more than one issue potentially going on, that focuses more on depression than anxiety attacks. [in my case, smoking, depression, potential bipolar, probably ADD]

I had taken prozac for a year and took my self off cold turkey. In that year I gained 15lbs and was starting to get worse.then I did my own resurch and looked up non ssri meds for depression (all ssri meds make you gain weight and want to sleep). I hated the side effects of prozac(sleeping) and the 6 weeks it took to clean out my liver and detox. I then went back to my dr. My depression was soo bad. I asked him about wellbutrin. I started at150 and now week 3 at 300. I'm more cheerfull around my children. I'm having awsome sex again!! Working out, doing my yoga that I love and enjoying everything I missed doing. The only thing that I can say I don't enjoy is the smell of my sweat. Other than that I have high hopes for this medication.

I wasn't able to think clearly. Had to be taken off of this medication which put me into a mental health lock-up.  I have heard from doctors  since that this is a common side affect.  How can this drug be on the market?  I have never had to be committed to a mental health ward in my life. This drug is scary and I would not recommend it to be taken by anyone.  It took over my common sense and my life.

It gave me horrible anxiety, palpatations and made me very edgy.  It also prevented my from falling asleep which is obviously a problem within itself.  I knew my pain was not from my job, posture, or poor ergonomics.  Once q went from 300mg to 150mg, most of my upper back pain was abolished.  When I quit cold turkey (you can with tis drug unlike SSRI's), my neck pain was abilished!!!   In the future when I take in a new patient, I will make sure to see if they are on buproprion.  I think this drug should yanked off the market by the FDA!   My wife was prescribed it for bipolar, and she became so full of anxiety that she could'nt even concentrate to prepare a typical meal!
Depression	Olythia, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	4/21/2012 4:30:52 PM	Started these about 2 years ago after being  desperate because none of those that act on serotonin had worked for me. Best thing I ever did! I researched it on-line and found the ratio of people praising it to hating it was much more favourable than most other anti-depressants. Problem: I'm in the UK and it is only licensed for giving up smoking. So I have to order it from Europe or USA. I started by taking just a quarter of one 150mg tab and working up to the full dose by day 7. (different for everyone of course)Doing it this way made it much easier on the side-effects which for me were itchy rash on my hand and foot and difficulty getting to sleep maybe a bit of nausea but I found if I  ate some food with them it helped -even though my research said it shouldn't affect. I have read that taking a quarter of a tablet and building up gradually to lessen side-effects doesn't work. It really does for me. Bupropion has made me feel completely &quot;normal&quot; I didn't feel like I was on medication at all, until recently. After about a year and half I found I got occasional head pains. Not a headache as such. If I lay down on my front suddenly to watch television or something like that i would get a sharp pressure-like pain. I would keep still or slowly sit up and it would pass. after a few months I gradually started to get a slight hang-over feeling for a few hours most days. without any changes to my diet etc. I don't normally get headaches. My delivery was very delayed recently and I literally ran out. I was very worried what would happen with suddenly stopping (i could not get any from the doctor of course) Nothing happened so I stayed off them for two months. I can now very slightly feel anxiety on waking up that I used to get but only slightly so I decided to start again rather than wait until it gets bad. Today is the first day and I have a bit of that slight tightness in the head feeling. Anyone else had similar?

After a month doc increased to 300 mg and what a disaster. My heart was racing , felt jittery, and the worst was the insomnia. I slept 2 hours a night before I couldn't take it anymore. I went back to 150 mg but still can't sleep. Right now it's 3:30 am and not sleepy at all. My sadness and crying did go away but I am going to ask for something else b/c of the jitters, heart racing, and insomnia.

Other	KLouCB, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/17/2012 7:41:59 PM	I do not recommend anyone take this medication Wellbutrin.  It caused my thoughts and behavior to be out of control.  I took it because my former MD said, &quot;if you have chronic pain you also have depression&quot;. I have never been depressed in my life yet placed on Prozac and changed to Wellbutrin. This medication made me end up in a mental health ward where doctors automatically place a person on anti-psych drugs. Anti-psych medications are scary and should never be given to patients automatically.  Wellbutrin made my thoughts and actions so crazy and doctors since have told me that this is a common side affect.  Scary thought! Due to the fact I was discharged on these crazy drugs to take at home I continued to have scary thoughts and odd behavior.  This has been a nightmare that I would not wish on my worse enemy. Ive been in and out of psych wards for four years due to drugs that are on the market and we are told we must take the medicine a doctor orders. The ER doctor sees my medical records of a former  mental illness and then send me back to be committed to a mental ward with several E.R.visits. It was a revolving door as I would be once again on medicine that alters ones thoughts and behavior. I am lucky as my doctor got me off of Wellbutrin and every time I have been forced into a mental health ward by an emergency room doctor, my doctor weans me off of these terrible drugs and I am back to my old self.  I never had a history of mental illness until I started taking Wellbutrin and then being forced to take anti-psych medications will make your brain think things you wouldn't believe and behave in an out-of-control manner.

Went through recovery program and is doing great.  I, however, went into a deep depression.  Wellbutrin has taken the edge off my life.  Things that used to make me cry don't any longer.  It does make me sleepy.  I feel like myself, only calmer.

At times when I've run out, I can really tell the difference.  I don't want to be without it any more.  Thank you for this.  It has helped inhance my life with my family.
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	4/1/2012 1:01:25 AM	Went from 150mg to 300mg after 3 weeks due to minimal effect, but once at 300mg experienced a noticeable difference in my depression and irritability. Still experiencing side effects of dry mouth, trouble sleeping, and racing thoughts at times, but it is doable. Glad this Rx was available for me. Tried Zoloft, Lexapro, and Remeron previously- no luck, terrible side effects and minimal effectiveness.

The biggest thing about the med for me is that I lost 15 pounds within the 1st 4 months. I I take this med along with Prozac and Xanax. Another good thing I can say is it helped stop my dad from stuttering. So far, so good. I have not cut back on smoking though. I would recommend this drug to others. 
Depression	YaYa, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	3/30/2012 12:08:52 PM	I've taken this drug at the 150mg level for many years, just recently increased to 300. Increased because I wasn't feeling as good any more.  Can't say I'm feeling much better, the sleeplessness has been terrible.  I'm seriously considering going back to the lower dose.I originally started on Wellbutrin XL after participating in a double blind drug study for depression.  Wellbutrin combined with Cymbalta was the study administrator's best guess as to what I had been taking. This is not a usual drug combination, but it has done wonders for me. I am able to hold down a full time job in an extremely detailed position.  I'm known at work for my calmness! 
Stop Smoking		1	1	1			3/29/2012 11:40:47 PM	i took this medication for a total of 5 days. i took it to quit smoking and to help my moods as well. By the 3rd day i started thinking about  death constantly.it wasnt suicidal thoughts just obsessive thoughts of dying and my funeral and that it was going to happen soon. By the fifth day i started to get scared because i was  thinking about running my car off the road and i knew since i have battled depression since i was sixteen  that these thoughts were  and not normal for me and instead of being melodramatic about how horrible life was i was internally obsessing over these dark thoughts . it was very scary and stopped taking it immediately. after i stopped wellbutrien the morbid thoughts stopped. very weird.

I have no nasty side effects at all, if anything I have more energy and even started to exercise again after one year of inactivity. Got a couple of bad headaches the first week or so but it dissapeared quickly. In my case it took it 3-4 weeks to work.

I was hesitant to try another antidepressant again but last year none of my usual coping skills (exersize, paying attention to my thoughts etc) seemed to be helping as much as I needed them to. This medication has worked extremely well for me, the only problematic side effect is some increased shakiness and anxiety - even with that I feel so much better than I did before I started taking Wellbutrin.

The start of the third week, I quit smoking and have not had any significant cravings since. I've also been dieting and losing weight at the same time. The only problem with this med is I always feel nasuous throughout the day, have lots of gas and am constipated. But a small price to pay to deal with these side effects than to be smoking.

It works really well to help you quit when you are ready.  I stopped taking it after only three months the first time I quit, and I believe that is partly why I started back after four months.  It has been over two months this time, and I feel it's my last!  Thank you, Wellbutrin XL!

I am just now seeing a difference. As each individual is different so do I believe how long or how soon it takes for antidepressant to kick in. I did experience some &quot; sudden anger&quot; moments but those too are starting to go away. I had been on Prozac for many years and it was not working anymore so doc prescribed wellbutrin. I think the transision between the two drugs is what caused some of my uneasy feelings but is better now. My advice is, give the drug time to get in your system before dismissing it. As stated everyone is different and it may just take longer for some to feel the effectiveness . It's helped me so far and anticipate it getting better everyday.

I was then put on Wellbutrin for it has little to no side effects and doesn't mix badly with my Seroquel. The problem I'm having now is, instead of lack of sex drive I'm like a 16 year old again (but I last just as long as well). I don't know if switching to this medication has brought life back into certain parts of my body that i had forgotten about (doubtful) or the medication is making me SUPER sensitive. Either way, I don't like it. Also, I get agitated fast and I'm slightly more emotional. Looking for alternative medication... any suggestions?? Anyone? 
Major Depressive Disorder	hopeful65, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/2/2012 1:30:14 AM	This medication has been a life saving treatment for me.  I have been on multiple drugs for my depression over the last several years and in and out of the hospital several times also.  I was put on the Welbutrin after my last hospitalization for attempting to take my own life earlier this year(2011).  I am currently on the maximum dose and I also take Lamictal(100mg)and Remeron(30 mg) to help with sleep.  I was like a zombie with the 5 meds I was on before my suicide attempt now I feel so much better.  For the first time in 6 yrs I have my energy back, I'm not falling asleep during the day,I am hopeful instead of hopeless and I am back working after an extended medicalleave.  I do see a therapist in addition to the medication currently and attribute the success of my recovery to the combination of the new medicine, therapy and the intensive care I received in my week and a half stay at a psychiatric hospital 6 months ago but I believe the medication change to Welbutrin has made a huge difference.  I hope my experience is helpful to someone out there who is suffering from this medical illness that can be difficult to treat.

Bipolar Depression	gyptian, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	45-54	12/17/2011 12:31:57 AM	I take wellbutrin twice a day 150mg. And I find it to be a lot better than zoloft. And it doesn't take away my sex drive the zoloft did. It doesn't make me drowsy either. Nor does it keep me awake at night staring at the ceiling the other antidepressants have done in the past. I take it along with seroquel 75mg at bedtime and I'm able to fall asleep without any problems. The biggest complaint I have regarding seroquel is tha it makes me crave sweets and other foods, so you really have to excercise discipline as far a healthy diet is concerned (but its not easy) because seroquel raises glucose levels and can cause diabetes, so you really have to try and limit you carbohydrates as well. Other than that, I'm satified for now.

I woke up in bed scratching and itching all over. Had hives all over my body. All throughout the day I had severe chest pain and stomach cramps that would not go away. I took all kinds of meds to get rid of pain but did not help it. Later in the evening I could not take the itching and chest pain anymore and went to ER. They gave me steroids and benadryl IV and kept me overnight for the chest pains. Got better, went home next day and woke up following morning with my face and eyes swollen shut, fingers and hands were swollen and throat was shutting off, couldn't swallow and hard to breathe, so I went back to ER to get more steroids and Benadryl, still itchy. Finally went away later that night. What an experience!!! I will never take Welllbutrin again. One good thing about Wellbutrin it did take my appetite away. I am going to miss that part of it.

I am now smoke free for the last 5 yrs and never want to return to smoking again. I am still on Wellbutrin XL 300mg daily but am recently wondering whether or not it is enough; am going to begin some activities to try to combat my feelings of sadness, boredom, and fatigue at this time.

My thought process is clearer then on Zoloft but can't interact around people so I am on to the next one.

I wondered if it was the way it's delivered into your system through the time release...it is a diffent shape as well can that play a role in the release? Anyone had that issue?

It has helped with my depression which is really great but in return, I have trouble sleeping, I feel tried, and sometimes get become over heated-very hot and then I will cool off. I am going to stop because it is making my ears ring all the time which I know is the medicine; which can drive you crazy!  So, it has it's benefits but also it has it's drawbacks. 
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/25/2011 12:50:34 PM	I have been prescribed Wellbutrin XL 150mg a day for 2 weeks then increased to 300mg.  I have been taking it for 12 days now and the first 7 days were hell, I am feeling much better now.  I was haveing extreme headaches, dizzyness, nausia, sleepy.  I missed 4 days of work and spent most of my time in bed because I felt so bad.  These side effects are gone now and I an starting to see small changes, feeling more happy and I am having a more positive attitude.  It has not disrupted my sleep...If anything I am sleeping much better than before.  I start 300mg in a couple of days....I hope it goes well.

I had previously tried other medications but was wanting something that would not decrease libido or cause weight gain so she put me on this.  I experienced the worst side effects ever. Severe shakiness, overhyper activity, severe insomnia, and it caused me to have such bad anxiety attacks that I ended up in the ER after the 4th day of taking it. I have never reacted to any drug in my life, this was scary.

CUT BACK TO 150 MG AND LIGHT-HEADNESS CEASED, BUT ANXIETY INCREASED.  DR. TOOK ME OFF OF IT AFTER SIX WEEKS, AND PUT ME ON VILAZODONE.

I was nagged by an underlying feeling of anxiety and nauseous stomach.  It definitely improved my sex life.  I had been on Cymbalta and it worked well except in the bedroom.  I give Wellbutrin an OK.  I really need something more effective for depression.  I may take the leap to a new drug called Viibryd which is hyped as offering good depression relief without the sex problems.  I first got on Wellbutrin to knock out the Cymbalta sex effects.  It didn't work.  I may find myself on it to aid the Viibryd if it turns out to be problematic.  Anyway, good luck with Wellbutrin.  If it works for you..that's great.

My symptoms of anxiety/depression worsened within days after starting this new Rx. I turned into a raving lunatic, talking non-stop, not able to stay focused on tasks at work. I was miserable, nervous, angry, sad, never satisfied. Did nothing for the low sex drive. Demanded to be taken off after a month. 6 months later I am still hearing tidbits of what I was like when I was on Wellbutrin, in fact I can say I was almost fired by my employer because of certain things I spewed out of my mouth without regard to anyone's feelings. I am now taking Cipralex 20mg once in the morning. I have been taking antidepressants for most of 15 years. Generally, I feel better but you have to realize there isn't a magic pill, you have to find one that works for you.

I was taking 450mg a day.  It seems like it's not working as effectively as it did in the early days.  Now my DR has upped my dosage to 600 MG a day. That doesn't seem to be working either.  I'm trying to find a new DR but hate the prospects of being hospitalized for the 5th time.

First time I took this about 5 years ago I was literally having sexual urges constantly so my doctor took me off it after a month of &quot;bliss but agony&quot;. Well, speaking to my psychiatrist who specializes in meds and heads the state board where I live, Wellbutrin was actually considered being used as a drug for lacking sexual desire when they did their initial studies. This was due to the results of the initial tests showing increased sexual desire of women and actual orgasm without stimulation. It was being studied at this time to see positive effects for depression. It helped me the first time I took it although I felt like a nympho. Back on it again 3 years ago to help libido but doing nothing but causing constipation...no sexual desire at all. Actually wish I was experiencing my initial use &quot;urges&quot; that caused me to stop it, was having &quot;almost orgasms&quot; at work and couldn't concentrate.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	9/22/2011 7:26:52 PM	 I beleive there is a posibility that wellbutrin contributed to an overly high sex drive. It made my husband happy, but being that I couldn't get enough I went outside the marriage to be satisfied. It almost seemed to put me in a bipolar state. It never happened before and it never happened since. Keep in mind I am not blaming this all on the drug because I was feeling like i wasn't getting enough attention at home and these other men provided that for me. It just seems an odd coincidence that this all started 4 weeks after i was put on wellbutrin. No problems since i got off the medication.

I told my Doc. and she prescribed this because she had prescribed Wellbutrin ER, 200MG taken 2x per day. With the new prescription she also prescribed Doc-Q-Lace. I started the new therapy on a Thursday - Today is Tuesday - no bowel movement yet. Along with the new drug therapy I have included all old stand bys for constipation - prune juice -  prunes - large quantities of fruit and vegatables - copious amounts of water and have stayed mobile to help move things along - no dice.Trying to find someone else that had this same side effect. My doctor seems to think I am one of 1000 that has had this happen.

Only the XL can be broke down. It gives the same effect as meth but if the vein is missed,it ruins the vein, rots the skin &amp; ALOT of people lose their limbs by amputation. This drug is dangerous &amp; should be taken off the market &amp; people use the reg. wellbutrin cause drug addicts can't shoot up with that. PLEASE listen to this message, i've witnessed many people that this has happened to.

The only thing is that I'm starting to gain the weight back and if feels like it's not working as effectively. I will continue to use it but I'm afraid that it's going to make me gain more weight? any suggestions out there?

Depression	AABurnett, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	9/6/2011 9:07:09 PM	I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder almost 20 yrs ago. At first it was just anxiety, but as the years have gone by I developed severe depression on top of it. I've tried just about every kind of &quot;depression&quot; medication on the planet, and Wellbutrin (the generic, Buproprion) has been the one that's helped me the most. The depression has gotten 90% better during the time I've been taking it. Still have anxiety issues (but I've got Xanax for that...LOL)...but I'd rather be anxious than depressed any day.I have to take this medication in the morning, otherwise it's hard to get to sleep at night. And I'm carrying around several extra pounds, but I think that all depression meds make you gain weight. After reading some of these reviews, it's obvious that everyone reacts differently to this medication as far as &quot;side effects&quot; are concerned. For the first week after I started taking it, side effects were a little rough...my hands shook really bad at times, I had a hard time sleeping, and I was a little nauseated. After my body adjusted to it (and it takes about a week) the symptoms subsided &amp; everything was fine.On the plus side ~ after I'd been taking Wellbutrin for about 6 months, I quit smoking. One of the nice little side effects of this medication. ; )If you have depression and haven't tried Wellbutrin yet, give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.

And unlike Zoloft, it caused no sexual side effects. However, it eventually made my throat feel really wierd, to the point that all I could do was think about my throat continuiously. Needless to say, I had to stop taking it.

I only took it for about a week and noticed that I started having tingling and numbness in my hand/arm and foot/leg.  It has been about a week since I took and am still having the symptoms.  I thought it was something else but it is ironic that I started having this issue after I took the medicine.

From the beginning this medication made it impossible for me to fall asleep at night.  My Clonazepam was increased which just makes it harder to get up in the morning.My moods were better, my sex drive increased but I have gained 3 pounds(no change in appetite) and after several doctor visits, MRI's and a final visit to a neurologist I was told to discontinue this after nearly passing out when driving.  It feels as though I am in a fog and everything around me is twirling...and this comes on suddenly.  Hoping it is not the medication as it has done wonders for me.

Overall, I noticed a huge improvement in my mood, my energy level had extremely increased, and my appetite decreased. However, anxiety hasn't completed disappeared. While I use to have an anxiety attack, and then feel better once it passed- I now am in the lingering &quot;is it coming? When is it going to come&quot; panic feeling. Also, I believe this pill is mixing with my menstrual cycle. I would experience the normal/moderate emotional stage, however since I starting taking this I've become a hysteric, crying women for 5 days a month. Also, when I take stand pain relievers, it makes me extremely dizzy and makes my brain feel hot (only way to describe it).

I had previously tried Zoloft but had to discontinue due to the side effects.  After about three weeks, it seems the black cloud of depression has lifted.  I have the excessive sweating side effect but it's ok.  A positive side effect is that it has increased my sex drive by about 500%, so that is a plus.  I am only on the 150 Mg dose, once per day, but don't know if it needs to be increased or not.

Stop Smoking	55-64 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2		55-64	7/4/2011 6:14:41 PM	I've been on Wellbrutrin XL just over 6 mo's. It has hardly any effect on my smoking neither have the patches. I've just completed step 3 of the patches &amp; my Wellbrutrin XL was increased from 150Mg to 300.I have COPD quiting smoking is a real challenge. I will say the Wellbutrin XL has helped with the deppression of quiting smoking.
Other	CandyL, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/4/2011 2:06:13 PM	I have been taking this med for three months now for anxiety/panic attacks, fibromyalgia, and neuropathy. It has helped me tremendously.I experienced few side effects. I tried Savella and Cymbalta before and had a horrible experience with both! I would recommend this med to anyone.

It made me feel better for a few weeks, then the effect disappeared completely.  Now I'm feeling irritable all the time. 
Other	bettinamarie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/1/2011 1:52:07 PM	Four weeks of absolute hell!!  Was prescribed this for anxiety after being on Lexapro for 2 years &amp; feeling like I was in a coma, doc changed me to wellbutrin 150mg, it did increase my energy 100% but I suffered every side effect except weight loss of course (damn) &amp; seizures, I had a constant headache &amp; neck ache 24-7, tried tylenol &amp; advil neither provided any relief, dizziness 24-7, rapid heart rate, nausea, shakiness, restless leg syndrome at night, inability to fall asleep, diarreah, hair falling out, constant ringing in the ears, all this started right away &amp; continued 24-7 for 4 weeks, then I started hearing voices in my head that weren't mine!!  That was the final straw, I threw it out, think i'd rather just deal with the occasional panic attacks!!  It's fascinating how some people have no side effects &amp; some of us have side effects that are worse than the condition it was prescribed for.  Zoloft was wonderful with no side effects but it stopped working after a year.

Depression	Yeayeayea, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/24/2011 7:21:29 AM	I have been on this medication for almost 7 years and it has helped a lot.  300mg I had no side effects, although I don't remember if I did in the very beginning.  I have recently had my dosage increased during a divorce and I am having insomnia, anxiety, and weight loss. The side effects aren't bad enough I need to decrease my dosage though.  Overall, I think it has worked great.
Depression	13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	13-18	6/22/2011 10:33:03 PM	Was hopeful at first but within 2 weeks I became extremely aggressive and ate everything in sight, overall bad medicine, like all anti-depressants. 
Depression	anno, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	55-64	6/19/2011 7:19:28 PM	I have been taking the generic of Wellburtin which is (Bupropion) and have not experinced any of the side effects that others have mentioned. I was prescribed this as well as other antidepresants for over a year now. I feel much better than before I started taking them. I am under a very large amount of stress most of the time and the MD and my Phych doctor recommend that I stay on 300 mg a day, once in the morning and once at night. I also take 150mg of Venlafaxine HCL er plus 1 mg of Alprozolam. And yes you do lose your sex drive. Which almost all of the antidepressants do. Overall I do benefit from the drug. Also does effect my short term memory. 
Depression	RunForFun, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/19/2011 3:55:00 PM	Have been taking this medication for 10 days and I already feel much better.  Mental clarity, focus and concentration are better.  Feel more hopeful and optimistic.  This has worked the best for me over all, having taken other medications in recent years.  I'll deal with the constipation because it's the worse of the side effects, sometimes hot and cold, and restless feet.  Has helped with smoking cessation.  Getting less satisfaction from smoking.  It works well for me.

Went to my doctor and he now switched me to citalopram/celexa...hope this works better for me, I'm tired of feeling hurt and pain!
Depression	Jim, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	55-64	6/14/2011 9:51:57 AM	I am amazed at the variety of responses to this drug. For those of you who have benefited from it, I am truly happy. Unfortunately, I did not. I have never experienced a med with so many and so intense side effects. The first couple of weeks were actually OK, but once it built up in my system I experienced severe headaches, dizziness, ear ringing, nausea, night sweats, insomnia, and nightmares. The drug also caused my system to violently reject ANY other central nervous system drug I put in my body. Couldn't have a drink, a cup of coffee, or even take an ibuprofen without feeling just awful. So I stopped. That was 2 years ago. Not the end of the story, however. Every 2 months or so I get what I call &quot;flashbacks&quot; where I have episodes of the exact same symptoms that last about 3 days. This stuff tried to take my body over and it still doesn't want to let go. I curse the day I took it.
Depression	afisher86, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	6/10/2011 3:29:44 PM	I felt the difference within the first couple days and let me tell you it was not pleasant! I went from bad to worse, if I wasn't crying then I wanted to kill everyone! My fiance and I never fought, never doubted each other and always loved on each other. After taking this we were fighting constantly, I was accussing him of cheating on me(at least my brain was telling me that, my heart knew better) I didn't want anything to do with him or the kids, work or even the house. I cried when I knew it was time to go home, how pathetic is that!!! All I can say is I hope that if you try this then expect the worse, hope for the best! I will NEVER take this medicine again, even if its the smallest dose known to man!!!

It's only been about two and a half weeks since I started taking my new meds, but even in this short time, I've noticed nothing but positive results. All of my symptoms have effectively vanished. What's more, my overall energy has increased, and I feel a constant sense of calm and well-being, even in the face of some recent hardships. I have high hopes for the next couple of months; I think I may have found my 'miracle' drug! :D

It took me several years to finally see the pattern and the toll it was taking on my husband and children. I spoke with my gynocologist and she recommended Welbutrin. My husband and I have been married for 25 yrs. And this has been the happiest I have been. I no longer get that out of control feeling anymore and I am able to cope with things so much better. It has been wonderful for me.

Depression	andenia,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female		5/31/2011 6:02:09 PM	I felt a little 'off' sort of angry the 1st 2 weeks, then notices my ability to focus (ADHD) on mundane tasks increased DRAMATICALY!. I took 150mg every morning and was doing better with my depression. After 1 1/2 yrs developed heart palpitations ( I have other issues) and had to discontinue, it's now difficult to remained focused. I wish I could still take this med, now Dr and I have to start searching again. Meds work differently for everyone, it is YOUR responsibility to know the side effects and SPEAK UP, make a nuisance of yourself if necessary. Some (not all) feel afraid to question medical decisions, some feel like it's not worth the bother. For your peace of mind, yes it is.

Depression	bjoy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	5/20/2011 8:10:16 AM	Been on Wellbutrin XL for several years with a short period of time when my insurance woudn't pay for the brand name and only Bupropion. That did not work AT ALL. Completely different exprience.After a divorce, losing both parents (within 7 months) and the recent loss of both my dogs, Wellbutrin just doesn't seem to be effective anymore. My doc tried adding different medications along with it, but weird side effects (from the newer additions) have kept me on Wellbutrin. I'm ready for a change as I think this has lost some effectivness.Overall, no real side effects with Wellbutrin XL except for losing a few pounds, but nothing major. Just wish it would have kept on working. Maybe my issues are just too much for it.

Well I read over the side effects: weight loss- I am hungry all the time!! I think I gained 3 pounds and Ive only been on it a week. Constipation- I more regular then I have ever been. Trouble Sleeping- I have the best sleep since I stated taking it.  Now I do have the dry mouth, strange taste in the mouth, but thats all taken care of with a piece of gum.So are these considered uncomfortable, I dont know. I am taking the generic version, so as for the depression, I feel mellow and calm while at work. But when I get home, I feel like I took a energy shot. I dont feel moody any more, and I am spending more time with my kids outside, showing my husband more affection. So far this is the best thing Ive been on.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	4/30/2011 11:16:11 AM	19 yrs, bulimia, bipolar 2. not sure why my doc prescribed this, bcuz i meet a lot of the contraidictions. however overall pleased. Pros: has decreased cravings, allowed me to stop and think before i do impulsive self-destructive behaviors (SBDs), reduced All-or-Nothing (AON)thinking with bingeing, reduces bingeing (best thing ever)also reduced depressive episodes gets rid of hopelessness feeling. OH AND INCREASES SEX DRIVE FROM BASICALLY ZERO TO A LOT.Cons: nausea, shaky hands, dry mouth for a week. Makes me manic a lot more- get angry and very hyper during the episodes. i stopped taking it for this reason for 3 days and became very dpressed. hopelessness, called suicide hotline (never been like this before) altho my life ssucks rite now so that was part of it. went back on it and the mania has lessened. this drug also decreased my alcohol tolerance from low to basically zero- ystrday i got drunk off of half a bottle of beer, felt dizzier than usual. im pretty sure im not supposed to be drinking with all the meds im on (increased seizure risk) but im in college so thats not going to happen, you should probably talk to your doc about this.overall i like this drug i have been trying to get it for years bcuz of the weightloss potential. im taking 2 other psychotropic meds so that may affect results.

Depression	Madelyn, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/5/2011 9:49:00 PM	I had a serious problem with the generic wellbutrin- after a month of increasingly uncomfortable symptoms, I realized they had started with the generic. I could not get a good breath in- it was tight and no matter how hard I tried, it would take 5 or 6 deep breaths/yawns before I got one breath, then the process would start over. I had chest pain/tightness and an incredibly fast heartbeat. I exercise regularly and am only 24, so this was unusual. I ended up in the ER because my chest hurt so bad I worried I was damaging my heart. They couldn't find anything and wouldn't believe my generic accusation, until a social worker called a psychiatrist who confirmed my symptoms as a common side effect from this generic. I took Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression 8 years ago, and I was fine. I know my body has changed, but I believe this generic may be dangerous for some. With coupons, my co-pay will be $230... so now I will be either fighting or beginning again the struggle to find an adequate medication.
Depression	Guinea pig, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	4/4/2011 12:21:08 PM	As a professional Guinea pig, Wellbutrin was but one of the anti-depressive drugs prescribed to me.  My doctor thought perhaps it would help with my obsessive/compulsive behavior.  It did not do anything for that.  I guess it helped with depression somewhat.  The problem arose when I noticed any time I'd lie down, whatever thought was in my head would vaporize.  Trying to remember exactly what I'd been thinking would not get it back to save my soul.  Sometimes, I would write down my thoughts, then lie down just to see if they'd go poof (they would)---at least I could read about what was on my mind just minutes before.  However, even reading the subject would not return the thoughts themselves.  When I brought this up to my doctor, he said, &quot;Uh-oh.&quot;  Apparently, I was suffering seizures on Wellbutrin, which caused my mind to reset to 0.  I was immediately taken off this drug and another was tried--and another--whichever had the best sales pitch.  I ultimately did find an extended-release antidepressant that works perfectly for my particular needs.  
Depression	trmages, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/1/2011 1:17:05 PM	I atarted with Prozac after my second child and I developed post partum depression. I didn't want to start taking any medication but I was getting so scared of just life. I took that for almost 2 years with very little results. I was back to feeling anxious all the time so my doctor switch me to Wellbutrin and I feel great. I actually want to participate in events now and I finally got the motivation to start losing weight. I have lost 60 pounds since I started taking Wellbutrin. I thank my doctor everytime I see him.

I have been on an SSRI for about 20 years.  I am experiencing some acheyness in my gums.  My dentist doesn't see any damage from clenching my teeth.  I might be clenching my jaw...It just seems strange to me never having this symptom before, but now I do. Has anyone else experienced this?  I stopped the bupropionXL because I thought that may be causing it, but even after months the feeling persisted.

Depression	needing sanity, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	3/18/2011 2:23:56 PM	I took Wellbutrin XL for a couple years. It took a very long time to find the right drug I needed. I had a baby and stopped the drug. I am currently on the generic, Bupron XL ER. I'm not feeling the same benefits that I had before. I think there must be different types of Wellbutrin, though I've been told they're all the same. I wish someone could tell me why they seem different. If theres a difference, I need to know so I can talk with my doctor and be back to the drug I need.

I was not at all better but at the time I figured it was somehow working since I was ignorant of any other options. However, I did start taking it when there were few options, i.e., mid-90s.
Depression	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	4	5	2	Female	65-74	3/9/2011 11:35:59 AM	when I first began taking Wellbutrin several years ago it was very efffective but now it seems my system has become tolerant and it is not noticeably helping me. Anyone else have this problem? 
Other	Donuts2, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/5/2011 2:00:45 PM	I was diagnosed with dysthymia &amp; ADHD. Both issues have become worse as I head into menopause (very common so I'm told). I started with the generic version. After experiencing strange side effects (happy one minute, suicidal thoughts the next...and I'm NOT exaggerating), I switched to the name brand. Let me also state that I have never felt suicidal in my entire life! How scary that a generic med could make me feel that way. It is NOT the same as the name brand and I pay a hefty co-pay every month to have the &quot;name brand&quot; prescription filled. In any case, it is helping me with the mild depression/ADHD. And as a side note, I have develop tinnitus from the medication (not really noticeable until I'm ready to fall asleep).

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	3/2/2011 3:43:33 PM	I just started taking this drug today, and after reading the reviews I am concerned about the generic version I was given (Bupropion XL, I think). According to one article, it's the patented membrane that allows for extended release that seems to be the problem. Apparently some generics don't use the same XR method, which can lead to a huge release of the active ingredient followed by little to no release. Wellbutrin has a membrane-like wall that allows a constant release, but many generics use pills that just dissolve slowly. Other bodily functions can speed up or slow down the release (i.e., amount of food in stomach). Just thought this was interesting so I'm passing it along and will also ask my doctor about it.  http://www.prevention.com/health/health/healthy-l iving/find-out-how-to-use-generic-drugs-safely/ar ticle/ca929d93636d6110VgnVCM10000013281eac____

Ceased suicidal thoughts, gave me a functional attention span, gives me the energy to complete activities, and decreases appetite.As others have stated, if I stop taking the pill for a few days, I find myself moody, listless, and starving.NEVER take generics of this pill without speaking to your doctor. Google &quot;Teva Suicide&quot; and see why it should be avoided at all costs; it literally almost cost me my life.

Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	13-18	2/15/2011 11:55:54 AM	I'm a 17 year old female and suffer from axiety and depression. I've always been lucky in life and have had a great family and basically everything a child could ask for. Although, I've had some tramatic experences in my childhood my parents where in the process of getting a divorce, my father committed sucide when i was nine, and i had to move 3 years later due to expensive living in New York. After i moved  to the south it was a major culture shock and sunk into a depression. I was always a bigger taller girl which affected my self esteem, when i was 13 i weighted around 135 lbs and was 5'4. Over two years i gained 60 lbs and 3 cup sizes and am now 5'7, thankfully i still had a shaply hourglass proportion. Finally when i was around 195 lbs. i was severly depressed and though &quot;how did this happen&quot; and &quot;why did i let myself go&quot; Everyone said you look fine your a beautiful girl. Thankfully not to toot my own horne, but i am an attractive girl and look very mature for my age but that didn't matter i felt horrible. In 09 my doctor prescribed me Prozac 20 mg and i didn't like the though of being on medicine so i didn't take it reguarly  which is bad. It made my tired and it just did not work. My doctor was a prozac pusher lol. To make a long story short in October 2010 i wanted another advise and saw another doctor and he put me on WELLBUTRIN XL 150 Mg later uped me to 300mg. I though wow thats so much medicine compared to 20mg but he explained to me how it works differently and it has different mg and 150 isn't so much. 4 Months later now Feb 2011 i feel great and have lost 45 lbs in 3 months. The medicine isn't  a miracle drug or a weight loss drug. It just helps you feel like yourself, actually i felt like i wasn't on meds. It helps motivate you to help yourself and get back on track and boosts energy. It severly decressed my hunger which was a super plus and motivated me to start working out. 4 months later with watching what i eat (even over the winter holidays) an

Not only did it only make me almost pass out every time I stood up, it also lead to a, thankfully, unsucsessful attempted suicide attempt. In my personal opinion, if your doctor recomends this medication run for your life.

I have to work on limiting my caffeine intake.Drink plenty of water each day, also if you can eat a well balance breakfast high in fiber such as oat bran cereals or grab a smoothie on the go. Smoking thats another issue Yes to me it stops the cravings as you taper down in the progress to quit.

Depression	lovinglife2011, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	1/28/2011 2:03:48 PM	Wellbutrin 300 MG, second day of taking this med. already feel a change in my personality im always happy loving my family more. before i couldnt even look at myself in the mirror. b/c i am over weight. but now i see i CAN lose weight and i can excersize. i actually feel like doing stuff. which i NEVER did before taking this med. i hope it does help me lose weight, which now i dont have that craving to eat all the time. which is a big plus for me.. the only downside of this med is the side effects it has given me which isnt bad at all.. headaches every now and then.. change in my vision, things seem closer and brighter to me. bad taste in mouth which comes and goes.. over all.. like i said has put me in a better mood and i dont think about negative thoughts or i dont feel like crying all the time. It does give me a little bit of energy. Everyone is different and might have different side effects. but i love the way this drug has made me feel. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	19-24	1/24/2011 10:16:48 PM	I've been on this drug for almost 1 1/3 years and I haven't seen much of a change. I'm still lounging around, not wanting to do anything, not wanting to see anyone, crying most of the time. This drug is a waste. Yeah it helped in the first few months, but then it stopped so they bumped me up to 300mg, which helped, then stopped, and now i'm up to 450, which made me have tons of side effects, so they dropped me down to 300mg. It's such a waste of a drug to take, and a waste of my money, i wouldn't even think of recommending it to anyone.

Depression	DonnaD, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/22/2011 12:05:52 PM	I had depression because of several difficult events taking place in my life, in my job, illness in the family, etc., crying occasionally, feelings of hopelessness, like I didn't want to go on with the events and was angry at the world for what I was going through. That's all changed now. I am very happy with the effects. I started at 150 mg for about 2 weeks and didn't feel much... then started on 300 mg once a day and voila, I felt a strong difference in my mood, no more nagging negative thoughts, increased ability to not only handle the stress, but become a strong leader in my family and help others develop a more positive attitude and perspective. I recommend this drug, but like everyone else says, hopefully not as a permanent way to deal with life. Once some of the challenges I am going through have been resolved, I plan to slowly taper off of this drug altogether. It is the ONLY drug that I take.

Basically it causes sexual side effects and fatigue and does little else for my mental or emotional state. A fairly safe drug side effect wise I guess but I am still massively depressed. ANyone know of a drug to stop the ANTS and NOT cause weight gain? Been on this drug for about 3 years. Not really loving it. Oh, if you take it in the morning it DOES cause sleepiness and shakes for a couple hours.

For the first three days I felt like I was on a wonderful, happy high. Everything started seeming surreal and I developed these uncontrollable muscle twitches all over my body. They wouldn't go away and I had to go to urgent care. I thought I was going to have a full blown seizure or something which I've never had problems with before. It's been years since I've been on this drug and I still have muscle issues that are there permenantly. I HATE THIS DRUG! The doctors don't even know why my body reacted like that to the drug or what to do for my muscle twitching/damage.

If I was taking Wellbutrin on alone, it would not be effective in reducing my depression.  In my case, I see Wellbutrin as an enhancer, or an enhancee.

I used this one and I was able to do the things that I needed.  I need it to focus and stay on task.  It also gives me a bit of energy.  It does come with its side effects just like the rest and you will have to determine is it worth it in the end for you.  In my case the benefits out weigh the effects.  I have dry mouth and headaches and some tension at times, but most of the time I am mellow.  This is very important to me as I hate high strung people even my self when I can't control my racing thoughts and brain fog.  It is a great drug in my opinion.

I began this medication after several years of successfully taking Prozac. My doctor switched me to wellbutrin because I was starting to feel like my old depressed self. He started me at 150 mg a day for 7 days then going up to 300 mg a day and going off Prozac. Wellbutrin was amazing for me. I had energy, i wanted to do stuff again and most of all i wasn't sleeping all the time.If it wasn't for the hives, this would have been the depression medication for me.

Found it to be easy on my system (little side effects presented), and effective, particularly for quitting smoking. Had a hard time coming off of it, as is the case with most anti-depressants, would recommend a real plan with your doctor on how to deal with this possibility.

I've been very satisfied with the results. My mood has improved and I feel like I have a lot more energy. Prior to starting the medication, I was having trouble getting motivated to do just about everything, and I've found that it's been a lot easier to get myself to do things (e.g. washing the dishes) than it was before. As far as side effects, I experienced some insomnia for the first few days, but that was completely gone within a week. I didn't experience any other adverse side effects.

I take 150mg. Works well. I had no symptoms of PMS other than a headache which is normal. I have become more energetic, think clearer, and focused. I have also lost 5lbs so far. Side effects experienced are - dry mouth, dry lips, trouble sleeping (I can stay awake like I'm a teen again)some constipation at first, and I had one dizzy spell that lasted about 3 secs. I possibly had a headache or two. I suffer from migraines also. I do eat less since I am focused, I'm not constantly reaching for food. I am in school and can actually read a chapter and remember what I read. I still over react some but have only been on the drug 4 weeks. I don't dwell on things like that anymore. Once they happen, it quickly goes away. I love this drug so far. My pharmacy tried to make me take the generic. I gave it back and asked for the Brand. I have to pay more, but read horror stories about the generic version. Incidently, my pharmacy covers this drug as non formulary but the SR version is formulary. I'm working on that too.

While I think it worked to improve my depression, it caused me to have severe episodes of dizziness and weakness upon standing--orthostatic hypotension?--to the degree that I would sometimes literally slide down a wall to the floor, helpless. I never stood without something to grasp until the symptoms passed, and sometimes I fell anyway. The symptoms stopped when I stopped taking Wellbutrin.

FYI don't stop talking it even for a couple days, i did and felt the worst i've ever felt in awhile.

I can only take Wellbutrin (purple pill.)  I also take lower then the recommended dosage for SAD and I probably couldn't function without it for several months of the year.

I tried to ween off a couple mo.s ago and my mood was fine but I was experiencing very low blood pressure, disorientatation,and dizzy spells that lasted for hours. I cannot say that this was directly related to withdrawal. My Dr. could not find any reason for these symptons. I went back on my meds after that, because of personal problems as well, and they seem to work better now, I think I was getting used to the dosage... overall it seems to work well, I do still get irritable which could be beause I don't take my 1st dose right away when I wake up, and I forget or have to skip my second dose because it is too late in the day to take it..

It made me suicidal and cried uncontrollably for no reason what so ever, made my skin crawl and overall the worst thing ever! Please if you are considering taking this med. make sure you go thru every  possible problem with your doctor and make sure your dr is available for help if you run into problems!

I am in love. I actually take the generic form. My doctor prescribed this after I told her Lexapro wasn't working as well as it had in the past. I am currently on 4 different meds for other problems and I take ALL them at night because all of the says &quot;may cause drowiness&quot; and I don't want to risk my life or my families. I forgot to take it for several days a while back and I all I could do is cry. My friends asked me why was I crying and I all I could say was I don't know. Now the joke is &quot;I'm allright as long as I am on my meds&quot;, but the reality is it is true. I am on a level playing field and I feel incontrol of my life which I haven't felt as long as I can remeber.

Depression	medwisegirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/21/2010 8:29:38 PM	Wellbutrin has been great for me. All I wanted to do before taking this was sleep, and when I was up I was grouchy and irritated. I actually like getting up in the morning and enjoy my day. Everyone around me is much happier as well. I tried Cymbalta first and it didn't fit my specific needs, and in fact worsened my depression. There are different medicines for different types of depression. Wellbutrin works on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is for motivation and acivating the reward center in the brain. I wouldn't discourage or encourage the use of this drug. It's your doctors job, depending on your depression symptoms, to match you with the best medicine for you. You need not listen to people that say not to try it, everyone is different. This medicine may or may not work for you. Treating depression is not an exact science, due to our lack of knowledge about the brain. Finding the right depression medicine will take trial and error, which can be very frustrating. Stick with it and you will find a medicine that works for you.

I occasionally suffer with depression but nothing at all like it was before I started taking this medicaton.  So I guess its working!  I hate the idea that it has made my appetite increase and therefore gain weight.

I assume it is working but I dont know what I would be like without it. I take it everyday and if a day is missed the effects arent bad. This is supplemented with Abilify and seems to cover the major neurotransmitters effecting mood. There has been no weight gain.

I think when I go back next month I'm going to ask for cymbalta again. I am lethargic and generally depressed. I'm tired of feeling this way.

The initial euphoric/hyper feelings dissipate quickly but are still enjoyable for the first few days.  Bad thoughts and anxiety tend to pass much more quickly.  Bad moods and sadness are not nearly as &quot;low&quot; as they were before.  It makes it much more easy to combat problems instead of dwelling on them.  Improved sleep seems to be a result of the other effects.Cons:Constipation is sometimes a problem, but this can be dealt with through proper diet.I also get more thirsty throughout the day.Neutral:Really reduces hunger pangs and overall appetite.  This has been very helpful for losing the weight put on while depressed.  It may not be good for those who are already lean.

Stop Smoking	catlover959, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	9/24/2010 2:22:21 PM	I has a life threatining illness last yr. and was hospitalized several times. One stay was 28 days. I'm a heavy smoker and was given patches in the hosp. The pharmacy was later delivering medication, ie... my patches to the hospital floor one evening. I have never felt such hatred, meanness, urge to actually kill. Not taking wellbutrin but going to start next week. My point is this: I was not just irritable, I was furious, until they got my patch on and all that went away. Maybe what you are calling side effects from the meds are actually withdrawl from the nicotine. I was astounded that I could feel such rage. But as I said, after patch got in to my system all the went away. I see there are two different kinds of wellb. one is ss and one is xl. Could someone tell me the difference. Also I was treated with many drugs, one being cumadin, the blood thinner, for a blood clot that in my leg that had went to my lung six times. I began to notice that when the generic was used, actuallly with all the drugs I had to take, I noticced that the generic drugs were a joke. My doc told me that drug co. have a 10% leway on what they put in meds. That is awful. Generics DO NOT work for me. and i can't afford the name brand. Has anyone else noticed this? and is there any way we can make a complaint to some organization.I did not mean to mislead about being on the medication, but I will be on it this time next week.

Other	DontHaveOne, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	13-18	9/23/2010 12:33:06 PM	My 16 yr old son has been having problems in school for 2 yrs:Poor grades due to not doing homework, also seemed have low self esteem and some mild depression (caused by above?). Hanging out with a &quot;bad&quot; crowd and some drug abuse. He's been in behavioral therapy for 2 years - I finally said, ok, nothing I am doing is working (therapy, life coach skills, summer school).  I was looking into wilderness camp for him too. But, I did not want to put my son on drugs for poor grades.  I did not want him on amphetamine drugs - adamantly. He has been on Wellbutrin 150mg 1x/day for a month.  The change was almost immediate. He wanted to cut his hair shorter - which gave him a real boost when the kids (girls) noticed.  He has gone from a F/D/C student to an A student (it's only the 3rd week of school - so we'll see).  Teachers he has (again) have noticed the change and love it.  He is my son again.   He still has the dumb friends, he still  is smoking uknowwhat I am sure - but it does not seem to be his all emcompassing thought.  He wants to go to the Jr Dance, he is exercising and taking pride in his appearance, he is talking to other kids too at school and noticing the difference in kids.   I am thankful I tried this medicine.  Even though the change is seems drastic - it feels &quot;normal&quot; to him, not like he is BAM someone new - just an improved version of him.  My only thought is that after only being on this for one month his Doctor wanted to increase him from 150 to 300mg - I don't understand that - why kick it up (soo much after only a month) when it's fine?  So, I said we'll try the 200mg - which is not timed release - lasts 8 hrs and if my son does not like it - we will go back to 150mg time release.  I guess the 300mg is timed release - but why drink Mountain Dew when a glass of water is really all you need?

Now I take 300mg in the morning and I find that I have so much more energy and my depression is improved greatly! On the other hand, I feel more anxious than I have before, but it has never been a problem for me.I don't have dry mouth w/ this like I did w/ Lexapro, but I do have a constant tremor and extremely decreased alcohol tolerance and those are the only side effects.

He is back in school and doing well, playing sports, and making friends.  I think for our son it has worked great.

This has worked for me.  Lexapro had been good at keeping panic attacks at bay; Wellbutrin is slightly less successful with this, but the libido tradeoff has been worth being on Wellbutrin.

To my surprise, I ended up being worse on it than on nothing at all.  I became meaner, more emotional, and an overall B***h!!  Proof again that what's the perfect drug for one person can be horrible for another.

Depression	singingmama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/9/2010 12:02:20 AM	After suffering from PTSD from my husband committing suicide, then a few months later being gang raped and beaten , I understandably was severely depressed. I kept thinking of ways to kill myself, my son, and my unborn child. It was crazy, I couldn't go anywhere or function at all. So my doctor put me on this and after a few months added Celexa and it worked miracles. I was able to go back to college to finish my degree and both of my sons have a mother who is totally functional. The only side effect I noticed was appetite suppressant and since I am very overweight I think it's a great one to have! I no longer binge everynight!

Depression	nkh, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/27/2010 3:12:18 PM	I started taking Wellbutrin XR several years ago and have now switched to Bupropion HCL XR (generic) 300mg. It works great. The pharmacist has several manufacturers he can go to for the one that works better for the patient so I would try different generics until I found a suitable one. I also take 225 mg. of Effexor XR along with the Wellbutrin and Buspirone (generic Buspar). I recently switched my Effexor to generic and it is working great. I guess because I have been on them so long, I do not have any adverse effects.My doctor is switching my Buspar to Xanax because the Buspar has affected my vision and I am experiencing involuntary muscle contractions and jerking movements. I tried Cymbalta once before and I felt suicidal so back to the Wellbutrin for me.

So far, I haven't noticed any bad side effects.  I can tell that I have more energy during the day, which is very nice!  I have always battled having zero energy throughout the day.  I've been taking 20 mg of Lexapro for 2 years now for anxiety and it helped wonderfully.  But after my Grandmother passed away a little over a month ago, my anxiety attacks were getting the better of me..I made an appointment with my doctor and that's when she wrote me a script for Wellbutrin.  I think it's way too soon to know if it's going to work for me, but I am hopeful!  I am taking the generic, which is nice because it only costs me $4 per month.

Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	7/17/2010 8:16:54 AM	I have been very lucky with this medication.  Prescribed to quit smoking, it has been successful.  The first 3-4 days caused side effects (mood swings,and my lips felt like I ate a whole bag of potatoe chips immediately after taking the pill.)  Once I started taking it two times a day (day 4)side effects seemed to diminish.  I do crave a cigarette from time to time but immediately it dissipates and I have gained weight.  I was hoping to stay slim.  I would recommend and suggest to continue for 2 weeks as long as the effects are non-damaging and non-suicidal.

I was first given another anti-depressent that made me feel like a fence post.(Effexor?)  Switched to Wellbutrin and what a wonderful difference!!  I did not realize that I was really Adult ADD.  Suddenly I COULD finish projects, could clean my house with some order, COULD organize my files,  I felt so much more control. This was noticed on my job and at home.  The biggest improvement, as an artist, is that my skills and concentration have vastly improved.  At present I am taking college art courses and can paint and draw so well!!  I hope I don't ever have to give this medication up for any reason!!

I have been on this for about a year progressing to the current dosage that I am on. I think this medication has significantly helped me feel motivated and helped me to see my life more with the glass half full :) I know that it is working because when I ran out of my meds a couple months ago my boyfriend asked me why I was being so snippy with him and instigating problems between us. In a later conversation I mentioned I hadn't been taking my meds for a few days and he told me that he indeed could tell a huge difference in me. Thats all the confirmation of success that i need! :)

Other	daienu, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/26/2010 9:40:46 AM	After 4 years of fatigue, a complete physical breakdown, and a range of mysterious illnesses I was misdiagnosed with depression and an eating disorder. I was prescribed first Zoloft, then to fight the fatigue caused by it, Wellbutrin XL. As soon as I started taking WB I began to feel more energized, awake at 5.30 am, just like another reviewer, more alive. This was during the winter months. At this time I was also taking a small amount of Zoloft, that was upped a little while later to 200 mg's, at which point I began to feel worse. Than my wellbutrin was upped to 300 mg's,and I began to feel better again. I then ran our of Zoloft completely, and my medication provider failed to reorder it for me, so I remained without it for nearly five weeks. They were wonderful weeks. While the first few days I felt dizzy, I did not feel more emotional or irrational in any way. my doctor, however, insisted I go back on it when it arrived. Sadly. Getting back on that was a rough road. Only two years later, when I was diagnosed with lupus, could I stop. Wellbutrin has been amazing. Yes, it comes with some photosensitive side effects, not so fun for lupus patients, but the good outweighs the bad. Long term, i agree, the effects seem to fade a little. I don't like being without it. It helps another friend with Irritable bowel syndrome, it helped me lose a few pounds. Neither the generic, nor the 150 mg format is a good substitute for the extended release (XL). It has been great and I highly recommend it if you must be on antidepressants.

I have taken all the drugs and Wellbutron is the only one that helps. I take 450mg in the morning and 20mg Celexa at night. The combination is most important.Wellbutron is no longer covered by my insurance. The costs increases every month. My last 3 month script was $800. The generic does not work for me. I have tried for financial assistance. No help. I am less likely to take all my meds when I worry how I will pay for it. 
Depression	Jo, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	6/23/2010 9:54:59 PM	I just started one week ago with a generic brand of Wellbutrin SR 100 mg. I had severe stomach ache for 3 days, headache and joint aches.  I realize I was taking med. in the morning without food. Now I take it after eating first and I have no stomach ache &amp; my headache did go away after the 3rd day.  I feel dizzy at times, extremely dry mouth and constipation.  I been feeling more energy and waking up not tired.  I was crying easily for no apparent reason &amp; sleeping many hours through the day for weeks after moving and seeking employement.  Some of the things I started is: exercising along with eating healthier.  I am sleeping evening 6-8 hours and I'm able to get thru the day feeling better about myself and others.  I am going to increase my dosage tomorrow to 200mg/day. Doctor suggested 1 pill in AM and 1 pill at Noon.  No later in the day otherwise I will not be able to go to sleep.  I am feeling positive about the results so far.

Depression	abirata, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/15/2010 11:54:53 AM	Wellbutrin had side effects at the beginning - the worst of which were insomnia and constipation. The insomnia abated after about 3 weeks of treatment and I take a fiber supplement to deal with the constipation. It also abates with time but never completely goes away. Another side effect at firt was a general &quot;hyper&quot; feeling but that also wore off after a few weeks. Unlike the SSRIs, Wellbutrin does not make me feel &quot;drugged - I feel emotions, good and bad - but the difference I notice while taking the drug is that I tend not to brood or obsess over negative events or ideas, it is easier to let them pass. I think it has also made me more able to open up to talking about my situation because I dont think I have to reign in my bad emotions so tightly as I dont fear them getting out of control. It is easier to work through them, and talk about them. Wellbutrin by itself is a great help, but by far the most effective treatment for me has been talk therapy. Depression runs in the family. I did not start seeking treatment until age 27 when it became overwhelming  and was affecting my work and relationships. The first course of treatment my physician prescribed were SSRIs (Paxil, Prozac and Zoloft), but I could not tolerate the side effects nausea and drowsiness, but the worst, that although my depression was dampened, so were all my emotions. These side effects never abated. I became even more distant from people I loved and could not function effectively at work because it was difficult to concentrate. I had great doubts about all of the anti-depressants after those experiences, and am skeptical of drug claims and the pharmaceutical industry in general but have to admit that Wellbutrin has been very effective. I know that SSRIs are very effective for many  people - I just wanted to share that portion of my experience because I believed that because they did not work for me, nothing would. I am glad to be proven wrong.

The only side effect I did experience was being very irritable. That side effect did seem to fade out after my first week. you do have to be careful taking this alone without a downer if you have bipolar, because it can make you very manic... manic feels good, but usually the results hurt you in the end...

It worked for a few years, but still had anxiety &amp; panic, my doc added lexapro 10 mg, that was too much, now I take 1/4 of 1 pill.Nothing has changed still highs,low lows &amp; anxiety. Today I go back to doc, now they think I'm bipolar ( i can see that ), so the fear is great w/ the trial &amp; error w/ new med's. I must say I did have a few pretty good years

The short period I am not haveing all of my symptoms I fell pretty normal. However this is a short period of time. I think couseling or psychiatric help is key, my symptoms lessen if I go to my regular weekly visits.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	6/3/2010 8:49:41 PM	I have been taking Welbutrin 150mg for 11 days now. I really like the fact that I don't feel like I need to sleep all the time which I did when I was on Celexa. I also like the way it helps boost my mood and has definitely helped with my sex drive that had been non-existent with Celexa. However, I am waiting for some of the side effects to wear off. My doctor said to give it a few more weeks before I decide if I like it or not. From day two I have been dizzy. It is better now than it was, but still feeling it. I also have been very nauseas and I have had a mild headache, kinda feels like a sinus headache. I also have had hot flashes and night sweats and my ADHD is actually worse. I find that odd since this drug can also be taken for ADHD. If the side effects fade I am all for this medicine, but if they don't there is no way I can keep taking it. I have also had some trouble sleeping, but as long as I take at least half of my dose of Neuratin and Buspar a few hours before bed I am fine. If I forget to take it early I can't take it at all because I need 12 hours before getting up to get those two out of my system or I can't find it hard to wake up on time. I'm gonna give it one more week and if the side effects don't fade it is back to the doc for our next trial and error run.

Depression	helpless, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	5/27/2010 2:06:54 PM	Initially it gave me more energy and I did not feel the need to sleep all of the time.After taking it for three years I have started to feel anxious and panicy after taking it in the morning. I went to a new doctor yesterday and he suggested cutting down on the dosage.  Hopefully this will help.  I am experiencing a new episode of depression.
Stop Smoking	JustSayNO, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	5/26/2010 8:46:58 PM	I use to take Wellbutrin many years ago for depression. This was before they came out with the SR and XL. You had to take it using a starter kit that had a certain dosage for each day. Side effects were minimal for me except for severe upset stomach for the initial 2 to 3 weeks. It eventually subsided. My doctor said that side effect is rare. Well NOT 4 me. My doctor wrote me a prescription for XL 300 the other day to help me stop smoking. Im assuming the extended release formula replaces the need for the gradual starter kit. I sure hope so otherwise taking 300mg from the get go may be intolerable for my digestive system. It worked pretty well for my depression but what I remember most was the effect it had on reducing my smoking. Cigs tasted like sucking on molded burnt logs. I quit the medication because at that time I really wanted to enjoy my cigarettes again. Idiot I know. Not this time though. Those old molded burnt logs are going to be thrown out never to return. I suggest this medicine for smoking cessation over that new Cymbalta stuff. It has the same indications at about a tenth of the price. Cimbalta is just ripping people off. I really doubt it affects the brain much differently than does Wellbutrin. Especially when only taken for a short period. Wellbutrin is indicated for smoking cessation. If it was harmful to people who are not depressed I doubt that this purpose would be listed as one of the uses. If I could afford the Cimbalta I'd try it instead just to see how it compares for me versus Wellbutrin in altering the taste of cigarettes. My guess is Cymbalta does not work as well as Wellbutrin for this purpose. It was marketed differently probably due to the stigma some have for taking anti-depressants. It will interesting to see what the effects,if any,while taking when not depressed. It may have the effects of ecstacy...lol doubtful but it would make for quite an experience. Probably would not curb my craving for a cigarette. Will post results later 
Depression	JenS., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/26/2010 1:47:33 AM	Wellbutrin was a life saver for me. I was diagnosed with Major Depression 5 years ago and initially was prescribed Celexa. I felt a little better but still had no concentration or energy. My psychiatrist added Wellbutrin XL and it turned out to be the answer I needed. I would not have survived my depression without the addition of Wellbutrin to my celexa (300mg Wellbutrin and 40 mg Celexa). I know some people have shared negative side effects of this drug but you will not know unless you try it. It worked well for me but it is not for everyone. If you have depression please do not give up on finding the right medication for you. It just takes some time. I have been on meds and in individual therapy and it has been successful  in treating my depression. I am now to the point where I am titrating my Wellbutrin so that I can be med free and start a family. Thank you Wellbutrin for giving me my life back! 
Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	5/22/2010 6:54:36 AM	i took wellbutrin for two years. not only did it make my dpression MUCH worse, but it made me numb. like my skin was always numb. i couldnt feel phisical pain. it was INSANE. also it upset my stomach to the point that i couldnt eat or drink ANYTHING unless i skipped my meds.this is probably the single WORST drug to ever be invented. i urge you before trying this drug to examine every other possible option with your doctor. everyone i have ever met who has taken this has had severe problems with it.
Depression	Disappointed, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	5/20/2010 10:59:39 PM	I had been on Effexor for many years and I grew to hate it for the side effects and the withdrawal symptoms. Switched to Wellbutrin 300 mg 8 weeks ago--horrible. I am &quot;okay&quot; in the morning, but crash by 10 p.m. I had such high hopes for it--cheaper, less risky, fewer side effects--but it just is not working for me. I see the doc tomorrow and wil try something else. I do want to day I had the insomnia for about a week, the a rash for about 3 days, but th eside effects have pretty much disappeared, so if that is a concern for you, try to tough it out. If the med works, hang on until you get through the side effects.
Depression	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1		19-24	5/20/2010 4:46:27 PM	I was put on this in combination with Prozac to attempt to regain my sex drive. I experienced ringing in my ears, increased anxiety, upset stomach (to the point where I could barely eat one meal per day), and no effect on my libido.
Depression	Tell Mel---, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/17/2010 4:22:15 PM	I've taken this medication for many years and it DOES work best if used in conjunction with another anti-depressant (I also take Effexor) both prescribed by my psychiatrist.  Patients should be advised it usually takes several weeks before you begin to feel the full results but even after about the first week or two, you begin to feel better.

Bipolar Depression	sarahkatara, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	5/13/2010 5:22:37 PM	Wellbutrin has been an amazing treatment for my depression. i saw a change in my mood within one to two weeks after starting it. i feel i really need to note that before taking brand-name Wellbutrin, i was on the generic for, Bupropion. I had horrible side effects including worsening depression, extreme sadness, constant crying, etc...it was a very bad time. as soon as i made the switch, it was like night and day. if bupropion doesn't work for you, don't write off wellbutrin. discuss taking the brand-name only with your doctor and see if it helps. Wellbutrin is very expensive though so i order a three month supply from CanadaDrugs and it saves me about $1500.

I noticed that if I forget to take it after a three days I AM A MOODY B*** and snap at the least little things, but once I start takin it again I feel great.  Beside the sexual thing I love it and if I get moody people will ask me &quot;Did you take your happy pill today&quot; which will remind me.  I am only 30 and did not think I would ever need something this strong because I was on lexapro for YEARS and then even after they increased the dose to the Lexapro it stopped working.  This works GREAT, just wish I knew how to get my sex drive back.

It helps me cope.

Depression	Great Mom , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/6/2010 2:50:27 PM	I started taking this Welbutrin 2 months ago. At 30 years of age, I never in my wildest dreams thought I would need such a medication.  But after starting a family, work and daily activities, I found myself overwhelmed and it was difficult to deal with people and situations. It was enough for me to consult with a doctor and see what was out there to help. My symptoms in plain english included, not wanting to be around friends or functions that normally I would attend, loss of interest at work, easily distracted by anything, sleepless nights, picking at my husband over every little thing (which was causing problems.  But since I've been taking this medicine my relationships with people overall have improved dramatically, I have more energy and I am less of an emotional eater.  I could go on and on.  I love this medication and I'm a happier person!

Depression	Ellie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	5/3/2010 8:42:39 AM	I started taking Wellbutrin XL a little over a week ago. It started with severe headaches, fuzzy thoughts and just the general feeling of being uncomfortable. Last Thursday I started taking it twice a day and have been in bed for the last three days with such severe muscle aches and off and on temperature with ringing in one ear.  I even had to pull over when driving home from work on Friday because I kept feeling &quot;blackness&quot;.  I am also a runner and since starting this medication, my legs have felt heavy and sore to the bone, not even able to finish a short training session.  I have not taken any more of the medication since this happened and am going to the doctor this morning!  I am sure that she will say it is a virus, but I know that is definitely was the Wellbutrin because the side effects were immediate. Has anyone else had these side effects?

Interested in life, have energy, zero weight gain (all the other antidepressants made me fat &amp; lazy) &amp; no negative libido side effects.  I think it's great -- but i know different stuff works for different folks.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/25/2010 2:49:19 PM	I started taking Wellbutrin to help ease my seasonal depression &amp; my DR said it would also help with the symptoms of my ADHD.  I took this drug when I was 20 turning 21, I quit taking the drug b/c I had bad side-effects (I figured out the only time I had those side-effects was when I was drinking alcohol) recently I realized I had a serious alcohol-abuse problem, I joined the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous and I have been sober for 5 months. When working with my Psychiatrist in an attempt to control my ADHD (he wanted to work in my Alcohol Abuse) I asked him if I could try Wellbutrin again.  I have only been taking it this go around, for less than a week, I take Wellbutrin in addition to Trazadone (for sleep) Lexapro (my opinion the BEST anti-depressant) Adderall (for ADHD), one of the 'benefits' I am receiving from Wellbutrin is the cessation my my nicotine cravings! The other 'benefits' I am experiencing: more 'real' energy (not too much) I am able to get through the day without PRAYING I can go to bed when I get home at 6pm, also I can THINK much more clearly, I have patience now (I didn't realize I wasn't very patient before), I have a reasonable appetite during the day (Adderall suppresses appetite) I am calm and I cry a lot less than before :)I hope this helped: Charlene age 25    
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	19-24	4/25/2010 1:41:39 AM	I started taking Wellbutrin about three weeks ago. After the 2nd week, I started having trouble sleeping. By the end of last week I started having a strange feeling like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. I went to my doctor, who informed me that I was experiencing heart palpitations. The last day I took the medication (3 days ago) I experienced a panic attack while at work, and have since experienced 2 more panic attacks, each with worsening symptoms. Today is the 2nd day without medication and I am still having the palpitations... Although Wellbutrin helped with my mood, I would taking being depressed any day over the side-effects I have experienced.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	4/23/2010 11:28:51 PM	I'm a stay at home mom...have 2 girls and am being treated for mild depression and PMDD. I'm not sure about this drug yet. I was taking 150 mg SR twice a day for 2 months and really felt not difference.  Previously I was taking prozac for about 4 months which helped my mood but left me feeling so tired and lethargic; therefore I switched.  Now I'm taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg (for one week)  and still have only felt little relief.  The worst side effect for me is abdominal pain.  Day 2 of taking the new dose I started feeling bad stomach pain.  Still has not got better but I'm trying to wait it out to see if it will help my mood.
Depression	ThereIsASolution, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/23/2010 8:09:54 PM	I was on SRI's for 13 years, and was exhausted all the time, barely functioning, even though the dark depression was gone. I slowly switched from Effexor to Wellbutrin, I take 400mg in the morning now, then added Xanax .25 at night for anxiety. The effect was startling - in a few days, I hate much more energy and motivation. I used to have to take naps at work at lunchtime because I felt like I was going to almost faint - at least 2-3 times a week. I have done that for 10 minutes once in 2 years. I was able to do 5 years of taxes that I was too tired to tackle before, and I can function much better in general now. Made a huge difference in my life, night and day. Wellbutrin affects dopamine levels much more than most of the SSRI's, I believe that's the reason. I am a recovering alcoholic (26 years sober), and drinking affects dopamine too, so I can see why Wellbutrin works for me.
Depression	softtouch, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/22/2010 10:41:47 PM	I think this is just great for me after about 4 weeks. Started at 150 for about 3 weeks and then went to 300 for over a week now. I do not suffer from anxiety and i am not sure how this would ever be a medication for the treatment of anxiety ? It would seem to me that this medication could very well increase anxiety for those who have anxiety related issues. What it has done for me : Got me out of bed instead of sleeping all day for no real reason i could think of . It jump-started me so to speak. I have way more get up and go along with reduced anger,i got away from this senseless sadness,constant rehashing issues i have no control over and this is what i should be.Hope this continues for me. I get my 6 ,7 or 8 hours of sleep and i am ready to go.I really have nothing negative to say at this point for me.

Depression	LACing, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	4/19/2010 5:29:14 PM	Dr. told me to take 150mg the first week and if need be, increase to 300mg, which I did (150 did nothing for me; I have a very high tolerence).Calmed me down, but gave me the worst case of cotton mouth (drinking a ton of water), wake up in the middle of the night &amp; can't get back to sleep. Dr also gave me 0.5mg of Xanax (helped take the edge of the Wellbutrin XL.Also taking 0.25 Xanax at night to sleep. Stopped taking it after 30 days ( felt like I have built up a tolerence to it &amp; it's not working the way it was) and I'm experiencing dizziness. Getting up in the morning, I can understand, but laying in bed, stretching &amp; I'm getting dizzy...Has anyone else had this experience?? Using the same combo? Everything else is within the guidelines of this med. Tired in the afternoon, thoughts a little fuzzy, slight forgetfulness. Would like to hear from ohters who have experienced the same.

I was afraid that because of the limitations with meds I'd have to experiment with the Doctor for months before getting the right combination.  I added the Wellbutrin to my already 16 y.o. routine and have since been able to enjoy life and really focus on the moment I am in at the time. I'm not 100% better but am far more functional than before.

Had been on 150 for about 1.5 months.  When dosage was increased, I had a mild ringing in my ears.  Go to PCP &amp; Psychiatrist and was told that it was extremely rare (I'm often the exception to the rule) I stopped them for a few days to see if the ringing would subside. BAD MOVE!!  My mood immediately went south and the crying came back.  I started back after 5 days and in 24hrs I was back to &quot;normal&quot;.  I  have taken countless anti depression meds over the years.  This is the only one that has worked.  I will just deal with the ringing. Also there is a lot of muscle aches but I am resuming my workout this week.  Was told that will help.  I will let you guys know.

I've been on Zoloft and didn't really get much out of it. Recently came off Prozac because my side effects were really rare and severe. Wellbutrin gives me energy during the day and helps me wake up with a more positive feeling. Issues that used to send me into a bad funk aren't so bad anymore. I find that I rebound from problems quicker and am able to move on. The only side effects I'm experiencing is a little dry mouth and occasional constipation, but it's all be manageable.

Depression	Theresa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/4/2010 8:58:10 PM	I have taken Buproprion (Wellbutrin) three different times for depression. The first time I was extremely depressed and was crying all the time, hated my life, hated my job, etc. etc. I feel that the Wellbutrin it helped each time and I did not need to stay on it permanently. My personal experience with this drug was positive. I did experience constipation however, and this is easily prevented by adding TWO apples to your daily food intake and drinking at least 1 ounce of water, for every 2 pounds of body weight. I will actually be looking to go back on this anti-depressant again soon as I am in the middle of divorce and things are starting to overwhelm me. But I do not feel like I &quot;need&quot; it. It is great if you have adult ADHD, or just trouble concentrating/getting things done. I am a superstar at work when I am taking this stuff.

In some ways I already feel better, and when I feel better, I FEEL GREAT! BUT I when I'm not feeling GOOD, I'm severely exhausted.  My stomach is also queasy for a while after taking it.  I'm going to switch to taking it at bedtime to see if any of that helps, since some of the severe exhaustion occurs within hours of taking it.  Will update in 1 week. cg

Within two days, I started feeling markedly better. My only side effects have been some increased energy, so I try to take the 2nd pill earlier in the evening to avoid sleep issues. This drug replaced Effexor XR for me. Effexor worked for many years for me, but the effectiveness seemed to wane, and a change was needed.

My doctor started me on 150 mg. daly and I had almost immediate relief---symptoms did not magically disappear, but they became much more controllable. Two years later I'm back in control, coping well, and ready to wean myself off the drug. It provided the assistance I needed. However, unlike most other reviewers, I've gained weight since taking Wellbutrin. 
Stop Smoking	donttakethis, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	3/25/2010 10:31:34 AM	I took well butrin briefly to help me stop smoking.  I could feel it release in my body and it felt like little fingers running down.  Then I would feel sick to my stomach and then I would lose my memory...get forgetful and dingy.  After taking it about a month I began to have suicidal thoughts.  I got off of it after that.  AFter a few years...I am convinced it did some permanant damage to my memory--though it improved from what it was while I was on the drug.  I have a few friends that I found out were on this too.  They claim similarly.
Depression	Wild Bill, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	3/24/2010 11:31:27 PM	I have been taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg for about 10 years. Had no bad side effects for me that I know of. Seemed to help with depression and anxiety. Recently retired and a lot of stress and tension melted away. I am no longer taking it because I don't feel like I need it now. I went from 300mg. and gradually reduced dosage. A few side effects of anxiety and feeling &quot;strange&quot; but were not bad and didn't last long. I believe Psycotropic drugs are like women. Some can help some people and some can't. They are also like men. They are faithful to some and not so faithful to others. Depends on the make-up and physiology of the person.  All in all, not bad and helped me out of depression when I needed it the most.

Now i have been dealing with muscle/joint aches which are severe!!  my dr. didnt even mention this to me as a side effect.  my whole body feels flu-like, completely drained of energy and sore by the end of each day.  I am hoping this will eventually pass, or any suggestions to help with the joint and muscle pain???

The side effects are annoying (get less sleep now, increased libido, possible increase in anxiety) and really became noticeable at 300mg. It hasn't hosed me over like just about every other anti-depressant I have taken (and I've tried a couple dozen at this point) so it's the one I have to settle for. I'm taking the SR version in case my IBS acts up. To the person that asked about taking all of the SR's at once, they release the medicine over a 12 hour period, so I have to wonder about that. I spread mine out (loosely every eight hours). On the other hand, having a higher dose during the day may be a good thing. Sounds like you should ask your doctor about this.

I was told after I stopped the prozac it might take a week for migraine to go away, it has been exactly 1 week and it is not gone. Excedrin Migraine 1 pill at a time takes the edge off( you can only take 2 in 24 hrs.) Going to Dr. in 4 days... also terrible high pitch noise in ears....want to stop med. on my own to see if these will go away. Don't think I can wait 4 days for appt.
Stop Smoking	secret, 65-74 Female 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	3/17/2010 7:51:50 PM	I have been on Bupro for about a month now.  It definitely has helped my night and day sweats tremendously.  Only on .3 mg and think if this dosage does not work completely will ask for a little more.  Thought if I had to sweat like this the rest of my life, it would be very short.  Just could not stand the drastic temperature change in my body.  It has been my life saver so far!

Depression	amball1711, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	3/2/2010 10:42:58 PM	i was on wellbutrin 100mg bc of mood swings for 1 month before my dr increased my dose to 150mg.  i read into all side effects listed on webmed like i do with all meds.  webmd states siezures as a rare sife effect with wellbutrin. i had been on 150mg for less than 1 month when i took my 9month old son to see my parents.  i had been there for about 15mins when i fell out and had a convolsive siezure. luckly i was not driving/alone/holding my child.  my dr did reseach and found out that in fact 1 out of every 1000 people have siezures while on wellbutrin.  i then spoke with coworkers &amp; found additional people i knew that wellbutrin caused siezures with.  turns out siezures are not as rare of a side effect that they make it seem. again my dr found that every 1 in 1000 people wellbutrin causes siezures in.

Bipolar Depression	Christine, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/1/2010 8:55:28 PM	The Brand Wellbutrin XL 300 mg works very well for me, with Lamictal 200 mg and ongoing psychotherapy. It stabilizes my mood swings effectively. However, my insurance company decided to switch me to generic form of Wellbutrin. I assumed it was working for me until I hit bottom and was so out of control I didn't know what to do. I wasn't in therapy at the time. My GP was continuing the prescriptions and follow up with me after I moved away from my therapist. My GP recognized that I was in trouble during a routine exam and sent me immediately to a therapist she highly recommended. This therapist works closely with a psychiatrist that I am now seeing.  She recognized that the problem was the generic form of Wellbutrin (I wasn't taking Lamictal at that time).  I read several reviews by patients experiencing the same problem, with the same symptoms, which I found on the internet. I owe my life to these doctors for recognizing the problem and switching me back to Brand Wellbutrin XL.  My insurance company still won't cover the Brand but insists on the generic even though my doctors have explained the problem and insisted that I take the Brand name drug. I have to pay full price for Wellbutrin or suffer the dire consequences.  I have now ordered the drug from a reputable pharmacy in Canada at a lower price.

Depression	nomore, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	2/21/2010 1:32:37 PM	I experienced some side-effects when I first started using  wellbutrin XL (inability to sleep, vivid dreams, headaches)  which subsided within three days. My depression lifted, I was energetic, sleeping well, and lost weight. It seemed like the miracle drug. Three weeks into taking the medication, I realized that my memory was lapsing (I have always had an exceptional memory). Yesterday, I walked out of the supermarket without paying something, for I forgot that I was holding it in my hands. Thankfully, I was not accused of shoplifting. I realized that it was in my hand when I got home. Although it works great in all other respects, it seems like a very expensive price to pay. I am calling my doctor tomorrow.

I tried everything under the sun to help my severe anxiety disorder and once I found this, my life has changed for the best. I can do my daily activities without wanting to stay in bed and worry about missing the things I needed to stay in for. I handle my emotions better and do not constantly stress myself over the littlest things. This medication is my life saver! TRY IT! Only side effect was nausea for the first month or so....but it was worth it! And if you forget a dose, it is not the end of the world. Just take it the next day as scheduled!I love you Wellbutrin XL!

I started out taking 150mg, then after 5 years, switched to 300mg.  I have never had a problem on this medication.  No side effects, no sexual dysfunction.  The reason why I like this drug so much is because it's one that you can just stop taking and there aren't any withdrawal symptoms.  Although, after 10 years of taking it, I think it's stopped working.  Now I have to figure out what to do.

I took the brand name, and switched to generic when the price skyrocketed. SIX days later I had to return to the brand name. The FDA site tells you the whole story. The thing is that anyone who is prescribed the generic brand for the first time won't know it's not working, and the prescribing physician presumably doesn't otherwise s/he would not have presctibed it.

My first episode of depression was treated with Wellbutrin and the medication was very effective.  Went off when planning to become pregnant. Recently returned to using Wellbutrin, orginally at 150mg which wasn't as effective as the 300mg dose. Side effects have included: nausea, weight loss, poor appetite, occasional headaches. Although I initially lost weight due to the depression I now have to really force myself to eat and find myself going hours without food only to feel terrible due to low blood sugar levels. Also noticed some increase in anxiety symptoms. I am considering going back to the 150mg dosage.  I discovered that adding SAMe supplements have helped as well.

Depression	januarymom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	1/2/2010 5:56:00 PM	Typical story...busy mom of 2 fighting mild depression.  My &quot;mild&quot; depression includes a general feeling of lethargy, difficulty motivating myself to do simple things, feeling overwhelmed with the thought of completing simple tasks.  I was functioning in life but at a  lower level.  Anyway onto the med review:  MD prescribed 100 mg 1x a day and then told to work up to 200 mg 1x a day after a week.  First week at 100 mg....tons of headaches, crazy dehydration, wierd flighty feeling, nauseus, lack of appetite.  I convinced myself to stick with it at uped my dose.  Experienced 4 days of the worst headaches of my life.  I had to quit completely b/c I couldn't function.  Waited a week and began 100 mg once a day again and this time no headaches,  I am sticking with my low dose since it seems to give me the extra lift I need.  I don't feel medicated or foggy.  The biggest thing to disappear was the feeling of being overwhelmed.  I feel like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.  As for side effects now...I have a tendency to get dehydrated more quickly when on the meds so I have to really drink alot of water.  If I don't hydrate the headaches follow.  Initially my appetite completely disappeared.  Now it's less but not significantly.  This med does seem to reduce cravings in general.  I am not a drinker but had a couple drinks (despite my better judgement) on NY's Eve.  The next day or 2 I felt like the meds weren't working.....felt lethargic, just down.  Definately not worth the drinks of Champagne so I'll abstain 100% for now.  I am at a much lower dosage then is prescribed for most people but it works for me.   Main con i that I do notice that I can become agitated quicker.  I am usually the most laid back person, almost too laid back.  So for me it's not a big deal but I wouldn't recommend this med to anyone who has a tendency to anger easily or experiences anxiety.

I took the 2 a day version for 5 months before not being able to stand the headaches anymore.  I also felt very jittery the first week or so.  I recently switched to the extended release medication and my headaches are gone!  My doctor said that maybe the large dose twice a day was like a fire that then burned out over &amp; over.  I would definitely recommend the extended version of this drug.  In the past I had taken zoloft and I did feel great.  A little too great.  I gained 30 lbs over 6 months and had NO libido.  And I couldn't sleep at night to boot!  I did love how I felt, but I had to sleep and I didn't want to take a medication to sleep every night on top of the zoloft.  I like the welbutrin better for me because it only lessened my symptoms enough to be able to wrap my head around the issues in my life that were completely overwhelming me.  It didn't mask the problems as I felt the zoloft did.  Only helped me feel like I could compartmentalize them and start to deal with them.  Definitely make your doctor give you the extended release!

She began to withdraw from her normal behavior, and her school work regressed to about a 2-3rd grade level.  Her memory was affected dramatically.  We removed her from the Wellbutrin treatment after we heard similar stories about the effects.  She began a slow recovery and is functioning at a high level now.  Her ability to know left from right, tell time and several other skills that she had for several years were severely affected and she continues to struggle with some of these issues.
Depression	65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	12/26/2009 11:56:09 PM	As a caregiver for my husband, he had a complete lapse of cognitive function and was diagnosed with Early onset Alzheimers.  The symptoms were all there, however, we removed him from his Wellbutrin that had been prescribed for depression a year before, and he slowly began to improve.  It took several years before he could function again on a level that would seem normal.  He continues to have some memory problems, but the onset seemed keyed to his start of the Wellbutrin.

Also i do not feel suicidal all the time, as with effexor use and welbutrin; that was a 100%- 24/7 hobby with the use of these drugs; thinking of suicide and stopped my artistic life style cold. too bad i let them tell me to take this crap for so long. life's situations don't make us always need a pill... to fix us in the mental department. sad the doctors who give us this stuff- do not know what they are really doing.&quot;I LIVED THROUGH tTHIS med&quot; but I am not sure how (same goes for Effexor xr only more so!!) 
Depression	Ozzy's Mom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	12/23/2009 6:50:28 AM	Have been taking zoloft for about 6 years, psychiatrist added wellbutrin. Started with one per day, two weeks later, increased to two per day. Side effects started on the 3rd day of taking wellbutrin; strange taste in my mouth, headache, increased anxiety. When dosage was increased, depression worsened to include anger, yelling, shaking, constipation, loss of appetite, restlessness. Generally made my depression worse. Stopped taking wellbutrin a week ago and feel 100% better. Wellbutrin did not work for me. 
Other	enigmatoid, 45-54 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	12/22/2009 2:18:57 AM	Decided to give up my life as a chronic alcoholic. Found myself in a state of lethargy but not physically tired - like I was on auto-pilot. Went to work, paid the bills, but in a state of zombie - like a mental lobotomy. Wellbutrin (with xanax that I was already prescribedd for anxiety) has shown positive results. I hate to think that drugs (or alcohol for that matter) are the answer, but clearly, Wellbutrin (buproprion) is an effective adjunct to my transition toward totally clean living.The right doctor, the right attitude, and the right support system (outside the clinical realm) are important. I see Wellbutrin as an excellent mental stabilizer toward the end of dependence, and the transition toward livivng life on life's terms.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/21/2009 2:45:48 PM	I have a panic attack disorder with depression my doctor added the wellbutrin to my celexa and since the wellbutrin I have been alert,actully cleaning my house, sleeping less, staying focused, haven't had any panic attacks. This combination has helped me so much. . . I am so greatful I thought I'd be stuck were I was forever, I didn't think I could get any better. Before I've tried zoloft,lexapro(not bad), Effexor(awful), I know there has been plenty more, but those are the most resent. I used to need to sleep all day I was so lazy, my house was a total mess, I wasn't being a very good mom. I am doing great now.

Depression	Lesley, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	12/15/2009 9:44:00 PM	I have been using Welbutrin for 7 years for depression. Treatments over the previous 20 years included Adapin and Prozac, both of which had unpleasant side affects; nonetheless, I stayed on Prozac for 15 years prior to switching to Welbutrin. My overall experience has been good, especially in the beginning. However, after insurance forced me to start using the generic, I have found it to be less effective than the original formula. I'm thinking about going back to brand name even though I have to pay for it. I hope it's the generic formula and not due to tolerance build up that is causing the waning effects.

No other medication/ ofr combination of medication has worked this well for me ever. I had been experiencing depressive and mof changes since I was a teenager.  this combination has been a miracle for me.

I have been on the generic brand of Wellbutrin XL 150mg for 6 weeks now, and feel &quot;better&quot; overall (taking med for chronic depression/anxiety) and not having the severe mood swings, nor the usual emotional outburts and crying spells that I used to.  I feel more focused and in control...finally getting myself back and able to smile.  I have completely stopped smoking cold turkey, which was not initially intended, but a definite benefit. I have not had any side effects, except some weight loss due to appetite control, which is also a welcome benefit. I went up to 300mg after 4 weeks, but found it to make me very irritable, so I came back down to 150mg. After visiting my doctor, we decided to add 10mg of the generic Prozac to my med regimen, since I felt that I was very &quot;indifferent&quot; and not really finding the &quot;joy&quot; in things.  Today was the first day on Prozac...felt lots of energy and remain very optimistic.  Good luck everyone.  You're not alone:)

I have most of the common side effects..... now i feel depressed again with the side effects. Useless.wondering what will happen when i wean off? I hear alot of controversy regarding generic vs brand name. I think i'm going to ask my Dr. to prescribe the brand name as a last resort before i wean off.
Depression	ali, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/9/2009 7:03:50 PM	I used the generic for 2 years and then that stopped working. I had to switch to the name brand and my insurance company won't cover the name brand. Name brand worked great just wish my insurance company would pay for it. My dr. said it's common that the generic stops working after a couple of years.

Depression	collegegirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	12/2/2009 12:48:42 AM	I recently had to stop taking wellbutrin because of some insurance problems. I have been off for about a week and a half. I have an intense headache, nausea, uncomfortable in my own skin. Overall awful. Are these normal withdrawal symptoms? Does anyone have any advice for some kind of relief?
Depression	itsybay, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	3	Female	65-74	12/1/2009 7:00:56 PM	Not much relief.

I have anger issues, I can not think straight. I am crying more and I yell to release the tension I feel. In general I have become a terrible person and I am most deffinitly NOT myself at all on this.
Depression	mamato, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	25-34	11/26/2009 2:58:15 PM	Ive only been taking Wellbutrin for a little over a month. I have horrible anxiety attacks. I do believe it has helped with my moods overall. I dont go from a happy mood to a bad mood at the swing of my head. I know I have a ways to go but I believe that with the combination of Wellbutrin and counseling, I'll be just fine. I don't want to be on medication for a long time so I have to make a committment to myself to continue the counseling after I stop the pill. Being on an antidepressant for most of my life now scares me.

I felt like a new person while taking it. My relationships with people at work and home improved greatly.

I really dont want to start over with somethig new...but my attitude is taking a downward plunge and I am starting to feel warning signs.....
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	DrewM, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	2	Male	19-24	11/16/2009 7:28:56 AM	I actually gained a little weight, which I could trade for the sexual drive of Don Juan!  It countered wonderfully the Paxil I was co-currently taking.  I had not until adding Wellbutrin been able to orgasm in less than 35 minutes!  BUT, being a smoker, the appetite increase was due to the fact that I COULD NOT STOMACH a cigarette on Wellbutrin.  Between that negative effect, no real noticeable change with depressive or ADHD symptoms, the ONLY upshot was the sexual drive.  WHATEVER.
Depression	rytawn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/15/2009 7:11:56 PM	I have been on several medications in the past..celexa,lexepro etc. All of which caused me to feel blah and emotionless. They also caused weight gain and sexual disfunction. I was weaned off of them with a lot of withdrawl symptoms. About 8 years ago I was on wellbutrin. I remembered how much better it was than the others. When I felt that things were getting bad again I asked my Dr if he could try me back on that. I immediately had more energy, better attentin span, weight loss and better sex. I am only taking half the dose prescribed, 150mg in the morning. I am now at a plateau, so I may begin taking my second dose of 150 mg early afternoon. The only side effects are slight hand tremors, some irritability and my heart races especially if I have a few drinks. Not enough side effects to give it up. Really, if the other drugs you are taking make you feel lifeless, ask your Dr to try this. When I went off this the first time I had way less withdrawl sickness than the others. 
Bipolar Depression	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	11/13/2009 4:04:49 PM	I have found that Wellbutrin works best for me. I have tried numerous drugs to treat my depression, none of them has worked as well as Wellbutrin. The only side effects I have experienced is that rarely I have mild sleep problems. This drug has been perscribed for me on two seperate occasions, as my depression can be significant at times and other drugs are tried. I have a problem with severe anxiety with panic attacts. When these symptoms come up I do take additional medication, however Wellbutrin will often times help ease these symptions. If I were a doctor I would highly recommend this drug.
Depression	CRZYGRL, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	11/13/2009 2:09:34 PM	Over the past 15yrs I have tried Zoloft,Luvox &amp; Prozac. Zoloft made me feel like a &quot;zombie&quot;,Luvox and Prozac I pretty much plateaued on where they weren't effective anymore. I have been on Wellbutrin XL300mg for the past 6 years out of the 15 and I am in the process of weaning off of it now due to how I have been feeling lately. When I first started taking Wellbutrin XL I felt great! My depression was at bay,I had energy,felt good myself,lost 60lbs. Now I have reached a plateau or something, and I feel horrible!I am extremely depressed,do not have any interest in anything I use to do,I have racing thoughts of challenging myself to do things that could harm me, I have no energy,I have gained back at least 40lbs. Im full of anxiety, which i am taking Xanax for. I can cry at any given moment for no reason. These are all side effects I have been feeling since BEFORE my dr started weaning me off. Its only been a month since I started to wean off and I really haven't felt much of an improvement yet. My dr said it may take several weeks before I start to feel any change.  I am so frustrated because I just want to feel normal. I feel that this is not a long term &quot;drug&quot; for some people. It is definetly not helping me anymore. If anything it has made me feel worse in the long run.

Depression	bobrob, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	11/9/2009 1:50:45 PM	After a sever traffic accident, and being in a coma for a month, I was suffering from post tramatic stress symdrome, and was consumed with anger toward the person who, I felt, nearly killed me. I went to a phycologist who diagnosed me with the PTSS, and said that I should see about getting medication for that..I ignored him, and my out look on life was getting worse steadily. My girl friend was beginning to back away from me. I had many and thoughts about ending all of the pain. I was convinced that It wouldn't be hard to do and that would end the mental torment. My girl friend finally talked me into talking to my GP about this condition, and I did. He prescribed Wellbutrin 300xl. Withing a week I felt like a new person. I was still was having the anger issue, but the depression was gone and I wasn't interested in ending it all.  This is now 4 years later and wellbutrin is still doing it's thing. I did try others (Ambilify, Cymbalta, Zolof) and they were all horrible. They ruined sex, but the Wellbutrin is a Godsend in that department.  I understand that Wellbutrin isn't the same for everyone, but this has been my experience.

Bipolar Depression	Jane, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/8/2009 3:06:08 AM	I am a recovered alcoholic/ addict although I have been sober and clean for four years, I was still experiencing depression, lack of motivation and concentration.  Felt hopeless, like I would never really be ok. I have been taking wellbutrin xl 300 mg for three weeks and love it.  I have not been depressed, it has given me lots of energy, controls my appetite and I quit smoking!!  I had tried many antidepressants in the past and they all made me more depressed and very tired, I was constantly sleeping and had no personality, like I was living in a fog.  Wellbutrin gives me an overall feeling of well being.  I have not had any side effects.  I highly recommend trying wellbutrin to see if it works for you.  I am so glad that I did!!!
Stop Smoking	Jane, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/8/2009 2:38:11 AM	I started taking wellbutrin XL 300 mg to treat PMDD and after two weeks I took a 6 hr flight and noticed I wasn't craving a cigarette as I normally would have.  I then realized wellbutrin was decreasing my desire for nicotine and I quit smoking.  Wellbutrin has helped my PMDD and also allowed me to quit smoking, what a bonus!!  I would highly recommend it to anyone who desires to quit smoking, it is amazing!!
Depression	tomg, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	45-54	11/5/2009 3:11:20 PM	Initially it was great. Some agiation at first and rapid speech. Experienced weight loss (good) and mood did level out. They said it would not &quot;poop out&quot; over time, but it did. I took higher doseages until I have a few seizures. Now I'm in no mans land. Maybe a smaller dose would do the trick, but the siezures ruled that out. Nothing else seems to work well.

However, I am on the lowest dose possible and still get all the side effects- constipation, insomnia, head rushes, fast heart beat, but most of all migranes. I have never had such intense headaches in my life, they seem to be getting worse, and happening more often. If I take pain medication they do not go away.

I have never felt better. The only thing I have to complain about is the generic is NOT the same. I have no issues with taking generic medications, except for this one. I basically felt two bursts of the medication, and nothing was constant. My moods were up and down, and it was like I was paying to be depressed! Other than that, the brand medication is wonderful!
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/26/2009 12:53:30 PM	Wellbutrin helped me get my life back. I have BP and had an episode of severe depression that lasted several months last year. Before that, my episodes were manic except for a depressive episode when I was sixteen. The mania is not as severe or as lengthy as it was in my late teens and early/middle twenties so Lamictal alone has been enough to keep me stable at this point. After 10 weeks on Wellbutrin I finally started to crawl out of the dark pit. My current regimine is 300 Lamical at night and 300 Wellbutrin XL in the morning. The Wellbutrin causes ringing in the ears. I don't notice it too much until I sit down at the end of the day to relax (I have two small children). I enjoy reading, but am distracted too much by the ringing to concentrate. I am tolerating it because Wellbutrin has worked so well for my depression. Also, I had been on a generic and my Pharmacy switched to another generic brand and it really messed me up. I was very anxious (I don't suffer normally), confused, dizzy and had a strong metallic taste. My doc said that she's had other similar complaints and recommended switching to the name brand. I did and since then have been back to as close to normal as I'll ever get LOL:) Also, to all those suffering from sleep problems and irritability, do you drink caffeine? I'm very sensitive to it and have been off of it for six years. On occassion I will &quot;splurge&quot; and have a sweet tea or Dr. Pepper at a resturant, but then I'm very jittery, irritable, hyper and VERY chatty. When I finally go to bed (2-3 am) I wake up often which impacts my mood and concentration the next day...vicious cycle, so I stay away from it.

It eased the depression while I was taking it, but the anxiety levels increased for me at times. The medicine also took away my appetite, making me get full faster when I ate.

That is what I think. After a month of it, I have never in my life prior to taking this experineced almost daily crying spells, one weekend woke up with sore fingers and flue like symtoms (but no fever) Even at 300mg for a second week now, do not feel any difference.

First time on medication in 1989 and still on it and I feel great. The trick is to find the right dose of wellburtin with the ativan.

Depression	BJ,CALIFORNIA, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	10/16/2009 4:05:59 PM	I suffer from irritability, lack of motivation, depression, and anxiety. I have been medicatited most of the last 10 years. I was perscribed Welbutrin, and Celexa to take place of prozac, which hasn't really been effective for 2 years.I also started taking Clonopin 6 months ago, .5mg 1 or 2 a day. The Clp I like it seems to really help calm me. I take it around 1 pm before my kids come home from school! My primary care dr. retired so my new dr wasn't comfortable refilling the clonopin because it can be addictive! Who cares if I'm taking it everyday anyway? So I go see a real phsyc. dr. f9or help. The first 2 days I was very tense and jumpy had hot flashes. After that the migrain hit. I have suffered from headaches in the past so didn't relate it to the meds for a couple days. But after 4 days of severe pain in the top of my head, I spoke to my Dr. who said a small percent of people will experience migrain from the Wb. The next morning I had an ice pack on my neck at six am. I took only the Celexa that day and realized around 11am my headache was almost gone! I still had tension and restlessness dry mouth. Today I didn't take anything until about 11 am I took 1/2 clonopin to take the edge off. I am actually feeling good today. I slept better last night. That helped alot! I see him in one week, during that time I will try go solo as much as possible. (I have my clonopin if I get too out of hand!) Then I will ask my dr to try effexor xl. I was on this for 5 years before I got pregnant with my youngest. I did very well after the 1st couple weeks of side effects. Hope this helps someone. I know I go to the reviews to see how pills effect different people. It helps. We all have a different chemistry and a single goal in common...TO FEEL GOOD!

It is an extended release version of the drug which should help eliminate the need to take it more than once a day.  Anyway, my best advice to anyone with depression and/or bi-polar disorder is to try any meds that are offered or are available.  It took a while to find the medications that worked for me.  Don't be worried about taking more than one drug either, if you need to.  I have been taking Wellbutrin XL for 3 1/2 YEARS.  I am taking 450 mg and have been for most of that time period.  I have had excellent results on this med, and have had no side effects at all, ever, nor have I had any significant weight gain.  This medicine has worked wonderful for ME.  I have bi-polar disorder; therefore I also take Lamictal 400 mg, and Seroquel 100 mg.  This is the &quot;cocktail&quot; of meds that have worked for me.  Medicine affects everyone differently.  Don't think that just because one person had serious side effects that you will also.  This medicine may be just what you need.  Sometimes you have to trust the doctor more than the reviewers.  The doctors know what the side effects may be.  They are in no way trying to hurt you!  They are trying to help you the only way they know how!  Good luck and God bless you!  There is hope, just don't give up!

Depression	JessieLAB, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	10/8/2009 10:55:10 PM	I took this drug when I was 16-17 for smoking cessation, and it did nothing for me in that area.  Before taking Wellbutrin, I wasn't a depressed person, but it caused me to become suicidal and ended up overdosing and was hospitalized due to severe seizures.  I was diagnosed in my early 20s with clinical depression, and was put on Wellbutrin XL again to treat it.  It made a major difference in the first 2 months while on it, but after that it became useless and I became more suicidal than ever.  My appetite was very off while on this medication - I could go for two days without feeling hungry and would literally have to force myself to eat.  My anxiety worsened on the medication as well.  I just switched to Zoloft today. Hopefully that will help!

However, the headaches also caused me to become depressed.  I'm sure my problem is a lack of serotonin.  I started taking Effexor at first, which worked well, but I started having side effects that I didn't like.  My doctor then put me on 150mg Wellbutrin XL 2x day.  It takes care of my headache for the most part but I still have them slightly.  The worst side effect from Wellbutrin is the sweating.  I hate it.  It's like hot flashes constantly all day and night.

The first day I felt very high and jumpy and It took me a long time to fall asleep.  It also gave me diarrhea a few hours after I have taken it both times.  On day2 I felt les anxious and a bit more even...and my appetite is way down.  I am also taking the med to stop smoking...i'm currently at 150 1x daily and will increase to 2x daily next week.  I already find my cravings have decreased dramatically...i'm hoping it continues to work!

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/2/2009 9:33:06 AM	I had suffered from depression for years before I started taking Wellbutrin.  It has made a major positive difference in my life in the way I handle things; I am able to think much more clearly and rationally.  For the first few years I combined the medication with therapy.  I was taking 225 mg when I started and have had to increase it once to 300 mg/ day.  I currently take the Wellbutrin 300 XL.  Word of caution on the generic version of Wellbutrin 300 XL - I tried it when it was approved and found after a few months that I was becoming depressed again.  The generic did not work for me; the tablet may have the same amount of medication but the packing (what makes up the rest of the pill)is completely different than the brand name.  For me it seemed like instead of medication being steadily administered to my system throughout the day it hit all at once, thus the return of the depression.  I was hoping to be able to save some money with the generic but it is worth it to me to take the brand name.  
Depression	Prollywastinmytime, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	10/1/2009 6:48:00 PM	After one week of Wellbutrin treatment, I became unable to focus on any task for more than a few seconds. Every facet of life was frustrating. Extreme anger and rage were a common occurence. My treatment ended after two weeks, however years later my ability to focus remains diminished. This drug is extremely dangerous, in my opinion.

I had to stop it because it made my depression worse. I felt hopeless and started having suicidal thoughts. I was tired all the time and I felt like all I wanted to do was sleep. It took so much energy to get up and do ANYTHING that it like I was fighting with my inner stubborn child to get anything done. Including going to the bathroom. My mind felt like I was in a fog bubble and I couldn't think. I had to concentrate very hard about just basic things. I became cranky, irritable and downright ridiculously rude. Anything that I thought fell right out of my mouth no matter what it was. I couldn't stand being around me... I know no one else did either. Having two children that I homeschool, I couldn't stay on the medicine. I decided that mild depression was better than being psychotic and on the verge of catatonic.
Depression	Suzie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	9/23/2009 11:47:17 PM	Started this to treat Depression and Adult ADD.  I took 75 mg/day, and it gave me a lot of energy, focus, attention span. However, caused anxiety and the worst symptom was severe hair loss.  The first time I tried it, I noticed the hair loss after 2 weeks.  I stopped taking it for about 6 months.  Then, I gave it another try, thinking maybe it wasn't the Wellbutrin.  As soon as I started taking it again, my hair started coming out by the handfuls, right about 1.5 weeks into taking it.  My Doctors have never heard of this side effect, but I know for a fact it's caused by this drug.

During the day I felt sexually aroused all day, so much that I had to go to the bathroom at work and masturbate several times throughout the day. On the occasion that I did have sex it was embarrassing because my orgasms were so fierce and I would end up drenching my partner. It got to be too much for me to control myself and I had to stop taking it after I developed bad headaches and nosebleeds. Although it helped me feel less depressed and anxious, I would not recommend this drug

After about a week I felt a slight upswing in mood but after 3 weeks, I can hardly sleep, can't concentrate, and it feels like my brain can't function anymore.  I'm quitting this tomorrow but encourage others who have trouble with this med to keep trying until you find the right one.  It took me 5 tries to find what worked for me.

I was finding that I was feeling better, and I now take the wellbutrin instead of the lexapro and I'm now really feeling great - like my old self with more enthusiasm and energy.  This has been the case for only one month, but so far so good.

I tried nearly every antidepressant on the market in the 80s. Tri-cyclics, MAOIs, SSRIs, etc. The only drug that initially helped me was Trazodone. When the effects of that started to wane I went to a doctor that prescribed Wellbutrin for me. I immediately received outstanding help from this drug. For the first time since I was a child I felt like a &quot;normal&quot; person. It helped with every facet of The Monster, Depression. I have been taking this drug for twenty years and I will never give it up. It and the doctor who prescribed it gave me my life back. It also helps somewhat with Fibromyalgia and CFIDS. It once   helped to keep me awake. I no longer get that benefit from the drug and am taking Provigil to try to remain alert. If you have tried other antidepressants with less than stellar results, please ask your doctor about Wellbutrin. I take 450mgs of Wellbutrin XL in the mornings. I can tell within hours if I missed a dose.

The least little thing had me feeling like my world was coming to an end. After taking Wellbutrin I am a very different person. I asked my best friend if she noticed a difference in me and she said if I went off Wellbutrin she wouldn't be my friend! She was only kidding but she said there was a big difference in me, happy, upbeat, positive etc. I tried Wellbutrin generic and it did  nothing for me. Someone talked me into trying Cymbalta because it also helps with Fibromyalgia, it did not help at all and gave me a lot of side effects, weight gain, tremors in my hands, just wanted to sleep and sit and stare at nothing, went off of it and back on Wellbutrin after a 3 month try. I will be staying on Wellbutrin and paying the extra  not to be on the generic.

I've been taking Wellbutrin XL for over 4 years. I also was taking Cymbalta (didn't notice any help from that drug), but stopped due to the perceived ineffectiveness over 6 months ago with no negative effects. WB however seemed to help level out my depression. Instead of the very deep lows they became less severe over time until my mood was manageable. When I began taking WB I immediately noticed a decrease in appetite and lost several pounds right away. In time my appetite came back and have gained the weight back. It also helped with my cravings for habits I had stopped years ago, e.g., smoking, drinking, drugs, etc. If I wanted to stop smoking, drinking or drugs I would HIGHLY recommend WB as an adjunct therapy. I see why ZYBAN is prescribed for smoking cessation! I have tried weening back to 150mg from the 300mg dose I take daily before bed, but noticed mood changes within a week so I went back to 300mg, not wanting to fix it if it wasn't broken. It seems as though I may have to take something for the rest of my life as I have been a lifetime depression sufferer. The only side effect I suffer from is that I think it contributes to sexual dysfunction, but depression itself could be the main culprit. There is no free lunch with any medication. Your mileage may vary ;-).

I had every side-effect listed and then some.  The worst were the muscle cramps, and the rash.  I quit taking it after a week and switched to Zoloft.

I have been off of Wellbutrin for almost 5 months and the hair loss and acne finally stopped.
Depression	pisces87, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	8/11/2009 3:47:14 PM	I have been taking the generic Budeprion XL for about a month and a half and I honestly dont feel any differently(mood wise), but boy, lots of side effects have tagged along for the ride! For starters, I started having constant palpitations and chest discomfort about 2 weeks into treatment. Then there was this strange pain under my left shoulder blade that kept happening. Not to mention feeling jumpy and jittery most of the time. I am convinced that the generic form is to blame. Will be going back to my doc very soon...something has GOT to change and SOON!!

I have been taking 150mg daily for 2 days when the dizziness,confusion,nausea,crying for no reason started. Also have ringing in my ears but it is like a hammer hitting a piece of sheetmetal 3 timesthen stopping..about 1 minute later it happens againand so on..24hours a day. calling dr in the morning and getting back on celexa
Depression	Julie, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	8/9/2009 12:17:06 AM	I have been on the generic Wellbutrin for a few months now. I cannot take the XL or XR type. I do not have more energy, I am still very fatigued and I seem to be as depressed as I always was if not more. But I don't think the worsening depression is from the generic Wellbutrin but from other life issues. I am all for a medication that doesn't cause you to gain weight because if you are already depressed that will cause additional depression at least it would in me and I would be non compliant.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/7/2009 9:18:07 PM	This drug drastically improved my quality of life. Though I do not have a formal dx of MDD, I suffered from both depression and fatigue- not sure if it was fatigue as a symptom of depression, or that I was depressed because I was fatigued all the time post mono.  In any case, the Wellbutrin XL took care of both of them. In my experience having tried all three, the brand is the best, then the generic buproprion, and BY FAR THE WORST is the generic budeprion-HORRIBLE headaches.  Right now I have been taking 300mg of the generic buproprion for about a year because the brand got too expensive, even with insurance.  While on the brand drug, I lost about 10-15lbs but since have gained it back (not sure if it is related to swtiching from the brand to generic).  Side effects I experienced/still experience include a headache the first week on it, constipation the first week on it, and for the two years I have taken it I have had increased eye sensitivity to sunlight.  As a patient taking it and a registered nurse, I highly recommend this drug for patients experiencing depression with fatigue, especially if SSRI's increased your feeling of fatigue.

I lost about half my hair (luckily I had a lot) but once I stopped taking it, it grew back.  I know it sounds crazy, but that was my experience with it.

Then while resting in bed, had bursts of palpitations and irregular heart beat.  It decreased appetite and desire to smoke, but not worth the A-fib and risk of stroke.  Threw it away.  Have been chewing a lot of gum instead.

Depression	?, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	3	Male	65-74	7/22/2009 4:12:43 PM	
Depression	Kathy O, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/24/2009 3:46:23 AM	I have suffered from depression most of my life.  In my early 20s I started see a psychiatrist.  I received talk therapy as well as antidepressants throughout my life.  I have been off &amp; on Prozac for the past 20 years.  For nearly two years, I have had trouble with sleeping too much (anywhere from 12 to 20 hours a night).  When I saw my regular doctor, she suggested increasing my Prozac to 40mg &amp; said I should expect to stay on it for the rest of my life (I am 63).  With no improvement she added Effexor (75mg).  It didnt seem to improve the sleeping or depression.  Besides the excessive sleeping, I also felt like crying all the time; found no joy in life; had no energy; &amp; no motivation to do anything (other than what was absolutely necessary ).  I went to a psychiatrist  and he decreased the Effexor  (37.5mg).  With still no improvement, he stopped the Effexor and started me on Wellbutrin (300mg).  Within about three weeks I felt like a normal person.  I would wake before the alarm would ring, had more energy and felt not so hopeless. I hadnt felt like this in a long time.  The change lasted about two months.   After he wrote the next prescription for Budeprion XL (300mg), which he said was cheaper.  I started to feel like I was going back to my old pattern of sleeping too much (not as bad as before but still too much) and not as much energy as with Wellbutrin..  I am sad to say I did not experience any weight loss with either the Wellbutrin or the generic.  While taking the generic, I had some adverse effects which include: dry mouth; tremors of the hands; increase in resting heart rate (85+ per minute); trouble keeping my balance and some hair loss.  When I see the psychiatrist in a month, I plan on having write a prescription for Wellbutrin, not the generic.  It is worth the extra money.  
Depression	WheelchairDude, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	7/23/2009 4:38:01 PM	5/5 with this drug.  It has really helped me out in so many ways.  I have Muscular Dystrophty (FSH type).  Have been markidly depressed for about 6 years.  Nothing has worked, until I actually asked.. to try Wellbutrin.  Wellbutrin has changed my life.  It has definatly increased quality of life, over quanity of life.  Makes dealing with my everyday disease more at ease, with my physical weakness, and mental tiredness.  And what I like about it is, is that it doesn't make you feel &quot;high&quot; or &quot;euphoria&quot;, well, to me anyways, but you just... feel good.  And that is quality of life to me.

On day 3 i had a panic attack while driving home from work. Couldn't catch my breath and I felt like I was having a heart attack. I had to pull off the freeway and be taken to the hospital via ambulance. My bp was 180/90...which i guess is really bad. Will never take this drug again!

Other	ashleyamore, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	19-24	7/18/2009 5:26:06 PM	I just began [this will be day 4] my treatment with wellbutrin. I tried to get an appointment with a psychiatrist only to be told that I couldn't be seen until the middle of august. [almost a full month from then]. I already had been suffering from severe daytime anxiety, but one night I awoke with what I would later find out was a nocturnal panic attack. This was very scary for me, as I thought it could've been sleep apnea, and my nighttime panic attacks were MUCH worse than my daytime ones, which is saying something. My heart would race, beat out my chest, I would shake, become disoriented and dizzy, and my chest would tighten up. My breathing would become very labored. This happened to me every night for over a week before I broke down and went to my PCP. He prescribed me wellbutrin 150 mg once a day for a week, to be increased to two a day if I don't see results. I also have bipolar disorder, which I'm not sure if my PCP knew.  Anyway, my side effects were NOT pleasant. For the first three days I was so restless I felt like I was going to claw my own skin off. I had TONS of energy. My nighttime panic attacks worsened. I felt like I was on coke. [LITERALLY]. I couldn't stop pacing, and my heart was racing. I couldn't sleep. I took my medication at 8pm as I'm generally a night owl, figuring this would be ample time for my body to adjust to the medication before sleep. I was up every day for 3 days until 6 am. Last night was the first day so far that I felt only mild symptoms. I was twitchy but able to sleep at my normal time [around 1 am]....It makes me somewhat apathetic. But once I would take the medicine during the first three or so days of treatment, let me tell you, it was HELL. I seriously considered stopping the medication because my anxiety was driving me crazy. I do have the jaw clenching still. If you can stick it out through the temporary hell, its not so bad for my mood. STAY CALM ON THIS MEDICINE- IT MAKES PANIC ATTACKS MUCH WORSE DURING THE FIRSTDAYS

I am no longer depressed or anxious, however I am calm and happy.  I had side effects for the first few days, but they went away and now I feel great. I felt the difference in a few days, and realized it was working. This is the first medication I have tried, and I would definately recommend it to others struggling with depression, and anxiety.

I finally have my sex drive back and on other meds i didnt. I had bad side affects for the first 2 months, even worst depression. Im definitly angry and agitated easily now. But i tried a lot of other meds and the transition was so hard for me that im not sure if i can try something new again. In the beginning i stopped smoking and drinking on this, it was a bonus. In the last few months i do more of both now. I really dont know how i will feel from one moment to the next on this. 
Depression	Jean, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/13/2009 4:16:35 PM	I noticed relief in my depressive symptoms within days of beginning Wellbutrin. It was the first drug I tried and it was a wonder drug for me.I have been on it for 15 years or so. At times, I did struggle and still struggle with suicidal thoughts but that has gotten better as I have gotten older. I did have one period of time where it seemed that the Wellbutrin was loosing its effectiveness. I was weaned off of it and I tried several other antidepressants but none worked as well. I ended up going back on the Wellbutrin and for a short time, was given another medication with it. I am now taking only Wellbutrin and it is once again working well for me most of the time.

I am on wellbutrin xl for multiple reasons. I was on it a couple of years ago and loved it then. Although, when I got off of it, it made me feel very angry (to put it nicely)! This time around I've had no problems. LOVE IT. It helps me function properly, and controls my mood swings. It really helps me be the mother and wife that I need and want to be.

With this one she had me on 300 mg and I became confused and shaky.  Now we are trying to get the insurance company to cover the brand name Wellbutrin XL.  It has now been a week and still the insurance company hasn't approved it yet.  I heard that the brand name is alot better than generic, but I have to wait for the insurance company to approve first.
Depression	getakickoutofyou, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	7/11/2009 4:12:11 PM	I started on 150mg of the generic Wellbutrin.  Within a day I had nausea, felt like throwing up, headaches, insomnia, and confusion.  Five days after starting, I woke up 5:30 am with such a severe headache I could hardly move, which was followed by severe nausea- my husband got a waste basket for me just in case because I could not move.  I had really bad chest pains added to this, and I counted the minutes till my doctors office opened at 8:00 am.  I had read that some people had more severe side effects with the generic version.  The active ingredient is the same amount in both, but the other components are different, causing some people to react differently.  I wanted to be prescribed Wellbutrin, not the generic, and within a day, most of the symptoms had gone.  What a relief.  It has been mostly a good change- I feel more calm, less anxious, and able to concentrate more, I feel almost &quot;normal&quot;, but I still have some agitation and sometimes cry at small things, but do not feel depressed, if that makes any sense.  It usually only lasts a few minutes.  I think it would be beneficial to add another medication to this to maximize my results.
Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	7/8/2009 10:28:27 PM	I had taken Wellbutin several years ago to quit smoking.  Although I have been diagnosed with depression, I wasn't requiring medication for it at the time.  I only took it for two weeks.  I never wanted to smoke, but I also became extremely depressed and almost suicidal.  I cried all the time.  So, yes, it was VERY effective to help me quit smoking, but I wouldn't recommend it and will never try it again.  I would rather continue smoking than use it.

I was on it a little over 2 yrs ago to take the edge off. Love it. Lost about 10 lbs and felt great. Did make my thoughts less clear, and got off of it when I had to make some life-changing decisions. Got back on it now, and it is hard to adjust to in the beginning. Mood swings for sure. And I agained 4 lbs in a week! The opposite of what I wanted to happen. Hopefully it will change and go the other way. No sexual side effects except that it is better!  I do have a range of emotions every day though from being confident and secure to being totally insecure and emotional. This too, I hope will pass soon. Can't stand it and I know that I am hard to be around now.

I feel lucky to have gotten it right on the first try. Before I began taking Wellbutrin XL I was very depressed, specifically I felt like everybody hated me and conspired against me. After taking it I feel normal again. I know it works becuase if I miss a few pills the same feelings come back until I start taking the pills regularly again. They seem to have a few day delay. Also, my pharmacy gave me the generic version one time so I thought what the heck and decided it wasn't a big deal, but I was wrong. It made my feel like I wasn't taking anything at all and the old feelings were back. After that I made sure my pharmacy always gave me the name brand. This drug really works for me.

Unlike Prozac or Zoloft, it di not cause sexual side effects or lethargy.  It can cause slightly manic mood swings when beginning dosage so might require a slower schedule to work up to full dosage.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/28/2009 4:27:12 PM	I could tell a huge difference in the generic vs the reg Wellbutrin. Insurance company does not want to pay for the whole script since there is a generic avail. I pay the diff  its worth it. No weight gain and lots more energy with normal wellbutrin. antidepressants and heart meds as well as thryoid meds have the biggest problem with patients not doing as well on the generics, Insurance companies should be more concerned about the health of the public rather than making a buck

Felt angry all the time and short tempered w/my family.  taking Vynase now, works much better for me, no anxiety or anger.  I noticed the bad side effects right away and they decreased about 8 hrs. after taking the dose. stopped taking wellbutrin after 3 weeks, this is the second time I've tried it.  It's hard to find the right med, keep trying!

I was willing to switch meds to see if it would hep.  It doesn't work as well as Prozac for me.

Very effective in my case. No side effects that I have noticed.

Bipolar Depression	Solhso, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	45-54	6/16/2009 9:50:45 AM	It didn't seem to help with my depression but after only two weeks on itI  was told by one Psych Dr. That if I beleved it would help me, It would. I slapped him and left, I felt he was the crazy one who needed meds.   - 5 years later I started taking it, when it came out for quitting smoking I took it for over 6 weeks and it did actualy help with my depression  Also I quit smoking!  That Doctor did me and probably many people a disservice by not expaining time frames with all these   different drugs, Like Prozac The doctor saidin a few weeks He could tell .  I felt it within 48 hours. That was the first drug I was on so I never really trusted them after that and no drug ever came close to helping me but it stoped working.  and I was put onI couldnt even tell you how many drugs and combos. since then.  BUT I did learn that it is true that when they (who ever they are)say it may take six weeks , trust it , don't give up. Its a good drug and I dontbelieve I had any bad side effects. maybe dry mouth. actualy I'm still on it now, along with a few others.

Depression	wordcat2, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male		6/7/2009 6:29:56 PM	I have been taking Wellbutrin since 1995. Twice I tried not taking it for sveral weeks because  I was not sure it was heping mem. TWICE i gradually became more lethargic, unable to do more than barely function. Both times my wife noticed my decline beforeI did even aware of the change. Since that second experiment. I have continued to take my W pwice a day. Wellbutrin does not make me high or very happy; it does seem to make me behave with an appearance and general feeling of normality. 
Depression	suem, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/5/2009 1:29:40 AM	I've been taking this drug for several years and did well with it until I was given a generic then life became miserable.  There is a difference in absorption rates among the generics and I felt like I was getting it all at once-  Zoned out, headache, down right rotton and tired.  I read an article about some having the same problem so tomorrow I'm back to wellbutrin.  Also it's common to need another medication with this to combat what I call compulsive hyper nastiness.  Everyone is different to what brand/dosage/combination works for them and requires alot of patience.  If you don't feel your dr is listening to you when you're not feeling well, move on to another dr. Just like meds, some drs are better than others.  :)

Depression	Barbarella9, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/26/2009 9:44:16 PM	I was switched to this medication from Effexor XR 75mg.  I am taking 300mg per day.  The Effexor made me so tired I was unable to function.  While Wellbutrin has reduced my fatigue, I have become very agitated and angry.  I am so mean and say awful things to people.  It has not helped at all with my depression.  In fact, my depression is worse.  On Effexor XR, I never cried or felt like crying.  On Wellbutrin I cry during commercials.  This medication does not work for me at all.  My doctor wants me to switch to Lexapro.  I am scared to try it based on reviews stating it's extremely difficult to wean off of it.
Depression	EJL, 25-34 Male  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	5/25/2009 11:42:33 PM	This drug has caused me to have severe anxiety, anger, caused me nightmares, makes me feel very weird, headaches, nausea, dry mouth, racing thoughts, sleeplessness, major depression, bad thoughts, stress, and every other horrible feelings, like I feel I am jumping out of my skin, losing my mind, and I've been on it for about 2 weeks.  I felt these side effects shortly after starting this drug.  I cannot wait to get to my doctor's office in the morning if I don't lose my mind and can make it there in this crazy state of mind.  This drug is horrible and has made me much worse than I've ever been....

My scalp, face and neck would sweat profusely even while just sitting and watching television. If I was being active (i.e., biking, housework) I would be drenched with sweat and it became socially embarrassing.

At the time I was also taking Paxil for depression. I stopped taking the Paxil and stopped smoking and lost weight. I find the Wellbutrin to be a better anti-depressant for me than the Paxil was. My husband is also taking Wellbutrin plus Zoloft for chronic depression after trying  many other anti-depressant drugs and he is in the best place mentally in the 40 years we have been together.

I read up on the reviews and the side effects on this site and discussed it with my doctor. We agreed to give it a try and I felt a change within hours.  Now I feel like myself; not the shadow of who I was, pretending like I was alright.  There are a few side effects that can be annoying (constipation, involuntary quivers), but to feel like me...it's worth it.  I hope this feeling continues.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	5/15/2009 10:54:18 AM	I started taking this medicine 6 months ago and I now can not live without it.  It took a while for the medicine to take full effect. The first 2 months, I was happy, sometimes a little too happy.  Now it has evened out.  It does make me hyper and at times very aggresive but I know it is just the medicine and I can keep it in check.  I haven't gained any weight either.  The only negative thing I can say about it is if I take too much of this medicine, I feel very irratated. I have to space 2 150mg XL at least 4 hours apart. I can't take one 300 mg XL at one time.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	5/14/2009 9:19:25 PM	I was recently diagnosed with depression and ADHD, so I was really hoping Wellbutrin would work.  I was prescribed 150mg, but after 5 days I had to get off.  I started to get increasingly shaky and I got a bad sore throat and dry mouth.  I didn't sleep for like 2 days, and I started to act kind of weird - like I blew everything out of proportion.  I also started to get nauseous and have headaches.  Anyway, the evening of the 5th day of being on Wellbutrin, I ended up having my first ever panic attack...the night before a final.  It was horrible - it was one of the worst nights of my life.  Thankfully I was able to get a hold of my psychiatrist who was able to get my final rescheduled - I know for a fact I would not have been in any shape to take it the next day.   Anyway, I'm disappointed Wellbutrin didn't work for me.  I realize that it helps a lot of people, but if you start to get these types of anxiety/mood symptoms, go off before it gets any worse - because it will, and it's not fun.  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/14/2009 9:15:26 PM	I was put on Wellbutrin XL 150 for complaints of anxiousness associated with job related stress.  I was on Lexapro 5 mg which assisted me in not worrying about how I would manage to complete all the tasks of my demanding job each day.  However, the Lexapro gave me a zero sex drive.  At 30 years old, I was not comfortable with that. In the first week, I took 2.5 mg of Lexapro while starting Wellbutrin XL at the recommendation of my doctor.  The first week I did not have any problems, but by the second week, I began having racing feelings, hot flashes, chills, belly pain, and what seemed to be an increased heartbeat and off vision.  Additionally, I felt agitated and by week three, was crying off and on for no reason.  After four weeks of being on Wellbutrin XL (3 weeks of just Wellbutrin XL by itself since I was still taking Lexapro in the first week), I contacted my doctor, who as luck would have it, is on maternity leave now.  I attempted to taper every other day for a few days, but I felt worse on the day I took the drug versus the day I skipped.  I am now 12 days off Wellbutrin without tapering.  Nevertheless, I am still having hot flashes off and on and a racing heartbeat feeling.  It is not as bad as when I was taking the medication every day, but I still do not feel myself.  If you have just a bit of anxiety about how you can manage all that is required in a job which lots of responsibility and long hours, I would not recommend starting this drug.  I do not have depression,  yet most of what I am reading seems to indicate that people who need an extra push to get out of bed are the people that find this medicine useful.

In addition, it has caused insomnia in which I've been up almost 48 hours.  Needless to say, it caused me to be very aggitated and even more depressed because I am so exhausted but cannot fall asleep.  I am stopping this drug immediately and trying something else.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	2	1	Female	19-24	5/11/2009 1:06:49 PM	I started taking Zoloft in 2005 to treat my anxiety/depression combo. I felt so much better on it but as of now, I am 40 lbs heavier. I have maintained the same weight for like past couple years prior to taking Zoloft and now I cannot stop gaining. It averages about 10 lbs a year and changes in diet and increases in exercise did nothing for me. I got frustrated and depressed about myself so I called my PCP and told him I wanted to try wellbutrin xl, because I heard its does the same thing and often causes people to lose weight rather than gain. I have been taking the generic Buproprion SR now for a little over a month and I am completely miserable. Apparently, people who have anxiety are not supposed to take this drug because it only treats depression and a side effect of it is an increase in anxiety. I have been experiencing loss of appetite but that come with nausea and queasiness-- I feel like I am pregnant (and I am not!). My head feels like its out of whack and I cant really describe the way that it messes with my vision and hearing without sounding like a whack job. My doctor should have known that this drug, with is an SNRI will not help me the way an SSRI does because of my anxiety. This past weekend I graduated college-- an important part of my life-- and I felt incredibly hostile and would go from screaming at my friends and family to bawling my eyes out in 2.5 secs. Thanks, doc. I am glad that I have google and WebMD to tell me what I should/should not take, because he apparently cannot. 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/8/2009 12:43:03 AM	I have suffered with depression for approx 8 years. I have been prescribed Lexapro, Zoloft, Celexa and Paxil. Meds seem to work well for a time period (different with each medicine) &amp; then they just seem to stop working for me.  I just recently switched from Paxil to Wellbutrin XL (generic). The first two days I took it, I felt wonderful! I felt like the old me again! Then I became dizzy &amp; tired. I had constant headache &amp; unending nausea - and I've only been taking it for about a week.  I haven't taken it in for two days now and I am still having horrible stomach problems and dizziness.  The only good thing so far is that I am not smoking as much, only about 2 or 3 cigarettes a day from smoking about a pack a day. Guess I will be going back to the doctor very soon for something else. I wish there was an easier way of finding a medication that worked. I feel like a lab rat going through all these different medicines! I wish everyone the best of luck with finding the medicine(s) that work for you.

I'm dizzy, withcy, impatient and full of energy (which is good) but not when I think everyone else is stupid and go on and on about it.  I can't drive safely to work so I took the day off.  Hopefully my PCP can figure out something else.  These reviews really help.  Thanks everyone!
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	5/2/2009 9:39:22 PM	I've been on Wellbutrin xl 450mg/day for a little over two years now and for me it is what works. My mood doesn't flip at the slightest negative event and one annoying thing no longer ruins an entire day for me. I can think clearly and positively without losing my ability to be upset when there is a reason to be. (nothing like showing up to a funeral grinning and cracking jokes because you can't feel sad.) I don't have issues with getting up in the morning (well not ones that I didn't have long before the bipolar set in. I am not a morning person.) and I don't have the issues of manic episodes where I can't sleep until I have to be medicated into unconsciousness. I no longer constantly sit at my desk with the lights off holding a box cutter and staring at it for hours or go off on screaming rants about things that are trivial. I feel in control of myself and my actions as opposed to the constant feeling of being out of control; an observer in my own self destruction. This is what it does for me. Considering that we are all complex creatures of finely balanced chemicals it may not for you but that doesn't mean there isn't something that can help you regain control of your life. Take time with your physician to figure out what is right for you. And be picky it's your life if something isn't working go back to your doctor and try something else don't torture yourself and end up even worse.
Depression	concerned patient from Birmingham, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	5/2/2009 7:06:38 AM	I have been on Wellbutrin XL for almost 5 years and in the last 3 years I have had to switch to the Bupropion XL. The wellbutrin itself worked great, I had loads of energy and did not experience any of the side effects. However, since I've switched to the buprpion,(due to insurance prefering everyone use Generic),I have tried 3 other antidepressants to try to help with the side effects. My mood has changed dramatically for the worse, no energy, headaches or migraines at least 3 times a week, have not even wanted to quit smoking, and now I am at the point of just staying alone, not want to join in family functions or talk to my closest friends. I highly recommend that anyone taking Bupropion XL talk to their physician about writing a letter of referal for the name brand Wellbutrin XL to the insurance company because the Generic is not the same and does not have the equality as the Wellbutrin.

In December I began taking the 300mg XL version.  It helped me tremendously.  I had so much energy and motivation to do things.  It was a generic.  In March I had to switch my pharmacy so they gave me a different generic.  It was made by Watson.  I started getting really tired all the time.  I was constantly angry with people for no good reason and also seemed to be obbsessive compulsive.  There were also many physical side effects also.  I finally realized it was the medicine and stopped it immediately.  I began feeling so much better within 24 hours.  I can't believe the difference in these generics.  Please pay close attention to how you begin feeling when you take these.  I seriously think I would have become suicidal if I had not quit and I have never felt that way before.  If it's not working for you go to your doctor and try something else because these medicines can really change your entire personality.
Depression	Wendell , 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	4/25/2009 1:02:00 AM	I have been taking it for a few years now it works for me.
Depression	ANONYMOUS, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/22/2009 7:32:22 PM	MY DR HAS FINALLY FOUND A DRUG FOR ME. YOU MUST EAT BEFORE TAKING, AND TAKE IT IN THE MORNING. FOR ANXIETY, CLONAZAPAM, WHICH I'VE TAKEN SINCE 1996. YRS AGO I WAS DIAGNOSE WITH PTSD. GOOD LUCK AND TRY THIS COMBINATION.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	4/21/2009 11:20:32 PM	Wellbutrin alone didn't do anything for me, but together with Lexapro, I felt like a new and happy person. The only side effect that I didn't like was the low sex drive (since I am married, my husband wasn't happy about that!) But he admitted I seemed genuinely upbeat and energetic. I even decorated the house for Christmas which was incredible for me since my depression worsens around the holidays. Having tried many different meds, I think this combo works the best.
Stop Smoking	laine, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	4/21/2009 1:11:09 PM	Not a good med for me...I felt like I was on speed all the time. Agitation was the worst. I had to stop takkking it shortly after starting. 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	4/21/2009 10:41:13 AM	I have tried several different meds for anxiety/depression/OCD, each one giving me the exact side effects it has listed.  Maybe I'm just sensitive I guess.  With this one the worst was probably the constipation and blurred vision with bouts of dizzy spells where I felt off balance all of a sudden.  It seemed to work well with keeping my anxiety attacks under control and supressing some OCD tendencies but again I can't handle the side effects.  I am hoping something will work as well without the extras I don't need.  We'll see I guess...

Depression	cesium_133, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	4/19/2009 7:47:50 PM	I give Wellbutrin 5 stars for ease of use, as it's just a regular pill.  However, I experienced a paradoxical reaction to the medicine about 48 hours after first use.  Interestingly, the first time I used it, I felt better.  Not the next... I felt like I wanted to die.  I have had depression most of my life, and this beat everything I have ever felt (this was a -1 dose- effect, btw).  I quit taking it immediately and tossed it in the trash.  I had an appointment with my psychiatrist the next day, and told him all about it.  Normally, a doctor would say not to miss a dose (which I did by not taking it the next morning) without asking, but mine said he was glad I got off it.  Desipramine works better for me.Not suggesting that this is a poor drug; I'm sure it's great for many people.  However, believe it when they say it can have side effects or make you feel worse...
Bipolar Depression	wendy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/18/2009 7:56:56 PM	This was the worst med I ever took I almost went into the hospital because of it I thought everyone was trying to kil me and my kids I was always hiding in the basement my family members would always have to look and find me I would lock myself in the closet so noone could get me. I would get lost driving around the block or going to the store all in all I was very paranoid,confused all the time and scared for my life as well as my kids life. I would never take that medicine again.

That was a year ago. Now I've decided to get back on it for depression again related to job loss, etc and also for anxiety. It has really helped and haven't had any side effects.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/14/2009 12:34:59 PM	I began taking wellbutrin with fluoxetine after ovarian cancer.

This is not about Wellbutrin, but the generic, Budeprion SR 150 mg x2. Irritability, jitters, at first, with 2nd dose at noon--super-witch, anger replaying itself.  I checked reviews of generic first, before reading here.  Many of the same comments were made.  At first, it seemed to work w/Lexapro.  Then after weening from Lexapro I  felt so brain racing and fatigue from the event.  Thought it was the Lexapro withdrawal.  Paid attention to my reactions after a.m. dose only and then with noon dose.  There appears to be a cumulative negative effect, producing more irrational impatience.  I'm scared; will discuss w/psych after having read generic reviews and Wellbutrin reviews.  I  do not normally have bad reactions to any kinds of medication.  NB: the generic medication seemed to work w/ Lexapro for a year. I've been on the genric Budeprion SR for two months. I'll ask to switch to the Wellbutrin and write back.  I've been retired about a year--I should be relaxed.   
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/13/2009 6:16:05 PM	Have been on Wellbutrin XL for almost 7 years and I absolutely love it. I take it in combination with ZOLOFT. Have had NO side effects. Mood is positive and I've been steady at 300MG's for awhile. 
Depression	LiveAndLearn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	4/13/2009 3:15:54 PM	I took this medication about 3 wks for depression. In that time I went from being my easy going sweet self to a witch on wheels. It was bad enough for my whole family to sit me down. I was later diagonsed with bi-polar due to extremely stressful conditions. I'm not sure if this medication exaserbated that problem since at the time it had gone undiagnosed. I would recommend before starting anything for depression you make sure that's all you're dealing with.
Other	libby1965, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	4/12/2009 10:56:38 AM	I was on Lexapro for several months. I gained several pounds, had no sex drive and felt tired all of the time. My dr. started me on Budeprion SR 150 MG 2x daily. I began it last Wed. I feel dizzy and out of sorts, I also am having trouble sleeping and am having very vivid dreams. After reading some of the reviews, I am wondering if I should ask my dr. for the brand name drug or if I should try to wait it out.

This stuff is so good they should put it in the water supply! I have energy, my spastic boss does not get me annoyed anymore. I am calm, I can deal with life's little problems much easier now. Have only been taking it for about a month. A little dry mouth is well worth it!! I have lost 16 pounds since I started taking it. No desire to drink any alcohol even a glass of wine tastes terrible now. Losing weight and feeling great!
Depression	lazybonz,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		4/7/2009 11:02:49 AM	I have been on wellbutrin for 15 years-I came off of it for a short time but the anxiety caused me to return to it again. Like most depression sufferers I have tried many drugs over the years but this one has the least side effects and works great. I occasionally get dry mouth so you do need to stay hydrated.  I was a smoker and a drinker and have kicked both habits as the drug really does reduce cravings for any pleasure. Unfortunately that does include sex as well-it does decrease your libido but that can be overcome if you work at it! It does not decrease the pleasure level but the desire to get started just isn't there. I did have a period of time where I was not eating as it does also take away your cravings for food. My hubby loves to eat so he makes me eat too,so I have not had anorexia since I met him but I did with my first husband. So I would say that an understanding mate goes a long way toward helping to make this drug a success. I take 150 sr upon waking and before bed. My insurer is also pushing the generic but that did not work for me. I understand there are some generics that are better than others and if the cost is a factor you could try those first. I am convinced that wellbutin treats alcoholism because it runs in my family and I was a problem drinker until I took wellbutrin. I can have a drink now and not want another-but that may just be me. It is sure worth a try if you drink too much-I don't know why it is not more widely used for treating alcoholism because it works. You do have to take wellbutrin for 60 to 90 days to get the full effect of the drug.During that time you do have dry mouth but that subsides after a while and was not a significant problem for me. I am 62 years old so I don't know how much longer I will take it but the doctors seem to think that it is a lifelong drug. It has made a drastic change in my life and I recomend it highly!!
Depression	sunshine , 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	4/5/2009 3:51:26 PM	I have had depression for many years and my doc put me on this drug quite a number of years ago.  It has helped me with mental capacities in thinking and not being so depressed as in the past.  If you need this drug I advise your pscychiatrist to consider this drug for you.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/3/2009 12:33:55 PM	I have been on antidepressants every since a bought with post partum 9 years ago.  I have tried it all.  Paxil made me sleepy and sweat but relieved anxiety, Prozac gave me tons of energy but made me 'crazy' and moody, Cymbalata made my anxiety go thru the roof, Celexa didn't do anything. I was on Zoloft for years, it was great for the anxiety but not the depression.  I slept a lot and just had no ambition to do anything more than I had to. I am now on the generic of this - 150 the first week and I am in day 2 of 300mg.  I LOVE IT SO FAR!!  My energy is through the roof, my fog of depression has lifted and I feel great.  My only side affect so far is that I seem to have an aching back, that could be due to the anxiety level needing to balance out.  However, I will take a slightly aching back over no energy and sleeping all of the time!One thing I have learned is that everyone reacts differently to each med. so you just have to find the one that works for you.
Depression	graybaby, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/2/2009 1:34:16 PM	Hi!! My name is Nancy. I've been on and off off Effexor for 3 years, I didn't find that it worked, but if I took one every few days I would get immediate results. After being to my doctor, I needed something for my depression and to quit smoking, so here it is, day 1. Please keep me in your thoughts, as I am for you guys. I hope to god this will work. If anyone would like to talk about this drug or effexor, email me at nancy.gray85@hotmail.com , I would love to get feedback. Thanks
Depression	tracym97, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/2/2009 10:53:11 AM	I have been taking the bupropion SR for about 6 months now and my hubby can see a marked difference in my mood.  I still get a little moody, but he says I am not a psycho anymore.  I also take xanax 2x per day and evening primrose oil with Vitex to help with woman mood swings.  MAJOR difference! Hubby is loving the change in me.

Depression	Ruth, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	2	5	Female	65-74	3/31/2009 6:23:33 PM	Have taken this over 10 yrs, very effective for keeping me in sane stable mood w/o inappropriate crying.  I can cope .  I tried stopping several times, became immediately in major depression.  I started with low dose,gradually over the years increased to 300mg.  I have tried every version and every generic and brand name, each one is a little different because of absorption rate is differs from brand to brand.  All are effective, but I do notice differences if affect and side-effects.  Some are absorbed more slowly so work best when take b4 bedtime to not interfere with sleep, but others donot.  Also different people will experience different absorption rates between brands and dosages.  So you all hang in their, talk to your Dr.

Depression	joyousq, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/29/2009 7:48:49 PM	Was prescribed the generic Bupropion HCL for mild depression and anxiety.  The first few days on 150 mg were a little scary.  I had a headache the entire time.  This only lasted about 3 days.  On the fifth day started 300 mg.  Loved the energy boost and eveniness of my mood. I also immediately quit smoking...have tried quitting many times before with no success. I started getting bad cramps and realized I was horribly constipated.  Tried upping my fiber and fluid intakes but nothing helped.  I had to stop taking it because of this...BUMMER.  I really liked this med and wish I could continue but I can't take laxative everyday to conteract the constipation!!!!!!!  Some decrease in sexual desire did occur.  My doc prescribed me Effexor XR and I filled the ordered but I do not think I will try this one because of the horrible things I have been reading about it.  I will be asking her about Cymbalta because the reviews seem much more positive.  I wish the makers of Wellbutrin/Bupripion could fix the constipation issue because it worked great for me!
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/29/2009 5:40:19 PM	Wellbutrin has worked well for me for 10 yrs. Now generics have taken over. My insurance plan is now forcing me to use bupropion and/or budeprion. Both make want to jump from a bridge. I use generics for other issues with no complaints. There should be provisions for those who are not able to shift from the name brand. Thanks for your understanding Glaxo/Smith/Klein. Instead of paying $25/month, I'm paying over $350.00.

However, like several of the following responders, I've was so exhausted and nauseated taking the Wellbutrin generic, I'm wondering what gives?  Is there are formuary difference from the original name brand?   Surely so many of us should not be experiencing exactly the opposite prescribed expectations?     I had to stop taking the pills.  I was too sick and drowsy all day long for weeks.  What gives?

Depression	~Jilly Jill~, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/26/2009 7:49:57 PM	UPDATE- I last wrote about 3 weeks ago and I had just started taking this medication.  I wasn't given the XL to start off with and for some reason...just couldn't remember to take 1 pill 3 times a day.  I am a SUPER busy mom and full time college student (aren't we all super busy though?).  Anywho, After 2 weeks I went to the doc to let him know about my difficulty and THEN he gave me the XL...it is SO much easier taking 1 pill in the morning and being done with it.  So far, things seem to be improving.  I am on the 300.  It has ALSO cut back my craving to smoke (AWESOME..since taxes went through the roof..again).  My depression seems to be getting a little better but I haven't experienced any weight loss that I was REALLY looking forward to.  LOL!  I am giving the XL a month to &quot;kick in&quot; and hopefully by then my depression will have subsided or at least decreased more.  Oh...ALSO...I AM tired ALL THE TIME!  But if the medication helps me smile again and feel &quot;normal&quot; then perhaps less sleep and an occasional redbull will make it all worth while  :o)Good luck to everyone who is taking this...I not only hope it works for me...but for all of you as well!!!~Many Blessings~Jilly Jill
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/26/2009 5:10:52 PM	Wellbutrin XL 300 mg is what I am on.  I was on 150 mg Wellbutrin 2x daily.  Since starting the XL, I have had horrible nausea.  Lost weight!, but I could think of better ways of losing weight!  I have been very very tired, no energy, feel like I have been hit by a Mac truck!  I asked the dr. and he said to give it another week or so and if it doesn't clear up he will change it.  I hope it the side effects go away soon, I can't stand feeling like this...Sometimes I don't think I will make it through the drive to work or through the night w/out vomiting...  Anyone else have these symptoms this bad?

It is a very uncommon side effect, but since I am a beader, I am no longer able to bead with the tiny beads I loved. Even after being off Wellbutrin for over 4 yrs., my hands still experience tremors. Worked O.K. for the depression, but still felt &quot;below normal&quot;.

I went up to two doses the second week and thought I was going to die so I went back down to one.  I have never been happier.  I expect to feel the side effects of every new drug that I take, but I know that if I let them work themselves out there will be light at the end of the tunnell.  I always give myself a month on a new med before giving up.  I did have to go down on the dose because the side effects I was feeling were a medical concern but they went away two days after I went down.

I then tried prozac, it did not seem to work as effective as the paxil, and still put weight on me(also increased appetite like paxil) At this point I took matters into my hands, began researching and decided I liked what I read about wellbutin, I have been on it about 3 months now and its the best yet, without the unwanted  side effects.

Depression	jenjen, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/19/2009 9:45:13 AM	I was taking Effexor for a little over two years but then felt like it wasn't working anymore so my DR. lowered my dosage of that and started me on Wellbutrin. It has been a week and a half and I have never felt more miserable in my life. I am more depressed then I have been, no energy and so dizzy it makes everything difficult. I don't know whether I should stick with it, or stop. My Dr. is aware but I don't feel that she understands what I am going thru. If you have had similar experiences, I would love to hear about it.

I had a terrible reation to it.  I felt completely depressed(which I am pretty much always happy)I felt as though I couldn't go on living and my panic attacks became much, much worse.  It was very scary. Luckily I thought about it and told myself that thsi was not me and that it must be an effect from the medicine.  I felt better after one day of being off it and went on Zoloft.  Which worked for me.  If you do take the medicine and have any of these feeling...remember please call your doctor.  It is not you...it is the medicine.

No bad side effects yet but I am scared of all the negative feedback I'm reading about this drug. My Dr. 1st suggested Lexapro or Zoloft but I heard horror stories about those 2 &amp; Dr. felt this was the better of the 3 evils.  I hated caving into the use of meds to combat my depression but I've been battling it for far too long not to do something about it.  Can anyone tell me some POSITIVE REASONS why I should continue use??? &amp; How hard is it to wean yourself off of it????? Jill, I read your comments.  Would love to chat:  gigiandmommy@hotmail.com

Depression	JillyJill, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	25-34	3/13/2009 7:25:47 PM	I have been on this medication for almost a week now. I was given this medication for depression, weight loss, and to help me quit smoking.  I was originally diagnosed with Hypothyroidism and then after many tests, I was advised that I didn't have it (ARGH!). I have tried many other medications such as Adipex, Merida, Lexapro, Effexor...etc and have had no success (with MAJOR side effects), so this is kinda my last hope and I'm praying this will work.  I haven't experienced any side effects yet (maybe just a little more tired), but it hasn't been that long.  I just want to feel &quot;normal&quot; again and be able to function as a &quot;happy&quot; parent should.  Please keep me in your prayers as I will keep you all in mine.  Also, if anyone has any additional info they would like to share...I welcome it!  Thanks so much!~Jill~

I felt short-tempered - I could just about bite somebody's head off that crossed me or even looked at me the wrong way.  I am now taking Lexapro and doing much better!
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	35-44	3/10/2009 10:09:15 AM	I took Welbutrin for approximately 4 years. I just stopped taking it within the last month or so. I now feel much better. I believe that Welbutrin may have contributed to my anxiety and moods. I felt very anxious and was extemely moody. I feel so much better now being off of it for a month. The positive of this med is, no sexual side effects and weight loss. 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	3/10/2009 3:39:23 AM	I have been taking this medication for about 6 years.  My hair began falling out about six months ago and I think it started when I switched to generic budeprion xl and increased my dosage.  Luckily I have thick hair, but I have lost about 50% of my hair and my doctor insists it is not a side effect of the medication.  Does anyone know when or if my hair will stop falling out? I am starting to freak out, the Wellbutrin has been great for treating my Depression, but losing my hair at age 31 is stressing me out.

I stopped taking it recently and feel so much better! I was so sleepy before and wasn't able to concentrate, which was my big concern. I'm still on Lexapro and feel that medication, along with focusing less on me and more on the Lord, are all I need to start living again. Pray for me...I've been in a very dark place and I am just now feeling the son's warmth upon my weary soul.

Stop Smoking	angel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	3/1/2009 10:50:29 AM	I was prescribed this med to help with weight loss and to help me quit smoking. Wellbutrin was effective in those areas but once I was  told to increase from one table to one and a half the gates of hell were open. I began to fell trapped in my own body and wanted to get out by killing my self. I would cry uncontrollable and even wanted to kill my husband. It felt like I was walking in water. I was told by a pastor to stop taking this immediately. Once I stopped I have not had a day of depression. I used to get depressed often. My advise is do not take this med unless you really have to try to quit smoking and lose weight on your own. I pray that those of you who are taking this will not experience the negative effects that I had.

Depression	ABMN, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	2/24/2009 8:24:38 PM	In Dec 2007 I was prescribed Wellbutrin 150mg, after the initial few weeks it just didn't seem to be working. My doctor bumped me up the the XL. It started working almost immediately. It felt as if the veil and earmuffs had been removed and colors and sounds became real again. I was extremely happy with the 50 lbs I lost. Sex drive came back with a vengeance. No listed side effects. It is now Feb 2009 and it doesn't seem to be working anymore; back to being irritable, short tempered and just sad. Going to Dr in 2 days to see if something else will work. One side effect that I can't find anyone else having is it messed with my period, even on birth control. My period would come whenever it wanted regardless of what week of pills I was on. Once I switched to taking the BCP at night and Wellbutrin XL in the a.m. it seemed to get MUCH better. Now that the wellbutrin isn't working as great, my cycle is completely whacked. Usually one week w/o it, then get it for a few days, then another week w/o, etc. Doctors say it has nothing to do with each other but I have been on the same BCP for almost 6 years and it didn't happen until I started taking the Wellbutrin XL.

Im in my 30s, so can anyone in their 30s, female, taking this medication for the same reasons, or similair, let me know if it worked for you?  Thanks.Regards: JLL

Only took it a short time, didnt want to become dependent on it.  My counseling worked better than the pill.

However, now that I am only working part time, I can no longer afford it and have to take a generic prescription.  Not happy at all.  It also decreased my smoking.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/16/2009 1:17:26 AM	I began taking this drug when I was suffering from depression that was severe enough to affect my job, family relationships, socializing with friends, etc.  The difference between how I feel today versus one year ago has been profound. I combine Wellbutrin XL 150mg with Adderall XR 15mg during the week, and take just the Wellbutrin on weekends (when I don't work).  I have had few negative side effects-- the two noticeable are the dry mouth (the dryness affects intercourse as well) and hair loss, which I experienced when I was on the 300 mg dose.  I backed down to the 150mg and the hair loss has stopped.  I am grateful I was prescribed this drug first-- it really does work quite well.

Because I don't have insurance, I spent a while on the generic version and failed to progress out of my depressive state. For a few weeks I felt like I was mildly feeling a change, but eventually it felt like I had plateaued, and shortly after, I returned to spiraling downward.    There were other medications added and subtracted to Wellbutrin in order to determine the right combination of drugs to aid my depression/anxiety/ADD. I AM POSITIVE that my only improvement was the result of other medications (Lamictal- mood stabilizer).    It has been documented that the generic version of this drug does NOT produce the same progressive results as the name brand. I can confidently say, that my experience w/ Bupropion was not a good one, in fact, I'd say it was horrible, and at times, worse than my initial state.   I have been back to taking the name brand Wellbutrin XL for about 3-4 months. I have continued to feel a drastic improvement in my mental state, and finally recognize the person that I knew I always was. It has enabled me to live my life again.      Although I have felt such a great improvement, the cost is $167 (that's with insurance), which is the CO-PAY! Without the insurance, the cost is $230-$270, and very few insurance companies offer reasonable coverage for Wellbutrin XL, since the generic version was approved.
Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	2/12/2009 3:19:26 PM	I took Bupropion, only 15 mg, for three days.

When the time changes on the east coast is when the dark moods would set in.  After being on this for 4 years the time changes don't effect me anymore.

It definetly helped me overcome my depression for a while. However the drug did give me seizures. I'd take 5 or 6 Wellbutrins a day (as opposed to one)to get high and lose wieght. This gave me grand mal seizures. I stopped the drug and resumed my pill regimen months later, vowing to take only one pill a day. I did, but still had seizures. The seizures weren't a result of overdosing on the wellbutrin. They happened because I was taking them while abusing street drugs (Ecstasy and Cocaine). Please, tell you doctor if you have a drug problem or are prone to overdosing on OTC/prescription pills for fun. I crashed my car into a tree during one of the seizures I had. (PS Do not take if you have an eating disorder. Weight loss is common in users)
Depression	me27513, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/10/2009 6:16:50 PM	Why do docs use only one drug at a time? After 20 years of experimenting with SSRIs, I have an almost ideal combo of Wellbutrin XL (generic) 150 mg each morning PLUS Lexapro 10 mg each night. Wellbutrin made me hyper at first, so I lowered the dosage. It has no negative sexual side effects, so it balances Lexapro nicely (in fact, it has the opposite effect). No weight gain, late-night munchies, sleeping all the time. It's truly different from all the rest. Effexor was awful, Paxil made me fat, Zoloft made me sleepy, Prozac made me nuts, and none of those helped my depression. Wellbutrin saved me, I don't build up a tolerance (even after 10 years), and its generics are so much cheaper than the alternatives. If you're not doing well with the standard Rx, try this...it's truly different, and ask your doc about combining meds.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/10/2009 3:25:59 PM	I have been on this medication for about 3 or 4 weeks now and feel amazing.

My only complaint is that I've had some ringing in my ears, who knows maybe it will go away.
Depression	teslagirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	2/10/2009 2:08:19 PM	I had to vote along the middle on this one. It took about 3 months for it to fully work. For 8 months I felt absolutely wonderful. I had energy &amp; drive to exercise, I smiled &amp; laughed again. Did not help my anxiety but I still take Lorazepam for that. In the last 3 weeks (about a year since I started it) I've become very depressed, irritated at stupid things, angry. This morning my doctor said sometimes it just doesn't work anymore. She prescribed Cymbalta so I'm going to wean off of Wellbutrin while weaning onto Cymbalta over the next 6 weeks.  I do know people who got WORSE using Wellbutrin, I know some who love it after years of use. I was right in the middle. I loved it but it just stopped working. Also I lost the 25 lbs that I had gained on Lexapro once the Wellbutrin worked.

It really helps visualize what is wrong and what needs to be worked on. If you start missing doses, you will fall pretty hard so be careful about that. That is the set back about some drugs, though take them as prescribed. If not regularly, tell doctor and why that is. For me, it has better results with Abilify.

Depression	SweetButterfly, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/5/2009 9:38:40 PM	I have been in treatment for depression for over 25 years and have tried many different antidepressants over the years. Wellbutrin has been a life saver for me. It works very well for me combined with Effexor XR.  Took a long time to find a combination that worked. I have more control over my emotions, irritability,anger and suicidal thoughts. I feel so &quot;normal&quot; sometimes I forget my meds. Isn't long before (24-48 hours) before I notice a difference and get back in control. Unfortunately, my medical insurance changed this year and instead of a $35.00 co-pay, it is now $215.00 co-pay for the Wellbutrin. I am guessing it is to force folks to get the generic. I refuse, I know I will not do as well on the generic.I am scared,I do not want to go through the misery of finding a substitute. What if I can't find something that works as well for me?   I have had minor side effects,dry mouth mostly.

I pay the higher price for the name brand.  If you researched this you will find a lot of people have problems with the generic  for wellbutrin.

All previous medications were either ineffective, or caused intolerable side effects. Wellbutrin, for me, is a miracle drug, allowing me to function like a normal person. At one time I was unable to afford it, and had to wean myself off of it. By three months without it, I was in a full blown depressed state, wanting to sleep all the time, crying, and thinking irrationally. Now back on Wellbutrin XL I can once again enjoy my life, and I feel human again.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	1/29/2009 8:23:27 PM	I noticed increased energy immediately and my depression has completely gone away. I quit smoking as well as lost nine pounds. I went from the verge of dropping out of school to finishing the semester with A's and B's. ALL GOOD!!!!! One side effect was an initial loss of sleep-which faded. I also have a high resting heart rate because of the epinephrine in this med. I think this could be harmful long-term.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	1/29/2009 1:36:22 PM	I was prescribed Wellbutrin XL when Cymbalta made me constipated and caused a total loss of sexual desire. While my sexual desire did return after taking this drug, I became SO irritable!! I had horrible temper flare-ups, and my mood was constantly on a roller coaster. Crying one minute, screaming the next. Absolutely not worth the horrible side effects that come with it.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Shopgirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/27/2009 9:37:22 PM	I have mild-moderate adult ADD.  Initially I was prescribed this 150mg twice daily by my PCP and noticed a remarkable difference in my ability to focus and concentrate, and it improved my mood.  Unfortunately the dosage was too high to start out with and I had very uncomfortable heart palpitations and was dropped back to 100mg twice daily.  That continued to help my mood and memory a great deal but I didn't have the benefit of the focus and concentration.  Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist and still taking 75mg daily of this plus some Ritalin, which is helping me to concentrate better and not get as distracted.   
Depression	HappyinPortland, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/25/2009 4:40:52 PM	Wellbutrin SR 150 (2x daily) has helped my depression better than Prozac, Zoloft or Paxil.   It also curbs my appetite. At first it made it difficult to get to sleep, but .50 mg of Trazadone is enough to help me get to sleep, and makes it easy to get 7-8 hours of sleep. Wellbutrin does not affect my dreams like Prozac did. With Wellbutrin I do not have the sexual side effects associated with other anti-depressants.

Depression	Angel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/23/2009 10:58:45 PM	This med worked for me after many attempts of other drugs throught the years.  It took about 3 months for me to be completely satisfied.  It also curbed my appetite and I've been able to lose 25 lbs.  Nice.  It also helps with concentration.  I haven't felt this good in over a decade. Everyone is different, so if you're trying this and don't feel the results you want and it's been less than 3 months.  Give it a chance.  An added bonus:  No sexual numbness.

Depression	Confused in PHX, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	1/23/2009 2:27:09 PM	Into my 3rd week on the generic Wellbutrin XL/300mg., 1 x per day in the A.M.  First week thought it was a miracle drug, my gloomy mood gone/energy level soared! Great appetite suppressant!! Also staying up late is no problem, before the drug I was going to bed earlier and earlier (9:00-9:30), now staying up past midnight is the norm.....BUT started having a horrible time falling to sleep. Within the second week, I started on Lunesta...well my doc must have anticipated this possible side effect and had prescribed Lunesta in conjuction with the Wellbutrin..just in case....umm...now I can't seen to not take the sleeping pill..when I have tried to go without, it's pure misery..wierd dreams, nightmares, oh so tired..until I take my mornng dosage of Wellbutrin..and then the cycle starts all over again...take the Lunesta, don't take the Lunesta..longest I've gone is 2-3 days and then I just can't take the lack of sleep! My doc said I should only take the Lunesta when I really feel I need it..hello!! I need it every night...the withdrawal effect is unbearable...2 to 3 days is the longest I've gone in not taking...also extreme inner ringing in my ears..sounds like I'm in a house full of crickets!! Maybe the 300mg is too much...anyone else experiencing the same!? Go to doc next week...we will see...

I was tired all of the time, craveing junk food, and gaining weight, not to mention zero sex drive. I just started taking 300mg of Wellbutrin Xl a week ago and I am more anxious now. My craveings did stop. Still no sex drive. Also, when I try to sleep in the dead of silence I swear I hear an inner ringing in my ears. I don't know if it's all in my head or if I really am having negitive side effects. I also find it very hard to sit still in class. I also have the same old feeling of hoplessness and anxiety about everything. Does anyone have any input on this?

The drug worked well for anxiety and depression but strange side effects: very angry; upset stomach; and maybe a good one: didn't want to drink alcohol, coffee, didn't want to smoke. I stopped because side effects were too great.
Depression	rollercoaster, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/17/2009 5:39:36 PM	I have taken Wellbutrin for depression since 1991 in combination with Clonazepam.  I had extreme weight loss but eventually the weight came back after a couple of years on a decreased maintenance dose.  It has been very effective in helping me through menopause.  I can taper off during non-stressful and non-hormonal times.
Depression	susantoo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	1/15/2009 6:45:27 PM	I don't think this med helped my depression at all.  One of my doctors think it may aggravate my irritability.  Exactly what I don't need.  This is a med to skip. Its worthless to quit smoking, and useless for depression, in my experience. No side effects besides possibly contributing to my irritability, but no proof that the wellbutrin has anything to do with it.  I wouldn't bother trying this drug. 
Stop Smoking	susantoo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	1/15/2009 6:42:16 PM	Didn't make the slightest bit of difference.  I used it for depression, as well, with the same results.  In fact, I think it made me crankier!!

I use this medication in combination with Zoloft. For many years, I had been taking a very small dosage with an &quot;ok&quot; effect. I switched psychiatrists and we increased the dosage. Since then, I have had very wonderful success with using Wellbutrin. I would definitely recommend this medication, but you have to be the one to decide if it is working for you or not. Be proactive in your treatment! After all, it is your life!!

I did quit smoking as it made me sick when I did smoke. I started back smoking after a year on the medication when I was having relationship issues. I just keep taking the medication for depression. My moods seem to be leveled out now so there is no reason for me to quit taking it. I also take Zoloft and I have found that taking Wellbutrin in the morning and Zoloft at night has really helped me. I feel great now.

I have been prescribed different medications due to insurance.  When Wellbutrin went generic I was prescribed it again.  It took about four weeks before I seemed to notice a difference.  I am not as hungry, and I am having a easier time with my emotionsbut I think the dose needs to be higher.  I have not had any of the listed side effects.

I took the generic for two weeks then switched to 150mg brand. After taking this for a month, I feel great. The depressed, gray feeling is completely gone, and I have more energy. I haven't noticed any side effects, but I did lose about five pounds (which I wanted to do anyway). I eat less now but feel much healthier. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this drug.

It worked great with the Zoloft, it gave me that extra boost I needed to help me back to being myself again. I could no longer afford the medications when i left the military so i decided to stop them cold turkey and did not have any side effects like i did when trying to be weaned off just the zoloft. I think this is a great medication and can help when taken with other medications when you dont want to up the doses anymore, this can give you a different mix to help. It's worth a shot

It does curb that urge. Just don't think so much about it and maybe you'll find what I did.. 
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/24/2008 10:43:44 AM	I was diagnosed a few years ago with bipolar depression after a suicide attempt. I was on a few others that did nothing for me. I now take wellbutrin xl 300mg. I was told to take it in the morning because it might keep me up, but I take it at night with my other meds.  I take seroquel 400mg, so that knocks me out.  I used to have nightmares, but ever since I was put on the generic, not so much. I still wake up scared sometimes.  I dont know if its just me but I feel that the generic is not as effective. I dont have any side effects really unless the dreams count. It works wonderful for me. I love it. Keeps me more stable and in a better mood.
Depression	BobbyPeru, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	12/23/2008 5:18:12 PM	Prior to this medication (I take the generic, Bupropion XL), I had tried a couple of different medications. None of them worked well.  Then, my doctor prescribed this. After about three weeks, I noticed that I would wake up without the customary depression that had been afflicting me for over a year and a half. Mind you, the depression has not gone away, but it has lessened greatly. The medication also sped up my metabolism and I lost weight. Nice. I also have more energy and my mind is not as lethargic as before. I take the medication with Lamictyl for anxiety and mood swings. Bupropion's side effects are occasional hyperactivity,  occasional stomachaches and frequent visits to the number for number 2, which may be caused by my sped up metabolism. Furthermore, my libido has increased and my performance in that department has improved. I am fortunate to be taking these medication and hope the benefits to not subside with time. Again, I emphasize that the depression has not ceased completely, but it has lessened in frequency and intensity.

Torture is the best way to discribe it. I tried Effexor, Lexapro &amp; Prozac. I experienced absolutly no relief from any of these.  Then I tried Wellbutrin.  I thank God for the relief I felt within the first week.  I am taking 150 mg once a day &amp; feel that this is a little on the low side as far as dosage.  I have no side effects.  I would recomend this medication but not in generic form.  The generic affected me in a bad way with many side effects.  If your depression is brought on by Chantix try Wellbutrin.  I hope this helps.

I scared my husband he said I just wasn't acting right.. Also it made me feel like I was numb to feelings which bothered me since I just lost my father due to very bad circumstances.

I also took lunesta to handle a sleep disorder (waking up like clockwork 3 hours into my sleep). I needed something to schock my out of my usual habits of depressiveness, and it did shock me, but made me different, but not much better. Made me much more volatile, although happier in general. When I would have a low, although less often, they would feel like life or death lows. And my tension increased. But it did change things, atleast, just not for much better. But different, but still bad, is better than same and still bad.It was easy to use. Only thing is trying to take it regularly and trying not to get drunk while taking it.I'm pretty neutral about satisfaction. I believe it may work for some, but it increased my volatility, although it did do *something*, atleast.Now I am on lexapro. Just started it.

It made me fall into a deeper depression to the point that I thought I would never stop crying. I called the doctor by the 3rd day and she told me to stop at once. You know yourself so when you start on a new med please watch out for signs that its is having a adverse affect on you so your doctor can get you the right one. 
Depression	fed up with drugs, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	12/9/2008 10:50:37 PM	I took the generic form for about 6 months in combination with Effexor XR. We tried many different dosages, but I had awful side affects-constipation, sweating, ringing in the ears, weird weight fluctuations, and almost constant headaches.Having to take it two or three times a day was really diffult to manage. I continued to feel sad, hopeless, and TIRED. I slept all the time. This medication did NOT work for me at all and I weaned myself from it according to my doctor's instructions. I am now on Paxil and still have constant fatigue and headaches. Although Paxil has worked for me in the past, it's not doing for me what it used to. After the fiasco with Wellbutrin, I am not looking forward to trying yet another medication.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/9/2008 7:46:02 PM	This is the first medication that I have taken for depression. Within two weeks there was a positive noticeable difference in how I felt physically and my perception (of everything.)This drug has been a great help in getting myself in order; I am no longer afraid to go outside and walk by people, I enjoy challenges again!Side-effects: dry mouth
Depression	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	12/8/2008 6:16:50 PM	My husband suffers fron chronic depression, anxiety and PSTD for which he takes a cocktail of medications presscribed by his Psychiatrist.  With the Wellbutrin XL as part of his regimine, his moods are more even as he only has to take the medication once a day;  with a twice daily medication, he would often forget to take the second dosage so I  love the time release aspect.  He doesn't have any sexual side effects which is great and just has to watch what he eats (low carb diet) to keep the weight off.  I am every pleased with the effect this has had on his depression.
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/8/2008 4:05:32 AM	I have been taking this medication for about 5 years, 150mg to 300mg then back down to 200mg.  I recently increased the dosage to 450 and my hair has been falling out.  I noticed several other people with the same complaint, why isn't this listed as a possible side effect?

I discovered that I was very tearful, extremly panicked, and suicidal.  I took it for about 2 weeks.  I finally managed to quit smoking cold turkey!I am happy to say I have been smoke-free for 5 years mostly because of prayer and a serious exercise regimen.

I have Sjogrens Syndrome and it's difficult to manage the dryness along with medications which increase this effect. Otherwise, it has helped with depression management.

But I think it's causing problems with my vision (red,dry, blurred vision) and really bad acne. Has anyone else ever experienced acne with this medication??
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/3/2008 12:31:50 AM	Wellbutrin has really seemed to help me with depression.  I have a tendency to be anxious and I don't really think it does too much to help with that.  The only side effect is that I feel a bit jittery but feel more alert.  Also, it has definitely cut my appetite which has helped get rid of a little extra weight that I put on over the past year (which I think was due to Zoloft and depression).
Depression	Depressed , 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	45-54	12/2/2008 11:20:54 PM	It did seem to help my depression but did nothing for the anxiety. Actually it made the anxiety problem twice as bad. Overall it was ok for the depression but I could not maintain an erection for nothing while I was taking this product. Which is due to the anxiety issue caused by this product. One minute I was semi hard and as soon as I would think about my problem, it would just shibble up. Or even if I heard a sound like the wind blow, the party was over. I have stopped taking this product for only a week now and Ole Willie is standing proud again.The only problem is now I can see a slight depression behavior problem returning and I do not know what to do. I do not want to have issues but if I can't enjoy having a sex life, it's depressing too!

Depression	Darth42, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	11/29/2008 4:26:33 PM	I've been on Bupropion (generic of Wellbutrin) for 5 weeks now. I started at 75mg 2x/day, and am currently at 100mg 2x/day.  My depression symptoms have subsided and I am more comfortable around people with less irritability.  However, I continue to have anxiety and constant worry (Generalized Anxiety Disorder).  It appears that Wellbutrin does not list this as one of the treatable conditions.  I am considering switching to Prozac instead.  One major plus about Wellbutrin is that it has had no sexual side effects on me, unlike other antidepressants I've tried before such as Paxil and Lexapro.  Also, I haven't had any weight gain from taking Wellbutrin; however, my appetite has increased (I get hungry quicker).  If depression is the only condition to be treated, then I would recommend Wellbutrin.

My depression was worst upon awakening...very bad, with suicidal thoughts. wellbutrin has cleared that up almost 100%  I take it with breakfast..easy to remember. Orignally, I took 150mg, 3x/day. Now I take the300mg XL and it is more effective than the 150.
Depression	bck, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/27/2008 1:34:20 PM	I noticed I had a hand tremors when I started using but under's a doctor's supervison deciding to keep taking at a lower dose.  I've been on it for two years but lately I'm starting to think it has lost some of its effectiveness.  I'm going to ask my doctor about increasing the dose to 300 mg a day up from the 150 mg. I take now to see if that helps.  I'm wondering if I have developed a tolerance to it.    
Stop Smoking	skygypsy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/27/2008 10:00:48 AM	I used this drug 4 years ago to stop smokeing.  I took it for 8 weeks.  The first 2 weeks I smoked as I normally would.  Day 15 I put down the cigs and have had no desire to somke since that day.  Wonderful drug, very little adverse side effects
Depression	tat2moon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	11/26/2008 8:41:43 AM	I'm 27, female, with a long history of severe depression. I've been taking generic Wellbutrin 75mg for less than a week now, and so far it seems to be helping. I'm sometimes groggy in the morning, but it goes away and I feel awake and clear-headed all day. One unusual thing: by evening I sometimes feel anxious, and two nights ago I had a full-blown panic attack and could not stop crying and feeling scared. I had a very stressful day at work though so maybe I can attribute the panic to that. I also notice changes in my appetite, like I will be hungry but not want food, or feel full after three bites of something. My energy level seems better, and I don't feel a lack of sexual desire like I did before the drug. The flat, gray feeling seems to be lessening. Overall, I do feel better, like a fog has been lifted off of me.In two weeks I'll switch to the brand-name version at 150mg, so hopefully things keep improving. Hope this helps!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	deannad, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	11/26/2008 4:38:06 AM	In the fifth grade I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was originally prescribed Ritalin but can not take stimulants due to a weird reaction and I developed Tourettes Syndrome.  After years of trial and error with medications I have settled with Strattera 60mg and Wellbutrin XL 150 mg.  They work well together. The Wellbutrin helps with ADHD, depression, and helps balance the irritability I get from strattera, however it does make me more anxious, which is hard to live with.  The Strattera lets me concentrate and my grades are decent in my third year college. With any drug there are side affects but after six years the Wellbutrin is still working. It doesn't seem as harsh as other drugs and the weight management is just a bonus.  If I forget to take it my day is not so smooth.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/21/2008 8:49:31 AM	After trying Lexapro, this drug was the right fit for me.  Honestly, it was like putting on a pair of glasses for the first time after not realizing you'd been looking a blurry world.  It did make it easier to get up in the morning, it didn't affect my weight, it didn't affect my sex drive or the quality of sex, AND it really improved my daily depression.  Apparently it is the only anti-depressant that doesn't have any usual sexual side effects, if that's something important to you.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	11/20/2008 1:27:54 PM	This medication was okay for a while. But the Doctor kept upping the dose. I took it with Prozac also. The sucidal thoughts never left my mind and I finally tried to kill myself. I don't recommend this for anyone with MDD. I was glad and my life has been happier when I got off both of those drugs and put on something better.

Stop Smoking	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/19/2008 6:50:03 PM	Initially used it to help stop smoking/ chewing tobacco. Worked great! In addition, I found it 'energizing' and started wondering if I was dysthymic as well. Found it much easier to get out of bed in the morning and less dependent on drinking coffee to perk up.  I've taken 150mg once a day in the morning for several years and I'm very pleased with the results.  I tried taking the recommended BID dose, but the evening dose would keep me up at night and vivid dreams. I currently feel like the positive effect are slightly wearing off and I would like to slightly increase my dose to 200 mg daily in the AM.  Again, very thankful that I discovered this medication and I think it has helped me tremedously.
Bipolar Depression	45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3		45-54	11/19/2008 4:53:15 PM	I was originally prescribed Wellbutrin along with Depakote and now just taking Wellbutrin. It seem to be working well and I don't need to take the Depakote.
Other	AMS, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	11/19/2008 3:51:41 PM	I started on this medication 2 years ago after we moved to a new state and had a baby. It worked wonders but now my body has adjusted and I seem to be back where I started. After reading some of these responses, I wonder if it is because my prescription coverage had me switch to the generic version. Really - the brand name worked great with few side effects - loss of appetite, increased sweating, trouble sleeping but not snapping at every little thing my boys did was well worth it. My doctor just started me on Cymbalta ... we'll see what happens!

Depression	redcherry, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/18/2008 4:45:13 AM	I started taking this medicine for depression with the extra incentive that it would help me lose weight. Well i stopped after two days, it made me feel crazy. I felt like i was on the outside of my body looking at myself. I also felt panicky like i was going to die. Will never take this again!
Other	Poobear, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	11/17/2008 10:06:13 PM	Took SR about 3 years back for depression and it didn't seem to have too many bad effects on me, so when my GI told me that I had IBS probably caused by anxiety I thought I would give XL a shot. I did not tolerate it well at all. The first day was fine, but then the second day I felt &quot;dopey&quot; and ended up in bed with a fever later on that night. After that experience I stopped taking it but still had a low fever for a few days. I also had a weird sensation in my head that is difficult to describe. It almost felt as though I was about to lose control and have a seizure. After stopping this too went away. I will say that I am very sensitive to medications, so this may work well for some, just not me or other people with the same sensitivity. If you are sensitive to meds make sure to discuss the risks of this medication with your doctor.

It was the best thing i couldve done. Ive taken paxil,paxil cr, lamictal, lexapro, adderal, effexor cr and this trumps all these for social anxiety, depression and A.D.D

I didnt care if I took a shower,said things that hurt someones feelings or just anything.  I was lethargic and my work suffered.  If you can stop smoking with any other drug I would recomend that.

She went in for depression. So if anyone else has had this problem or just looking to put there kids on it DON'T the side affects are not good. My daughter has stomack problems, muscle problems, dizzyness problems, and now all she wants to do is sleep and not go to school.  As a parent I am trying to find out more about this drug..  If anyone please tell me more I would be very happy to here about it!..  
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/13/2008 5:44:25 PM	So far so good!  I'm on this for Social Anxiety.  I was on Zoloft which was great because I slept so well--but I was sleepy all day!  So, my doc put me on this--150mg.  Make sure you take it in the morning so you can go to sleep at night.  I never felt speedy at all (maybe because this wasn't the first med for me).  This works pretty well for anxiety, but it would probably work better with therapy (I'm looking for another Dr).  They're probably going to up my dose for ADHD so we'll see how that goes.  TWO AWESOME THINGS: 1. I never smoked that much but I did smoke, and now it is not appealing at all to me.  2. My sex drive has never been higher!  My boyfriend is very satisfied with this med!  AWESOME!

Now I'm on Wellbutin and I have periods of anxiety (which I never had before) I feel irritable and angry.  Additionally I feel like I have to yawn all the time but can't complete the yawn.  Also feel like I'm always trying to clear my throat.  Has any one else experienced this?  
Depression	crushsteffy, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	11/11/2008 7:39:39 PM	Well, I've only been on the meds for a little over 2 weeks, but I have noticed a definite improvement!  I don't cry at everything anymore- in fact, hardly at anything, I'm not as socially aggressive when I get angry, and it takes considerably more to make me angry.  I am still irritable, and that's something I wish would get better, but I'm glad not to be so miserable and &quot;blah&quot; everyday... I figure, at least I'm not an emotional wreck and I can at least tolerate some of the things that were making me feel terrible before.  Also, I have definitely experienced decrease in appetite... I don't eat much during the day, but sometimes at night I'll wake up and find myself going to the fridge to make myself a sandwich because I'm so hungry from not eating all day!  Also, I find it more difficult to fall asleep, and normally I go to bed pretty early and have no issues, so it's weird for me.  Other than the appetite and insomnia this med seems ok.  I might consider doubling up to see if it will help my irritability, but I will give it another week.

Ever since taking this drug...300 mg/day, I feel much better but I get irritated easily now, but at least I am not crying everyday.Also I am not as spaced out before taking these pills. Just do not take it after 2-3:00 pm because you will be up all night, unless you have a test to study for its great...(I am also a student).Being depressed made me see things in a different light... which makes me feel better about me getting better.

My anxiety and panic attacks have grown out of control and haven't been able to convince the doc to put me on something else.  Start new doc on Monday.  I HATE Wellbutrin!!

I am currently on the 300mg and it has helped with my mood and feelings of depression.  However, I still have problems sleeping at night which my Dr. said would go away eventually.  I have been taking this medicine for 2 months now.  It did take about 3 weeks before i could notice a diffrence in how i felt.   I would recommend this drug for people who are concered about weight gain w/ antidepressants as i was.

Bipolar Depression	normalbipolar, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/26/2008 12:28:46 PM	Diagnosed with bipolar during manic episode over 30 yrs. ago, preceded and followed by a number of depressive episodes. I have been on WellbutrinXL (generic since it became available) and Depakote (ditto) for 12 yrs. Best years of my life by far. Wellbutrin with marginal dose of Depakote keeps me out of any significant depression, while allowing me the very slight hypomania that enhances creativity, productivity, and sociability (like a safe &quot;6&quot; or &quot;6.5&quot; on a 0-10 scale, zero being suicide).  Sounds like it's not for everyone, but for me personally now, at age 50, seems like I'll gladly take it to my deathbed!

IF this is the case why would anyone want to put this drug in their body which might effect their brain function as well as Kidneys and Liver..Curious what the top 20 Drugs the FDA recalled and never listed in the newspapers.All drugs if labeled may cause dizzyness, don't operate heavy machinery etc should not even take the drug.. Try holistic methods such as Tai Chi , Meditation, Omega-3 capsules vegetarian ones..Drugs will kill

Although it took time to get the right doasge, it has really helped my  depression. On the downsside, I have gained 20+ pounds during the course on these two meds. It is really frustrating...although when I reduced my dose, I lost 10 of those 20. I feel like I am stuck taking this stuff forever..and I don't look forward to that.

I have been on Elavil for many years and it has helped. After the death of a person very important in my life, I became very depressed even on the Elavil. My Dr. put me on Wellbutrin along with the Elavil.  I can not believe the change in my life.  My personality has changed and I am able to deal with every day things so much better than any time in my life. I have, or had, a very nasty temper and I am very sick over the times I lost my temper and caused much hurt to others. I did things, in this uncontrolable temper, that I will never forgive my self for. I have been able to deal with getting mad and upset like a real person. I was so afraid that when I did have a situation I would lose it again. That has not happened at ALL on this.  It is hard to understand unless you have this kind of personialty. I can never thank enough who ever developed this medication.  I do not have the right words to express this. Thank you

Couldn't sleep well at all, but wanted to sleep to stop the panic attacks and anxiety.  AWFUL!  Not for me!!

I was threatened with having the police called on me by my therapist and was being pushed into going inpatient in a hospital. About a week and a half after stopping the medication...I'm just about back to completely normal. I didn't even take this for depression or anything...it was to quit smoking.

I moved on to Effexor which was effective for a bit over a year but then lost effect. My doctor then changed me to Wellbutrin XL which has been great. While I had no side-effects onthe original brand, I decided to try the generic brand. I gained a lot of weight ad fell a bit into a slump- a doctor I consulted told me the generic brand had a shorter half-life than the original; making it less effective. MOREOVER- WHILE ON THE GENERIC BRAND (2 months) I HAD AN EPISODE OF SEVERE SEIZURES!!My neurologist told me to avoid the generic Wellbutrin as it put you at greater risk and that he had two other patients with the same situation.

I now know what it feels like to have all my symptoms of depression lifted, but have yet to find as good of a match as Wellbutrin for my body chemistry.

I then started to realize that it was making me really anxious and jittery.  My heart sometimes felt like it was going to beat out of my chest and I always felt like I was going to die.  For example, I went to school in a not so good neighborhood and while I was on this medication I developed the fear that I was going to get caught in a drive by shooting.  I never had a fear like that before or after I was on the medication.

I was put on 300 mg Wellbutrin for ADHD as the safest option.  I have been amazed at how Wellbutrin has cleared the brainfog or brain static I have felt seemingly all my life.  My focus and concentration is much better now.  I still have some disorganization and forgetfulness but I am able to focus enough to use some tools to help with this.  I am not sure if I need to go up in dosage or not....but overall I am happy!

Really not sure if it is working yet. I have lost my appetite and I seem to have inflammation of the esophagus. Which is a mild pain, but never the less still pain. I am dreaming much more and the other night woke up with such a start. Thought a young child was at my beside and I even reached out to touch this child thinking it was my son when he was young. Wow, how scary is that. I think I better tell the doctor, but I know what she will say...just stay on it for a little bit longer and see if all side effects clear up. I am not sure what to do. I really do not know if it is helping my depression and mean behavior to others.

I am wondering if anyone taking the medication this long has felt like their body has adjusted to the medication and stopped working as well as it once did. I told my doctor, who changed my meds to Prozac which I felt didn't help at all. So she switched me back but I still don't feel as if it is working like it once did....maybe 450mg would help. Any suggestions?

It seeed to be ok at first but it weakened.  I decided to ask dr for Wellbutrin for many reasons: depression, quit smoking, curb alcohol cravings.  It seems that it worked, but once my dossage was upt to 300mg WOW! Now that works for me.  I got my energy back, dont think tooo much about cigs, and i dont feel depressed!  Overall, it is great.....except i wish i could stay asleep longer than 5 hours a nite!!

I took this identical med called zyban which did help me stop smoking(smoker 15 years-1 pack a day). I do not find generic is the same at all in positive effects. Very unfortunate. Generic seems to make me feel quite anxious and does not lift depression much if at all. Also the brand name did not give sexual side effects, unlike others I have tried such as prozac and other ssri meds which severely lower sex drive.

A few side effects for me, my dose was 450mg/day and I developed tremors in my hands. The Tofranil caused me to have nightmares every single night. I slept well, and got back to feeling good again with Wellbutrin. It is said to double as an ADHD medication, but unfortunately that wasn't the case for me. I had to take a second stimulant in order to gain control over both my depression and my ADHD.

My depression and anxiety symptoms decreased dramatically if not completely. I took this medication when I was younger (19-20) and unlike some other anti-depressants, I experienced no suicidal thoughts or extreme mood swings.

I have migraines but this is unlike anything I have experienced. It has got my crying under better control (now only a few times a day and I am able to stop after at least several minutes). However, I feel like a zombie. My mind is mostly blank. I either feel bad or nothing. I am irritable, my family tells me I am constantly crabby. I find it hard to chit-chat (I am usually a very talkative person) or carry on any conversation. I prefer to be alone more than ever. I don't feel like this is the drug for me. 
Depression	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	9/28/2008 2:10:05 AM	Started taking this medication at 150mg q day. At this dosage felt absolutely no change in mood and no side effects. After 1 week bumped up to 300mg q day. Medication did not improve my mood but it did give me severe anxiety and insomnia. Anxiety was horrendous... had me convinced that I was going to die at any second if I left my house. Absolutely miserable!

So my Dr. prescribed Wellbutrin. I was miserable, and thought about some crazy things. It also made me more depressed. It does curve your urge to smoke but it's not worth the emotional rollercoster between the urges of not smoking and the medicines side effects.It will make you give up and start smoking again.Not recomended for teens at all!!!!

The first two days on 150mg I felt hyper and could feel my heart beating. That subsided and I did not feel anything until 2 weeks into therapy. I now feel slightly more agitated, anxious at times, waking up 1-2 times per night.  I don't feel like myself, can't describe how I feel, maybe apathetic.  I have noticed a decrease in appetite which is very helpful. I am going to give it more time before determining that it is not going to be beneficial.
Depression	sueg55, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	9/24/2008 7:48:37 PM	I have been taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg (generic) for about 2 months along with 150 mg Effexor XR. So far it has helped me a lot. I have been Effexor XR for 10 months and even with dosage increases my depression kept coming back. Rather than increase the Effexor my doctor decided to add the Wellbutrin. I also saw a Clinical nurse on the recomendation of my therapist. She said she wasn't that familiar with this combination but if it was working she said not to change. She said she would have probably increased the Effexor to a higher level. She said most doctors get nervous with that and usually add another medication. Right now I am feeling better and will only call my therapist or clinical nurse if the depression comes back.

Effects: Reduces sleepy symptoms from SSRI,increases: energy,aggressiveness,low tolerance for frustration,irritability,assertive,insensitivity. Generic more so. Had to stop taking generic because of social aggression.Still impatient after 2 months off the drug.Helped stop smoking after 50 years. Folks argumentative in the family but better than withdrawn and depressive. Just watch the personality changes and weigh if you can tolerate those effects as above. It will give you energy...that's nice. Very expensive,good libido,verbal acuity increased (too much sometimes)Dose up to 300mg XR for 4 of us.Tried reducing before I stopped taking it but the generic 150 was still causing aggression..too much conflict in the family on this drug.

It left me with no sexual desire whatever.  It was somewhat effective in relieving my depression.  Then I tried Cymbalta.  That only made my heart race, and because I am active person normall, I could do nothing while on that.  Then I tried Wellbutrin, at first 150, then 300, now 450.  It seems to be working for me.  I am convinced that there is no perfect anti-depressive, but I do feel better.  Recently, my doctor started me on Xanax, but I only take it as needed, and I am lots better.  Maybe it is the combination of the two drugs, but I have a life now.  Before I could do almost nothing, and my future looked bleak to me.

I took 2 antibiotics for it and it helped some, but has never went away. I normally do not have acne at all. These pimple look alikes do not turn into white heads, are not pussy, itchy or painful. They also do not dry up and go away, the very same red pimple like bumps in the exact same places. Has anyone out there ever had a reaction/side affect like this from taking Wellbutrin? Please Help! I cannot find any other reviews that have mentioned this. My Dr. also stated that it could be related to taking Wellbutrin as well as taking a birth control pill at the same time. I need answers! I don't want to have scars!

Since taking Wellbutrin I am constantly very angry, I react very harshly to things, I feel hateful, I cry at anything and I am lashing out at the ones that love me the most.  I have a constant knot in the pit of my stomach that seems to get worse the later in the day it gets.  I can't do this anymore.  My daughter and I have always had a great relationship but now it seems as if she is hesitant about talking to me about anything because she is unsure how I will react.  I have absolutely no interest in anything intimately, in fact the thought of it makes me cringe.  I will be calling my doctor in the morning and requesting something different.  I can't put my family through this anymore.  There has got to be something out there that will work for me and my symptoms.
Depression	carter1281, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	8/28/2008 10:40:17 PM	I have transitioned for lexapro to wellbutrin. It has been 3 weeks and I am so driving my hubby and kids crazy.. I have been geeting hateful and wanting to stay in my room. This med has done nothing for me. the doc is going to try me on prozac. Lexapro is great but I have gained so much weight. as way this med is not any good... and it made me so dizzzy at first
Other	deb.,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		8/28/2008 3:11:13 AM	I am thrilled. I've been on it for a year now. 300 mg. a day. I asked the doc for it to quit smoking . That was no problem at all, even after smoking for 33 years!! It did however make coffee taste bad so I quit that too. I used to be quite moody, but I am much nicer to be around now. Just ask my family. My son,21, however tried it and he said that it made him feel almost suicidal.

Depression	carm, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	8/25/2008 1:52:05 PM	I didn't realize I had depression/anxiety until my doctor started me on Wellbutrin. I felt better almost immediately. I've only been on it for a little over a week, but already sleeping better. Had chronic insomnia and first night I slept 7 hours straight. I don't feel any side effects, just alot calmer and looking forward to doing more social activities. I am only on 150mg, hope I don't need to take more, so far I am very happy. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	8/24/2008 11:45:02 PM	I have only been on this a few days. I was on Lexapro which had no effect on my mood and I had all of the common side effects and many of the rare ones. I cannot sleep tonight because I am having extreme chest pain and a racing heart beat. Going to call my doctor in the morning. I have not had relief from depression yet (been sad for 8 months) and it is frustrating to have nothing work. It is making me feel even more hopeless and frustrated. 
Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	8/24/2008 7:41:54 AM	This drug really should be combined with an SSRI to be the most effective.  It effects dopamine and nuropenephrin (sp?), but doesn't really effect serotonin.  I tried taking Wellbutrin XL by itself and Lexapro by itself...with the former, i had similar anxiety issues that others have mentioned, and I didn't feel that Lexapro did too much for me...plus it made it really hard to orgasm.  i've been on 300 xl and 10 mg for about 2 years now, and it's been a great combo for me.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/17/2008 11:58:51 PM	Been on this a long time and have been very happy with it. Helped immediately. Don't plan on going off any time soon.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	8/18/2008 3:05:26 PM	I suffer from depression and need to have my meds changed each year.  I just went off Effexor.  The Dr. put me on Wellbutin XL 150 MG.  So far, I do not think it is working.  Usually when I change meds, it is an easy transition.  I have been taking it for only a week, but I am more angry.  I have been lashing out at my 8 and 4 year old.  Extreme anger.  I also have had diarrea. I also will think that I see things out of the corner of my eyes that aren't there.  I now can cry at the drop of a hat.  I do take a generic form of Wellbutrin.  I have been sleeping great!  Other pills that I have taken usually keep you awake a night.  Who knows maybe I have not taken it long enough.  I called my Dr today and he wants me to wait another week.  He feels it is not in my system yet.  So far, nothing has changed except for the anger.   We will wait and see!

Depression	s, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/14/2008 12:59:18 AM	I have been on this for 3 weeks and am now stopping.  My regular resting pulse is about 70-on drug 125+. Shaking anxious, mind racing and can't keep up. Tried a lower dose of 75mg but same results. Has not helped with the depression.  Knowing I can't take ssri's, thought this might help-not.
Other	V V, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	8/13/2008 12:44:34 PM	My doctor started me on it as a trial run for nerve pain.  I've been taking it for about 5 months and it has definately made adifference.  The hypersensitivity has decreased and so has the burning in my leg.  The only problem I had was in the beginning, I couldn't sleep.  I would wake up at 4 or 5 AM and could not go back to sleep.  That lasted for about 3 weeks. I hope this helps.
Depression	clbrgs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/12/2008 3:31:16 PM	Wellbutrin is a great antidepressant, but it should be noted that the generic form of Wellbutrin is not quite the same as the name brand.  The generic does not work at all for me, but the name brand works quite well, with no side effects that I am aware of.  
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	2	3	1	Female	25-34	8/12/2008 1:05:36 PM	Where do I begin? Wellbutrin, I thought was a lifesaver until I begin to slow down and do &quot;normal&quot; things in my life. While being an athlete, I did not have the time to sit down and notice the impact of this medication; however, once becoming a mother, I noticed the zombie in me. I literally felt like a zombie once re-prescribed this medication (I did not take the medication while pregnant). Times where it was perfectly normal for me to cry (like a funeral) I would not cry at all. I was desensitized to the world around me to include my newborn. I immediately took myself off the medication without the guidance of the doctor (bad idea - but at the time it worked for me). I did not have any withdrawal issues, which is a good thing! Nevertheless, I begin to try other medications in hopes of addressing my depression. But, I did not want to go through life feeling numb. In the end, I have turned to herbal treatment which is working wonders for me. I will NOT go back to this medication. I promised myself and those who love me.

I was having difficulty coping with life, home alone with 5yr and 3yr and hubby gone during the week (truck driver) I also had to sell my beautiful home cause of finanical problems. I actaully could get out of bed &amp; felt normal for once, got my energy back &amp; alot more patience with my kids (both hyper),I also lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks (that was great cause I'm 40 pounds overweight from the depression) The only problems is that the side effects started when my MD double the dose week 2. Three days after starting to take 300mg, I broke out in hives just on my face. I couldn't leave the house until they went away! I also feel a little absent minded, spelling words wrong and forgeting what I was doing. I didn't have these problems with the 150mg. Off meds for awhile until rash clears up and then going back to 150 and see what happens.
Depression	toolgirl44, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	8/10/2008 10:33:49 PM	I've been taking Wellbutrin 150 mgs for 5 months now and has helped alot but i'm noticing that my trane of thought is not good. I start talking about something and forget what I am saying. So the memory loss thing is happening to me! Other than that this drug has helped my depression alot!

Depression	celinehctr, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	8/6/2008 8:12:36 AM	I was on this medication for approximately 1 month and my anxiety and depression worsened.  My husband is on the same medication and he had been more irritable and has become more aggressive and more aggitated over time but was going to talk to his doctor this morning to change his dosage or just change his medication all together.  
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	8/5/2008 2:14:29 AM	I have found this medication very effective at helping with my depression.  It has made it easier for me to get out of bed and has stopped me from crying for no reason.  There seem to be two types of generic pills; I found one didn't help me at all, but the other one (purple colored) was as effective as the brand name version.  I experience shaking hands and constipation from the medication.  It doesn't cause the low sex drive and weight gain that I've experienced with other medications.  
Other	Pokey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	8/4/2008 10:54:43 AM	I was on a low dose (250 mg) of Wellbutrin for depression, but found it did not help much.  Months later I was diagnosed with fibromalygia, and with a 300 mg dose found remarkable improvement in daily functioning.  The generic seemed to cause bleeding during bowel movements.  Only complaint now is weight gain.
Depression		5	5	5			7/30/2008 4:38:57 PM	Wellbutrin was like a miracle drug for me.  I never took anything that actually made a difference.  I took 450mg/day.  It was so good it stabilized me from feeling suicidal.  I noticed that after a couple years on it, I still have major episodes of depression, but I think overall daily symptoms where better on Wellbutrin.
Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	5	3	Male	19-24	7/29/2008 11:35:48 AM	im 19 years old and in the school i want to be in, have the pretty girlfriend who everyone loves, but yet i get panic attacks. after a trip to the ER thinking i was having a panic attack, my regular doctor proscribed  zoloft which made me vomit, as well as lexapro having no change in side effects. soon the wellbutrin was prescribed which helped at first...i about 2 months later i had 2 panic attacks due to stress at school. i how ever feel that i should get off the drug because at this point in my life it seems to be doing more harm then good. when i wake up it feels like my heart is beating 300 beats per minute and i dont feel well. hopefully i have have with drawl symptoms as i have only been on the drug a few months
Depression	Bottleblonde82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	7/26/2008 10:35:19 AM	I had a lot more energy on this medication. However I had side effects that were somewhat annoying and made me stop the drug. Most noteable to me was a slight tremor in my hands, making handwriting look worse. But I have to say I was not on this medication for more than two weeks so I cannot fairly judge this medication. I actually might try it again for my depression. 
Depression	 , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	25-34	7/24/2008 5:44:53 PM	I have been taking this for four months now and I was sick at first lost weight,outlook on life was better, and I stopped smoking which that was a bonus, then the generic came out and my insurance would rather pay for that then the name brand and still pay the same copay. NOT HAPPY, the generic sucks!
Depression		5	5	5			7/22/2008 12:41:54 AM	works wonders. didn't notice a difference, then a few months into treatment i realized alot had changed: i wasn't as moody, sad and depressed, irritable, and i felt more in control of my life. I switched to the generic, but i have lost my sex drive and vomit randomly and sweat alot(not often, but it is annoying when you are out and start sweating and get sick). seems like name-brand wellbutrin is the way to go. I lost more than 20 pounds taking this. Chronic depression runs in the family so my mom switched antidepressants to this drug and she likes it too. try it it might be worth it for you
Other	baby blues, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	7/21/2008 6:59:01 PM	 This medication has cause more problems then helping. I took this medication for stress and baby blues. After moving to the 300mg, I would sweat so bad and feel very grumpy. My family said that I was more stressed out and very rude. I did lose 7 pounds in one week, I was not over eating. That was good but after 3 weeks my blood pressure was through the roof and I was having very bad headaches.I have never had blood pressure problems so my doctor I must be the 4% that gets high blood pressure from Wellbutrin. I have been off it for 4 days and feel better but still have high blood pressure.

My husband does not seem to understand what the problem is!!!  this is my chill Pill it gets me through the day I don't care what the side effect are.
Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	1	1	Male	19-24	7/13/2008 2:24:38 AM	I rated the effectiveness of this drug 5 stars because in conjunction with 30mg of Lexapro, it helped relieve the depression. I think it is important to note however that this drug caused me to noticeably shake my hands all day. I am a phlebotomist and this had a negative affect on my job. Also, while it takes away the depression, it causes your mind to not really care about anything. Sure, your not depressed, but you become emotionless. Maybe my side effects were due to the combination but I just want to stress the fact that you need to be very careful before just taking what is prescribed to you by the physician. I believe I had TOO much drug therapy.
Depression	Dee, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	25-34	7/12/2008 11:02:42 AM	My depression was triggered by my brothers suicide &amp; moms cancer diagnosis(both within 2007.) I have been trying to find somthing to just get me through this time so I can be sane for my family- not to pretend it is not there. I am on my second month on Welbutrin. It took at least a month to kick in. I was irritated easily for the first few weeks, but that went away a few weeks ago. I have lost just a few pounds and I do not feel like a flat line like I did on Lexapro. My sex drive is also still intact, thank God! The only downfall is that every night I get nausea, wich is why for me, it is not easy to use. My doc says to wait it out a few more weeks and make sure to take it every MORNING (I work nights so I took it later) I tried to have two drinks one night, and almost vomitted. I also got airsick for the first time. But I laugh again, and I am ready to be there for my mom now, who will be undergoing a stem-cell transplant soon. The stress is not gone- but I can at least handle it better now.My husband and mom both need me too much for me to wallow in misery all the time. If only I could get rid of the damn nausea! Oh yea, my husband said he noticed my memory has been better. I used to think depression was somthing you could talk yourself out of. Somtimes you have nothing left to give, and that is when it is time to see a doc or counseling to search what is right for you. I hope this helped someone because alot of the others helped me. Good luck!

I take it for depression/anxiety and it made me feel flat, better then being on nothing but nothing I wanted to stay on.  I stuck it out for a year and just went off it a month ago.  I tried Prozac which worked great with the exception of sexual side affects.  Wellbutrin made me sweat a lot, had trouble sleeping, still had these weird mood swings and lack of energy.  So I am trying Cymbalta.  I guess I will have to wait and see.  I wouldn't take Wellbutrin again, it really wasn't worth it.  Wish the Prozac didn't cause the sexual side affects because that worked great for me.

I would recommend this to everyone.

She was only 42 years old. The psychiatrist prescribed this to also help me deal with my child being hyperactive.CONS: It made me feel very hot, sweaty, uncomfortable. If I take it in the morning I am tired, if I take it at night I am wide awake. As a mother of toddlers I need my sleep.PROS:Helped with anxiety, weightloss, nervousness.I have learned getting over a death is not easy but with medication, relaxation and talking it out helps.On the other hand, I am not sure what is worse the anxiety etc. or the terrible sweats and feeling like I have a terrible fever and cannot move at times.If you are concerend and will not take medication due to weight gain, this is the medication for you.

Depression	Ann, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	7/2/2008 3:55:01 AM	I call it my &quot;chill pill&quot;.  I use it to help me when I'm feeling uptight about things that I know really aren't a big deal. Example, when I'm getting dressed &amp; I put my shirt on backwards, or it gets caught on my earrings. I've used this drug for a few years &amp; am relatively happy with it, but I feel a dose change is needed.

My doctor prescribed Wellbutrin XL Paxil and Geodon. It worked wonders. I could sit and finish the things I started. I didn't have the terrible ups and downs. Everything went well until my insurance company switched me to the generic when it came out. After a month on the generic I was going on shopping sprees and spending money I didn't have and had an anxiety attacks for the first time in years. When it got worse in the second month I went to the doctor and got her to write a new script for NAME BRAND Wellbutrin XL - had to pay more money for it but after just 2 weeks things were much better. Later found out that millions of poeple had bad reactions to the generic - some even committed suicide. If you were prescribed the generic get your doctor to write a medically nessacary script and try the name brand.

Depression	Sinclair, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/18/2008 5:41:00 PM	I have suffered from anxiety attacks and severe migraines since I was a child. I realized I needed to be treated for depression when I was in my early 30's. I finally went to a doctor and asked for help. After trying some different medications and dosages we finally decided on Wellbutrin XL 450mg with Effexor XR 225mg. I've been on this for about 2 years. IT WAS THE BEST THING I EVER DID! My anxiety and anger was gone after a few weeks. I stopped fighting with my husband and co-workers everyday. I was able to take difficult situations in stride. The worst side effect was dry mouth. I will say that after reading some of these reviews I'm terrified to ever go off of the Effexor XR.

Depression	rjlang 27, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/15/2008 9:53:11 PM	started wellbutrin xl for a family situation. had a few severe panic attacks the first 2 and 3 weeks of taking this anxiety is getting better since im also taking clonozapam. i would recommend not taking this med alone if you have anxiety issues as well. I tried stopping this med , thought i didnt need it anymore turns out i do. I had no withdrawal symtoms when stopping it just got really depressed again Iv had weight gain while taking this. Didnt do much for sex drive.to summ it all up, since taking this med i want to be a wife, mother,do my job at work, clean my house all things i wanted no part of before.I will continue to take this med,but i am concerned because i am about to have to switch to generic because i can no longer afford this &quot;miracle drug' but i will pay what i have to to be able to keep feeling this way its wonderful.

I have no signs of improvement with my depression. It did give me an energy boost to begin with but that only lasted about 3 - 4 months. Most importantly I have realized that a drug can not change the people around you just you. So if your depression is due to things outside of you it will have littel to no effect for you. At next appointment I will be asking to be taken off of it.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/5/2008 11:40:29 AM	I am currently on 300 mg xr and also 225 of Effexor xr for major depression.  The two together have worked very well for me.  I feel calmer not so quick to chew someone out.  These two have been a lifesaver for me!
Depression	chris in Spain, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	6/1/2008 10:32:47 AM	Been on WBXL 300 mlg for a year and half. Effects are subtle. Did help with my OCD thoughts. No sexual side effects. No weight gain. Do not think works well alone for depression. BTW in Europe it is almost banned. They consider it dangerous, and only effective for short term smoking cessation. Check into it before you go on it.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	5/28/2008 3:57:36 PM	i have depression and anxiety as well as adhd. my doctor suggested wellbutrin xl. he said it would take away my problems and nerve problems as well. i have been using it for 2 months and so far its not doing anything. i dont feel any different at all. i have also heard it makes you gain weight so i hope it doesnt do that to me. when i go back to the doctor in a couple of weeks i am gonna ask him for something different since it doesnt work for me.
Depression	Bob, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	5/22/2008 12:02:12 AM	With my doctor's OK, I've just doubled my dosage to 300 mg.  Half that did absolutely nothing for my depression and same results for trying to stop smoking.  Am hoping that taking double my previous dosage will make me a veritable vegetable, so that I don't have to deal with my two rotten 5-6-yr.-olds.  Taking 150-dosage, there was no effect either way--which means it sucked BIG TIME.  I want to be &quot;comfortably numb,&quot; but lousy Wellbutrin XL does nothing to assuage my abject disgust with my children (&amp; at times with my wife, who hardly ever interacts with the buggers).  Am praying that double the dosage will make me a sweet, pliable vegetable.  If not, then even at double the dosage, it will suck big time!!!!!
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/20/2008 4:59:02 PM	Initially started with Zoloft, which was really good for depression and anxiety. The only thing about Zoloft was, not only did it take away the anxiety...it took away all my emotions!! I was numb. Was not sad, was not happy, just didn't feel anything. A friend of mine's infant died recently, and I was sad for her in my head. I wanted to cry, but couldn't.  It also takes away the libido. Yeah...that sucks. So my doc switched me to Wellbutrin 100mg, and at first, just like a post I read earlier. I felt drugged, tired and wierd. I kept taking it though. It's been about a month, and I love it. It's false happiness in a pill, but I guess that is better than none at all right? I love it !!! I am not as anti-social as I had become. Starting to be myself again, which I thought would never happen. 
Depression	Laura Harris	1	4	1			5/20/2008 4:44:31 PM	I felt drugged. I felt bad. I felt tired. I felt horrible! This is NOT the drug for me, that's for sure! It did the OPPOSITE of what it was supposed to do! 300XL.
Other		3	4	3			5/20/2008 11:53:29 AM	I started off taking Zoloft for anxiety which gave me major stomache pains everytime I ate. Sometimes these lasted for two weeks, it was hell. I got switched to Wellbutrin 150mg and was okay for a few months. The last few months I have had heart palipitations and irregular heart beats. I am trying to get off this stuff
Depression	Switching meds, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	5/20/2008 10:08:06 AM	First week on 300mg...very anxious, but at the same time my head is in a fog, cannot concentrate on my work. Was on 150mg of Effexor XR, helped, but not all the way. M.D. suggested Wellbutrin 300mg and still 75mg of Effexor XR during first week. Could the anxiety come from Wellbutrin or taking less Effexor? Have been on Effexor for only 5 weeks, tolerated it well. Before then I was on Lexapro. Effexor and Lexapro help my emotional symptoms but physically I feel run down and constantly fatigued. That's why we're trying different drugs now. Wellbutrin was supposed to give me an extra &quot;kick&quot;...
Depression		5	5	5			5/19/2008 3:02:22 PM	Love this med!!! It has also helped with my addiction or cravings for other prescrition drugs!!!Life saver...

Taking 150 mg daily has eased the symptoms to a minimum except for two days prior to the beginning of my period.  Overall I do not have the doom, gloom, depression, and physical effects I had been experiencing.

I was effective and I found it to be a good &quot;mood stabilizer&quot; I went off briefly when I felt drug &quot;poop out&quot; but will return to it. 0 side effect, can't argue with that!
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/16/2008 9:53:23 AM	My overall mood has changed.  I call it the happy pill.  You don't feel drugged or strange, I feel like myself again.  It did increase my energy, or maybe it just seemed that way because I was happy and felt better?
Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	5/13/2008 12:29:47 AM	I just started taking this drug. 300mg once daily. I was formerly on Effexor XR for depression. I spoke with my doctor as I was also interested in quitting smoking as well as treating my depression. I have notice since I started taking this (4 days ago) that I have noticed some irritability, headaches, and some dizziness. I don't know if this is caused by the Wellbutrin or if it is from the switch from Effexor to this. If anyone could shed some light on this subject, I would greatly appreciate it. Please feel free to email me at dlhop2001@yahoo.comThanks.

Depression		1	1	1			5/12/2008 11:54:30 AM	My husband started taking this drug in Dec.07 and he has not been the same since.  He's argumentative,mean-spirited and unforgiving.  NOT the man I married 9 and 1/2 yrs ago!  The worst thing is, I can't make him believe it's the drug.  My marriage is in the toilet right now.
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	5/8/2008 9:36:45 PM	I have tried several antidepressants in my lifetime. I found that while I was on this I had a volatile temper and periods of rage starting about 5-6 weeks of therapy. My sister told me Wellbutrin turned her into an &quot;angry bitch&quot;
Depression	kimbkups, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	5/5/2008 12:45:14 AM	300 mg was added to my daily dosage of Effexor XR. I was on the Effexor for about 3 years when it started to wear off, plus I was tired of the extra weight I put on w/ Effexor. This seemed to help immediately, I had some more energy and a few poungs came off immediately. I also lost tons of hair with the Wellbutrin - watch out ladies. My sweating worsened once the Well. was added.
Bipolar Depression	Bigtimetorifan, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	5/3/2008 4:30:20 PM	I am a 36 yr old female and have used b/w 150-300mg daily on and off for 5 yrs. I feel very 'buzzed', my thoughts are fast and I am a little irritable (my poor husband! lol)but the trade off is that I have a lot of energy and this reduces my appetite a lot! The times that I have been off it I usually gain 10-15lbs w/in 3 mo (NOT acceptable). All in all I would say it does what it is supposed to &amp; helps w/ the depression end of my illness, w/o the all to common side effect of weight gain.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/29/2008 5:25:20 PM	My Dr. put me on Wellbutrin XL after prozac and zoloft did nothing for me. I started out at 150 mg, which didn't do a lot, I didn't feel worse, just not better.  Then the Dr. upped me to 300 mg4 days ago, I feel great!  It's usually hard for me to get up in the morning, but not anymore!  I'm more talkative, confident and generally in good spirits.  I have noticed one side effect, other than the constipation, my hands hurt, like the muscles in my hands and fingers have been used too much.  If I drink too much soda or coffee I get really jumpy, I can't sit still, I feel like I have to constantly keep moving.  Other than that, things are going great, but I will contact my Dr. about the hands.
Stop Smoking	LP, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/25/2008 3:22:32 PM	I took Wellbutrin XL 300mg to quit smoking several years ago (it worked) and I felt really good while taking it.  No side effects other than the lack of desire to smoke - a good side effect!  I'd like to go back to Wellbutrin, b/c right now I'm taking Zoloft, and it's not as good as Wellbutrin, IMO.  
Depression	adelaidaml, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/25/2008 9:00:03 AM	In using the generic brand,(bupropion) I found it's effectiveness nothing like the actual brand.  After three weeks of taking the generic brand, I was miserable and honestly felt that I was not taking nothing.  I was feeling as I did prior to taking any depression medication.
Depression	ASR, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/24/2008 12:39:48 AM	I am on Wellbutrin and Lexapro for depression and anxiety.  I have no side effects from the Wellbutrin.  The Wellbutrin renergizes me when the  Lexapro slows me down; the Lexapro stops me from crying uncontrollably. It's a match made in mental illness heaven!
Depression	smesser, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/22/2008 4:11:27 PM	I was put on this drug when Zoloft caused me to become anorexic. (I lost a ton of weight).  Wellbutrin XL is an AWESOME drug.  It worked quickly, and I had few side effects.  The worst (???) effect is that every so often my libido jumps into overdrive...my boyfriend loves it. I have experienced some weight gain, but I'm happy and feel better. Definitely highly recommended!!!

Doesnt seem to be working. Havent had any side effects other than if I drink coffee I get terrible nerves and jitters. I still feel pretty unmotivated, tired (even when having enough sleep) and sad most of the time. Doing things takes a huge amount of effort, and if I didnt &quot;have to&quot; I just wouldnt. I also have terrible PMS and this definately has not helped that AT ALL. I have terrible mood swings and I become completely irrational and angry at everything for several days per month. I just want to feel like myself again and I think this might not be the right drug for me, although it may work for others.

I was happier, had more energy, and was able to work through the problems. I went off it for about six years, then a series of personal drama caused me to go into depression again. This time, Wellbutrin did increase my energy but it made me very hyper and overly talkative, mixing up words and such.

Depression		1	1	1			4/2/2008 10:32:10 AM	VERY SUCKY DRUG WOULD NOT RECOMEND TAKING IT WILL MAKE U SICK! 
Depression	 (Patient) 	4	4	1			3/31/2008 7:48:49 PM	The first time I took this drug I took it for almost a year and had no problems with it, other than some diahrrea. I recently resumed taking it again after being off of it for almost 6 months due to problems with my insurance. For the past two days I have suffered with horrible anxiety attacks, I had to go to the emergency room yesterday. I have never had anxiety attacks or anxiety problems before. I think I would rather be depressed than experience anything like that ever again. I felt like I was on acid or losing my mind or something. In addition to the new anxiety, it has also caused me to be continuously either constipated or have diahrrea, nothing in between. It also gave me insomnia, which by itself is  manageable but coupled with anxiety it can drive a person insane. I will not take this drug again, even if it means crying out my depressions and talking myself out of suicide. Be careful and be prepared. 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/31/2008 10:23:10 AM	I have been on this drug for about 2 months.  And I love it.  I started falling into depression after my first pregnancy, everyone told me it would go away but it didn't.  Than after losing my second pregnancy at 20 weeks (twins), I couldn't handle it.  After being depressed and not recognizing myself for about a year and a half I decided to do something about it.  My doctor put me on 300 mg of the XL.  And I had some of the side effects like not sleeping, dry mouth, lower libedo.  But the whole libedo and sleeping thing now have subsided and with the whole dry mouth I just drink a lot of water.  Which isn't a bad thing.  I love this drug, I have more energy during the day, I am back to my old happy self.  And my husband is happy because I am back to the person he married and not some Psyco women that he never knows what mood she is going to be in or what will set her off next.  
Depression	Shjpatterson, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	3/30/2008 10:44:17 AM	My ratings are low cause I hust started 3 days ago. Before I was on Paxil it worked really good but a year later I realized I had gained over 20 pounds, I had tried going to the gym busting my but eating right and could not lose the weight. So I went to the dr. and she suggested this. She said it's supposed to help with my anxity,deppression and promote weightloss. Right now my moods are all over the place, but I expected that just hope it goes away. I'll write back in a couple weeks O I have notice already the appetite change, not so much in chage of smoking yet.

Stop Smoking	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	3/20/2008 4:28:18 PM	I just started a week ago and noticed a mouth sore (canker sore) the day after I started taking it, so stopped.  Thought maybe it was stress.  Want to keep up my progress that I had with Chantix in not smoking.  Chantix caused weight gain and depression, so my doctor gave me this to try instead.  I started taking again today and noticed another canker sore starting. They are very painful.  I didn't see it listed as one of the side effects.  Has anyone else had canker sores from the Wellbutrin?
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	35-44	3/20/2008 2:15:01 AM	I have taken this med for over 7 years and recently quit. For my moderate depression it worked very well but after long term use I just felt &quot;numb&quot;. It killed my libido and it left me with a feeling of ambivalence. One of the worst side effects for me was headache (other than no sex drive) and dizzyness ranked high as well. All of those things listed above in addition to concerns over interactions with another &quot;more important&quot; medication I take helped me make the decision to stop.
Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	13-18	3/18/2008 12:25:03 AM	basically i hardly know what i was like without medication. i am 17 and have recently switched to wellbutrin from lexapro, i am not satisfied, at first i had more energy and other that withdrawal from lexapro i felt better, but now i am constantly lightheaded and dizzy, my vision constantly blurs and i am tiered but can never fall asleep, i had horrible insomnia from childhood off and on again even with meletonin (a natural over the counter sleep aid) so i am cautious of continuing with my medication. i recommend trying this drug, but it is probably best if you are an adult.  also for those teenagers out there who are considering medication i would proceed cautiously, it is a slippery slope, addiction is possible and dependence probable. good luck- nickey
Other	R113, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	3/13/2008 5:10:22 PM	From what research I've done I think this might work well for people that are very depressed. However I was taking 150mg of the XL. Within 30 days I was ANGRY and mood swings did not begin to explain it. I switched from 30mg of Cymbalta, being used as a mood swing adjuster. Wellbutrin XL made my life hell for my close friends and family as well as myself. I went off over how beds should be made, to what color shirts were. I'm still dealing with the aftermath of stopping all mood adjustment drugs now. This made me loose myself and control of my actions. Something I never want a drug to do for me. Good luck and please be aware of your actions when your on it. 
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/11/2008 12:26:38 AM	I was on this medication for the last two years of high school and 1st year of college. My doctor switched me to wellbutrin sr (which didnt work as well for me) but the time i was on wellbutrin xl, it changed my life! Grades improved, I was getting honors (something I had never gotten before) and I was very very driven and motivated to do things. It helped my concentration so much and my desire to accomplish things in my life. I will give this warning: once being on it for long periods of time I felt great and felt like I didnt need meds anymore. I would stop taking it and within a month later would have horrible episodes from being off of it. This happened to me about three times. Once your on it, it is hard to get off but it definately improved my life. I am now on an SSRI and have found that I have no emotion at all and its hard to feel anything. While on wellbutrin, I still could feel emotions,etc. It didnt take every feeling away from me totally. This is a good drug to take, especially for a teenager, that is when I started it. I attribute all my accomplishments to this drug, I realy would not be where i am today without it and I am looking in to going back on it in combination with my SSRI

Depression	SunnyRays, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	3/8/2008 9:40:34 AM	If there is anyone who knows this drug it's me. I've been on it since it was created. If you want further info you can email me b/c it won't all fit here: roberts.rachela@yahoo.com. This drug works for depression &amp; smoking cessation-no doubt. However, don't expect to be able to stop taking it, in my case, perhaps ever. 5 x's I've stopped. The 1st 3 were due to no insurance &amp; by the 3rd I was 'rationing' pills and splitting them in half. The 4th was an attempt to ween myself and the 5th was w/a Dr.'s assistance that Rx'd another drug to ease me off. I CANNOT BE WITHOUT THIS DRUG. It's a horrendous 'rubber band effect' I call the &quot;crash n burn&quot;. It took awhile for me realize that It may be a month or so after it's out of your system to happen, but it will happen, and it will be harsh. I have taken this drug w/little conjunction of other drugs and know that it works to promote an overall sense of well being. BUT there are side effects [for me-everyone is different and thus cannot be expected to have the exact same experience]. For me I do have dry mouth, periodic insomnia, lower sex drive and constipation (the latter 2 were present before, just intensified by the drug). I feel like a Rx junkie, getting low on this drug causes me to panic. I have hoarded it for ins. changes. You win GSK- you now own me. I hope you're happy and proud of yourself. Despite choosing to be happy and not wanting to rely on a chemical to make that be, I no longer can. Perhaps I'm being too harsh on GSK and I truly have a chemical imbalance that will always need to be corrected??? Could be. I just think the warning should be known of how powerful Wellbutrin really is. Is it a miracle drug or the socially acceptable form of crack or smack? I have developed a love/hate relationship with it at this point in my life. I love to take it and fell good and I hate to take it and feel weak for needing it. Straight up depression just blows. Too indescribable to an outsider about how it actually feels. 
Depression	TA, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/6/2008 4:29:48 PM	I have been taking this drug since July 2006.  I was experiencing a major depression episode and I had tried other drugs that made me fill hung over.  I noticed a difference within 2 weeks and complete turn around in my emotional state within 6 weeks to 2 mos.I lost weight, my sex drive returned in full force and my level of anxiety about going to sleep decreased.  I give this drug A+.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	3/5/2008 12:47:36 PM	Before this medication I was absolutley a mess. I was crying almost everyday, on my days off from work I would lay on the couch and would not get up all day. I had stopped going out with friends, gained over 30 lbs, and overall just didn't care about anything. I decided it was time to take action and as much as I thought, oh this is a phase and I will snap out of it, I realized I couldn't do it on my own anymore. I started out at 150 mg and yes, there were side effects. I couldn't sleep at night, I lost my appettite (which I didn't mind), I was alot more anxious and kind of trembly, and I was sweating alot more and really thirsty. At first I was like, I can't do this, I work 12 hours a day I need sleep and food and, etc. These side effects lasted for about 2 months. For the sleeping issues I started taking this medication right when I woke up in the morning, about 5:30 am. I noticed that this helped me have more energy through the day and wore off toward the evenings but, still I was only sleeping like 4 hours a night. I started taking Xanax and Ambien, not together and not every night, but this helped alot. I have been on this medication for almost a year now, my doctor upped my dose to 300mg, I am soooo much more motivated, happy, and I have found me again.I have lost over 20 lbs and like I said this medicine gives me energy and the motivation to workout now and care about what I look like. The nervous, anxious, trembling feeling has gone away. I still sweat a little moe than usual and am thirsty but, it is not a major thing to me, I have adjusted. I would really recommend this mediaction to anyone who was having the symptoms of depression like I was. And, those symptoms weren't at certain times in the season or just every once in a while, yes they were worse during winter then summer. I was on a roller coaster of emotions up and down and I needed major help. Give this med. a try, ride out the side effects if you can, it is worth it in the end!!!!
Bipolar Depression	bipolarlady, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/4/2008 4:30:07 AM	When I started taking this med, I was sick as a dog and still depressed. Then two months after I started taking it and a bump from 150mg to 300mg. I woke up and I felt better. That dark feeling was gone. Without wellbutrin I would not be here today.I can say that and stand behind it. It also has an side affect that I love; weight loss
Stop Smoking	May, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	3/4/2008 1:15:00 AM	I had two seizures the second day I took this medicine (in US). My sister also took similar medicine prescribed by her doctor in Asia for about a week and she had a blackout. She fell and hit her face on a hard object and almost cut her eye out. Very dangerous medicine! Totally not worth it.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	3/3/2008 11:33:26 AM	I've taken an assortment of other antidepressants in the past and never had success with any of them like I have with Wellbutrin. I have no negative side effects. If anything, my side effects are positive - increased sex drive and slight weight loss. I'm on 300mg currently and probably need to up it a little as I still get depressed occasionally. All other drugs I've taken have made me extremely lethargic and disconnected. I have none of that with Wellbutrin.

Depression		5	5	3			2/23/2008 2:29:35 PM	I have been taking 450mg for nearly three months.  I had been severely depressed for over a year, and bad circumstances beyond my control that happened in 2007 made it even worse.  I have to say that after the first month on Wellbutrin (and therapy), however, I am feeling great.  It is also a great energy booster and I feel like I'm accomplishing much more than I had for so long.BUT...I have a terrible time trying to sleep.  Even with taking a sleeping pill, I average 4-5 hours of sleep a night.  While I don't want to stop taking Wellbutrin, the insomnia is a real problem, and as of yet my doctor and I haven't found a way to overcome it. 
Depression	Sassy Sal, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/23/2008 10:25:38 AM	When I expressed to my Dr. how angry I was and stressed most of the time, he said it was actually depression.  Yes, I was sad but thought it was because of circumstances in my life at the time.  He prescribed Wellbutrin XL.  Wow, I can't believe how it evened out my mood.  My life is once again normal.  It takes the rough edge off and I am much nicer to be around.  I do have to watch my weight though, seems to have put some pounds on.  That's minor to losing friends, a marriage and even the dog feared me.  Wellbutrin has saved my marriage for sure.
Depression	cade_kaylees_mom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/22/2008 11:19:43 PM	The first time I took Wellbutrin XL a few years ago, it made everything worse. I was incredibly angry and mean.  I stopped taking it.  Recently my doctor added this to the Lexapro 20mg pill that I take and I am feeling great! I take Wellbutrin XL in the morning and Lexapro at night.  I was a little nervous starting it again because of what it did the last time, but I am having no problems with it this time. Id recommend it but only in conjunction with something else. I also go to therapy now, so maybe that is one reason why the effect is different now than before.
Depression	Mandy24, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	5	3	Female	55-64	2/21/2008 12:16:12 AM	I used it along with Prozac to treat depression. The combination did not work as well as I expected, but I feel somewhat better.
Depression	nutty girl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/19/2008 10:14:41 PM	I have been taking this med for about a month now (i realize that isn't that long, but enough to see the effects) I do feel alot better.  Many years ago I took paxil and then effexor for about a year each...and they sucked, between the weight gain and ZERO sex drive, and they didn't help that much, therapy did more for me.  But honestly, I feel a lot better on this durg, I am not moody and grouchy, and crying all the time and wanting to bite off everyones head.  It also stopped me from smoking...nice bonus.  Sex drive is still here...if not even more!  It is worth a try...seriously.  Oh ya, no weight gain.

I have been taking it for about a month now and I don't feel any better.  I do however think my weight is going back to normal.  I am very moody, down, and feel tired all of the time.

Depression	baerRN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	2/14/2008 10:00:24 PM	I orrigonally went on Wellbutrin SR to quit smoking 2 1/2 years ago. It worked and I don't smoke anymore. Then I realized I like the new me and realized I had undiagnosed depresion. After 2 years of taking it I went to a new OB-GYN for my yearly and she inadvertantly changed me to Wellbutrin XL (it stays in your system twice as long as the SR). I didn't think anything of it as I am a RN and work in a pharmacy where the standard is the XL dose. After 3 1/2 to 4 months I started having blurry vision(I had LASIK 2 1/2 years ago), nausea, diarrhea, dizzyness, then anxiety, jittery, then shaky and rapid heart rate with missed beats. So bad that one day I clocked out and went to the ER. My heart was racing at 120-135 beats per minute. They sent me home on a Holter monitor to record my heart and it came back with frequent sinus tachycardia with occasional premature atrial and ventrical beats. Not realizing the drug switch, I was positive that my thyroid was out of wack. Had all the tests even changed doctors since I didn't think the first doc was doing enough. Finally I asked an eye doctor if Wellbutrin could be causing my vision problems and he told me to get it changed. I start a new medication in the morning, so we will see if it works for me.

Depression	Fiona, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	2/12/2008 11:15:31 AM	I started 150mg a day a year ago because I wasn't leaving the house or contributing to our family. It helped me stay motivated in school and work and helped me get things done that I would let slip away before. However, if I forgot to take it for a couple few days I would get really irritable, more than I've ever been. Eventually I cut myself down to 75 mg a day and I'm seeing how that goes. I don't feel that I need it as much as I used to. I went about a month without it and I did pretty good. Now I've switched to the generic brand for insurance reasons and I will see how that goes.

I feel confident when it is in my system. I also combine this with 20mg of Lexapro by doctors prescription. I also take metoprolol for high blood pressure. Don't quit without a doctors assistance, the withdrawls aren't as bad as lexapro.

I do have some rapid heartbeat but I think it will go away once the depression has fully lifted.
Depression	shaykae, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	2/3/2008 10:45:15 PM	I am taking Wellbutrin XL 450mg/day for depression, dysthymia and PTSD. That is the highest dose a person can take of it. It helped me so much! But after about a year, I felt the irritability and anger creeping back. My doc added Lexapro. This gave me the extra &quot;boost&quot; to relieve the symptoms. I take a half pill (10mg/day) and if my symptoms get bad again, I take the full pill (20mg/day). 
Depression	Kereedite,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female		2/2/2008 2:56:14 PM	I've been taking this med for depression and I think it has helped me significantly.  I couldn't get through a semester of school without having several episodes and feeling depressed.  i had to stop taking it a the end of 07 becasue I was no longer covered under my fathers insureance.  I'm a student and I work but I still  can't afford it out-of-pocket right now so I'm just wishing for the best right now, as far as school goes.  I really hope I can make it to graduation solo!  Wish me luck!

It worked and I haven't smoked in almost 3 yrs.  I noticed after a month or so on the drug that I was smiling and laughing more.  Who knew I was depressed?  Not me!  Now I'm an ex-smoker and not depressed anymore.  Life is good.
Depression	notcrazy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	2/1/2008 11:34:43 AM	I took this to help with anxiety and depression, it's made it worse. I felt jittery, agitated and restless. It also made my heart race and I haven't slept more than 3-4 hrs a night since I started it 1 week ago. I was on Lexapro, which helped me mentally, but not physically. I was tired and couldn't stop yawning. I'd rather yawn all of the time on Lexapro, than be agitated and restless on Wellbutrin.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/30/2008 12:14:30 AM	I could only take this drug for about 3 days. Starting on day one, I starting having hallucinations at night and they got worse the next couple nights. I stopped taking it after that. The one thing I had was my sleep and that was important to me. this drug interupted that. Maybe if i could have stuck it out, they would have stopped but I couldn't take it anymore. I was seeing things melt down my wall and seeing people in my room. My husband literally had to lay on top of me and hold me to get me to sleep.

Depression	angie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	1/27/2008 3:13:11 PM	I could only take this med for about a week and a half. I couldn't sleep at all. I have a 2 mo. old baby who wakes up about every 2 hrs. or so , so by the time I would fall asleep, the baby would be waking up again. Also, I had no memory at all. I felt like I was in a constant fog, like I was too doped up to even think straight. I've heard that maybe I should have kept taking it longer, but there was no way I could do that. I couldn't even function and I have children to take care of. My husband was the first to notice I wasen't being myself. I became even more depressed on this drug due to lack of sleep and feeling so strange. 
Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	25-34	1/27/2008 11:50:57 AM	Taking the drug did not help with my depression, it made it worse since it caused me to have night terrors which then gave me severe insomnia.

Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/24/2008 10:25:09 AM	I started taking this drug after my daughter was born for post-partum depression.  It has changed my life.  Thank you Glaxo Smith Kline for creating such a wonderful drug.  I struggled with anxiety and feeling agitated about small, insignificant things all my life and now that is all gone.  One thing I will say is that I found a tremendous difference between the generic drug and the named brand drug.  I had severe mood swings while taking the generic.  You pay more for the named brand but maybe there is a reason for that. I love you Wellbutrin!!!

I was on prozac first, but with the high dosage I needed, it completely took away my sex drive and ability to climax....not fun!  This drug has not only helped me to manage my depression, it has done wonders for my sex life with my husband!  I did suffer from the insomnia at first, but my doctor put me on xanax for two months and now I sleep just fine.
Depression	Kathy8314, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	3	Female	55-64	1/21/2008 4:02:37 AM	I fell much more alert with this drug as opposed to Remeron, which I stopped using becasue I wanted to lose weight. However, I sometimes have trouble sleeping. I have stared to lose weight slowly -- four pounds after two months of ues.I am going to add more dietary changes and hope to lose more weight. I am a bit concerned about getting more sleep since I often awaken after a few hours sleep--as little as three hours but sometimes more. I usually get up and read or go on line for a while and then sleep again for maybe three hours. I  am going to try getting some exercise to see if that helps.

Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	1/18/2008 3:13:07 PM	The doctor prescribed this drug for me, I battled with chronic depression and some anxiety; Had previously tried Prozac, that didn't work...then Amitryptilene (sp ck), that did not help either (both made symptoms worse)... So my obgyn doc rx'd Wellbutrin XL, said it was an excellent drug.  When this drug was in my system after about 5 wks, my depression sunk to the lowest EVER; mood swings were almost out of control, very unlike my character, to where eventually I felt suicidal and completely hopeless like life was just not worth living.  I called the dr ofc told them this drug was evil!  That I flushed it down the toilet.  It scared the you know what out of me... I am currently on Zoloft 50mg now, and that is working great for me.  WXL is scary, atleast it was for me. I feel like &quot;me&quot; again on what I'm now on.

Stop Smoking	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/16/2008 7:24:38 PM	It has been okay.  Definitly helped with the many mood swings I was expecting while quitting smoking, they seemed to be few and far between.
Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	1/16/2008 2:24:00 PM	I began taking this medicine to treat depression.  After about 2 weeks of taking the med I starting having huge side affects.  I could not sleep at night (even with taking sleeping meds), lost about 10 pounds in 1 week (due to no appitete), had huge mood swings (one day happy, next day sad, next day mad, etc) for no reason.
Depression	cac58, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	2	Female	45-54	1/16/2008 11:14:57 AM	I was taking celexa 15mg. having a weepy day asked my Dr. to give me Wellbutrin 300XL, used it the next day and felt a little jittery for a couple of days,I've been on it about 2 weeks, thought I was doing well and I'm feeling weepy again.  I'm a 49 female, divorsed with my oly child leaving this year for college.  I don't want to be &quot;pyscho&quot; and make things hard for her or me. I just want to be able to control my emotions. Is this withdrawal from the celexa, hormones? I'm not in menapause yet. I need advice.
Depression	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4		25-34	1/13/2008 8:25:59 PM	This has been the best medication for me at this time in my life.  I have tried many other antidepressants over the years, but Wellbutrin XL is a great fit.  I love that my quitting smoking was an unintended side effect too!
Depression	Grimbear, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	1/13/2008 11:40:37 AM	Started taking this for mild depression. Was sick at first on only 75mg. Was taking 3 times daily, now taking all in a.m. TERRIBLE night sweats, memory loss, can't sleep at night, my head feels like it will explode most of the time, legs itching like crazy! I already have dermatitas &amp; this makes it so much worse. I am lucky I have medication for the itching. My Dr. has prescribed Effexor &amp; wants to wean me off Wellbutrin because of its ineffectiveness. But after all the reviews I have read, I won't start taking Effexor. Going to continue on with this to see it it helps more in the long run. Only been on it for 3 months.

Other	 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female		1/12/2008 12:25:33 AM	My dr. prescirbed Wellbutrin XL to help with my fatigue associated with mononucleosis. I took 150 mg for 7 days, then 300 mg of a generic for almost a month. Part way through treatment, I developed an awful rash. My dr. said it was from an antibiotic I had been taking, and that it shouldn't be taken if you have mono. Thanks, doc! 2 weeks later when I went for my Wellbutrin follow-up, he decided the rash was from the Wellbutrin, so I am not taking it any longer.I did not see any improvement in my depression, and very little improvement with my energy levels. And I still have a lovely rash, which I'm taking another drug for.

At one point a few years ago I tried to stop taking it because I felt my depression was finally gone for good...After about 2 months of not being on it, I became depressed again.  I went back on it and have not stopped since...It REALLY works well for me..My &quot;highs&quot; are not too high and my &quot;lows&quot; are not too low.
Stop Smoking	bonesrv, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	35-44	1/10/2008 8:05:06 PM	After 1 month the side effects have reduced, false pains, anger or rage, negative thoughts, sleepless nights. I think many of the side affects are caused by lack of sleep while &quot;adjusting&quot; to this medicine. Seretonin is what keeps our Sanity, and is only produced when we sleep well, 8 hrs. For Smoking, I am surprised how my breakfast and coffee does not include a Cigarette afterwards. I will set a target date to quit after 2 months. This does not remove my anxiety or panic attacks like Paxil did, they must affect the mind differently. I am concerned about the possibility of a seizure on this medication as I am also a Drinker. Overall for smoking it seems to be a very helpfull crutch vrs cold turkey.
Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	35-44	1/10/2008 7:42:26 PM	Addicted to it! Starting out I would see things (flashes) out of the corner of my eye,would hear voices,I felt paranoid, nervous.I thought i was loosing my mind.That passed after about a week.It does ok for my depression but the sexual satisfaction makes it hard to give up,it makes those few seconds 10 times more intense.
Depression		5	4	4			1/9/2008 10:53:29 PM	I love Wellbutrin because it doesn't have the most, well, depressing side effects that come with other anti-depressants - loss of libido. In my case, it has enhanced my libido. Love it.

Best thing I have tried for all three however it had attacked my liver to a severe level after the third day. Even with a mild case of liver damage due to Hepatitis B/C. I am using Wellbutrin XL 150 mg in the morning. It was a brief attack about 10am four hours after dose, and very painful. I am reporting to my doctor and will request a liver function test. I will continue treatment drinking 16 ounces of water per hour, if symptom persists I will discontinue.

I did try taking it alongside prozac but that made me feel sick all the time. I take 200mg 2X daily and the pills get hard to swallow sometimes and I end up gagging or throwing up.

Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	13-18	12/31/2007 1:18:40 AM	This was my first antidepressant. It would have perhaps worked, but I hated the side effects. I would get shaky, anxious, paranoid, and sick to my stomach. Eventually, because I was abusing drugs at the time, started to abuse it- it happened to be one of the only antidepressants that can be abused. It was a poor choice to prescribe this drug to a drug-addicted teenager. Overall, it was not a good drug for me.

My doctor decided it was more beneficial to keep me on this medication than to take me off. I feel like a whole new person. I have sleeplessness, and some foods taste different to me, but other than that there have been no other side effects.

It was later increased to 150mg 2x daily but I have not experienced any improvement with the increase. The only side effect I experienced was a decrease in appetite, which was fine with me since losing a few pounds was nice bonus. It did not cause a decrease in libido like other antidepressants. It did not improve my depression enough to feel normal, thus I was prescribed an additional antidepressant.

I've combined it with Effexor and because of the mix, I don't have any thoughts of suicide or any depression at all. I would not recomend just taking Welbutrin alone, because for some reason it usually hypes you up and makes things worse. So combining it with a med that will calm you, eg.Effexor, it should even everything out, or atleast for me it did.

Overall, my depression has subsided, I can focus on my family, job and other activities.  No more bouts of crying, binge eating on sweets/carbs, and no more horrid thoughts of death and dying.

I took it for a week and felt like crap the whole week with horrible side effects: severe sweating, not being able to sleep, nausea, weird dreams and I was seeing things. I would wake up the next morning feeling, as my friend who as also been on it with the same side effects &quot;cracked out&quot;.  This is the most horrible drug in the world. If you like feeling like you have the flu and are hungover at the same time, you might find this helpful.

The generic form has an opposite effect - mood swings, sensitive, crying spells, etc.

All of the negative issues experienced while taking this medication improved within 3 weeks of the doctor taking me off Wellbutrin.  I had taken Wellbutrin several years ago with positive results, so I am not clear on what happened this time.  It was the same dosage and the same presenting symptoms.

I have much more energy, and I'm not constantly worried. The only problem I had with it is my face and hands would randomly swell up, but I believe this is more so my body's allergies than the medication's side effects. Either way, be careful with it.

Depression	paul, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/7/2007 12:33:51 AM	I originally took Lexapro for anxiety/depression, but I felt so &quot;drugged up&quot; and the side effects were terrible.  I've been taking Wellbutrin XL for one week, 150mg each morning, for depression.  The results have been so amazing.  I have much more energy, am excited to start the day, and am finally happy to talk to people.  However I've noticed that I have become a bit &quot;snippy&quot; and easily irritable.  I can definitely handle this though because it means I finally care about life again.  Overall, this drug has been fantastic for my depression.  After one week though, it has losts its intitial effectiveness.  I'm going to go up to 300 mg daily.  Please give this drug a try if you are a young male like myself, it has been great.

I have always thought tied to my cycle,but when I ask Dr. they don't give me any better suggestions than antidepressant. For awhile each month I often think I would leave this world if I KNEW it would not hurt my kids and husband.....

Slowly tappering off Effexor at the same time.  Effexor caused me to crave sugar and alcohol (sweet vodka coolers) everyday.  I was never a drinker, just socially glass of wine.  Gained 35 lbs in 4 months, 124lbs to 165lbs, very depressing.  Now on Wellbutrin I have no cravings at all, even coffee, and my mood is much better,eating healthy and a week without drinking.  Hopefully continues.

Within 1 hour of my first dose, I had every negative, psyciatric side effect listed.  I have never felt more intense negative emotions in my life.  My blood pressure soared and I was taken to the hospital by force.  Has anyone else ever had these reactions?  I am 49 years old and am trying hard to understand this reaction.  The doctor tried to say that it was not possible for the drug to effect me this way, but within 24 hours of not taking it, I was fine and back to normal.  The whole ordeal was traumatic.

I began to fight with my husband all the time, and I couldn't let an argument go. The urge to argue and fight was uncontrollable.

Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	11/23/2007 12:08:23 PM	No antidepressant totally alleviates all symptoms of depression.  However, Wellbutrin has the least side effects, and I don't feel like I'm taking an antidepressant.  I simply feel the absence of the extremely depressed feelings.  Yes... the things that bothered me before are still present in my mind, but I am able to live with them and put them into a more healthy perspective.  Plus, I can enjoy life regardless of its ups and downs.  Now, to me ... THAT'S living!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	sara, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/21/2007 7:42:34 AM	Stimulants for Adult ADD did not work for me. Although I occaisionally feel agitated on this medication I found that it gives that &quot;motivation in a pill&quot; effect I've been hoping for. It has also helped me to stop smoking. It is very nice to wake up and have the motivation to do the dishes and clean up and feed my son a healthy breakfst instead of laying around on the couch or smoking a cigarette first thing. I felt that it gave me an &quot;attitude problem&quot; when i was first given this medication for depression, but coupled with Effexor it is a dream come true for my ADHD symptoms. While on this medication my migrane headaches have gone away COMPLETELY and my overall blood pressure has lowered. My work has been more satisfying and less of a burden and it is easier to wake up at an ungodly hour to be there. I was also a habitual user of pot before starting this medication and have stopped smoking pot and cigaretters almost effortlessly. 
Stop Smoking	blondie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/21/2007 2:11:22 AM	I've never been treated for depression, but a suffered several deaths of loved ones this year. Wellbutrin improved my outlook and it has increased my energy level to start exercising and quit smoking! I've always had trouble sleeping and still do. losing weight and stopping smoking are great side effects! havent expierenced any negative side effects. my doctor reviewed all my supplements/vitamins and no interactions or sexual side effects on wellbutrin in my case.

Depression	lovernotalearner, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	11/20/2007 2:39:14 PM	I'd previously been on Effexor XL - side effects included weight gain and impotence.  After spending a year getting off of it, and another year trying to stay off of Anti-depressants altogether (cognitive therapy as alternative) I threw in the towel and sought 'something new' from healthcare provider.  Aside from forgetting to take it some days, I seem to tolerate it well.  I've not exactly been happy-go-lucky, but considering the despair I'd experienced during the preceding year, I feel it's been effective overall.  I'm not where I want to be yet, but I can conceive of 'getting there' - which is major progress in my book.
Bipolar Depression	Black Rainbow, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	11/19/2007 11:00:32 AM	Wellbutrin seemed to help at first, but after a couple months it made me nuts. I was getting aggravated easily and constantly bitchy. I had to stop. At that point my doc tried me on Cymbalta.

Overall this drug has worked rather well for me and produced fewer side effects than the others I have taken. There is no cure all and everyone has bouts with breakdowns, but realizing how well this has controlled the mood during the good times is important, thanks.

I dont even feel like I take any medication, but know I feel so much better. I tried other antidepressants and this is by far, thes best one! I feel like myself again!

Bipolar Depression	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	13-18	11/15/2007 3:40:08 PM	Wellbutrin was very effective the first few months that i was taking it. I was generally in good moods and my moodswings were less intense. After about five months it stopped working, so my doctor put me on 300mg. There is a noticable difference in moods depending on whether you take it in the morning or at night. Taking it in the morning was difficult to remember, so i resumed taking it at night with my Seroquel. It is a stimulant and could be good for use in the morning if you are a morning person-- no one likes being awake but grumpy in the morning. Overall, i like this drug. It has been the most effective anti-depressant I have taken in a span on 6 years.
Bipolar Depression	Bend, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	19-24	11/15/2007 3:37:13 PM	This drug made me not sleep for 3 weeks after getting it for severe depression. I lost 60lbs in 2 months - a pound a day. I shook all the time, felt sick to my stomach with a rotten feeling at the bottom. This is a horrible drug that gave me two months of absolute hell. It also made me quit smoking, temporarily, because I felt so sick that a cigarette would make it worse. Don't take wellbutrin.
Depression	me2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/15/2007 9:37:08 AM	Been taking 300mg 1x per day for a little over a year now for my depression.  Out of all the other drugs I have tried, this is the best by far. I felt like my old self within 2 weeks. I have not gained any weight. It actually curbs my appetite. And no sexual side effects. The side effects I have had are; Difficulty concentrating, and trouble staying asleep.  I have tried to stop taking it but, oh boy, do I get irritable! It's like PMS, but 10x worse! I would recommend this to anyone with depression.

It also caused dibilatating migraines for me.  I had no choice but to come off it. My primary doctor nor my neurologist would admit it could be this med. but I nothing to lose by coming off it.  About two months after i was off it.  My migraines are back to occasional and my full vision is back.

My doctor added the wellbutrin because I complained of my mood being irritable.  It has helped very minimally.  I feel numb and have difficulty focusing and concentrating. It also seems to affect short term memory in my case as well as pain in some muscles and joints.

Depression	hope, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	11/10/2007 10:34:37 PM	It is not a happy pill.  It does curb depression and make life more manageable.  I tried to get off of it twice, thinking I did not have depression anymore, but I do, and always will.  I am a generally happy person, and work on a lot of projects.  I can see the glass half full or half empty.  WellbutrinXL oral helps me see the glass half full.I have tried several other anti-depressants, including one that is supposed to help for chronic pain.  That one had too many sexual side effects.  The other one had a weight gain factor.  One of them made me MORE depressed.  One made me tired.  WellbutrinXL oral allowed me to have energy, lose a small amount of weight, I had no sexual side effects, and was able to wake up in the morning.  It gave me more energy than the rest of them.  I am very happy with it, and would recommend it to a friend.  I even heard it helps people quit smoking.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity		2	3	1			11/9/2007 5:43:26 PM	I have ADHD as well as some anxiety than can follow with it.  My doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin XL because it is shown to help with both issues.  It worked pretty well for the first week, then after that I started feeling depressed, agitated and emtional.  The effectiveness was extremely short term.  
Depression	Steveo, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	5	Male	35-44	11/9/2007 2:10:16 PM	I could be the poster child for Wellbutrin. Finally something that helped stop the constant internal dialogue - much like a dog chasing its tail. I may be in the minority here but I can wake up in the middle of the night with the anxiety dialoge streaming in my head, take a Wellbutrin and go back to sleep. 
Bipolar Depression	pcarson@sharylandisd.org, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	55-64	11/8/2007 1:18:14 PM	I'm taking four other meds, and they do not mix.  In fact, this medication has an unpleasant odor and taste when taking.  I have to take an acid reflux med to keep from throwing up, and it doesn't always work.  The meds work, but hurt my tummy.  I am diabetic II under control.  I dread the a.m. and evening meal, as I have to eat and then take the meds ---except for the welbutrin in the evening.  I've been diagnosed since August, 2007, so I'm still working on everything.  I do not like throwing up anywhere, and especially at school.  I teach school.  To help, I take Lithium Carbonate 300 mg. twice daily.  I also take Glucophage 1000 mg. twice daily.  I take Calcium Citrate + D twice daily.  In addition, 20 mg. of Crestor at night.  (My cholestrol is at 200.)  I take AcipHex, 20 mg., of the morning.  I take 15 mg. of Dalmane to sleep.  However, I do not take the Dalmane or Crestor with the night pills.As far as I can tell, the Welbutrin is working -- when I can keep it down.  I do think it is a combination of pills.  The Lithium is new since August ---- I had been on Depacote since 1999.  If you have any suggestions on which pills to take, and then the others to help the nausea, please feel free to advise.  Thank you for listening to me!

I can never get out of bed in the morning.  It has made me way more irritiable than before almost causing me to lose close relationships and my job.  Ive been experiencing dizzness for the last four days oh and not to mention its made me gain weight.  The only good thing thats happened is allowed me to quit smoking after 11 years of smoking.  Now they are wanting to put me on seroquil and those side effects and reviews I have read are scaring me badly if Welbutrin is this bad for me whats seroquil gunna do?

Took Wellbutrin for about 2 months and stopped smoking completely (with no cravings) in about 1 month. Been nicotine free for 5 months. HOWEVER, was depressed when started med due to minor surgery &amp; was smoking excessively. Doc Rx wellbutrin, and ALL habits stopped, INCLUDING wanting to be married(nearly 30 years) and being a parent to my children.  I became manic and cried ALL the time.  I stopped the wellbutrin, but these 'habits' have been damaged.  ALTHOUGH I don't know exactly how this med works, I know it's responsible for my dramatic change in personality, which is not good.  I'd rather be a smoker and never had this drug mess with my neurons.  Hopefully the drug makers read these comments.  I'm telling you something is wrong with this medication.
Stop Smoking	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	4	2	Female	55-64	11/4/2007 1:40:53 PM	Since taking this medication, I have had periods of memory loss which scares me.  I stopped taking it and things seemed better.  I'm not sure if this product can effect a person like that.

Stop Smoking	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/30/2007 10:15:49 PM	I took the generic version and smoked for 20 yrs.  At the end of the 1st week, the cigs tasted bad and I was only smoking about half of them.  At the end of the 2nd week, I was wasting money smoking, so I quit.  It's been 6 months and In haven't cheated once!

Overall I have been satisfied with the effectiveness of this medication, but now that I am trying to ween myself away from it (with doctors' approval), it is EXTREMELY difficult! I am experiencing tremors and head zaps that make it nearly impossible to function normally. PLEASE be careful when weening off of this drug!
Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	35-44	10/30/2007 12:50:50 AM	I had terrible side effects from this medication. Migraine headaches, sour stomach, nausea and vomitting. I tried to stick it out for one month, but the side effects never went away. After my Dr. took me off of it, the side effects were gone, but I realized it did help with my depression, tying effexor xr next.
Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	10/29/2007 11:31:41 PM	Wellbutrin made me very angry at everyone, I almost quit my job. Also made me have alot of muscle twitching. Did not sleep for days on end and then crashed and became very lethargic.
Depression	Light, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	55-64	10/29/2007 10:19:56 PM	Wellbutrin (generic) made feel manic at first and brought back old feelings I had when I was young about love and romance that distracted my life so much, it ruined it.  I don't want those kinds of feelings to distract me from my life's work or from the people, places, activities, and things I believe are important toward my individual and societal integrity at my age (over 50).  So, my doctor put me on Lexapro with the generic Wellbutrin and the mania has stopped and the anxiety has diminished as well.  And I haven't had a cigarette in over three months!  Life is liveable again, and life is worth living again.  Balance and stability are real again.  I am real again.

Felt a little nausea, but worst part is constipation and bloating.  Very uncomfortable.  Do have some ringing in my ears also, but overall not too bad.  I did notice a difference after the 3rd day.  I felt as if a black cloud was lifted.  Overall I do feel much better, but unless I can get this constipation under control I'm going to try and go on a lower dosage.  Bought some Aloe Vera juice today and hope it helps.  Also been drinking more water and do not have the appetite I used to have.
Stop Smoking	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/28/2007 10:00:07 AM	After years of smoking and probably hundreds of attempts to quit, my doctor prescribed Wellbutrin.  In just 3 days I could tell that my addictive need for nicotine was much lower than it had ever been. After a week on the drug, I tried to quit smoking once again. For the first time, I was able to go a day, then 2, then 4, then a week, then a month without a cigarette!  I am so grateful for this drug.  I have not smoked in 7 1/2 years thanks to Wellbutrin.  I never thought I'd be able to say that!  It's wonderful.

I was smoking almost a pack a day, and my lungs started to get real bad.. Anyway. He put me on it and it did NOT work AT ALL. My depression got out of hand and I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. Hooray if it works for you; because it deffinately didn't for me.

It has worked very well. Not only do I feel much happier, I have more energy too. Plus I lost 20lbs. I don't think the Wellbutrin directly caused the weight loss, but I think it gave me more energy and more of a desire to do things, which caused the weight loss
Depression	SereNole,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/24/2007 2:18:55 AM	This has been the only anti-depressant I've tried that didn't make me feel worse than I did before. Zoloft actually had me contemplating suicide and Effexor had me gaining so much weight I physically felt just as bad as I did mentally. I tried others too before finally trying this one. The biggest plus was that I've LOST weight, cravings were drastically reduced, and my libido wasn't compromised. That was truly wonderful!

I have had no side effects from using it. It has really made a big difference in my life. I have found that if I take it at the same time everyday then it tends to work best for me.

Still was very hyper also.  It did help his mood somewhat.  It seemed to work better at the beginning and benefit then tapered off.

Depression	lucylux, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	10/19/2007 1:45:56 AM	I have been on Wellbutrin for almost 3 weeks now and I have noticed an improvement in mood.  Tried Cymbalta before which did absolutely nothing.  In regards to side effects, I have noticed that I feel almost manic at times and have been much more talkative.  I am normally a very quiet, shy person.  Since going up to 300mg per day I have also been experiencing nausea and dizzyness.  For now though, I will continue on this medication to see if my depression continues to improve.

I've taken several other antidepressants with varying sucess. Wellbutrin works well, but has none of the unpleasant side effects, like emotional numbing or decreased libido. I've also managed to quit smoking as the nicotine simply doesn't affect me anymore.

Stop Smoking	Cadiac/Open Heart RN, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/15/2007 12:52:43 PM	I took it for anxiety and to quit smoking.  After smoking for 18 years...I quit.  Yes, it did cause some nausea at first...however you must eat when taking this medication.  Take with meals.  Also, don't give up.  It also has a side effect which decreases hunger.  I lost weight after quitting smoking...about 10 lbs.  I was scared after quitting smoking I would gain.  I didn't I lost.  This medication is a wonder drug.  It is rough in the begining as your body adjust.  It's not fun but give it time the side effects will go away and it is effective overall.  I really support the use of this drug.  I am an RN and also think if this drug does not help with smoking cessation try Chantix.  I am an Open Heart Nurse and we have had great success with our patients on Chantix.

Depression	johnny, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Male	25-34	10/12/2007 4:11:12 PM	I used this for depression and smoking cessation. I took the XL, 150mg for the first week and felt fine and then the dose was increased to 300mg a day. It helped me quit smoking and I've been smoke free for 6 months! However it sucked for my depression. When i was on 150mg i felt fine but once it increased to 300mg i felt tired and sluggish all the time. I tried it for 3 months and finally i had to be taken off it cause it was too strong. It is good if you want to quit smoking.

Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	10/12/2007 10:21:51 AM	Wellbutrin works better than any other anti-depressent that I've tried, however the side effects are scary. I also take xanax. I stopped taking the xanax for about two weeks and had a seizure. This was the first time I had ever had one. I was taking 300mg once a day in the morning. I then stopped taking the wellbutrin, but struggled with the depression again. I am now on 150mg once a day. I feel better mentally, but sometimes I feel a little dizzy the morning if i drink the night before. it also makes me sweat like a pig. The results are soo good that i can live with the stuff that comes along.

SSRI's make me tired, wellbutrin wakes me up.  also works well to control physical withdrawals from smoking cessation.  been cig free for 2 weeks.

Stop Smoking	marti, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	9/25/2007 6:53:01 PM	 I am &quot;somewhat&quot; dissatisfied with this medication. I recently was prescribed wellbutrin due to anxiety and addiction to cigarettes. I took it for 3 weeks and yes quit smoking but had more anxiety than ever and more depression. I had many fits of out of control crying and anger. My boyfriend brought the medication I was on to my attention because he knew that i was a little on the emotional side but not possessed. I even had a week long outbreak of hives. Although I am only 90% sure this was the medications fault. I was so distracted at all the other stuff I was going through I did not crave cigarettes and as far as drinking was involved I got sick after two drinks so I am taking a vacation from alcohol as well. I still have hives on and off so hopefully in another 24 hours the medication should be completely out of my system and hopefully hive free. I will finally be able to breath peacefully and with out a cigarette in my hand.
