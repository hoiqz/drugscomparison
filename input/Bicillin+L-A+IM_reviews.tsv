Syphilis	Syphillis, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	8/4/2012 12:28:15 PM	One shot of this med and I was cleared in 2-3 weeks of visual signs on my body and lowered my blood levels to almost non existant. Takes time to build up and work with the immune system.

Strep Throat	natureistheway, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	19-24	1/18/2012 6:26:50 PM	Cleared up the strep, but caused me to have a seizure (which I have never had before). It was a horrible experience. I couldn't get out of bed the entire next day. Felt like I had been hit by a truck. The vaccination site was extremely sore for a few days, and the shot the buttocks was not a fun experience either...very painful.

Rheumatic Fever Prevention	pmg, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	2	4	Female	45-54	7/12/2010 4:37:30 PM	My 20 year old son was recently diagnosed with Rheumatic Fever - it took 4 weeks, including two week long hospital visits and a team of specialists to get a final diagnosis. Treatment plan - Bicillin LA shot every 4 weeks for a minimum of 5 years.  He says the shot is very painful - but not nearly as painful as the symptoms he experienced over 4+ weeks. He is symptom free after his 2nd shot...

Strep Throat	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	11/26/2009 12:03:28 PM	Had a highly virulent strain of strep which hit suddenly in the evening - the next afternoon I was at the doctor - she said the second my culture hit the dish it was positive for strep.  She felt something strong and immediate was the best treatment.  I'm so glad I took the shot - it honestly did hurt, even though I have a high tolerance for pain, it wasn't as bad as how badly my throat hurt.  It's almost 24 hours later and I feel at least 90% better - just slight 'tightness' in my throat - and had a great night's rest.  Much better than 10 days worth of antibiotics.
