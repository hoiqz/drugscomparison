Epileptic Seizure	snzzer, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/10/2010 5:07:37 PM	I have been taking Dilantin for 45 years now and didn't have any problem's. I had two seizures in 2000. The blood test showed that I had no dilantin in my system, but I was taking it faithfully. I was also taking St. Johns Wart vitamin and it cleaned out my system, lol. I quit the vitamin and I have been siezure free since.

Other	ricpent, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	3/30/2010 3:12:22 PM	I am hoping to connect with someone who approximates my situation. My dosage is 300mg/day. I weigh 145. Leads to approx .25 serum level. Highly qualified neurologist says,&quot;fine&quot; Equally qualified GP says I should prevent eventual liver damage by maintaining .20 s/l. Without going into all precautionary measures I've taken, I stay at home quietly on the one day a week that I skip dosage. Am not overly concerned because  on several occasions(family emergencies) I have accidently missed 2 days! Remained cool and carefully monitored situation, relaxed and watched for &quot;aura&quot;. Nothing happened. Am 63 and have had 3 seizures since stroke in 1983. Advice anyone? Due to spasticity, I also take Diazepam. That is all. Occasional alcohol. Excellent diet. Salmon, skim milk, home made bread and yogurt. Distilled H2O,sea salt and excellent vitamin regimen.Beef 1/mo. Chicken/Turkey 3/wk. Ala pasta 4/wk. and rice and veggies/olive oil. No butter, only &quot;Smart Balance&quot;. Organic eggs 3/wk. Would appreciate further suggestions!
Epileptic Seizure	tobagotim, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	3/24/2010 3:15:15 AM	I have been taking Dilantin or a combination of Dilantin and Phenobarbitol for about 55 years.  My seizures have been gran mal followed by a sleep period of several hours.  I am fortuante that the seizures came about one every 3 years.  The last one over 35 years ago.  The last seizure that I had followed a neurologist's attempt to reduce my dosage.  My family doctor noted that my dosage had fallen out of the the therapuetic zone.  I have not had a seizure in 25 years now that the medicine is in the therapuetic zone.  I have been asked again if I would like to reduce the dosage.  I grew up with this medicine in my system and am comfortable with it; I would rather continue taking it the rest of my life than risk any more gran mal seizures.  The main thing for me are regular blood tests to make sure the medication remains at the correct levels.

Epileptic Seizure	lilyann, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/9/2009 12:42:03 AM	I have been taking Dilantin since I had my first seizure 30 years ago. The generic does not work well for me and my doctor won't prescribe it for any of her patients. Unfortunately, my ins will only pay for the generic. But the 70.00 a month is a small price to pay for no seizures. I have had two healthy children,(now grown)neither with problems. I have taken Dilantin and Phenobarbitol for 30 yrs and added Zonegran for the last 8. When my original neuro retired, I went to a new one that decided that I took &quot;dinosaur meds&quot; and wanted me to get current. Even though I had been seizure free for years. Needless to say, I lost a month of my life having numerous grand mals a day until my husband took me to a new neuro that got me back on the original meds. I have some issues with my gums and my memory lately, but again, it is a small price to pay to be able to live my life and enjoy my family!!!!

When I was first put on meds I had 2 others meds with this one that my first Nuerologist prescribed Phenibaritol and Zarontin. This mix did not totally help and at age 17 the doctor said this is the best thing for you as others in your family it has worked for and can you live with out driving (As I was not totally controlled). When he said this that was the last time I saw him as I could not live where I could not drive. I went to my current Nuerologist he took me off both Zarontin and Phenobaritol nd place me on Depakote with Dilantin. Since then I have been successful on occassion blood levels have changed and I had side effects but I've been seizure free for several years. 
Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/1/2009 11:03:01 PM	overall this medication has worked well for me. I have taken it for 3 yrs now the only problem I have is some of the side affects are begining to have an impact on me. All in all the medication outweighs the side affects.

Convulsive Seizures	Greg, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	6/3/2009 9:26:28 AM	I have been on this drug since the onset of my seizure disorder 30 years ago. For the most part, I have found it to be an effect medication, although I started having break though seizures about 10 years ago, resulting in my having to take Lamictal as a supplement. Fortunately, bleeding of the gums has been very minimumal at best, but I have noticed an increase of being tired and/or sluggish. (This could very well be the result of taking both medications, however.)
Epileptic Seizure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	5/4/2009 9:43:11 AM	I've taken Dilantin for the better part of 13 yrs.  Sometimes I switched to a generic, but I had breakthrough seizures so I switched back.  I am generally satisfied with Dilantin, excpet for the memory issues and puffy gums.  My doctor increased my dose from 300mg/day to 400mg/day and I noticed a big decline in energy level and memory retention.  Body hair growth has been my biggest self-esteem issue with this drug.

He had one seizure.  He started on Keppra and had psychological side effects.  Same thing with Topamax.  He's only been on Dilantin for three days but it makes hime extremely tired, light headed, and his face tingles sometimes.  He really wants to try to make this work but he's supposed to be at 300mg/day and can't even tolerate 100mg/day.  He really wants to know how long other people have taken to acclimate to these drugs.  It affects his work and this frustrates him.

I was tired all the time, and my gums did get pretty bad. My neurologist now tells me that he hasn't prescribed this for years, especially to women. Ive also been told its very bad for your bones. I also took the generic, and it wasn't as affective. I think this drug is alright for short term use, but after years of use, its not very good for you
Convulsive Seizures		1	4	1			1/14/2009 8:44:13 PM	 I have been on dilantin for five days. The Dr prescribed me 900mg a day. The first day I started taking it I had to go back to the er. After that, few days later,I started getting a tingling sensation left side of my head and arm, lost balance and temporary memory lost. Skin started turning yellow and tinling in my head increased along with passing out. I fell countless times. Dilantin levels were really high.

It works great for me when I take it. Only seiure I have had on it was when I didnt take it for a while since I couldnt afford it.  My most common side effects with it are getting dizzy real easy, dry mouth, acne, and bleeding gums.  Lately my teeth have been getting bad and I'm starting to forget things I used to know and do on a regular basis which greatly affects my job.  My doc recenly bumped my level up from 200 to 300 mg/day at night since my level is never accurate or coherent with every test. I am still able to drive.  Any one else having any similar effects?

I notice I am so tired on this medication and also my gums hurt at times.  I have been on it 20 years and wish I could get off it as it has caused me acne and cysts.

However the first few years this drug worked for me. This is not a drug I suggest even think of taking. If I new about the long term effects I would have never taken this drug in the first place. ij

I have been taking 400 mg a day since then. The seizures seem to be under control unless I am under extra stress. I don't know if my short term memory loss is because of the stroke or the meds. I have a lot of joint pain, but all of this is so much better than having the seizures. I am still not allowed to drive. I also have headaches from this.

Has this ever happened to anyone else?

I do belive that each was cause by a blow to the head. My doctor says that I may have to take this drug for the rest of my life so I don't have another seizure.  He tried ofter drugs but they did not work for me.  They made me fill like I was drunk and I couldn't go about my daily life while taking any of them.

I ve been taking it for almost 20 years. Back in 1989 after a stressful but injury free car accident I suffered a mild seizure. I was taken to the local ER and given Dilantin. I took it for 3 years and didn't have any more seizures. Then I went off it when I went to college and for about a year I was fine. I had two other seizures in college. They were both at times when I was severely run down and was not taking my meds regularly. After the last seizure in 2005 I realized my life style had to change and I had to take the medication religiously. Ever since I have been seizure free with a low dose of 400mg daily. For me side/fx are extra body hair(I never had any) and my gums bleed easily. I'm curious to know if prolonged Dilantin use has any link to low sex drive or short term memory loss or any other health risks?

I am 50 years old and have taken this drug since I was 10 years old.  I have been seizure free...during a small time frame, I had a few seizures.  The dr's. never could figure out why; I only have had seizures when I am in bed asleep; never in the day.  I tried to go off of the meds when I wanted to get preg; had more seizures and went back on it and adopted.  This is a staple in my life; I have taken it every single night.
