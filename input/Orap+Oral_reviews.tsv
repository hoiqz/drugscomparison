I would not function in my daily life without it. I only take enough to suppress tics during the day so I don't overmedicate.
Tourette's	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	3/28/2012 11:39:31 PM	Orap immediately took care of my facial and hand ticks but gave me SEVERE anxiety.  I was on this drug for two years before I realized why I was so anxious.  I went thru 8 jobs in two years because of it.  Wish I would have pin-pointed the cause earlier.  Would have saved me A LOT of grief.  Stopped taking it and am back to my normal laid-back self!

Orap worked for me however the side effects were too much for me to handle.  I was scared all the time, had severe panic attacks, would hear and see things that no one else heard.  Thought about suicide on a regular basis.  I finally decided to get off of Orap and it took well over a year for the anxiety and depression (even with depression RX) to get back to normal except now my Tourrettes is worse than it was ever before.  I have an appointment to go back to the doctor to once again try Orap.  After stopping Orap my Tourrettes has gotten so much worse that I'm willing to be scared, see &amp; hear things that others don't just to stop the tics.  In my opinion Orap is a give and take relationship.  Take Orap and have back part of your life but give up feeling safe, tight spaces, airplane rides, just about anything that might have a little excitement that cause the panic attack. Oh, and the facial movements that could become permanent that I got the first time around I'm willing to take back.  Just because movement is much quieter in a quiet place than a tic.  My tics were foul words and weird noises.

She tried Tenex but that had no effect.  She was place on Orap, 2 mg a day, and her tics have disappeared, even during periods of extreme stress.  I have not noticed any side effects from this dosage.
Tourette's	tikker, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	65-74	4/28/2011 9:33:27 PM	I have had Tourettes since I was 10; I'm now 71.  I have been on Klonopin for 25 years and thought I needed to try something new.  Orap was a huge mistake.  After two weeks I felt like crawling out of my skin.  I stopped and it took 2 weeks for the side affects to discontinue because of it's long half life.  Orap was a huge mistake!

I have now been on orap(2mg) for 26 years and it has been a life savor.  Since going on the medication I have raised a family, gotten a BS and Masters degree in Education and am able to live a normal life.  I am very thankful for this drug and do not intend on trying anything else.

Other	dawnwark, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	9/22/2009 6:37:13 PM	I have a 16 year old daughter who has OCD but also tics. The drug immediately made them disappear but the personality change, mood swings and moderate depression are scaring me. I cannot tell if this is 16 year old behaviour or a true drug interaction.  Anyone have an idea about how to distinguish...I have never had a teenage girl before nor remember my own childhood closely enough to know if this is &quot;normal&quot; behaviour. I guess we can try another drug to remove the tics and see if her mood improves...any ideas?
Tourette's	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	7/22/2009 2:16:39 AM	I HAVE TOURETTE SYNDROME AND MY DOCTOR WANTED ME TO TAKE ORAB. AFTER TAKING IT FOR 2 WEEKS I STARTED GETTING DEPRESSED AND HAVING MUCH ANXIETY.  I COULD NOT CONTROL MY IMPULSES. WELL I HAD TO CALL 911 DUE TO A MENTAL IMPAIRMENT AND JUDGEMENT IN MY BEHAVIOR FROM THIS MEDICIDE.  IT DOES CAUSE SUICIDIAL TENDENCIES.  THIS IS OUT OF MY CHARACTER.  I HAD NO CONTROL OVER MY OWN THOUGHTS.  I INTEND TO TAKE THIS TO A CIVIL CASE IN COURT.  NO ONE SHOULD TAKE THIS MEDICINE.  IT IS NOT WORTH IT
Tourette's	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female		3/11/2009 5:49:53 PM	It only mildly worked, and it caused my 9th grade daughter to have severe diarrhea, it was so thin that it was sliding out without her knowledge.

This drug made her very slow, walked stiff and slow, slow reation time and had memory issues. She is seeking an alternative. From a daughters point of view....I don't agree with Orap (for her anyway).
Tourette's	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/9/2009 7:03:09 PM	My daughter is 11 years old and was diagnosed with Tourettes Syndrome 8 months ago.  After watching her tic for hours at a time, I have been very please to see what Orap has done for her.  She still has tics, but only when she is stressed, excited or in extreme heat.  I have been very pleased with Orap.  I feel parents should always  be knowledgeable of what their children are taking and take the time to research it yourself because our children are our responsibility.
Other	helpless, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	9/23/2008 3:07:25 PM	My daughter who is 7 years old and weighs 48 pounds was put on ORAP because we were told that she had Tic Syndrome. She did fine the first 3 days with 1mlgm. The doctor told us that she need 1 pill in the morning and 1 in the evening. We started the second pill on a Sat. Monday evening we had to call an ambulance because she was not responsive. To make a long story short, we were told by several doctors that she was way over medicated. We were also told that kids under the age of 12 shouldn't be on this medicine, because it is to powerful!!!! To all you parents please research other drugs for children under 12. This almost killed my only daughter. I did all kinds of research and explained to the doctor what I found, and he still told me that she would be fine. Not True!
