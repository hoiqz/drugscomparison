Although I give it great reviews, its more for what its not prescribed for than what it is.  I got A's and B's in Calculus 1,2,3, Physics 1,2, and Chemistry 1,2 sequence plus Diff EQ.  But, this drug will make you want to have sex all day and it is a distraction. Its almost painful how the mind will not deviate from this topic.  Also, when the drug wears off many people feel &quot;nervous&quot; but in my opinion this is when you can get the most work done because whatever you focus on will be worked on, you just have to ignore the depression or jitters.  Do not take this drug everyday!  I took 30mg capsule about once a week and the mind really doesn't stop racing for about a week.  You can sleep about 24 hours after taking a 30mg capsule, but the mind seems to remember how to function correctly well after that.One final note is that when the drug does wear off, waking up is very very difficult, but sleeping is very enjoyable.

Although it works just as well as shorter dose, I find that when it wears off, I have a drop off ... sadness is the best way to describe it.  The information that came with it did not mention this issue, but things I have read since mention the possibility.

It is the miracle drug that I have always needed but when younger refused, if only I knew!  I can focus now more then ever. I once was not able to study with ANY noise around and now the TV can be on no problem.  I was on 10 mg twice a day and now I'm at 20mg.  I do not have any side effects other than great energy and the ability to focus on homework and work.  Its great it has improved every aspect of my life. I am careful of not taking it 3 hours before bed because it does take me about 5 minutes longer to fall asleep.  Drink a pop around the peek of my medicine working has helped an nervous feeling that I have.  With that in mind this helps me have all the positives and none of the negatives of the drug.  If your thinking about taking this drug, just do it becuase you will never regret this.

I am on 30miligrams a day and it seems that my body has been reacting different towards it.I think I'm getting immune to the drug, I find myself emotionally unstable,and lately I have really bad ticks,prickling and my thumbs and my focus has been off as well. It's scary because I really want to get off of it before things get worse, the only thing stopping me is school, I worry that I will be completely off focus and I wont be able to finish school. Today I didn't take it and i was in a great mood, normally when I'm on it I am depressed and guarded. I really don't know what to do from here.

Other medications were tried; Provigil put me to sleep for 14 hours. I took Provigil twice - the Docs had trouble understanding.  Ritalin LA works for me. I take 60 mg each morning &amp; live a normal life;  without it, nothing is normal

So I have to give him a 5mg pill to help through homework and then doesn't want to go to bed and doesn't sleep well.

But I think as parents we know them better then anyone else does and we know when they need a little help controlling themselves.Belieive me giving my son meds was the last thing I wanted to do. This medication helps him get through school and have good evenings at home. I have no complaints. He eats, he sleeps, and he isn't a zomby like the other medication vyvanse made him. He gets a good 7-8hrs out of it and slowly comes down in the evening. he's on 30mg and thats what seems to work for him.

It seems to be okay; although I start going down hill around 3:00PM. Was on Provigil, 300 mg, for years and it too stopped providing help with my fatigue &amp; tasking (Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis). What is the maximum dosage for MS patient on Ritalin LA. Oh, by the way... it works great for my tasking problem.
Other	sunshine 01, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	35-44	10/6/2008 9:39:45 PM	I have a sleep disorder not helped by Provigil, but 15 mg of Ritalin in the am then again around 4pm worked well. Dr. switched me and after 2 days of the new capsule, it is easier, but not nearly as effective. It seems to wear off early in the day (like 5pm) and leaves me exhausted during a usually productive time of my day -when my child goes to bed. Unless this is going to kick in better in a few days, I want to go back to the regular pills. This capsule also takes an hour to kick in, and the pills only 30 to 40 minutes.

It alters your personality as well as helping you focus and stay on track with your activities. It does not substitute for a good work ethic or diligence however, those skills must be trained not drugged.This medicine does give an extreme drop off after approximately 6 hours after the dosage and is rather rough on one mentally.Almost as if you were watching one channel of tv and suddenly someone else grabs the remote and switches channels without your control. I felt I needed to post because I read of so many VERY young children being given this powerful drug and I believe that discipline must first be attempted before jumping into giving your 5 year old drugs.

She started on Ritalin LA as her first medication attempt a few months later when school started.  She did good on it for a while.  We got up to 30mg daily but instead of the 6-8hrs promised, she usually got a good 5 usable hours prior to coming down.  She was arguementative about homework at night unless it was done right after school (which we started doing w/my mom).  She developed a very loud, annoying and very  disruptive verbal tic.  (Think throat clearing loud enough to hurt your ears within 3 feet of her).  So we are switching to Strattera to try it and we'll see.  The Ritalin was pretty good though, she complained of stomach pain sometimes and I think that was the medicine.  But overall, no weight loss (just smaller gains than prior on the growth chart but it remained consistant) normal growth rate, appetite was less so for lunch but good the rest of the day.  She did SO much better in school and her ability to concentrate when it was working was great.  An overall good improvement, but the tic thing was an overwhelming side effect that was detrimental to school and social situations.  I think the tic was brought out from stress, but, am not sure.  I'm hoping she will do good on the Strattera, but it bothers me there is no other way to treat this that doesn't involve potentially mood altering drugs.....

The difference in her school performance is amazing. She can stay on task much better and her socialization has improved greatly. The only side effect so far is she gets very emotional in the late afternoon(crying/whinning), but this seems to be improving somewhat. We are pleased with this medication as our first ADHD med.
