Other	rojo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/15/2011 11:31:06 AM	My teenage daughter suffers from debilitating migraines.  They are so bad that we have to take her to the ER to get relief when her rescue meds fail.  The doctors have tried so many different meds via IV but to no avail, especially when she gets stabbing pain.  Finally one doctor tried Inapsine as a last resort.  What a difference!  The pain stopped almost immediately, she smiled and walked out on her own, not needing a wheelchair.  For my daughter, this has been a miracle drug. She has had no adverse effects other than sleepiness.  She has had to have it two more times and again, no adverse effects. I realize that it has effected others adversely, but it does work miracles for some.

Its caused sever depression and mood swings, in an otherwise happy person. This drug needs to be removed from the market. seems VERY dangerous. I am actually going to head into the ER in a little bit to see if they have anything they can do to make this stop. If they can't I am going to find a lawyer

The doctor thought I was anxious, as well, but I am just normally a fast talker and I was in pain.The ER doctor gave me this medication and said it was for pain.  Apparently, this is not a pain medication.Within 5 minutes, I was having difficulty breathing and became out of touch with reality.  I became very agitated with restless leg, tachycardia, and confusion.  I felt I was going to pass out or die. This medication was derived in Hell.My ER doctor was not being honest in why he administered this medication.Patients NEED to ask &quot;why&quot; before medications are administered.  We have the right.

Nausea and Vomiting	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/23/2010 10:58:06 PM	I was in the ER with a severe migraine. I was given this drug and within seconds felt this horrible sense of doom or depression and then very anxious. I could not stop moving my legs or arms but it was this internal feeling of anxiety that is hard to explain but almost unbearable.  I had to supress the urge to rip off the IV..I will make sure I NEVER am given this drug again.
Other	45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1		45-54	1/13/2010 7:23:36 PM	I was told in the ER that I was given this med in combination with Benydryl for pain and inflammation for pancreatitis. I was actually dehydrated and receiving IV fluids as well. I felt extremely restless and wired immediately after receiving this med.  I would never want it again based on this very uncomfortable reaction.
Nausea and Vomiting	Lexie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	55-64	12/31/2009 4:16:19 PM	Went to ER because of severe abdominal pains. Started vomiting at ER and they gave me a shot of Inapsine. Apparently, it stopped my vomiting but it wiped out my memory of about 12 hour prior and about six hours around shot. Because of pain had stopped, I kept asking why am I in the hospital. They were going to proceed with surgery until the anestheologist realized that I didn't remember him telling me why I was there and the planned surgery. I still have no recall of driving to hospital or the pain that I was going thru that caused me to call my doctor, who advised me to get to the hospital. Because I was unable to remember what they told me a few minutes earlier, they did an MRI to see if I had had a stroke. I lost all memory of about 15 hours and learned what had happened from my doctor. I would never knowlingly accept this drug again. If I consented to it at the time, I have no recall.

Nausea and Vomiting	lovingspouse, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	1/21/2009 3:12:38 PM	Spouse given this drug for nausea in ER.  Within minutes began having adverse reaction, strong anxiety, hallucination, tearing out IV in order to escape and screaming for help.  When nurse advised, they administered benedryl and commented that sometimes this drug can cause &quot;LSD-type trips and people begin climbing the walls.&quot;  Nurse made it sound like no big deal!  VERY frightening and has changed his life dramatically since then.  Now suffers depression, anxiety, seizure-like spells, all from this terrible anti-nausea drug that is given regularly in ERs. If any drug side effects are like a bad LSD trip, it should be removed from the market!! BE VERY AWARE before getting this drug.

I could not even tell my husband who was beside me that I needed help. I looked and felt like I was having a seizure my muscles drew up and my tongue swelled finally when I got his attention the Dr. gave me Benadryl to counter act. Please use caution BEFORE getting this Med.

When I told the nurse I NEVER WANTED IT AGAIN she tried to convince me otherwise.  When I spoke to the doctor he agreed that the drug didn't have to be used. 
Nausea and Vomiting	frantic, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	6/26/2008 3:34:36 PM	Several years ago, I was taken to the ER due to constant N/V after GI surgery, seems I had an Ileus.  But Phenergan suppositories were not helping and they decided to try Inapsine.  BIG MISTAKE.  As soon as they gave it IVP,  I begin to have trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, and basically looked like I was having a stroke.  I almost broke my teeth from the constant grinding and I just knew they were going to have to put me on the ventilator because I couldn't breath. But finally they started another IV, gave me 2 kinds of meds and oxygen before it got better.  Never want to do that again.

This is the first time I have felt normal in 4 months after having vertigo for that long. I use it under my tongue, 4 drops, twice a day. It has been wonderful and I feel normal again.
