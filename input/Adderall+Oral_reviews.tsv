Have used twice daily for more the 2, but less than 5 years. Works as good sleep aide, also. Have NOT felt or developed any side effects. Grateful to my Psychiatrist for thinking of this medicine when no antidepressants, tricyclic, MAoI's or others, worked.

Then recently after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia, I was referred to a psychologist for ADD testing which can be affiliated with fibromyalgia. I was then diagnosed with ADD and was put on 10 mg of adderall twice daily. It has done absolute wonders for me. Taking it early enough in the morning and once again around noon keeps me from being up too late. My mood is always heightened and I am very motivated and not overwhelmed. The only downfall is that of a rare side effect, which would be once the adderall starts to wear off, I get the sensation of bugs crawling all over my skin. It scared me at first because my first impression was that it could be bed bugs or scabies, but after both were ruled out, I learned it is a rare and unspoken side effect of this drug, which has been controlled by a low dosage of atarax, which is an antihistamine primarily. and the nice thing about it is that it helps me sleep at night! Anyone else seem to have that bizarre sensation once it gets later in the day and the adderall is wearing off?

Good news is that it works wonderfully in managing the symptoms. The bad news is that you have to watch how your appetite is affecting your eating habits, usually you won't be hungry until the medicine wears off and you might find yourself malnourished if you're not careful. Also note that you can develop permanent 'tics' or compulsive repetitive behaviors. I have developed a tic of chewing on the side of my tongue. I am now pregnant and cannot take the medication for obvious reasons and yet I still chew on my tongue, but that being said, it isn't severe enough to prevent me from retaking it after my pregnancy because the ADHD is definitely worse than the side-effects of the Adderall. However, every person is different so maybe for other people these 'tics' and appetite changes might not seem so minor. Overall though I have found it very useful and it has made a huge and mostly positive difference in my life, so if you're thinking about trying it to treat your ADHD then I'd say go right ahead.

I had no idea that I could be helped so much by a medication. I do understand it is considered an &quot;upper&quot; for those not afflicted with ADHD. I had seen the shows of abuse by parents with this medication. This medication, although, not used for ADHD, for me, allowed me to feel like I wanted to get up and live my life. I have only been on it for less than 6 months but I feel it saved my life by giving me the kick in the butt someone else might get from coffee. Nothing worked for me, complete loss of energy until I started the Adderall Oral. It is mentioned as a treatment for severe depression and I refuse to feel bad for using a medication that made me want to live again. It's not magic, I still have to think positive, not focus on the negative but I'm so thankful this medication serves more than one ailment.

During the day, I was a complete zombie. don't me wrong, it worked. I focused and did my work, but from last period to about 7 O'clock I was a complete wreck. I would get angry, and cry. I'd have MASSIVE headaches everyday and when I did my homework i'd get impatient, cry somemore and just feel hopeless. upset that I couldn't do my work like I could the rest of the day and get re-angry when someone tried to help me with it. I've given up on medication and am a firm believer that you can overcome this by yourself. Jst a strong will power,and dedication to success.

I used to be so unorganized, with my manic thinking and racing thoughts and insomnia, as well as being so extremely uncomfortable in any and all social situations. Now I am able to function in daily life and have a daily routine I stick too as well; by feeling comfortable in my own skin and before having no self confidence, now I see myself as attractive and young and intelligent and full of potential. When put on this medication by my doctor - after being on every anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, mood stabilizers and benzodiazapines, etc; since the age of 4 and am now 29 - I now feel that I have finally found the one psychiatric drug that has actually helped me in my life. Not just with my Adult Add, but also with my Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder and Bi-Polar I Disorder and lack of concentration, focus and energy to complete tasks. This drug is a life saver...that is no joke!!! Constant catatonic depression for over a year and being pulled out of it and having your lust for life back, is a gift from the Gods!

I would bounce from task to task, and realized that this was the first job that I had to sit and focus.  Having started this med, I can focus, finish what I start without feeling like I have to move or do something else.  In meetings I can remember what was said, because I actually pay attention, I'm not checking my phone or drawing.  Even my coworkers have noticed that I am much more &quot;quiet&quot; (they don't know my condition).  The best part...my head is quiet.  When I first started this med, I felt slow and didn't understand how the rest of the world functioned thinking this slow...to me they were the one with the problem.  Not my fault they couldn't keep up :)  My relationships have gotten better, I actually listen and let them finish speaking.  I'm still busy but I actually get stuff done, and that is the best part.  It's not pieces at a time are completed, the whole thing is completed.  Also, I still get hungy, just full on less food.  But I do drink TONS of water everyday due to the cotton mouth side effect.  Minor annoyance compared to the greatness that is taking place.  I highly recommend this med to anyone that has ADD/ADHD.  You don't lose who you are, just a better more pulled together you shines through.

It has really helped with my inatentiveness and I don't have the extreme highs and lows nor do I feel like crap when i dont take it like I have with other stimulant medications. The only drawback to this medication is it causes constant spotting. Ive been spotting every day since I started the medication even if I don't take it on the weekends or if I'm on vacation the spotting is still present. It's a small price to pay for a medication that &quot;normalizes&quot; your cognitive functioning.

During this time, I was treated with xanax(alprazolam) tablets which, as directed, I took 3x a.day. Over these years I was at a dose of up to 6 mg per day. I tried one time foolishly to just stop taking it and was put in the hospital the following day, unaware that I was going through serious and potentially life-threatening issues. Then, lure and behold, in 2009, the dr who I continue to see suggested that I actually seemed to be suffering from adult add. He immediately placed me on adderall. It has been a life changing med and is the sole reason that I.am now free from the addictive grip of xanax. Well, I am now almost totally off of benzos and currently working down from only a 5 mg diazepam...1/2-1 twice daily. Its so nice to be medicated appropriately and arty the same time, I am no longer a slave to anypill. :)))

I am now a junior in high school and still take it daily for school. When I started taking Adderall it was the 5mg IR before school every day. A very low dosage for an 8 year old but it did help. Since then I changed to 10 mg ER somewhere in later middle school when I was either 13 or 14. Just this year I increased to 20 mg ER before school with 10 mg IR after school in order to help focus on homework. The adderall has been invaluable for me in helping me focus both during school and out, as well as lowering my impulsivity since it gives me that second reaction time before I say something or do something I shouldnt. The only side effect Ive ever noticed is that I do have a decrease of appetite when on the pill and once it wears off Im ravenously hungry. However, once on the medication for 5 days or so that symptom has gone away and I end up hungry again. Overall I would recommend it to anyone with ADD or ADHD.

Yes, it keeps me awake but the side affects, to me, are not worth it.  I had severe loose bowel movements, slight headaches, shakiness, VERY IRRITABLE AND ADJITATED at every little thing.  Became cold to the world and everyone in it.  Sore throat, and severe rash on my chest that still hasn't gone away after almost 2 weeks off the adderall.  I was very sensitive to anything that seemed loud....things that I normally wouldn't think was loud.  Fighting with my own mind and my family constantly.  Tightness in my thumbs, yeah WEIRD.  Sore tongue and the list goes on. Also, even though I was awake, I had absolutly NO MOTIVATION AND WOULDN'T EVEN COMPLETE A SIMPLE CHORE.  My mood has gotten better since off of this and I would never recommend it to anyone.  But I know each medication is different for everybody. Hey, if I didn't have the HORRIBLE side affects I would still take it because it did keep me from excessive sleep.  Now went to a neuropsychiatrist and he put me on Nuvigil, which I have heard GOOD AND UGLY news about, but can't even try it because my insurance won't cover it.  Now, back to the doc tomorrow to get my script for ritalin and am totally scared because the rates on that med. don't seem any better than the adderall. But, you never know it may work for me.  I can only pray. Just wanted to share my story in case any of you have had these side affects I would immediatly stop.

In too large of a dose though, it causes me to relapse back into my anorexia, so having a nutritionist tracking my weight helps.

Also excess daytime sleepiness from fragmented sleep due to hundreds of central apneas.The cpap made that worse on my 1st sleep test.I have pain issues from the ms, spasticity,cluster migraine,peripheral neuropathy,cervical and spine issues,plus other numerous.I was on an inserted baclophen-morphine pain pump-with a usual customary dose for ms related.But that even on low dose caused me to pass out cold 24-7 without warning while walking down steps,driving, smoking,etc.Now take oral pain meds methadone and oxycodone. Since 2000-my drs put me on Cylert,Provigil,etc,and Adderall since 07.If I dont take it-forget,or cant find,(temp)at drugstore,I will lay in bed for days,to tired even to cook. With Adderall-I get energy 80-90% of time from 40-100 mg. If I take to late in the day I will get insomnia. Orig lost a few lbs but recent gained all back. Overall a godsend for me.  My daughter also takes (not always properly),and she can get moody,go wo sleep,etc.

I'm a college senior with a GPA of 3.6. I LOVE my classes and professors, but I can't pay attention as well as I wished. I found myself drinking insane amounts of coffee just to try and stay focused. I couldn't get through more than 4 pages in a book without having to reread it again. The worst part was, I had absolutely no motivation to do any schoolwork away from school (which used to not be a problem at all.) So, a few weeks ago, a classmate told me she was prescribed Adderall for the last 14 years, but stopped taking it, and selling it to make a quick buck. I had already researched ADD and ADHD and self diagnosed myself. I cut a 20mg pill in half, and didn't feel any difference at all. I waited a day or 2 and tried a full 20mg dose. 30 minutes later or so, I then found myself reading normally again, I was motivated to do things I had put off for weeks, I didn't get bored doing normal everyday things, and I didn't feel like I was moving at a million miles a minute (like I read people felt earlier.) I don't know when or if it even stopped working. I took it around 7pm and went to bed, no problem, at midnight (my typical bedtime) without any issues. I know that I don't HAVE to take it every day at all, but my days off when I want to just sleep and be lazy, I take  just ONE 20mg pill around noon after I have been up for a few hours, and I am far more productive than I have ever been in years. I'm not sure how to go about talking to a doctor about my self-diagnosis, or if there are any other similar medicines that could possibly be prescribed without the overly judged and criticized name Adderall attached to it. Not sure if that helps anyone, but I do see a positive change definitely. I wouldn't use it habitually or for an extended amount of time.

I once was at a standstill in College, always wanting class to be over, never paying attention, ditracted and over stimulated by the smallest noises; I would find myself obsessing about the tapping of a pencil, rather than the professor. As a result, my grades suffered, self-esteem suffered,  and I wanted to give up. I was prescribed adderall xr my sophomore year in College and I literally noticed a dramatic difference immediately. My grades went from a 2.4 and have remained at a 3.6. I do not recommend for long term use.

I have a fast paced job and my inability to maintain organization, stay on task and follow through has gotten much better. It is critical to have therapy to learn ways to work with ADD. Drugs are not the end all to ADD, between therapy and meds, it works.

I periodically develop tolerance to Adderall, as well, but a short &quot;drug vacation&quot; recovers its effectiveness.  This can make things a bit unpredictable, which is one reason I downgraded its ease of use.  The other is that, just because a few bad apples chose to abuse this and similar drugs, I have to get a written prescription, every single time; no refills, no phone-ins.   So, most of the difficulties with the drug are legal, not pharmaceutical.

However, when I moved and obtained a new doctor, he did not feel comfortable prescribing that dosage because of it being a controlled substance. Instead he switched and cut me off completely which caused severe depression and no motivation to do anything. When I asked about an extended release version so I wouldn't have the roller coaster effect he pursuaded me to try Concerta and Zoloft together instead... and let me say that it does not work for me (even after 2 months). I feel like I'm in my own world often and analyze everything way too much... Please someone tell him to listen to his patient and get off the adderall judging bandwagon. It does work for some patients, just saying.

She had been on Clonidine but it wasn't helping. It made her very tired so the point of her sitting, staring, nearly drooling on herself. When she started Adderoll it took a week to see real results, but it worked pretty well. She did have some issues with losing weight at first, but over time she gained back to the &quot;normal&quot; range. After almost a year of being on it, it became less effective. She started having violent outbursts, hurting herself and us, screaming, unable to pay attention, and very sad / crying often. I think for a while we had a good run, but when it was over it was OVER. It was like night and day how dramatically she changed when it stopped working. Also it is exteremly hard to find in the 5mg dose she was on. Had to drive to another town to get it. We're starting Ritalin now, hope it works better and for longer.

It was alot like making a deal with the devil.  YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AT WHAT YOU DO.  YOU WILL GET ADDICTED.  It will stop working the same and u will not get the benifits u once received.  Coming down is not fun.  I started drinking everynight to even out my moods at night.  If not I would get very aggitated and angry.  I made well over a million dollars in the last year, but every emotional/personal issue took a back seat.  Do not take Adderall if you have a family.  You will regret it.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/8/2012 12:00:20 AM	I knew growing up that i had a problem with focusing &amp; motivation for anything. i caused trouble in school to make the days more exciting or i would count repeatedly in my head &amp; obsess on objects, instead of paying attention. (i also suffer from diagnosed OCD)after high school, i found myself breaking up my family &amp; the life we had going for us, just so i could live my life on the edge with alcohol, pills, &amp; sex. all because i was bored with life &amp; i needed the adrenaline rush to stimulate my mind &amp; body. i was officially diagnosed with ADD without hyperactivity at the age of 23 &amp; started off with Ritalin, which didn't even touch my ADD. i'm finally taking what i wanted all along.. Adderall. i now take 30mg twice a day &amp; it has made all the difference in the world. i can finally focus on tasks at hand, i have the motivation &amp; energy to get things done, and people &amp; things don't irritate me as badly as they did before. side effects? it does give you an addictive &quot;high&quot; that's supposedly comparible to cocaine, so i do see the potential for abuse. it causes insomnia for me if taken too late in the day or if i double my dosage, but i can take my next dose that morning &amp; run like i had a full-night's sleep. i was 143lbs when i started taking Adderall (which is the biggest i have EVER been in my life, due to eating for comfort after the death of my sister) but i am now 126lbs after 3-4 months of being on Adderall. i literally have no appetite anymore.. unhealthy &amp; i know this BUT i honestly love seeing my lbs drop. also makes my heart race at times &amp; can be somewhat alarming, especially since my heart rate is on the high side anyways. the major issue i have had (that i haven't seen from other users) is my OCD is worse than ever now. maybe i'm focusing TOO much &amp; that triggers my OCD? other than that, i think the benefits outweigh the side effects. thank you Adderall. sorry for the long story, but i hope my experience helps &amp; someone else can relate :)

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/27/2011 10:52:31 AM	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 28.  I have a history of procrastination, lack of motivation, organized chaos and extreme fatigue/tiredness accompanied by worrying and anxiety.  I was treated for anxiety to start, pristiq.  Once, under control, My doctor started with a low dose of adderrall increased by 5 mg a day until I reached the point where I felt focused, locked in on my work and time seemed to fly by.  I reached 20 mg and maintained for 30 days.  The results where amazing.  I can't believe I went my whole childhood without this diagnoses.  Anyways, upon my evaluation my doctor &quot;upgraded&quot; me to vyvanse stating that it has a cleaner smoother release and I should benefit more.  The first day I felt like I was on cocaine.  I had lock jaw, grinding my teeth and felt like i was high which kept coming and going.  I gave it 2 weeks and had to quit.  My doctor switched me back to extended release adderrall and I'm symptom free.  My ADHD is under control and I'm functioning much better at work and home.  Eating was one of my coping mechanisms before so the decreased appetite was a welcome.  To combat, I keep lots of fruit, yogurt, veggies and nuts on hand.  My general physician introduced me to a book called &quot;Driven to Distraction&quot; which helped me understand my condition, the different variations, as well as ways to combat.  For me, exercise and to do lists are my keys to success.  Recently, I tried stopping pristiq to see if my anxiety was just a result of the ADHD but found I have a combination condition.  I wouldn't have understood this without reading the book so I highly recommend in addition to adderrall xr.

Adderall works really well for me, but I quickly built a tolerance to the drug. It now takes about 350mg of Adderall for me to focus all day in classes or when I am studying. I know that this is an unhealthy amount of the medication to take. I would suggest to anyone being prescribed Adderall to not quickly increase your dosage or you will build a tolerance. Now I never sleep and lost a significant amount of weight. Please help me, what do I do?

He went from an F in conduct daily to an A everyday for the past week. He is now completing all his classwork/homework assignments. The first day he did say that his stomach hurt, and his appetite is different. He tends to eat more in the evenings. So far so good.

Focus and clarity are amazing. I was on an intense grad school load along with 50+ hour a week job and a large family. It allowed me to sleep more than 4-6 hours too. Mood swings were a problem but nothing like other drugs. If it were not for recent weight loss I would give it all 5s. Btw I go without for two days sometimes. I also forget to get a dose here and there...this encourages me when I see the addiction possibility. I exercise and eat right too.

The XR helped somewhat, but no where near the difference as the Adderall oral 30mg. Although with the shortage, I have not been able to find anywhere to get it in my area, so I am now trying Ritalin.. hope it works at least close to the Adderall, at the very least to get me thru until I can get my old script filled again.

I have a family history of ADHD. I did research on different meds.  After completing my research and and talking to other ADHD adults, I decided to try adderall.  I really like the results.  But the 15mg does not last long enough. My doctor increased the doseage and it is working better.Well there is a severe shortage of Adderall where I live.  I do not have any side effects from Adderall.  I like to control my meds.  What is an ADHD med to is similar to Adderall.  I do not want to take a time released medication.

But then comes the late night mood-swings, the emotional volatility, the destruction of relationships, the loss of your job, the depression. If you're on it, get off. Take the short acting 20mg and wean yourself off over 6 months. It's like a new world when you're not on it. It's a better world-one where you can be yourself.

ADHD Im diagnosed with by some phychiatrist. Other phychiatrist i have been evaluated by say i don't have it. They all have MD after there names so who is correct and who's incorrect??...I've been off and on adderall for 8 years. Im 28 years old. Yes it helps me concentrate. Yes, it helps motivate me. Yes, it even makes me feel better about myself...however adderall is extremly addictive, so thats the biggest issue with it. This is a med that is in high demand among society and can kill if it falls into the wrong persons hands. Drug users feel great euphoria and energy when they use it, simply put; thats why they use it. Prescription drug abuse is sky rocketing like never before. So parents keep that in mind.---SO-- The fact remains adderall helps a ton with certain people. If you plan to take it here are a few tips (not that im a dr.) 1)If you have a prior substance abuse problem, FORGET adderall 2)Take it exactly how directed by MD. 3)Keep it in a place thats secure, kids know ALL about adderall. 4)Keep an eye on your pulse, BP, and heart rate. The worst side effect i've expericed is becoming anxious on it. I am just trying to give a down to earth review, and i hope it helps some of you.

I'm a 25 y/o male that was diagnosed with ADHD 3 years ago. I took adderall (30mg, 2x day) for the first 2 years and it worked well for the most part; there were two problems though. For one, if you forget to take your second dose when you're supposed to, you're going to notice...at least I did. Secondly, god-forbid I took my morning dose on an empty stomach; I'd feel really jittery and my mind would race at 100mph. Overall though, it did it's job. I ended up switching doctors at the VA (I'm a vet) and my new doc mentioned dexedrine. I was reluctant to try them, but he put on me on 2x10mg spansules in the morning and 2x10mg tabs in the afternoon. Here I am a year later a lot happier with the results. The onset is smoother, it's easier to eat on it and there are no ups-and-downs. I recommend looking into dexedrine for anyone who runs into these problems with adderall...Also, dexedrine is a lot cheaper than adderall. Generic 10mg IR tabs cost about $.27 each, while the 10mg spansules are 2.16each.

Surprised!Finally I can focus on what I am doing and can start a new task w/o any delays. No euphoria, no spikes of anger, no other strange effects which some people are reporting.The only side effects I am experiencing are:- lost couple of pounds. Went from 280 to 230 in 4 months.- No high blood pressure. Was on max dosage of Lotrel (and had 150/100 anyway), now not taking pills anymore and have 130/80- Type 2 diabetes, was about to switch to insulin. Not taking any drugs anymore - blood sugar level stays in up to 115 for the last 3 months (instead of way over 250 with pills)Most probably all of them are related to the weight loss, but I like it this way. :)BTW. Don't know why, but Vyvance does not work for me... Just FYI.

I was diagnosed with passive ADD years ago and tried severall non-stimulant meds but they just didn't work.  I am in grad school now (full-time job, husband, 2 active kids) and I was starting to cave-in.  Since the meds I can get everything done but my anger level (tended to have anger issues anyway) has skyrocketed.  I lose it easily and let go with explitives.  I love the way the meds help me with my school, job, and housework, but my family is suffering.  The shortage has made it to where I haven't had any in about a week and I am not sure I will be getting my presc. refilled.

I can focus I am very thorough and I take on tasks that I normally wouldnt,But then there r times when I feel like everything is a distraction or aggrivation,unless its what i want to do.  then u hav the the issue of controlling the drug and tolerance to the drug.  if u hav any down time without the drug u will experience manic lows of no energy and depression. My whole body feels like lead and my ambition or interst in amything is pretty much slim to none. I dont know if I really need adderall or if I have just convinced my body that i need adderall. Either way, good or bad, I always want the adderall.  I think I have literally lost the ability to focus without adderall. its like that movie limitless. if u havent seen it i suggest giving it a whirl

It works well and I love it. Unfortunately, I love it so much I take well over the recommended daily dose. I have built my tolerance up to 350mg per day, and it makes me feel awesome. About a half hour after I pop them, my heart will start pounding and hurt incredibly. Often, when remaining still, my legs or arms will go numb. I feel dizzy and weak all the time. I will also get severe chest pain and back aches. I do not sleep, and if I do, I sleep at the most one hour during the day. Concerning eating habits, I don't eat much and have lost a lot of weight. My withdrawals are hell, and unexplainably miserable. I feel sad, tired, hungry, bored, and hopeless. I will admit that these pills possess most of my thoughts. If I don't have multiple pills on me at all times, I feel very uncomfortable. Therefore, I at least need to have pills on me for the next time I need to take some.

Unfortunately, the manufacture of the reg adderall stopped sending out 2 pharmacies because of misuse n abuse by college attending persons.  Yet if u read ALL info, it says ppl truly needing medication DO NOT abuse it. News stations report that their brilliant idea DID NOT deter student abuse.  So for us that truly need this suffer the most.  Maybe schools should b addressing problem.  Torturing ADHD suffers DOES NOT deter. Drug abusers, it only makes them use the XR or Ritalin DUH. DOCTORS r suppose to b brighter than that, guess not. Just wanna thank u for what u have done to the ppl truly needing medication, GENIUSES in ur own minds

Teachers and parents said I was smart but wasn't &quot;applying&quot; myself which was totally confusing to me. After a series of attempts at self medication, I started seeing a therapist who prescribed Adderall. It has changed my life in every way. I feel like the normal person I always imagined everyone else to be. If you need it, you'll know because it won't cause the ill side effects that some describe. I eat normally. I sleep like a baby. The only drawback for people like me is that it's becoming harder and harder to find.

It also helped my depression,helps me sleep better at night (due to me wearing my self out &amp; not napping during the day) the only negative I can think of is,I seem to have developed a tolerance and for some reason my Dr. won't increase my dosage,even though I've been on the same dose for all this time.He has even mentioned taking me off of it for some reason,to which I replied I'd rather stop the pain meds!! Adderall is the BEST thing that ever happened to me in a Dr.s office!

Even then my racing thoughts would take me off somewhere else thinking about what i was trying to think about in the first place. When i started Adderall everything changed. My grades went up my social skills were at 100% and life had some meaning instead of thinking that my life needs to be over. So taking this drug off the market for what reasons i could only think of rather than people selling it, or abusing it should not have to change the other 85% of the world that needs it to go along with there normal living.

I did not take it for ADD or adhd, I was prescribed to it because it helped speed up my seritonin levels and would make me social. For that, Adderall did its job with flying colors. It's speed after all. I loved how it would make me clean and get stuff DONE! people called me &quot;super Mark&quot; (my name)   The only problem was I would &quot;crash&quot; terribly from it, get depressed,  and it would greatly supress my appetite and im already too skinny for my age. If it wer not for those issues. I would still be on this awesome pill.

I actually fix dinner when I get home for my husband and can focus so much better at work.  My sales increased to a 360 turn around.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	13-18	10/3/2011 9:32:46 PM	Present: 15 year old, Male, active in sports, using 15mg extended release. Started taking the drug when I was 6 at 5mg reg.The drug helps me focus during the day about 15 minutes after I take it. It is the reason I am socially accepted by my peers and others; the reason that I can preform well on my school work. The only bad things I can get from using this drug is slight depression, MAJOR hunger issues-getting better, and when taking to much (like during a greatly needed meds change) I can get very emotional.

I was never diagnosed as a child because I wasn't seen as hyperactive. I constantly heard my teachers tell my parents &quot;he's the best in the class however he doesn't do the work.&quot; Adderall has change my life for the better I can finally apply knowledge and get through the boring things life. I have been set back my whole life and in the past few weeks have made great leaps in my personal life, work environment, and in college. Bad desicion making is at zero while medication is in effect. I've also done a lot of research and on th topic of ADHD and Adderall. I am troubled by the media misconseption of data and effectivness of sitimulant medication. I am also troubled by the abuse of the nonsufferers. Thank you Adderall for the resent and drastic change and success in my life.

Adderall is effective and has caused few side effects for me until recently. I have been dx'ed with High IOP and I see now that is a side effect of amphetamines. Just started on treatment with my Opthmologist. May need to disc. the addreall and see how I do.

His worst reaction to this medication is that he does not want to eat. That has been one thing that all the medications he has been on has had for him. He is better able to focus and is easier to talk to, he listens to what is being said to him and actually remembers more than one thing at a time.

I was more aware of the changes &amp; feeling better ( more focused &amp; even) when I first began.  I am living proof that not everybody shows the typical side effects associated with Adderall.  I can say that I never lost my appetite or had any additional weight loss (hoped I would) when I started to take it.  My metabolism remained slow.  Today I am not as aware of all the positive changes.  That being said, on occasion I ran out for a day or two and noticed how lousy I felt.  I would feel very tired and depressed.

He was very implulsive with his behavior always &quot;acting before he thinks&quot;, grades at school were very inconsistant. He was failing to &quot;grow out&quot; of certain behaviors. Since starting Adderall ER 20 mg a month ago the change in him is amazing. He is now able to read on grade level, make good choices and is more socially confident. This drug was our missing link for him, we were doing everything possible for him and it all came together once we added the medicine. He is no longer receiving supportive reading services at school. He completes his homework in a timely manner with little assitance, last year it took an hour plus to do 20 mins of HW. It truely has changed our son's life and improved our family. Get your child tested for learning disabilities and ADHD/ADD if you have any concerns. My son didn't fit the mold of what ADHD/ADD looks like but upon testing he presented with Behavorial and Cognitive impulsivity, with a reading disability. Just starting 3rd it was critical to figure out the best way to help him reach his full potential and be happy.We do now give him 7mg of melatonin to help him fall asleep 15 mins prior to bed. He was 20 lbs over weight from implusive eating and so far has lost 6 lbs. So that was an unexpected plus for him. Overall we are very happy with Adderall and the improvment in our son.He takes it at 8 AM and it lasts until between 6-7PM, it wear off gradually.

Then i sometimes had those days where i felt kind of depressed, usually when there was nothing for me to do because on adderall  i wanted to always stay busy. other then that i lied the way it made me feel. wheni wasn't taking adderall, all i wanted to do was lay around watch tv and eat. and its the complete opposite when i'm on it. Another effect i get when i'm taking adderall is i feel the need to become a perfectionist. everything had to be just right. i mean in school when i was taking notes and they were written sloppy i would later after i'd taken all the notes i would redo them so they were neat. overall though i do like adderall

The orig formula was changed. These new pills have zero effect.2. The price: over $400/month (120x20mg). Funny facts: Barr, who makes these, also makes generics and sells the same amount for $150... and the generics work (for a while).3. Strange/disturbing fact: an insurance like Aetna does not cover Adderall (brand or gen.) if you're over 18...To parents: do not give this stuff to your kids! Adderall is a mix of amphetamine and dextro-amphetamine, aka street name &quot;Speed&quot;! It's extremely addictive and loses its effectiveness over time. It's a quick fix that will eventually ruin their lives, turning them into drug addicts.  There are many reasons why some kids don't pay attention in class, none of which can be fixed with drugs: 1- they're kids, not robots! 2- Classes are too large and out of control 3- Their teacher is boring 4-The level is either too low (not challenging enough) or too high. 5-they spend too much time on the internet, their cell phones, their ps3, and TV, all of which have been shown to reduce attention span. etc...

It makes me less &quot;spacey&quot; and able to do simple tasks (like brushing my teeth, for example) that I would regularly forget to do. The only issue I have is that it gives me strong desires to smoke cigarettes. I don't know why this is, but it has been an impediment in my path to becoming smoke free.

I had a history of suicide attempts, depression, anxiety, violence, etc., which was attributed to a specific event  - being raped by our parish priest as a teenager at 13. The drug Adderall, made it possible for me to be focused, on task, centered and a lot more accessible to psychological treatment which lasted almost 9 years. I am a much better person for doing the treatment, I continue to take Adderall. It is the only &quot;psychological&quot; drug that I now take and was misdiagnosed for over 30 years. Work with your doctor to tweak this drug, to the just right amount - you'll be glad you did. I am just one of the many that lived through a horrid, tumultuous life in regards to the rape, upbringing, violence, etc., and just trying to find the real me. A compassionate, loving, understanding and forgiving me buried deep under the ugly layers  of hell. I wrote a letter to my doctor and expressed the aforementioned and that he could read it to any patient that he desired - if he felt it would &quot;connect&quot; with that patient. My final words would be do not be afraid to ask questions, investigate, get second opinions and never have blind allegiance to one doctor. We all make mistakes and are not perfect for we are truly, only human - it is our nature. Anyone desiring to discuss what any medications have done for me were always welcome but you cannot base your results on someone else. You can only use it as a loose guideline for your own personal situation and physical makeup. That is where your trusted physician comes in and although they may be right on the money regarding one drug that works for you beware - they do not always remember all the drugs you are taking so that is where the patient must be vigilant, especially when being referred from specialist to another doctor or specialist. I bring an up-to-date prescription printout to any new doctors as a new patient. Thank You -

I decided to start seeing a therapist when my anger and irritability issues were having an impact on everyone around me including my children and my girlfriend and her daughter. I have always had these issues but I can also be a very fun person too. After a few visits with the therapist and asking her for help with the anger among other issues including concentration. She gave me a test for ADD and failed miserably. Went to the Dr. and he prescribed 20mg Prozac a day and 10mg of Adderall twice daily. WOW! Slap in the face and one happy son of a gun. For a week it was weird because of adjusting to the meds. Not much sleep and felt foggy and strange but that went away. After a couple of weeks I upped the Prozac to 40mg a day. Worked a lot better for me (28 year old male 215lbs).  I tried not taking the Adderall on the weekends but I just got distant and irritable. I thought it was the Prozac so I tried stopping it and just taking Adderall. Nope, that didn't work. I got easily car sick and real irritable. So just went back on both at the same time until I could talk to my Dr. about switching or something. I decided to try upping the Adderall by splitting on in half and taking 15mg in the morning and 5mg later in the day. I felt a lot better on a higher dose. I decided to save up a few extras and try to take 20mg in the morning and 20mg later in the day. WOW! That is a lot different feeling. I can really concentrate now and I actually get up and do things and finish them instead of just wanting to but can't seem to just do it. My girlfriend (now my wife) is loving it. I taught her daughter how to ride a bike, cleaned up the garage and organized it (which has been a dump for a long time) and I cleaned up my office (boss has been on my butt for a while). Best part is, I love that I am a person now. Cure for depression and anxiety: antidepressant + Adderall. Antidepressant to numb the pain and Adderall to get your butt up and enjoy life!

No side effects of insommnia/or iritability. Now, 60 mg decreased motivation, energy and sleepiness, however I am on other prescription meds, so I am working with Doc to change others and eliminated Welbutrin and the sleepiness went away. My motivation is still out the window, but when engaged in a task, stay focused. Pretty irritable, at times, but could just be me.

My marriage suffered greatly, but I had a great husband for 32 years until he died.Since his death in 2005 my life was just existing for no reason. Then I found another psychist who gave me ADDERALL 20MG times a day along other meds, DR changed and added higher doses of meds. such as 300mg seraqual 300mg trazadone, klonopin 1mg 3 times a day and cymbalta 120mg, with the adderall, this has been the best combination of meds for me. I know feel like a different or normal lady. Thanks for the adderall. I reccommend adding adderall to most chronis depressed people. Don't knock it until you try it. I wish I had adderall years ago, me and my husband would have had a more outgoing life. I am 54 and stated to really live.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	kellysue, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	8/27/2011 11:54:36 AM	I didn't realize I had ADHD for most of my life until my Shrink pointed it out to me. She had me start on Adderall,and life became much easier. I could stay on one chore and not get nearly as distracted. It has a real calming affect. I can organize my life for the first time ever. My kids see a huge difference in their mom. Seeing that I battle with bi-polar1, PTSD, major depressive disorder,and generalized anxiety disorder, Adderall I can honestly say does the most good for me! If I could say one thing that is the very most important- Never take this med more than what your Dr. prescribes! I have been taking Adderall going on 4 years and I am taking the same dose as I did when I started taking it. I wonder how many of you out there can take an adderall right before bedtime and fall asleep in a half hour or so? I try not to, but I can. Take care-

The med is very effective as far as &quot;follow through&quot; goes in life. The only drawback is the drowsiness it induces during the day and night. I take it in conjunction with several other prescriptions (Abilify, Pristiq, Xanxax and Klonopin to name a few. No noticable reactions to other meds. Would like the adderal ER but a 30 days supply on my rather heavy dose was recently quoted to be $780 something for 1 pill daily. Fortunately, the regular is not too pricey, as low as 30$ at NY Duane Reade. Very, very helpful.

I stopped taking it towards middle school and gained alot of weight and asked to b put back on it in 8th grade then I lost all that weight and was very happy. After getting pregnant at 18 I stopped taking it immediately and did not start taking it again until 4yrs later after giving birth to 3 children. Again it helps with not only energy, focusing, but also weight loss. Amazing!

Some side effects though more so from coming off of it when I take drug holidays they are usually spent sleeping on the couch. When I take it though I do very well and usually by the end of the day sleeping is not a problem. However it used to be a problem when I took the XR version. Now I take the plain old fashion immediate release tablets 30mg at a time. Once in the morning and then in the afternoon or I break my afternoon in half to make an additional 15mg available to take closer to 4:00pm but no later that a way I can stretch it out if its a longer day. At this dosage/prescription I don't suffer from insomnia as the drug tends to wear off my quickly at the end of the day and then I can sleep. Some side effects like feeling speedy and shaky can happen but are usually mild if not somewhat pleasant anyhow. I've been taking this dosage for years and I still say there is an advantage to having ADD. One is being able to take Adderall as I can usually run circles around my co-workers. When I'm on my medicine its like my personality lights up a little more and I stay focused and on task with little negative side effects. After so many years my body is addicted to it though hence the major withdrawal I go through on the couch on drug holidays. But if you don't mind being lazy and sleepy during those time I think it is well worth it all. Adderall is 4 amphetamine salts in one tablet so its like the inventors of this drug just said to themselves &quot;well one of these stimulants has to hit the right spot&quot; and then they marketed it with the clever name ADD ERALL. So for what ever reason it does work well for ADD. The only other drug I haven't tried for ADD is Desoxyn (methamphetamine) I guess I have been afraid to even ask for it just by the stigma that goes along with the name. So my experience with these drugs is well worth mentioning if you want an honest and thorough review.

Too bad I found this when I was as old as I am. 66 going on 67 in 2 mos. I am using my time to heal my mind and thinking process. I am able to choose my thoughts now. I have many sources of healing the mind etc, so since this works for me, I think one needs therapy as well.

Already it's working wondering on being able to focus. Side note: It's also helped my my anxiety! I do not know how long term effect will effect me, but for the time being it's a miracle drug. Just make sure your doctor monitors you very closely since it's a highly addictive drug. Its a class 2 controlled substance which means if taken improperly it can cause hearth attack, high blood, pressure, loss of bowl movement, and the completely lack of caring about the loved one around you. You become in your own 'Aderall&quot; world. I don't recommend this drug for under the age of 18 due to the abuse we see in schools, but for adults I personally thnk it's something to talk to your physician about.

I began with 20 mgs and that worked for about three months. During this time I did not suffer from any side effects.But,I began to feel &quot;out of it&quot; again and found myself struggling to focus and being overwhelmed with all my tasks. I also (again) had problems with impulsiveness and not being able to &quot;think clearly&quot;. I asked my doctor for an increase and he then prescribed 30 mgs a day. It did help. I also discovered that the generic did not work for me. I am experiencing dry mouth as a side effect. With the medication I've estimated that it has decreased my impulsivity by 85%. I believe it has taken a years time and a bit more for me to see the maximum effect of the medication. It's as though my brain needed that much time to get &quot;soaked&quot; by the Adderall XR. I am now in the place where I am now starting to deal with developing good habits to overcome my great disorganization. I am trying to strengthen my ability to think linearly.  When I first started the medication (at 20 mgs and again at 30 mgs) I found disorganization unsettling and I became neater for a time.  I then again became sloppy and I was bothered by the fact that the sloppiness didn't seem to bother me. Over all I'm happy with the medication.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	3	Male	25-34	7/1/2011 3:14:00 PM	Overall, Adderall (30mg/daily) has worked well for me. My academics have greatly improved and my ability to start, continue, and complete a task are a complete change. However, like many others have said, you quickly grow a tolerance to it. I have noticed an improvement with this by taking 1-2 days off a week. Those days are of course a little rough but the only thing that has helped me from the tolerance issues. I also have sleep apnea and if I'm having a rough day it sometimes makes me feel even more fatigued. The &quot;crashing&quot; after the medication begins to fade is sometimes worse then simply not taking it at all. So far the only medication I've tried for ADHD but overall a good medication thus far, not sure If I'd say the same if used for sleep related disorders.

Anyways I was perscribed to Strattera as I entered middle school beginning with 20 mg. After seven years this medication was working miracles with a few ups and downs here and there... well that's the good part. The bad news is the positive effects literally &quot;shut off&quot; in a matter of two weeks this past winter. I was back to that child who could barely read a couple of pages in a book, let alone prepare for exams and papers as a college freshman. It was terrible: I lost great relationships with friends and family, suffered from depression and constant unpredictable mood swings, and the list goes on and on. Even with an increase in 80 mg the pills were useless unless two or more were consumed a day. I talked to my doctor about the problem and he said drastic neurochemical changes may have built a tolerance against the strattera, which is farely common with that particular drug. To compensate, he perscribed 20 mg of Adderall to take with 100 mg of Strattera a day, and let me tell you, the waters have settled and the sun shines again! Complete clarity and focus, anxiety almost nonexistent, and I feel back to my normal self. Only thing is that my appetite has diminished quite a bit and I have the libido of a neutered camel, but those don't outweigh the fact that life is GREAT again. I could see where an addiction could transpire because it's pretty much altered cocaine that's approved by the fda, but really it all comes down to you: &quot;can I survive w/o downing 16 pills today?&quot;

I was the absolute worst person to deal with in the morning and it took so much effort to get my day started.  Struggled for years with sleep issues during the day and honestly thought I had other medical problems.  I take the IR version because my insurance won't cover the xr, 45mg when I wake up and another 45mg around 1pm.  Come down is a bitch, but by the time it happens, everything I needed to accomplish is done.  Just drink lots of water and avoid vitamin c or caffeine 2 hours before of after your dose.

Improved sleep nights and return of normal appetite.Concerned in 2011 May of &quot;industry wide shortage&quot; of this old and proven drug! Is f d a warning mfg causing shortage? Where is it all going?  At age 57 need to stay awake and continue right choices, and help my adult children and grandchild by staying awake.

I noticed a difference immediately.  I no longer had panic attacks, I was able to focus more easily.  Less fender benders due to not paying attention.  I will say that after years of being on this medication I have developed a bit of a tolerance for the dosage I am currently on.  This is a medication that you can and will build up a tolerance to, and it needs to be adjusted according to individual patient history and patient need.  The dosage should be adjusted according to patient need.  Afterall, each individual patient is unique and different.  I am a bright, intelligent 38 year old woman who has ADD, NOT ADHD.  There is a difference.  This is the only medication I have found that works for me.  I can concentrate.  I am not having panic attacks anymore.  I do experience upset stomach at times.  I think the benefits outway the side effects.  If you try this medication and it does not work for you, you most likely are not truly ADD or ADHD.

The only side effect that we have noticed in him is having a smaller appetite. Adderall has calmed him down enough in order to focus and cooperate while in school. Without Adderall my son is VERY hyper and impulsive and cannot focus on one thing for very long. He also talks A LOT when he is not taking it, it seems like his mind is racing a mile a minute. Deciding to put our son on Adderall has been so beneficial for our son and his success in school. He is a much happier kid!

I feel lucid and I am not nearly as forgetful. I took 20mg just about every day for two years and just recently it caused me to slip into depression. The &quot;come down&quot; at the end of the day is killer and I was extremely agitated and aggressive. I stopped taking it for 2 weeks and I finally feel like myself again, but not being able to focus or remember things is very hard. The side effects are not the same for everyone but I am one of the few cases where they occur and are detrimental.

This is a miracle drug for me!  I am a completely different person since taking this medication , this medicine has really saved my life.  I feel so much better, i can actually concentrate on one thing at a time, i don't have the racing thoughts I used to have throughout the day, it is like someone finally flipped a switch inside and finally turned he madness off in my brain.  I can finally finish what I start the same day that I start it , and not 3 weeks later when someone use to have to force me to finish the task.  I just can't say enough about how Adderall has changed my life and made it so much better.  I definitely reccommmend it as a starting point to any adult who is diagnosed with ADHA or ADD

I found that by adding adderall for that extra spark I needed sometimes has given me control over my depressive symptoms.  I am careful not to misuse this drug, and that serves me well as I avoid tolerance.  I use 5mg about 0-three times a week.  I am very happy with the control I have now over my depression which causes me to lie down on my bed listlessly all day and not go anywhere, see my friends or want social contract, engage in recreations that I enjoy such as horsebackriding.  It is my ticket to life at this point in my life.

I never had the hyper activity but could not stay focused on any task for long. I have always struggled with staying on task, reading and re-reading text and not comprehending what I read, putting off simple task such as paying bills or cleaning the house. I wanted to fo these things, but somehow I could not make myself do it. I have learned excellent coping tools through the years and did not take medication for my ADD. After four failed marriages and filing bankrupcy twice I finally asked my doctor for medication. I tried the Adderrall ER and it did not work for me. I am now taking 20 mg of Adderall in the morning and 20 mg at noon. It has changed my world. I am now able to complete simple tasks daily and an interesting side effect that no one warned me about is that fact that it has increased my sexual drive and intensity of orgasms. I am not complaining :)

My son was struggling in school and displayed many of my life long traits. He was diagnosed ADHD/ADD Opositional Difiance. They gave him Adderall. I hear bad things about ADD/ADHD meds so I previewed his meds having abused many drugs in past. At 10MG I felt like I was coming down off of crack but when the crack dealer called to deliver that I said no with $1500 in my pocket. The nerve pain I lived with daily level 7 on 1-10 was gone. Local pain down from 7 to 4. Manageble with Ibuprophen. I no longer wanted to kill people and even smiled and laughed when I should again after 30 years of not doing this. I felt normal but over medicated. I reduced my dose to 5MG from 10MG because of this so I don't feel this is at all addictive for me since I don't want more than enough to treat my symptoms where life is normal again. I now can listen to people where before they'd talk and I'd go yep, yep, yep and never understand a word winging it hoping I did not miss something important. Best of all I now realize I may have neurological damage and will be seeking a better eval after I finish Interferon treatments. This med saved someones life be it mine or yours. I wanted to kill you without it. I also have no struggle with Crack Addiction and could actually sell it without using it if I wanted too. LOL. I can't believe how well that fixed something I struggle w for 25+ years that cost me enough money to buy Miami. WOW! Thank you Kids School for interfering w my life. I may actually have one again. PS IQ140-150 as tested when I was in school No longer narcisistic as before... Want to treat cause now...

I also struggled with some OCD issues.  The Dr. decided after testing that I was on the obsesive side of ADHD and prescribed low dose XR with low dose IR.  It has done wonders for my work and daily life.  I have less stress. I don't get upset when I have to divide attention between multiple things, I actually get all done with excellent results. Then on the other side of my OCD like issues; if I am working on one thing alone I don't over analyze it too much, I just get it done.

I always knew there was something that wasn't &quot;quite right&quot; with my ability to concentrate, but I just thought I was just very impatient. I never knew it was an actual medical problem. Adderall has literally saved my quality of life. It has made a huge difference that I can't imagine ever going &quot;untreated&quot; again. I only wish I'd found out how much it would help 20 years ago!

I've been through a number of antidepressants and while they seem to help for a while, as I've gotten older the duration of effectiveness seems to grow less and less. I was started on 20mg of Adderall along with my Zoloft and I don't know when I have ever felt better or more clear minded. For the last several years I feel as though I was walking around in a fog. Now I can focus on what I need to get done and I don't keep asking my kids the same questions that I asked them 5 minutes ago.

I'm 20, and I was just diagnosed with ADHD (without the hyper-active) part a few months ago. I stared out on Adderall IR 10mg once daily, upped that to twice daily, and now I'm taking 20mg once daily. It has helped me beyond belief! I don't know how I lived without it! School is going great, my job is going great, I'm able to stay focused and do the things that need to be done! I'm hoping to start taking 20mg twice daily, but I think since I've just started on it, my psychiatrist just wants to make sure my body is handling it okay. I do get a headache occasionally, as well as loss of apetite and sometimes I'm not able to fall asleep quickly, but that just depends on what time I take it. I'm taking 18 hours in school, night classes, 5 nights a week, and I work during the day about 4 days a week, so I have long days. What time I take it really depends on what's on my schedule for the day. I'm new to all of this, but Adderall has been a lifesaver for me.

People said they noticed an immediate difference- my grades improved, I started paying attention, I was more obedient. Then, by the time I turned 13, I began to have chronic stomach pains, which continue to plague me to this day. At the time, I was battling ADD, depression, anxiety... you name it. The stomach issues were just another thing to add to the list. By age 15, I had an endoscopy, and it discovered I had a condition known as Eosinaphililic Esophagitis (I think that's how it's spelled) as well as an ulcer. I continued taking medicine to treat everything, until I had the idea to just stop taking my medicine altogether. That was at age 16. For more than a year and a half, I experienced NO pain whatsoever from my stomach, my depression faded, and I was still able to focus as well as I was able to on the drug. I haven't taken it since, as I haven't felt a need to, though I still take the stomach medicine as needed. Bottom line- Adderall interfered with many of the other drugs I was taking to treat other things, and kept me in a state of perpetual pain. But I was always alert and focused, so technically, the pill did its job. I don't see how everyone says this pill is addictive, I find it far from that. During the time I was taking the medicine, I continued to gain weight until I was nearly 300 pounds. Now, it's been almost 2 years since I've taken them, and the weight melted off naturally, I'm down to 175- lighter than I've been in years. I feel better, and I still can focus as well as I could on the drug, despite not taking it. All in all, I wouldn't really recommend taking this drug if you take other medicines in conjunction, but it surely gets the job done if you don't mind the agony...
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	4/22/2011 11:44:05 PM	Whether or not you have &quot;ADD&quot; adderall will help you concentrate, get things done, be more efficient etc.. Im a Senior in college.. 95% of people use it to study. If your kid says this isn't true.. they are lying.. or a freshman.. or from Idaho. I was tested and given 20mg pills... at first it was amazing. Not only could I sit down studying for my exams for 10 hours straight (literally) but it felt fun to study. Class was all of a sudden so interesting. Loooong story short, after a few months of using it off an on (about 3 pills a week) the effects changed. Yes, I could concentrate better when I was alone studying/doing school work. However, when taking adderall I felt like some kind of zombie. Like.. I couldn't smile couldn't laugh, didn't want to talk to anyone..(Im usually very extroverted). The day after taking adderall I sleep until about 2 or 3 pm. Ew! Typically I wake up at 7am and cannot sleep past 9 am! Once you start using the drug it is hard to get off it. Example: I am not physically dependent but when HUGE exams come along I mentally feel like I NEEED adderall. And yes, I use it. (Stopping after graduation in a week). The mind is a powerful thing. Once you get off the drug, once simple tasks may seem laborious. Final point:: I wish I never tried it. Also... I agree with a comment right below.. it is so sad that children are given this drug. Crazy. Try changing their diet.. brain teasers.. holistic options! Im a psychology major and we were just learning how on a basic-level naturalists perspective.. kids are not supposed to have great concentration because its a time to explore as much as they can as their highly plastic brains develop. Soak it all in! Helloooo people, what elementary kid do you see sitting still &amp; silent focusing on their workbook 24/7? Little adderrall robot antisocial children? Oh yea.. in all of my neuroscience courses we learned the chemical properties of the drug. Very similar to speed.. and cocaine. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Lina, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	4/21/2011 10:54:53 AM	Just started taking this about 1 month ago. It really works for me. Before, I had trouble concentrating and finishing tasks. Even minor things on my 'to-do' list (like mailing letters, making phone calls,etc.) would feel like a huge weight on my shoulders. Adderall helped with all of those issues. I take between 5mg - 10mg per day. Anymore than that would make me tense (I'm surprized that most reviewers here seem to take much more. Sometimes reviewers even call 20-30mg a 'small dose'--not for me!). I split it up--half around 9am, the other around 1pm. It's true it'll keep you awake at night if you take it too late. Other pros: I used to get very fatigued (perhaps even chronic), sleeping 9-10 hours at night, then feeling exhausted around 2pm. Adderall keeps me energized and wakeful (including w/sex life!). Other pro: besides ADD, I may have mild depression. Adderall has improved my mood. Cons: At the end of the day when the meds ware off I feel a bit socially disconnected, somewhat agitated, w/mild headaches. These are minor given the benefits.

My symptoms have changed over the years; more anxiety, less depression when I was younger now its more depression with less anxiety.  My thinking became disorganized.  I was forgetful and easily distracted.  When my doc suggested this med I was very concerned it would increase my anxiety level but agreed to a trial.  That was over 5 years ago.  My energy level is increased, I'm much less forgetful, my mood is improved and there was no increase in anxiety.  When I've stopped the med my mood plunges, my energy level drops, I become irritable and I'm miserable to live with.  I take 40 mg every morning and sleep well.  I did have a trial of the XL version but found it ineffective.

I started with 39mg 2x a day. It was a ;miracle; drug. I had motivation, great concentration and I was like superman. I could work out for hours non stop for hours and stayed up for up to 5 days in a row just cleaning and remodeling the house. With tine the medication looses its potency because u develop a tolerance. First was 60mg a day than 90mg, than 129mg and now im on 159mg-30mg 5x daily). I used to be able to take hakf of a 30mg tab when I started and be superman. Than taking it oraly did not work for me unless I tripled my dose. So I started crushing and snorting the drug. Right now my tolerance is so high I can snort 150mg very easy. Whats next 180mg? Probably My One time I lost my pills and I was literally narcoleptic, sleeping about 16hrs a day going through crazy withdtawals and not knowing what to do with myself. I felt I was literally going to loose my mind. I was so sick(head sick) that I could barely make my doctors appointment to get a new script. If I didnt have my xanex for the withdrawal I probably would have killed myself.This drug is very effective but also super sddictive. The sad thing is they give this drug to little 3 year old kids whos parents cant be real parents and want a magic solution that comes in pill form. Think about it amphetamine=adderall. Adderall is lagalized speed. How do you give a 3 or 4 year old amphetamines. Their four and supposed to be roudy and have alot of energy and stamina.Their $!!!!!Overall I think its an excelent drug if it is prescribed properly by a doctor. It helps my depression and fatigue problems as well.Motivation, concentration, determination=dependance.

Although it has helped me focus on tasks and allowed me to complete projects without a problem it has also made me almost obsessed with whatever the task is that I am doing. For example, I wanted to clean my pantry counter, a quick spray with some cleaner and wipe it down, no big deal right. About three hours later I realized I had cleaned the counter, the stove inside and out, the dishwasher, sink, floor, and organized the cabinets. It felt as if I had to keep cleaning until everything was perfect and it just feels strange. Some may say that is a good thing but If I had video taped it I probably would of looked like a crazy person while doing it. Also, I lost a good amount of weight since taking Adderal and now I feel I am to thin. I am 5'7&quot; and my weight was 155lbs before the Adderal, I looked healthy. My weight went down to 132lbs and I looked sick but did manage over the last few months to get up to 145lbs. I take 50mg a day, 30mg in the am and 20mg around noon. I have tried lowering the dose but it did absolutly nothing for me and without the second dose I end up crashing and want to nap by 2pm so the seond dose is basically to keep me going till bedtime. I do have trouble sleeping and even more trouble waking up but once I take my morning pill a half hour later I am good to go. Well that is my experience with Adderal so far, oh yeah, one more thing to add. I don't know if this happens to anyone else but I notice my hands and feet feel real cold at times and even though I will be sweating I am always cold. Well take care everyone, hope everyone has a great day. :)

Since I was also complaning about having difficulty concentrating at work, he added 10xr adderall. (i usually only take 1/2 - 2/3 of the dose tho.) It has definitely helped with my mood and with concentration. It has also made me just slightly more aggressive which so far seems to be a good thing, since I tend to hide when it would be good for me to assert myself. It gives me gas tho, and although sometimes no appetite, I haven't lost any weight! Am a little anxious and worry about it being addictive.

Have been doing so for about 6-7 yrs. Only other ADD med I've tried was Ritalin for a short time, which didn't seem as helpful.  Pros: Improved focus, concentration, motivation for boring/difficult tasks.  Cons: Insomnia, which is why I could not tolerate the extended release, and must make sure not to take the 2nd dose later than about 1pm. A small dose of Trazadone (25-50mg) has helped with the insomnia. Does take away appetite temporarily, but I make sure to force myself to eat adequately, b/c if not I am left feeling ravenous at the end of the day when it is wearing off, and have a headache and feel more moody than usual.  Need to take a 'drug holiday' at least 1 day each week, or else the med starts to feel less effective.  I do tend to 'hyperfocus' on things that I shouldn't necessarily be focusing on at that given time, but I'm not sure if this is just a symptom of ADD itself or a symptom exacerbated by the medication. Do see this as being addictive in terms of feeling the need to stay on it (though why would I NOT feel like I should stay on it, as it is helpful for my ADD).  However have not ever felt the need for a higher dose.  May increase levels of anxiety, if this is an underlying problem you already have. Has been helpful for ADD symptoms, but I've also realized it is not a magic cure, and cannot stress enough the importance of being proactive in terms of learning your individual weaknesses and trying different ways to help overcome them.  WebMD has been helpful, along with www.ADDitude.com and www.ThriveWithADD.com.  Would love to meet with a psychotherapist that specializes in ADD, but haven't been able to find such a thing.  A life coach specializing in ADD would also be great, but unfortunately is not covered by insurance and seems to be quite costly.  Overall has been helpful for me, but do believe that everyone is affected differently.  Good luck!

Eat less. Creativity. Talk talk talk. Cons: Hard to go to sleep. Sweating. The crash. Withdraw(Crazy tired/lazy). Speedy heart rate. Caffeine sensitive. Only take 10mg a day. Really its plenty. If your a doctor and your prescribing 40mg daily your out of your mind and should be removed from the practice. Until a DR. has tried it themselves stop guessing!!!!!

And the only side effect I have is decreased appetite. If you're worried about becoming addicted, just take a break from it every once in a while. That's what I've done, and I've never had trouble stopping.

I am also on a BP med and Effexor XR.  All taken together have proven just how productive I am at completing tasks at work.  Although I have found that there is an interaction when I take the Adderall and Effexor together, so now I allow at least 2 hrs. after taking Adderall before taking Effexor. The great thing is I have always been able to sleep really well.  After trial and error with other ADD meds found this to be most effective.  However at 3:30-4:00 pm in the afternoon it wears off.  I don't reallty know what to do with myself, feel like I need a small dose to keep up with things I have to attend after work, errands, and in social settings. I am lucky to have a doctor who shares a real concern about the side effects in it increasing my heart rate.  She has already referred me to a cardiologist only to find that Adderall in combination with the other 2 meds raises my heart rate some.  Enough for her to put me on BP med taken everyday.  Sure there are some mild side effects of being tired but but there could be dangers in increasing the size of my heart down the road.  So the risks outweigh the mild side effects.  Just now need to bring to Dr's attention that I might need something for focus early evening.  Anybody out there who needs to take a small dosage of Adderall? Any suggestions?

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/23/2011 6:49:37 PM	Adderall has been a lifesaver.  Once again, I was faced with the possibility of losing my job for trivial errors: forgetting to stamp this, forgetting to notate that, etc. until I finally spoke with my doctor who actually took the time with me to go over my symptoms (forgetfulness, constant interrupting, fidgeting, inability to concentrate) and came to the conclusion that I was, and had been for years, dealing with ADHD.  Within a few weeks time of taking it, I've noticed an improvement not only in my ability to concentrate and get all of my tasks finished at work, but I'm able to get more done around the house, I don't constantly feel as though I need to get up from my desk every 10 minutes and walk around, and mornings have become SO much easier.  I cannot thank my doctor enough for actually taking the time to ask me questions and figure out a prescription that works best for both myself and my lifestyle.

My feet used to literally turn blue. My legs in general were always bluish. I went to dozens of doctors over the past decade for a diagnosis. I even proactively asked the doctors if adderral could be causing the awful calf pain (which was the result of such poor circulation). The doctors all told me &quot;no&quot;. FINALLY, I found an incredible doctor who researched my pain extensively and told me that adderral may indeed be the cause of the freezing cold hands and feet, as well as awful pain in my legs. Adderral is AWFUL to get off of. VERY DIFFICULT. I'm now off adderral and my pain is 90% better and I no longer have blue hands and feet. This drug can work wonders...but it has the potential to cause many health problems.

Finally couldn't cope with juggling everything...i was actually excited to have an answer to my disorganization and rambling sentences..Adderall has made SUCH a difference (although CHANTIX interacted - blocked it and my Lexapro!) I started Adderall and i could tell a difference in a day in my brain processes - my supervisor noticed it within 5 days - my frens and my employees will tell me occasionally &quot;did you take your adderall&quot; and i'll check and sure enough i didn't!its not a magic bullet - i still fight to focus on some days - particularly if i didn't get enough sleep.  That being said - had i been diagnosed 10 years ago, there were a LOT of stupid decisions that might not have been made...

My constant impulsive behavior and concentration issues had been plaguing me for as long as I could remember. I was misdiagnosed when I was younger but went back as an adult and was prescribed Adderall XR. It's like I can do things other people have always had an easy time doing, and overall it has allowed me to make more rational decisions.

I've never been able to focus on anything for more than 30 minutes at most, especially with work and school. It took a while to figure out what worked for me, but due to insomnia I use the instant release tablets since they wear off by the end of the day. I take 15 to 30 mg per day and it works wonderfully. I feel like I can actually function like &quot;normal&quot; people. The downside is that this is a stimulant so it will wake you up and makes sleeping difficult. It also causes a loss of appetite, which can be rather difficult to deal with. After taking a dose, it becomes nearly impossible to eat. Even forcing food down with liquids is a chore. It's as if food has no appeal or satisfying taste. Another negative side-effect of the instant release tablets is the comedown. Since this is a stimulant similar to speed/cocaine/meth, it can have an intense comedown. I become very easily agitated (little things will set me off), I get headaches, and I overall just feel sick. This is more intense if you haven't been eating throughout the day and if your taking a higher dose. Being aware of how crappy the comedown is makes it easier to deal with. I now can control my mood very well during my comedown and it now rarely affects me. I am not recommending this since it is an illegal solution (unless you have a medical prescription), but &quot;herbal&quot; use has been extremely helpful with the side-effects. Once my day is over and my comedown is beginning to make me feel sick, a little greenery goes a long way. It removes all the negative moods and headaches, restores my appetite, and helps me fall asleep. I can not believe such a helpful drug is illegal, because I would be (more) underweight and sick without it. It's what works for me and my prescribing psychiatrist is aware of my use, but I'm not here to preach about it.Basically, Adderall side-effects can be ROUGH, but without it I could never manage to work 8 hour days or sit through night class.

I do find that close monitoring of this drug is very important. Also quiting smoking, interatctions with other medicaitions that can effect the heart is very important to discuss with the doctor. Also taking holidays from the drug is difficult with the side effects but helps to decrease tolerance and decrease having the medication dose increased. With taking these steps this drug as dramatically improved my life at work and home.

I would have been considered a light &quot;on and off&quot; smoker; probably 3-5 per day for a few months, then I'd stop for a few months, and repeat.  Two weeks afterward, I decided to go out a few nights and had a few cigs at the bar.  The next day when I took my Adderall, I had an immediate urge to smoke.  It was to the point that I wanted to smoke up to a whole pack in a day.Being as it's a stimulant, it definitely helped me focus on schoolwork.  I've been on a number of psychiatric meds, most of which killed off my libido and led to sexual dysfunction.  My libido went sky high, but it destroyed my ability to perform.  I'm sure it was caused by the Adderall in addition to smoking because I checked my blood pressure about a month later and it spiked to 165/80.I also have seasonal depression, and during this period the Adderall made me irritable.  Eventually, the depression killed off the effects of Adderall.  I just started an antidepressant, so hopefully this will correct it.Be very careful if you have high blood pressure, smoke, or consume excessive amounts of caffeine.  If you anxiety, depression, or bipolar disorder, as I do, you may have better results with the Adderall in treating ADHD.

Now, being on adderall, I can remember things again, I can focus again, I can multi-task like crazy!!! This is a great drug for moms with a full plate. The only negative I have noticed is my patience isn't as great as it used to be. An added bonus though is that I am thinner now than before I got pregnant with my twins.

I'm diagnosed with ADD w\o Hyperactivity. My life has been a stuggle. I lived with this disorder untreated for most of my life. this is how I found my way to meth addiction before I found out my real problem.  I want everyone to know that this medication is nothing like meth. A lot of people say that it is and a lot of people believe that it is. Let me, being someone who has experienced both. Tell you that it is not at all the same.  To be honest with you I wish that it was. Do not think that in anyway I'm trying to say that meth is a good drug in anyway. What I'm saying is, is that meth for people with ADD is a form of self medication and its addicting to us because we become normal people. I had high hopes that this medication would have some of the positive results that meth offers and none of the negative attributes of that drug.  I'm pretty sure I can tell you why this medication is addictive to people though. I've been on a lot of different medications and have learned well how to evaluate their effect on my life. This medication is the most difficult to figure out dosage and the most inconsistent medication I have ever dealt with. This medication can be addicting for us because we are tired of living our lives with ADD. When you take the medication and get varied and inconsistent results you want positive results so you take more to try to find that place where it helps you and remains effective. Its not a medication that you can just take the dosage when your supposed to and it will do what its supposed to. So far I'm not pleased with adderall. I will probably ask my doctor for something else on my next visit and pray that something else will work better for me. I know that this medication helps some people and I really wish that I was getting those kind of results. It would be nice to be able to speak with other people taking this medication and see what their experience has been like.

So my therapist decided to look for alternative treatments. She gave me a ADD test, I guess you could call it and almost 80% of my symptoms overlapped with ADD. So I started out with 20 mg XR Adderall, it worked great, was on it for 3 months and recently I have been changed to 30 mg XR, which works even better. My symptoms have all but disappeared, I have a new lease on life, I can't believe what I had missed all my life, this drug really saved my life

I have some mixed feelings about it.  I would not recomend it because of soo many mood swings, and it is very addictive.  It really helps me like the hour after i take it and after that i feel tired and disinterested and not in a real good mood.  It also made me lose my appatite in the mourning and I would have to force me to eat then later on in the afternoon I would be starved cause i hadn't ate much earlier because the pills made me not hungry.  This stuff did calm me down to some extent but I became a whole different person when I was on this and it changed my personality and that was not a good thing.  My grades in school did greatly improve on this stuff.  And it does work immediatly when I take it.  I also noticed though when I took this it made me focus but made me focus on things I shouldn't be focused on.  This makes you feel awake when you first take it then like right after lunch time you feel completly ezhausted and you can't focus on anything, plus i would get headaches every day.  This stuff did temperaily put you in a real good mood like 15 min after you take it then all the sudden you were in a bad mood.  This stuff works great for like a couple years, then after a while you feel addicted to this drug and like it consumes your life.  There are too many ups and downs with this and a different moods every hour.  And without this drug I am not a moodie guy at all.  So I would not reccomend this stuff at all.  This stuff will mess you up.  Try Ritlen I took it for a while it seemed a bit better.

I've tried all kinds of drugs in all kinds of combonations and dosages, and the Adderall has been the only thing that helps with the dementia, plus helps with the depression and anxiety issues. It is a C2 medication, so you have to be careful that you take it EXACTLY as prescribed.

The disorder had a serious impact on my academic and social development as well as my being able to maintain gainfull employment. ADHD symptoms always left me scatter-brained, unable to focus, and made me a slow learner. Adderall has changed that over these past 6 years.

Other	banana, 13-18 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1		13-18	1/24/2011 3:09:19 AM	Be very careful when choosing to take this drug, or any amphetamine. If you look at the pamphlet, I experienced the &quot;rare but serious side effect&quot;. I basically had something that mimicked a heart attack on the 1st dose. For months I had chest tightness, weakness on the left side of my body, and felt like I could pass out all the time. It's rare... but it does happen. And it ruined my year. I'm ok now, but I was worried for months that I had damaged my heart at the age of 16. Just... be careful. Try to work with your ADHD without amphetamines. They're basically speed.

Other		2	1	1			1/21/2011 9:50:00 PM	CAUTION: THIS MED CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS!!! Being in the medical industry and a user of adderall for nearly a year. Few significant things need to be said. While it did help me focus, I also ended up in the emergency room with a 194/126 BLOOD PRESSURE. Muscle twitches were rampant. Horrific negative moods with sometimes uncontrolled verbal aggression are commonplace (within myself and patients I tend to). Sleeplessness goes without saying especially with XR (extended release). I also experienced confusion and dizziness (also reported by many patients). It causes excessive urination as well which tends to deplete your potassium (which helps maintain normal heart rhythms). Eat a banana. Dehydration is a bad side effect so drink plenty of water as well. You have to ask yourself...is focus and production increase worth the risk?

She allowed us to evaluate his reactions. We are in our second week and second day of the 30mg. the worst side effect I have seen is that in the evening, after his shower, his is getting Gout like symptons in both of his feet which goes away by morning. I am not sure if it is gout, and would like to know if Adderall might increase uric acid in the blood stream.

First I was taking the 25mg which worked great but then effectiveness dropped. I was then put on the maximum dosage and did well for several years. Lately I have noticed it does not seem to be working as well. Use to give me energy and focus. However, I was just diagnosed with hypo-thyroid so they maybe the cause of the constant fatigue. I have tried other ADHD medications, almost all of them on the market and not one of them came close to helping me like Adderall has.

This medication has made a huge difference in my ability to initiate and focus on tasks as well as retain information. Positive side effects so far have been weight loss, mild euphoria, and improved energy and mood. Less positive side effects include dry mouth, insomnia (I am up all night if I take this too late in the afternoon), racing pulse, and occasional nausea. It's also definitely a little addictive, more psychologically than physiologically, and on the days I don't take it I feel kind of crappy and inadequate.All in all this medication has dramatically improved my ability to function at home, school and work and I am excited to be starting a new chapter of my life.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Help is out there!!, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/9/2011 9:36:15 AM	I have been on the generic adderall for about 4 months now 20mgs 2xday. It has worked wonders for me at work and my home life with the boyfriend. The hardest part is im a 2nd shifter. so i will stay up till like 4am and want to get up at 2 right before work. Making me feel like im rushing everywhere before i take my meds. I take my med at 2:30pm and at 7pm. B4 i got on it i had a hard time remember what my boss told me to do. I kept losing my tools for my job. i would forget to fill out all my paper work. And since i started taking it i'm very focused my rate has gone up. I remember where i leave stuff. I have always love to workout but, now i stay more focused on my diet and exercise. And i have helpped many people around me with health issues and to get closer to God. It has helpped me so much. i wish now that my parents would of not been so against ADHD meds. when i was a kid i had a lot of trouble in school. I got alot of help from the teachers they would read my test to me so i could hear it and see it at the same time. I know now that i would of got better grades and not suffered so much if my parents would of not jugded everything by what they hear on the news about kids beating up kids for retalin on the bus. It has worked wonders and i dont plan on taking it my whole life it just has helpped me get my lifed turned around. I have always loved to make people smile with the dorky little things and sound effects i make just for fun and i know you make awesome sound effects to if you have the same prob:) I have not lost my wonderful personality. I am very greatful for the chance to get my life on track for once and not be lost in lifes smallest things anymore. I have tried concerta but was very expensive. and retalin but it made my stomach ache and i got mood swings. I hope i have helpped someone out there by them reading this. P.S i kick butt in video games now cause i can actually focus on them. God Bless you n i will pray for you. Pray for what meds u need:)
Other	pikachukiller84, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	1/8/2011 4:51:25 PM	Hi, I have never been diagnosed with anything or taken any medications until just recently. I am a 26 year old make and have been feeling very down for almost a year to the point of wishing to die everyday. I have always felt it even as a child, but recently decided to seek help. The doctor prescribed me Celexa 20mg at first, I took it for a couple weeks and really didnt notice anything. He upped it to 40mg/day (Celexa) and after about a month on it I started to notice a change. It happens pretty slow, and it is subtle. But now I am much happier, I can talk to my family now without getting an attitude, and I have an overall feeling of &quot;life is good&quot;. The only thing negative I noticed about it was sometimes I would feel zoned out, or staring off into space. So the doctor prescribed me Adderall 10mg twice a day. I have only been taking the adderrall for about 4 days but let me tell you... this drug can work for you or against you. The first day I got it, I didnt take it early enough and was up all night. The second day I took it in the morning, and then in the afternoon. The first time taking it the feeling was intense. One pill makes you not feel much, but after the second one you get euphoria that last's for about an hour or two and you have the feeling of being on coke or something. I was unclear for a couple of days how to use it because I didnt really feel like I could concentrate. So today I reduced it to one just before I took my test and found it to be ok. It isnt what I thought, I know it would work better if I took the second dose, but i didnt want to seem wired today, and I wanted to get a goodnight sleep. As far as mood goes, the Adderall put me in a really good mood, non aggressive, and also very relaxed (even though I felt wired and cracked out). I want to know what I should do, because 1 dose in the morning is ok, but the second one really enhances the situation, clears my head up and allows me to concentrate, but like I said the feeling for a few hour

At the time my mother refused to put me on medication because she feared I would be put into special ed classes. I hated school, with a passion. I was bored with what I was being taught, and focusing on doing homework was impossible. After dropping out of high school, and moving to a different state, I got my GED and started college. I talked to my doctor about my problems in the past with ADHD and she started me out on Concerta, which didn't do anything at all. She then switched me to Adderall XR 20mg once a day. For me this medicine is an absolute miracle. I can't believe the difference it has made in my ability to focus, not only on school, but living life in general.This drug definitely does not work for everyone. I have read a lot of reviews about children having negative reactions. A close friend of mine's son was taking 30mg a day at the age of 12. He also has MANY other psychological problems as well, and Adderall turned him into a monster. His rage towards everyone around him was unbelievable. When he stopped taking it his behavior improved tremendously. In my opinion I think doctors are giving kids way too high of a dosage. Withdrawals from Adderall is a nightmare. I've taken a few breaks from it for about a month at a time within the past few years. I slept at least 16+ hours a day for a week straight. When I wasn't sleeping I was eating. The mood swings were terrible, and I had NO patience for ANYTHING or ANYONE. But after about a week I was almost back to normal. Adderall sometimes makes me very compulsive.  I will occasionally obsessively pick at my skin, and once I start its really hard to stop. Not many people experience that. Also as a smoker, it makes me smoke A LOT.I also found that Vitamin C pretty much blocks Adderall from absorbing into the body. Once I stopped drinking juices w/ vit. C, the Adderall worked normall

I take celexa 40mg everyday for about 2 months now. like i said i started adderall 2 days ago because the celexa is awesome for depression, but i feel spaced out. The adderall makes me feel very wired, almost a coked out feeling for the first 2 hours. then it goes away but you can still feel it. I take 10mg twice a day. I made the mistake of taking it later in the day around 4pm and was up all night. finally rested around 4am for a few hours until i got up. i havent really noticed the ability to focus more because it has been thrown off by the wired feeling. i will give it a try for a few more days, maybe cut back to just one a day. i didnt think 10mg would be strong, but it messes me up.

The mood swings are also apparent.. One minute im crying, followed by a feeling of elation. I also haven't slept in a few days. I could never fathom giving this drug to a child! 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	13-18	1/5/2011 5:48:06 PM	Sure adderall works wonders, it made me a straight A student, extremely focused, and very chilled out. But to me the side effects are not worth it. Its overkill, it made me like a 'zombie'. My dose had to be raised at least yearly to even work. After being on it for over 8 years I decided to quit taking adderall because i felt it consumed my life. And the withdrawl symptoms where horrible. I was constantly tired and moody, and had a uncontrolable urge to constantly eat, i gained tons a weight. So basically I would not recommend adderall and even thought it is tough to deal with ADHD, i would recommend just overcoming it instead of medicating.

My one concern is the I sometimes find myself focusing on what is in frot of me and not what I need to be focused on. It's hard to change gears sometimes. Multi tasking has proven to be challanging at times too especially when it comes to forgetting or spending to much time on one of the many tasks to be completed. I prone to nervouse energy and it does make it worse sometimes and better other times. I recently started taking Klonipin with adderal and the combination is really working for me. I have the focus of adderal, but with a calmer approach to just about everything.

I finally found a dr. who actually took the time to TALK to me and observe me before giving me a label or a prescription. As it turns out, I have ADHD. We started with Ritalin, but the peaks and valleys were too much. Plus it made me feel REALLY anxious. Now I am on 30 mg in the am and 20 mg of adderall in the afternoon. This medication has been a miracle for me. I can actually complete a task and I no longer burst into tears just thinking about compiling a grocery list. The only side effect I am experiencing is an upset stomach.

I did really well on it , but it got too expensive for me to use; no insurance. I don't recommend going off this med without a doctor monitoring. When I called and told them I coudn't afford it and needed a new med, I was told it would take 2 months. I had a horrible time coming off of it; very emotional, aggressive and irrational outbursts over small things, foul language and inability to concentrate with moderate depression. So yes this medication works well for ADHD but coming off it is another story.

I have been on and off antidepressants since about 25 for panic attacks and depression which seems to be to  genetics. It seems I had a low lying depression for years that I never realized but soon became clear when I finally went to a doctor. I never liked meds so I was on and off of them. Nothing had really changed for me in life so i was always self diagnosing and realized(i thought) i have ADD! All the symptoms were there, told my doc who is prescription happy and gave me a script. No tests, no medical screening, just a script for 20mg 3X daily to START OFF. Giving someone that much of a hardcore narcotic who suffers from panic and depression is just beyond me. Sure it made me concentrate, big freakin deal...I always did well academically without even trying. It also made me lose all patience, had zero personality, and just withdrew from life, didn't eat or sleep and depression worsened. The toppper is that within a month I was in the emergency room for what I was certain was a heart attack. So I threw out the pills, but again I decided another shot but lower dosage. Same results pretty much. I know this drug helps countless people but if you take you better damn well make sure that you have ADD for real and not just making excuses for your failings in school, work etc. And please if you read this, and you have depression and get panic attacks don't even think about touching Adderral or any other stimulant drugs. How the FDA could approve something so dangerous and highly addictive and abused is beyond me. They should just go ahead and legalize cocaine while they are at it and tax it. Bet the nation's deficit would be gone in a year!

It has worked very well for me, as i am now able to complete tasks, and think more clearly. I will say, in the beginning it gave me the jitters, like drinking a pot of coffee at once. After a few days, i felt like my life had some order to it, as opposed to feeling like i was going 90mph, in 100 different directions. I have been on a few other med's for ADD/ADHD, but they didn't work for me. The only negative thing i can say about Adderall, is i do have some short-term memory loss, but nothing major.

I was originally diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, but after changing doctors I am found to have ADD. After researching I found that my symptoms are almost 100% on. As a child I was very hyper and what I considered to be &quot;outgoing&quot; but I never really achieved anything. Didn't get in much trouble other then talking to much, or being a class clown,until after high school.Normal mornings without Meds,I could barely get out of bed,I had been angry and frustrated,with  MAJOR depression, and this is as soon as I get up!I just felt like a failure! Everything I do seems like such a task,appointments,or family gatherings have been like pulling teeth for me.Honestly getting into the Drs is a life saver. Because I couldn't have been that miserable for much longer. I know I just started taking this med.but today when my alarm clock went off,I hopped right out of bed and made breakfast for my daughter before she was even up.I normally would go back to bed once she went to school,and I have been up since.I feel happy,I even felt good last night.I am worried bc my blood pressure gets high when I am stressed out or upset, and I worry about the adderall making that worse. But I'm hoping that it will help ease my stress bc I wont be behind on everything rushing to catch up and get things done at the last min.(thats how I've been living my life) I mean even my sons shots were 6mths behind, and thats a major health concern for my child and family.My homework and health has been put off for so long.I've lived w the anxiety that I will fail at everything I do.I am ready to live a normal,meaningful life.I have always been a good Mother as far as giving my children all the love they can stand =)But now I am ready to be the Mother that can teach my children by example,a good role model,who isn't sleep all day either!I have had a couple lilheadaches,only lastin 10m,thats it.I feel brand new now!20mgs allday&amp; last dose@5 slept good.30mgs/2today

Before switching medications, I had been on Strattera in high school, which had left me depressed and without any change in my symptoms. When I started college I switched to Adderall and it made a significant different in my academic performance and improved my self worth tremendously. My only side effects were weight loss and insomnia, which eventually diminished after my dosage was correctly adjusted. While I am extremely satisfied with my experience on Adderall, I understand that each drug is different for every person  .. but I still think people should be willing to try several drugs and dosages until they find what works for them.. because effective treatment TRULY makes a difference!

I have had moderate-extreme difficulty being organized, fighting (and losing) my battle with depression and suicidal thoughts, and taking large amts of hydrocodone for pain, from arthritis and fybromyalgia, on a daily basis for several years. Also smoking and drinking far too much, high BP &amp; overweight. Started taking 30 mgs x3/day recently and the results have been: depression disappeared, paperwork getting done, no interest in drinking and maybe 2 cigs/day. I've lost 8 lbs, today's BP was 120/86, and I'm virtually pain-free, so I asked the dr. to reduce hydrocodone prescription from 180 pills/month to 25, and I'll call if I need a refill, but I don't expect I'll need to. Sleeping less, but getting a better quality of sleep. WOW!
Other	momof2va, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/2/2010 1:56:25 AM	I have only been taking Adderall for 2 months, but I think it has saved my life.  For the longest time I couldn't understand why I couldn't focus on one thing, or start something and never finish it without going on to something else.  I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 18 and tried just about every one out there. Nothing helped, i usually ended up feeling more depressed.  I almost felt paralized in my own body, there were so many things I wanted to do and needed to do and just couldn't.  Since taking Adderall, I am completely focused on what i need to do, i actually have the energy to do what i need to do and overall feel like a new person. I haven't had a job in over a year and I'm living with my parents currently with my two children.  In the past few weeks, I have gotten a job and started to look at apartments.  Let's just say I am making a lot of positive changes in my life and i feel like the adderall gave me the motivation i needed to do it.  hopefully everything works out, and things keep looking up!!!! i would recommend this to anyone who feels the way i used to. to me, it's a miracle drug.

This is an effective drug, no doubt.  She's able to focus in school, be less impulsive, and complete her homework.  The problem is that she gets regular stomach aches (her stomach is already sensitive), it drastically changes her personality (too calm), and she experiences a decrease of appetite. I guess you can't have it all.  Bottomline, she's able to get through the school day and learn without getting into constant trouble.  However, there are trade-offs.

I'll admit it works, it totally helps me be focused and &quot;normal&quot; like everyone else, i'm not obnoxiously hyper and impulsive, i just sit quietly and do what i'm told. IT'S AWFUL! it's pretty much a personality stripper, inside and out. When i take it I feel distant from the real world, overly focused on whatever I'm doing. I wouldn't recommend putting your kids on this, just saying. i mean, if you wanna take it that's fine, but for your unique child's interest, if they have ADHD, just love them anyway and deal with them the way they are. don't put them on meds, it'll make them feel like a zombie, WHICH IS NOT FUN. just something to consider.

Go to the DEA or FDA websites. It is an highly addictive drug. Over a period of time it causes pretty much all the side effects associated to it. Watch who and how much someone is taking. It might start out ok but check over time, 6mo. 1yr. Watch for symptoms associated to this drug and really think about other options before taking it. This drug is just handed out by doctors to easily and most people really do not need it.

Two years ago I suffered a back injury on the job. I have worked as a FF/Paramedic for the last ten Yes (8 now b/c of injury) and it has cost me not only my career but working again at all.

Other	pepmed, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	10/27/2010 2:15:35 AM	I was prescribed Adderall because I had taken it a couple of times from a friend and I thought it could really help me get motivated, have more concentration, and help with my depression.  It has helped with all those things.  Although, sometimes instead feeling outgoing and attentive, I feel very nervous and therefore can't concentrate on anything except how I feel.  I think this may be a result of drinking too much caffeine.  Also, during the summer, I would sweat profusely.  Even now that Fall is here, I still feel hot at times.  It's almost a double-edged sword for me.  I say that because it's working very well for me, but, at the same time, I'm worried that I'll become addicted to it.  In my case that's a legitimate fear since I used to take a lot of opiates and benzos.  I don't abuse the Adderall though.  I don't like the &quot;speedy&quot; feeling, plus I realize it's very dangerous to do so.  Overall, my rating is a:  A-.

My doctor and I wanted me to be able to sleep less and be able to be awake during the day and function like normal people. I was given Adderall 10mg, one a day. no change in my sleeping was noticed. We increased the dosage to 20mg, and I have only taken one yesterday and one today. I would like to know the best time of day to take the medication to get the best effect. I know that the suggestion says to take it upon waking in the morning. Will taking it in the morning be effective for me, because my problem is sleeping too much, but not narcolepsy. I just want to sleep normally and be awake a normal amount of time.I hope someone out there can give me the answer, I think Adderall can help, but the time it is to be taken by me is very critical. Thanks.Pat

I have taken it always with one or two antidepressants and a anti-anxiety med. It is the only medicine that has helped me be able to physically get things done. I have been and tried many medicines. Before I was on it I physicaly could not get off the couch. I have always taken the generic product non-sustained release. I hope I remember to ask my shrink next time to get me on sustained release. I had life tradgedies that made a mild depression severe. As it is a controlled substance I like what one of my counselors said &quot;A bad medicine for a good reason.&quot; I gets me from non functional to close to average energy. It does not get me feeling euphoric or high. On the street its called speed. I am a recovering alcoholic of 19 years, I am taking it to help me survive, and I always take it as prescribed. I was on it from 2006 until Sept. of this year 30mg 3 times a day. If I took it after 4pm sometimes hard to fall asleep. My new shrink reduced me to 30mg twice a day, I feel I have lost one third productivity.   Thank god I have never had the urge to take a handful. Thank God!

Getting the right doseage was the biggest hurtel. I am a much more organized and productive person because of adderall. I still go to therapy because I need the additional support from the sudden change of low production&amp; self-esteem, to accomplemishment of goals and assertiveness.I do not use my ADD for excuses of the past missed oppertunities,but use as a lesson for my children and grand children help them overcome their current diagnosed ADHD symptons.

I do experience slight agitation if I don't take it at a consistent time and ESPECIALLY if I forget to take my other meds. One of the other frustrating side effect I have noticed is that I yawn CONSTANTLY! I get this strong urge to yawn so badly, that I &quot;force&quot; myself to do it! The other side effect is having the urge to urinate more frequently. (Maybe I need to stay more hydrated?!)

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	John R., 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	55-64	9/27/2010 4:12:14 PM	I have PTSD from service in Vietnam. 100% disabled.  Recently in the last year I noticed radical changes in my behaviors and sypmtoms.  Not being able to focus, concentrate, lack of desire to do tasks or jumping from one to another to another and never getting anything finished.  On top of that my sleep patterns changed in a way different from my PTSD symptoms.  I began to stay up all night for no good reason and sleep most of the day.  Formally, with the PTSD I would not be able to go to sleep at night with racing thoughts about the war or I would go to sleep and wake up in sweating from horrible nightmares. Now it's like I have both going on except I seem to not have the racing thoughts about the war so much, in fact, hardly at all.  I recently started taking 20mg of Adderall XR last week but it does not last long enough and I only feel just a little bit more like doing tasks and finishing them.  It just doesn't feel like the dosage is strong enough.  I find myself drifting off to sleep in the middle of the afternoon.  I have a fulltime Psychologist and MD to monitor my situation.My Internest MD diagnosed me with ADD.

Anti-depressants added to my already present symptoms of fatigue, brain fog, and inability to focus. My psychiatrist was hesitant to prescribe me Adderall due to my past history of using illegal drugs to eliviate my symptoms.I wanted to find something that could help me function without the stigma and lifestyle associated with illegal drugs. After two years with the same Dr. and close monitoring of the affects of other medications, he finally decided to try me on the Adderall. Before, I would start out to complete one task, and end up with 10 unfinished tasks and no desire to complete any of them. After the Adderall, I noticed a difference the very first day. The ability to start a single task and see it through to completion was a wonderful feeling. It has completely changed my life.

I had a sleep study and have a &quot;fragmented sleep pattern&quot; but just shy of having narcolepsy. After sleeping for 17 hrs a day for four years, falling asleep while on the computer, watching tv, dozing off while shopping and doing dishes, it's nice to wake up at 10am not 4pm. I was so depressed *because* I couldn't wake up, not because of my depression which is well treated. My psychiatrist didn't care to listen. I'm still getting the timing right so I can sleep well at night. I do take meds for anxiety, seizures, atypical depression, and tremors with muscular contortions. Thought adderal would really agitate all this but all I do is shake a little bit. I drag a lot between doses and my concentration goes away. I feel really physically hungry when I'm hungry, but every food seems repulsive to me. I force myself to eat. I've had really tight muscles, partly because of occasional contortions, partly from adderal plus scoliosis. I do a lot of stretching and see my chiro. My pulse stays at 84 bps, some very brief palpitations (one or two per day) so NO caffeine. I meditate and do breathing exercises. One very weird thing: Night sweats. Otherwise great. I'm awake all day, can concentrate (no memory due to Topomax), and can do journaling and my art again plus be social. No more haze and I'm enjoying life for the first time in years!

He started taking Adderall @ 10mg 1x per day in the AM, 5 months ago. He is ADHD with all the hyperactivity and lack of ability to focus on any tasks, no matter how minor they may be. He was diagnosed at age 6 in the first grade. We have tried at least 8 different medications in the last four years. As he grows, the meds seem to sometime lose their effect after a certain period of time. Concerta was great for almost 2yrs and then we tried various others till we found Adderall. It worked GREAT! He stays focused and we do not have any side effects at all! Not even the loss of appetite which was always a problem with the other medications. I am very pleased with this medication, and at times this may be frustrating as a parent to go through finding what works for your child. But once you find the medication that works for your child, it definitely is worth everything to see your child succeed at all he does, especially in school. My son is a very caring, loving and happy child and have never had any problems as far as anger issues that many people might mention. He is just full of energy and cannot stay focused on one task, school assignments or just doing things in order such as fix your bed and next clean out your back pack....he may start the bed but will soon be jumping in the living room having not completed his bed or much less totally forgot about his back pack...

Helped with me focus.  But felt anxious. From there is was trial and error with trying about three other stimulants, with no success. Finally I found a new doctor and she prescribed me Paxil, and a BP med, along with Adderall 20 mg.  All three work fine for me.  Especially working well on my impulsivness. I am now up to 20 mg twice daily.  I am just curious at what hr in the day and do most people take pill on a empty stomach or after meals?  Feel less anxious when I have something in my stomach when taking this med?  Any advice?

For the week after it was raised I was EXTREMELY aggitated with everything. But my body eventually got used to the new dosage. Now I'm taking 20mg 2x a day. I'm very happy with how it is working. I can finally concentrate in my classes and at work. Side Effects: weight loss (40 pounds since March, but I was overweight), loss of appetite (which gives me a headache, so I have to remind myself to eat), loss of thrist, nausea (at least 2-3x a week, between 2-5 hours), headache, aggitation (only slightly), trouble breathing (rarely, it feels like I'm not breathing in enough air, but my dr gave me an allergy med that helps most the time). I have a lot of side effects, but honestly, the fact that I can concentrate and get stuff done outweighs them.

I've been prescribed the other meds, but for the past 10 years I've been on the same dose of Adderall (20mg t.i.d.) and nothing works better. With Adderall I am able to focus, think before acting, I'm much less anxious and my temper is curbed. All of which give me much more confidence in the things I do. Hell, it even helps me sleep better!Prior to diagnosis w/ADHD, I had a brief stint of drug use (and I know that's a contraindication), but in all honesty, Adderall was of great help in stopping those behaviours. It's amazing what can happen when a person gains cognitive clarity &amp; patience to assist in positive decision-making.Although it can increase anxiety in some and if you have cardiovascular issues - forget it, I highly recommend at least a trial of this medication if you have ADD/ADHD. It continues to do wonders for me. :)

I would take it at about 8AM and by lunch time it was worn off and I just crashed. My doctor then prescribed me 20MG XR once daily. This has worked so much better for me and seems to last about 7-8 hours. Side effects when taking 15MG immediate release tabs: SEVERE dry-mouth, loss of appetite, headaches, upset stomach, mood swings. Side effects from 20MG XR tabs: Extreme weight loss (24 lbs.) over a 2 month period, Loss of appetite, constipation. No more dry mouth,  headaches or mood swings. This has turned out to be a wonderful drug for me. I can complete tasks at my job and actually focus and pay attention now. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	huggybearbarry, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	65-74	8/17/2010 5:35:36 AM	Years ago, I had a TIA &amp; it gave me such a &quot;wild&quot; sensation (whole left side went numb) that I shall never forget it. Years after that, I had a tingling sensation that was so similar to my earlier TIA, that I thought it was an aura signaling another onset of a TIA or worse yet, a full blown stroke. So I made a &quot;beeline&quot; to the ER &amp; the ER Dr.'s had no idea what it was. So, they got on the phone with what I'm calling a &quot;lifesaver&quot; as he (Dr. Alan S. Zacharias, a &quot;guru&quot; of a neurologist here in Boulder, CO), knew, once they told him all the Rx's I was taking, e.g., Adderal, what was going on, i.e., that the Adderall was the problem, told the ER Dr.'s that info &amp; had them tell me to stop taking the Rx Adderall immediately. I did &amp; the tinglings went away forever. That is ONE STRONG Rx!!! Now, I'm taking generic Ritalin &amp; no side effects, i.e., tinglings. So, now on to this wonderful WEBMD website. It's here where I found that those who've had a stroke, or in my case, a TIA, should NOT be taking Adderal -- therefore, thank you for being so inclusive, exhaustive, comprehensive, etc unlike the PDR where no mention was made of that contraindication. Thanks, Barry

But in addition to that diagnoses of ADHD I was also told I had Bipolar Disorder. Now that I am in my 20s I have a worry about the long term side effects. Every doctor I have asked assures me that there are no proven negative long term effects of taking this medication for a long period of time.  But I can help but think otherwise. It is an amphetamine after all. Other issues I am concerned about have been the effect it has on me when I stop taking it completely. I am very tired and don't really know what to expect or I'm aware of things that are going on around me but can't really grasp the concepts. I have tried the none Extended Release Adderall and it was very unsatisfactory! BLEH! I would take one in the morning and then one in the afternoon and I had major side effects, tremors, ticks, I kept clenching my jaw and I was very unhappy. I am satisfied with the results and ease of the XR tablets. But I still think about the long term side effects...kind of feel like a lab rat considering every doctor I've asked about them seems to think that I'll be fine...I guess I'll find out, eventually...

With minimual side effects, at a dose of 20mg / day.  My pharmacy did make a mistake of dispensing the generic once. The pills are identical, but the side effects were not.  With the generic I experienced sever cramping, mood swings and extreme irritability.  It took another month off the generic and back on brand to rectify.  I also notice that not stopping over the weekends or on holidays, and keeping the regular dose without fluctuation, gives me a consistant benefit.

She has ADHD. The stereotypical kind: jumping off the walls, impulsive behavior, low grades, unable to focus on a conversation for more than a minute, etc. Anyway, shortly after she began taking it, she became like a zombie. Sure, the &quot;desired&quot; effect was achieved; she was calm, followed directions easily, blah. BUT AT WHAT RISK TO HER BODY &amp; MIND?! She walked around the house in a daze. She was incessantly licking her now-dry lips. She never, EVER had an appetite. And what really made me object was watching her tick. She would involuntarily buck her eyes and tongue. When I say buck, I mean REALLY HARD. Like POP. normal. POP. And so on. I hated seeing my sister twitch and could only wince at the thought of the long-term damaging effects this PRESCRIBED (meth)AMPHETAMINE (or whtvr the flying feck) was having on her actual brain. I just found out I have ADHD. And I will fight to the death, refusing to take these meds. There's another way.

I was just recently diganosed with ADD but I know i have had it all my life. Inability to concentrate like studying, listening and hearing what people had to say, I always heard them but never understood them because I just wanted the end resuly because I am always on the go go go. I just started taking Adderall XR 10mg i believe because  I need it for school and would like it for work(I do a lot of computer work and make careles mistakes even though I know better). The very first day I expierenced like a high of energy  but very attentive that lasted only 4 hrs, supposed to last like 8. So I took it again the next day because I know my body wasnt used to it, I was expecting it do the same but did not happen, I just became more alert and focused and relized mistakes when I made them and was better able to multi task(at work sometimes i have to do like 5 things really quick)I was able to priortise, but it still only lasted 4 hours, I started getting sleepy, and felt &quot;like a blonde&quot; as usual. So I will be trying Vyvanes later so I hope it works longer because my day starts at 9 and it doesnt end untill 11pm most days.

Other	Linda, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/27/2010 10:49:50 AM	**** Adderall helped me get through an intensive graduate school program by allowing me to focus on my reading assignments and projects after a long full day at work. It also elevated my mood. I felt happy that I was managing work and school well. I never abused the dosage and took it on a daily basis with the approval of my doctor for a year and a half until I suffered from a ruptured brain aneurysm. I never had high blood pressure and my EKG was fine before starting the medication. I did notice that my BP had gone up while on the medication but I just attributed that to the extra demands of grad school and a new teaching position. I was one of the Extremely lucky ones to survive the ruptured aneurysm w/o complications. My neurosurgeon said that the rupture could have been brought on by the use of this drug and demanded I immediately stop using it. Because of this I would not recommend it's use by anyone. I'm a teacher and would rather see kids or adults bouncing off the walls or daydreaming away then lying in a coffin.

My ability to focus now is incredible. I rip through tasks with ferocity like nothing I've experienced before. I'm however, admittedly, struggling with mood swings from a euphoria feeling to a &quot;crash&quot; feeling.  The drug gives me a speed-like euphoria that you will have to learn to channel into whatever productive task you need to accomplish. There is a huge potential for abuse here so be careful.  I've also experienced a some issue with hyper sexuality from this drug.It will absolutely help you focus, but this drug should be respected at all times due to the abuse/ addiction potential.

I've noticed a major change in my ability to complete tasks, I have more energy and can definitely feel the difference if I skip it for the day.  I tend to not take it on weekends, but during the week when I have a lot to accomplish, this drug has really helped me out.  I am supposed to take it twice a day, but only take it in the morning so that it isn't in my system too late into the evening.

I am 26 years old and have taken adderall since i was 13.  So pretty much everything that most of the things people are saying they are going through in these reviews, they have already come and gone with me.  But the last is the hair loss with me.  Right now Im going to a dermatologist just to figure out my massive hair loss problem.  I fear I will almost be bald by the end of the year (but mostly because my last dermy was a moron and never even ran tests). My suggestion is get her to a Dr.  Get a blood test or test the scalp tissues.  Thyriod/depression/stress/hormones are easily grouped and can be disguised.  And with this disorder is hard to figure if its just you or could actually be an underlining problem.  I have my other dermys apt tomorrow.  Ill respond when i have a better problem with whats going on with me because i can almost guarantee it might be the same thing.

Three months ago I was initially prescribed 15mg of the XR. I have a more inattentive form of AD/HD and I immediately noticed a difference in my ability to focus and concentrate, especially in school. However, as others have complained I notice it does seem to wear off a bit. It's possible I need a higher dosage for more effectiveness but I noticed I have begun jaw clenching and my dry mouth is insane! Although it's possible the dry mouth is from my Depakote. I have a Mixed Bipolar co-morbid AD/HD diagnosis. This medication is overall quite effective and can make a life changing improvement for some. However I want to caution this medication shouldn't make a person with true  AD/HD feel &quot;tweaked out&quot;, sped up, or high. It should just elevate awareness, focus, and an overall attention to detail. That's why I agree that it is safe for kids truly suffering from this diagnosis should take a stimulant medication such as Adderall. You will notice immediately if these medications will be a right fit for you.

She had tried many different medications and none worked other than this one. I beleive there are pro's and con's to any medication but to say that this medication should'nt be given to any child is outrageous, i know like any other parent of and adhd child if something helps give it to them. My daughter went from no school or daycare willing to continue to keep her to a great child with great acheivements in school. She just received a award for most progress this school year. I thank God there was something to help her succeed in life because without this medication it was no where near possible!!

My diet in addition has just gone down hill, and if i do eat i am eating junk... not a well balanced diet at all.

My parents did the same thing to me. Most ADD/ADHD med will make him worse, These pills drain happiness. Keep it up and your on your way to a very difficult acedemic career. People that have ADD/ADHD have an intelectual advantage, i beleive most people that say they have some type of attention disorder are full of it. If you want your son to be sucessful, push him in the direction of his passion, not yours. I was pushed in directions against my will most of my childhood. I dropped out of highschool got in trouble with the law, the whole shabang. I now attend the 3rd top business school in the country. Your Son will learn how you efficiently use his skill, changing his brain chemistry with amphetimines is crazy. I cannot imagine what is brain is thinking when he is on this drug. Do some research please. And trust me your son will be more sucessful then you can imagine. I know he is a hand full as i was as a child. But dont give up and let him be crazy he's 7.

Though I didn't experience any ral negative side effects - other than being a little jittery and unable to sleep sometimes, I felt a little sketchy about continuing to use it when I graduated. It does show up at an amphetamine in drug tests, and I didn't want to tr to explain that in a job interview. Now I have been takng what they call Cognitive Energy Enhancers. They are over-the-counter and are basically a combination of a 5 Hour Energy and a brain vitamin. But they work! I have tired a few, but I like one called PROFIDERALL as an Adderall alternative. It is not as intense as Adderall, but it gives me the focus and energy boost I need to get my work done, and it is totally legal.

I can relate to the person who said someone can talk to you for 10 minutes and you don't remember a thing they daid. I too use adderall for it's intended porpuse. Unfortunantly, I also use it and have abused it a lot.I moved 2,500 miles about 12 years ago just to get away from what was the meth Capital of our great country San Diego at that time. Thank God meth is not a major problem in Western Pa.However, adderall and meth are soooooo much alike. I encourage anyone out there to really think twice before putting your child on adderall. First I would get a second apinion from a Dr. who knows about addiction.2nd I would look at the families addiction history. If you must put your child on adderall I would only do so as a last option where you have tried everything else. I do not mean other drugs I mean like counseling, tuitering, sitting down with your child and helping him or her with homework. I mean really try to find out why they are having trouble focusing and try to solve the problem without a drug. Doctors are just so to quick to give you a drug or to put a lable on you. I can talk to 9 out of 10 head Dr.'s and in 15 minutes I can have them lable me anything I want them to and that is sad.I honestly believe most of life's problems are in a persons heart not our head.Please talk to your pastor as well. I think that is the first place I would start. Im talking to the man in the mirrior more than anyone and I pray someone out there knows exactly what Im saying and it's time for this great country to get back to place where we can get our hearts right with God and repent for all our sin and I truly believe our world would be a better place. If anyone out there is addicted to adderall you can get help at a place called the rolloff homes. please go to pbc-roloffhomes.org you and /or your child can get real help. no ins.needed.no money, u wont b turned away

I was able to concentrate, focus, much less impulsive.Unfortunately I build up a very quick tollerance to medications. I am on the maximum dosage (after being on it just 1 year) and it is almost like not taking it at all.I also am having the problem previous reviewers have stated with teeth grinding. I have tried mouth guards, I destroy those in no time. I have always been a teeth clencher, but now I exessively grind my teeth when the meds are wearing off for the day.Overall I have been very happy with the Adderall&gt;

I've been on about 10 different antidepressants since then. I am now 53. I am doing so well on this since it was prescribed to me by my physciatrist a year ago. I take 30mg. twice a day. I now clean my house, organize my life and activities plus joined the gym. I've lost a little weight, I gained a lot on the antidepressants, and continue to slowly lose it since I've joined they gym. I've never slept much since I was diagnosed with the depression but I can now sleep a good 5 hours a night and feel rested. It does, however, make you sweat a lot. I sweat a lot anyway living in the south with the humidity, but this makes it worse. Sometimes this is a good thing. I think I need another does though. During the day after my second dose, which is late in the afternoon since I get up so early, I start to wind down too early. I still go to bed late and get up by at least 5 every morning. I've always been a morning person but I think I do need an extra dose. I'll be asking my doctor for a third pill to take during the day so I can get things done in the evening. It has helped me so much I recommend it to anyone that has depression and anxiety issues like I do. I've not had a panic attack in about three months. I've found that certain situations and people trigger those. I've learned to avoid them. Hope this helps someone in need.

But once your body gets used to the drug, you need to increase the dosage in order for the drug to &quot;keep working.&quot;  After being on the medication for a couple of years, the patient slowly feels like a &quot;speeding slug&quot;, where you are feeling energetic from the drug, but disorganized where it's not getting you anywhere, but giving you anxiety.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	6/6/2010 9:12:51 PM	well I have been on Adderal for about 7 yrs.  I am now taking 240 mg a day..thats 2 30's 4 x a day.  I almost think that dosage is to high.., but when I try to cut back, it is impossible for me to do.  I'd rather take none at all (which that I cn dio easily) than just take say half the prescribed amount.  But my old habbits are back and worse. I still make my lists, ect., but I go off on so many rabit trails while doing the list, the list never gets done.  It almost takes me 3x longer to accomplish anything.  For me to pack and go to the lake, it takes me s good 6 hours.  I no all this is not how it should be..but I think i am what they call Tweaking out on it.  I think I will go aff it competely then go to 30mg x 2 a day.  One more thing.  When I don't take my adderal for a few days, when I do take it I have to start off on VERY small dosage.Thanks for all the reviews, I really showed me what I alreadty new in my heart..., plus it gave me the re3commended dosage for amount to take a day.  
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	6/5/2010 3:00:54 AM	Adderall seems like a miracle pill at first, but like most amphetamine based drugs that aren't entirely clean... it comes with a price.First, it IS very expensive now, even though Shire doesn't even make the pill.  Teva makes the namebrand now...  also the price is now higher, even the generic XR capsule.  Dexedrine is a better drug for ADHD, but is also easily to become immune to, and you're once again, F'd.  Adderall's negative side effects were not noticed by me for almost a year.  I worked out every morning, went to class, and had baseball practice after school.  College, drinking, bad habits, and the effectiveness of the drug were all part of the problem.Ritalin or anything like Concerta will probably make you more nervous, and give you a worse headache.  So far, Dexedrine has had the least side effects but comes with a negative stigma attached to its name.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/5/2010 12:48:55 AM	I have struggled with ADHD symptoms since I can remember.  I only recently started taking medications as my symptoms got worse after having children.  I tried Ritalin before switching to Adderall.  It has helped me more than anything I have ever tried to do on my own (making schedules, writing notes &amp; reminders, not taking on too many things at once).  It just made life so much easier.  I don't have accidents at work, I focus better, I finish what I start and dont procrastinate.  I also am able to get to work on time and not be as stressed and irritable.  However, I have been on it for two years and I have had issues with not being able to take it for a few days or a week sometimes and I definitly felt that there was a dependence even after taking the correct dosage always.  I dont like the fact that Adderall is so addictive whether you abuse it or not.  I want to be put on something else so I dont have to worry about that, but i think that the outcome outweighs the risk...unless another medication can do the same job without being as addictive physically.
Other	Bill Mc, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/4/2010 9:13:34 PM	Male, Age 60, for Adult ADD. Taking it approx 18 months. Prescribed generic Adderall 20mg twice daily. Usually split the dose into 10mg 2 or 3 times a day. Skipping dose completely 2 days in a row each week so as to not have to increase the dosage. Works very well for me.  Helps me to focus and accomplish what ever I may be working on. Also more sociable and more tolerant of others. Good for anger management. Spouse notices the difference and supportive of my taking it. Some initial weight loss 5 - 8 lbs but have since regained it.  Just eat at meal times and try more highly seasoned food (easy on the salt).  Also drink more liquids. Best to not take it late in the day unless you plan on being up late. I still sleep at night and usually take a nap in the afternoon. Some people complain about excessive side effects and not liking the results.  Well see your MD and maybe try something else.  As for me, &quot;it's just what the Doctor ordered&quot;.  Wish I had known about this medication years ago.  It's a real help for me. My results far outweigh any side effects, which I find to be minimal.

I am in exactly the same situation.  I am 25 and I have been on unprescribed(street) adderall since I was 13. For the past 9 months I have been prescribed 20mg tabs 3 times a day.  I was a grinder prior to any stimulant use.  My grinding wasn't so bad until I actually got my own script.  I am actually wearing out my teeth on the right side(I'm right handed).  I chew those night guards to bits. I really don't know what to do about the situation either.  My dentist just told me, &quot;Try to stay conscious of your teeth grinding and focus on not doing it.&quot;  Does he honestly think that 'trying not to' wasn't my first god **** idea?

I started at 10mg twice a day,then three times a day. And then it was upped to 30,f twice a day. I dont have insurance and couldnt afford the XR. It works amazing for my ADHD, but I am grinding my teeth so bad and clenching my jaw. I was a grinder before starting the medication, but it has just made it a whole lot worse. I'm calling the DR. tomorrow about it. Maybe there is a different medication that wont make me do it as much. I've been wearing a mouth guard for years now, but I do it while i'm awake. I did it while I was awake before starting the adderall too tho. Its just making it even more. And I dont have money to go to the dentist. So I guess Ill just have to do the whole guinea pig thing untill i find something that helps with the grinding.

And forget the Xanax because that will just reduce the Adderall you are taking.Try to get the doctor to give you divided doses of the Adderall instead of one large dose-it costs more but much more effective and remember when it comes to Adderall dosages sometimes less is more... Effective....10mg BID or 15mg BID both are better then 20mg or 30mg a day.Also be sure to take them at 8am and 12pm-4 hours apart...You should be sleeping fine by night time -Ambien should never be needed and if it is your dosage needs to be decreased...

Feeling of nausea pretty consistent-loved the weight loss. My heart felt like it was going to beat right out of my body! I stopped for that reason. maybe I should have given it more time...maybe I will try it again because at 63, just lost another professional job, made a really dumb mistake and honestly could not remember the correct information....still can't. I take an anti-depressant but it does not help me prioritize or use time productively and effectively.

After the 3rd hour the effect essential begins to drop off completely. 5 hours after taking the drug I was feeling spaced out, and unable to sleep. No appetite whatsoever. Continue to feel the effects wearing off for the next 5 hours until eventually it had worn off enough to sleep. Waking up the next morning was especially difficult, and I noticed the day after I felt more fatigued and irritable than normal.

I have mood swings, but was just diagnosed as being bi polar along with the Add, so I don't know if the mood swings has anything to do with the adderall, On the other hand, it does make me concentrate a lot better! I get good grades and it makes me feel happy. But at I don't like to take it everyday because of how it makes me feel physically. I just got prescribed a new ADD medicine,  concerta, hopefully that works better!

I have 10mg but only take half a pill in the morning and half in the evening. Can I function on it? YES! Can I function without it YES! BUT it helps with my mental clarity and focus, moody? yes but who isnt, dont freak out on any medication. Eating right and rountine exercise will balance you out. Good luck.

I had been living in utter chaos for my entire life until I began taking this drug. I had to deal with two very suspicious and discriminating doctors who were ideologically opposed to the notion of ADD! My current doctor is very supportive of the meds transformative effects, and monitors my progress very carefully. I have to go in for check ups every two months. I have been on the med for 3 years. The first year, 10mg once a day was effective, now 10mg twice a day OR 20 in the morning is what I take. The negatives are...muscle soreness, dry mouth and terrible breath, and excessive sweating. I try to go one day a week with out taking it, and it is truly a holiday- relaxing and mellow. **CAUTIONARY TALE** my husband came to abuse this drug in the last 3 years and wound up in a 12step program (thank goodness...) BUT he also has a history of drug abuse and recovery. I hide my script in the house now.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	4/19/2010 11:48:34 PM	I am 24 years old and have always struggled with the typical characteristics of ADD.  I cut class in highschool,cheated my way through, did everything last minute, and really missed out on my education.  I started taking adderrall in college and went from a 2.6GPA to a 3.8 in one semester.  I have been on and off the 30mgXR ever since then.  After a 6month hiatus from adderall i am now taking the non XR 20mg (pill and a half a day).  I have a love/hate relationship with this medication without a doubt.  Ive only been on it for 3 months and i have built up a tolerance.  I dont want to take more than 30mg a day because its unhealthy and only going to continue to build higher;however i am simply not getting the same effects.  I used to get a rush of euphoria,where i loved everything,everyone, and had thousands of aspirations--short and long term, i could do Anything for extended periods of time--including studying physics (ugh) for 6 hours straight......now that happyfeeling lasts maybe 45 minutes and i still have to work at reading.  i dont have the motivation to paint like i used to,go to the gym, or leave my house. Honestly all i ever do anymore is organize/clean my house and study for a couple hours.  But by 7pm i am completely wiped out, listless, detatched, irritable, edgy, apathetic, social anxiety ect.  I used to drink alcohol socially,now i drink atleast a glass of wine a day to cope with the irritability. AFter reading this,one may wonder why i wouldnt get off.....its because im addicted.  i may only have 4-5 hours of productivity and studying  (i have board exams to take) a day--but thats more than id ever get done without it.  When i wake up in the morning i feel great, for about an hour, then i get so tired i almost cant make it to the adderral bottle to get my 1st dose.  i cant imagine life without it, however its depleting my social life and increasing my risk of cardiovascular problems. I dont know what to do anymore!

Other	paintedacres, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	4/14/2010 6:30:17 AM	I found out that I was ADD almost two years ago. I never figured in a million years that I was until she described my issues to a (T). I agreed to start taking this drug and in the beginning it was a shocker. I was so amazed how alert and focused I was and wished I would have had this throughout school. I did well in school due to getting beat if I didn't but I could have done a lot better and at least been able to retain the information. As an adult I have found it very hard to keep my impusliveness under control. I have issues with spending. I am not a shopaholic but I buy for other people when I know I shouldn't and I over eat very badly even when I am stuffed. I can't control it. It eats at me until I almost have a panic attack. When I buy things it is always for other people not myself. This drug has helped somewhat with that. It at least makes me think about it first. But while I am doing better with it, it still is not cured. I still struggle with the eating and the buying everyday. At first it helped with the eating quite a bit. Now after a year or so the effect has worn off and I tend to eat more than I did however not as much as it was before. My doctor says that you dont get used to the drug and need to take more. You only do if you misuse it. Well I have not misused and I can tell you it doesn't work like it did and I find myself needing to take 3 to 4 10mg pills (fast acting) when before and even now my script says to take 2. I am scared to go off the med since it is helping in my job and keeping me on track but I am scared to keep on with it and get to where I am abusing. I don't think I ever will however I am getting used to it. I am also scared to take other meds for add since a few times I have changed scripts for depression and it has messed me up.

I can really tell a difference since Ive been taking this medicine. I work at a hospital and Im a student in college. I can concentrate alot better at work and school when I take it as opposed to not taking it. I went from Failing algebra to highest in class so that should amount for something! I have tried the adderall XR and didnt like it as good. It didnt hold me thru out the day and my doctor had to prescribe me the regular adderall to take after 5p. Soo I just told him I would go ahead and take regular adderall three times a day. What made me change is I didnt like have to take it constantly through out the day. I also didnt like the way it makes me feel when its getting out my system,real sluggish. I know when I get to feeling like that to take another one up to three a day.

My wife is glad it has been prescribed for me and is able to notice the change. Will start and complete projects. Even have learned to play Bridge, try that without being able to concentrate and focus. Prior to prescription I would procrastenate and/or not complete projects without a struggle. Retired early due to feeling overwhelmed by employment responsibilities.  Although most would say I have been a modest success, I always found it difficult to work, most routine daily activeties and just getting along.  Wish this medication had been prescribed for me many years sooner. My prescription: 20mg twice daily. I usually only take 10mg twice daily (sometimes full dosage if I have to be up late in a social setting - weddings, going out with friends, etc.) and I try to skip dose for two days in a row each week. This seems to allow the medication to work better when I take it and may prevent having to increase future dosages. Side effects minimal for me.  I still eat but sometimes not as much - no great weight loss, about 5-8 pounds. Will go to sleep but may wake up during the night but am also able to get up and get moving in the morning.  I am still able to take a short snooze in the afternoon, which I like to do. A great medication for me but I see others have not always had the same success. My suggestion, try a smaller dose a couple of times a day and take a break from it once in a while. Ask your MD.  Good Luck.  PS:  I had been prescribed Paxil for about 10 years. This was only moderately successful for me and I was glad when I stopped it, which did have a couple of withdrawl symptoms for me. Never would consider it again.  Should have tried Adderall from the start.

Slowly titrated, a gradual marked improvement in every catagory-and some not mentioned above. Within &lt; 1 Yr. truly remarkable effectivness beyond expectation. Even after seven Yrs. improvement continues-and personnally, for me at least, the increments of highly complex retention is-even many fold. Today- myself, unrelenting. Well tolerated, Adderall increased the cumulative component of technical and organizational skills. NO boundries in relation to unrestricted FURTHUR clinical cognitive retentive upswing-NO decline-only MORE and better results to report to this day. The titration of tailored tid dosing most amenable to tapering, titration as needed PRN. Occational drug holidays not reflective of lost productivity or ANY inclination to increase the dose on my own initiative. Not 'habit-forming' if taken as a regimen of maintanance properly taken as directed. Note: most psychiatrists/neurologists wish the Pt's would adhere to the Dr's dosage in respect to adherance of completion of the total daily amount. Most report underuse as the only negative regimen adherance (via Adderall Pt.) by dispensing practictioner.

DONT EVER USE IT! I was on it for 6 years and became highly addicted to it, all i wanted was more and more. It made me very angry at everyone and extremely emotional, my boyfriend at the time was also on it and he became highly addicted to and was so violent he beat me. Also i wouldnt sleep for days at a time and started picking at my face all the time to the point of where i had sores. And another strange side effect which will sond crazy but it made me CRAVE cigarrettes, i chain smoked the whole time i was on it. As soon as i got off it i instantly quit smoking. It took about 3 months to completely stop thinking about adderall. And now 3 years later i cannot remember hardly anything from the past 6 years, i was a zombie and didnt realize it. PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS.... PLEASE

It seemed like the effect wore off quickly, and I was often jittery sometimes to the point of feeling like I was having a heart attack.  Also, ADDers often have a problem with forgetfulness.  About 50% of the time I either forgot to take my afternoon dose, or when I did remember, I found that I had forgotten to bring my medication with me. About year and a half ago I switched to Adderall RX Oral.  What a difference! That drug has greatly improved the quality of my life. Sometimes I forget I even have ADD. Recently my prescription drug plan changed its rules so that they will cover the regular Adderall for $10, but instead of charging $10 as they had before now charge $265 for the RX.  RX is great. All I can say about the regular Adderall is that is better than nothing, but not by much. Please note that both drugs are generic.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	7-12 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	7-12	2/17/2010 1:54:14 PM	My son is in 4th grade &amp; had extreme difficulties at school such as focus,comprehension,accumulating info, disorganized,not being able to finish the work in class, math, etc. He was also diagnosed a couple of years ago with DAMP. He was on Ritalin for a couple of months 2 yrs ago &amp; stopped since we did not see any improvement. we were at the point of desperation &amp; had enough frustrations &amp; so did he!Therefore eventhough I was very much against drugs we decided that he needs help so let's give it another try! His dr. prescribed Adderall 10mg/day in the AM before breakfast- a miracle has been brought upon my son &amp; our family!! it works wonderful, amazing! the only side affects that I noticed are the loss of appetite (which I am not too upset over since he is about 6 lbs. overweight &amp; noticed that he is hungry in AM, so I give him a healthy breakfast) and sensitivity (he easily cries if someone gets him upset).Other than that there have been no other side affects. we are all extremely happy to see him do extremely well at school. He was never hyper, but had some behavior problems - even that has changed for the better.  He interacts &amp; socialized better w/friends. Prior to this med his grades were Cs and Ds; ever since he started on Adderall the test results are amazing; A's in social studies and B+ in math!!  Not only that it makes everyone happy (his family as well as teachers)that he's doing so well but he is very well aware of it &amp; I can see the happiness that he did not have before when he comes home with good grades &amp; ease at learning!! He has built confidence &amp; holds his head up high!! Thank you Dr. Weidner!!!...&amp; of course Adderall!  I shall return &amp; review this med in a couple of month &amp; let everyone know if he's still doing just as well and/or if the side affects have changed!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	a3gill, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	2/13/2010 11:11:15 PM	Adderall has been a lifesaver. I took Ritalin as a kid and developed some nervous ticks. So, I dropped it, and tried to manage without. I did fine until college reading emerged.I have a ridiculously high dosage, but it works great for me, other than nasty looks that I get from Pharmacists thinking that I am a dealer.(that buys inventory with insurance...LOL) My dosage is steady now, but for about the first year, it was increased each month. Thats probably just me though, my body doesnt respond well to medicine.Reading comprehension has always been my biggest hurdle, non-technical reading is virtually impossible for me. Just below reading is hanging-in with poor lecturers. I need to have genuine interest in something or my mind will promptly begin to wander. If a teacher shows the end goal and it appears interesting, then the uninteresting stepping stones become interesting, because they are required to get to the concept that you want to know. Conversely, if a teacher presents each building block as something to know, &quot;because I said so,&quot; then I will be staring out the window before they finish their sentence.Since arriving at the correct dosage, I can now do anything that I want. Not only are my problem areas fixed, but other aspects have improved as well. The best way that I can describe it is having a librarian roaming around in your brain. My capacity for learning has gone off the charts, my memory retention and recollection is ridiculous, and the boost of energy really shines though in self-motivation. And, above all, I now spend at least 2-4 hours per day reading anything that I want.To put my improvement in context, I took my ACTs un-medicated. My best score was a 29/36.Hmm, its okay, but look at the pieces:Math: 36/36Science Reasoning: 35/36English: 32/36Reading: 14/36I noticed the benefits most, when I lost them with my insurance for a month.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male		2/2/2010 5:48:44 AM	I've been taking Adderall for about three weeks now and found it very effective in helping me stay focused in my work.  Time flies by extremely fast when taking this drug.  I'm on 20mg twice a day and take my first does at about 12pm and my second at about 6pm right before I go to work.  I am very careful not to increase my dose and use only the recommended amount prescribed by my doctor. I've been able to eat and sleep pretty much the same on this drug although my appetite has decrease somewhat and I've lost weight due to being able to focus more on the healthy things to eat as opposed to not eating at all. Excercise is much more easier to stick with and finish.

I have had GREAT difficulty with severe fatigue and ADD for years, and could not seem to work my way out of it. I tried to put systems into place, but I was never able to keep them going so they could work for ANY amount of time.   NOW I can FINALLY complete tasks in a timely fashion, organize and order my work and life and enjoy relationships, both personal and professional, as well as attend to details.  I am also able to resist the urge to hoard.  My life was chaotic with crap everywhere, piles and junk all over the place and disorganized messes abounding and overtaking me and my family.  The ability to function with a clear head and focus has completely changed ALL of that.  Thank the LORD I had a clinician who properly identified and prescriptively managed my SERIOUS problem of ADD with 10 mg of Adderall, twice a day.  I have been stable for over two years now.  The change is dramatic. Definitely life changing.

It calms me and allows me to focus and not be overwhelmed with regular tasks like housekeeping and managing my finances. I don't feel that I'm unable to do what I need and want to do. I understand my behaviors of unfinished school work, disorganization of my school work and notebooks, putting things off and most notable to me, my problems with math, in that I would simply miss or not &quot;see&quot; parts of problems, even when I understood a process of doing a problem.

Before being started on adderall, I found it difficult if not impossible to stay focused on most tasks, especially if the task was not something that i was interested in doing. With the medication however, I find it much easier to keep my mind on topic, allowing me to utilize my time and energy with much more efficiency and efficacy. My biggest complaint with adderall has been its effect on sleep. However, I found that if I take my last dose at least 9 hours before I intend to sleep it causes little to no problem.

Not only is this medication helping me get things done around the house and in school, it gives me the energy and motivation I need to get out of bed and take on the day.

But while in college they threw it on me. Well I didn't know what a powerful addictive drug this was for someone who literally doesn't have typical add. Although when I take the quizzes I meet all the requiremnts except childhood was perfect. I now am trying to get off them and I must admit it is hard. I feel lethargic. But I am now starting Oriental medicine/Acupunture and it is helping with so many of my medical problems it's amazing. I get prescribed the adderoll by my psych but believe deep down I don't need it and am going to have to try my hardest to get off it. Get a 2nd opinion b4 you start on such a addictive med IMO

He's doing so much better in school and is far more motivated than in the past.  I know it's early, but his teacher and I are very excited about his improvements.  After reading some of the other reviews and speaking with his doctor.  I have decided to NOT give it to him on the weekends and during school vacations.  Side effects have been less sleeping and no real appetite while he's at school.  He does however eat well in the evenings.

I have just started this medication. I have already experienced nausea, it was bad this morning and I couldn't even eat and didn't even feel like I could swallow. I almost vomitted and the feeling was awful. I had eaten about 6 hours earlier and hadn't had any of the drug in about 12 hours. I've had headaches and the jitters. They say this will pass. I'm trying to keep hydrated and take my vitamins. I'm only on the 5mg dose and have to bump up to the 10mg dose after 15 days, and I'm worried about further side effects. I know there are ADD drugs that are non-narcotic and plan to ask my psychiatrist about that option. On a good note it has begun to control my irritability and my impulsiveness (I'm known to intetrrupt and not be able to wait my turn to speak or not filter my thoughts and just blurt out thoughts) I do not have ADHD, I believe I have simple ADD and it runs in the family. Luckily my daughter doesn't seem to have many symptoms and does well in school. I just hope that the increase in dose does not give me too many side effects and I am worried that my tabacco use may increase my chance of a cardiac event. I do not like the feeling of my heart racing. I'm also taking an SSRI and worried about those side effects, my MD is aware. I'm just worried in general.

They instead sent me to a private school with smaller classes and kept having me tested throughout my school years and kept getting the same answers. I would not pay attention in class and was very disruptive. They would yelled at me after meetings with my teachers and ground me. It was not my fault. As I matured I was able to graduate from college but I had a very hard time focusing. I have been on Adderol and Vivanse for about a year now and I cant believe my parents put me through a miserable childhood when I could have been much more &quot;normal&quot; and been able to focus with the medication. I have not experienced any bad side effects from either meds and I am much more happy and less stressed.

Doesn't make him tired anymore, instead it was like hearing and watching a robot:  over and over repeating things like, &quot;You hate me.....you hate me....you hate me...you don't like me...you don't like me...you want to throw me in the dumpster...&quot;  Over and over for like an hour.  We see his doctor tomorrow, but I'm not giving him this stupid pill, I'm not about to go thru that again!  That was awful!  It was not my child, it was like someone else crawled inside him and was saying these awful things.  Then I made him take a nap, and he was back to himself.  Very sweet and apologizing like crazy, and playing with Thomas trains.  He's good in school regardless whether he's on meds or not.  This is our first experience with meds.  But home is like being in prison, he's a completely different child (without the meds, too).  I've been reading on others, and I&quot;m confused.  I'm afraid to give him something else, what if the behavior's worse?  I'm worried about having some serious aggressive behavior with time. Then I suffer depression and anxiety on top of all this.  We're both in therapy, but toy therapy is not the answer!  I don't know what to expect, I'm afraif for my child.

It did its job and my grades shot up, but i was not myself at all! i was really really quiet and really shy (i'm extremely outgoing and always the life of the party so this was really really weird!) and another thing i didn't like about it was that i gained weight. Not to mention since Adderall is well known with people my age everyone was begging me to sell it once midterms and final exams came around. I mean i know other people who it's worked for, but it just wasn't for me.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	NikiM1973, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/7/2009 6:31:11 PM	Since taking Adderall I consistently do the right things at the right time. Before Adderall I struggled with moments of genius followed by days of a mixture of procrastination and chaos. With Adderall my focusing abilities are quite amazing. I have to actually be careful to not over-focus. I can honestly get so hooked on the details of a particular work project that I find myself working for 12+ hours without much of a break. So with that said I should probably urge everyone to try to maintain a life of balance. I've always been good at what I do, but now I can do more with less. I eat less. I sleep less. I waste time less. I make mistakes less. I'm more patient. I'm overall much happier. Am I addicted to it? Yes. When I don't take it I'm an even bigger disaster than before. If I don't take it I could stay in bed all day and stare at the TV. For me, the Adderall PROS outweight the CONS. If you are a distracted mess with piles of papers, a racing mind, and an inability to put first things first then I suggest you talk with your doctor about trying a low dose for starters. I've been taking Adderall for about 4 years and I take 40 mg daily, in the form of two (2) 20mg tablets. I do not like the XR (extended release) formulation of any medication, so it is not specific to Adderall.

After trying so many of the 'popular' drugs, my psych. decided that we should try Adderall -I was a little unnerved about the drug after reading all of the negative things about it online but decided that, as a last resort, I'd give it a try.I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER! This month is my 15th on the drug, and I've only noticed minor, appetite related side effects. [Perhaps it's because I am on a lower dose (20mg every morning and one 10mg at noon)?] Over all, I've noticed my focus is so much better, along with my ability to finish the things I start. My mind isn't going, going, going all the time, and I was finally able to get a job, and go back to school!  I understand the concern with younger children taking this medication, however, everyone reacts differently to different things, and if there were any natural alternative that would work, I'd be the first one on it. [I had tried going off of it and went right back to not being able to sit still for more than 15mins.] From my experience with Adderall, I've realised that sometimes, some perscriptions are necessary to lead a normal, quiet life.I know that the results aren't the same for everyone on it, but I did want to share a positive outcome :D

Other	ADDgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/4/2009 4:19:36 PM	I have ADD and probably have been since a least a pre-teen[self-diagnosis] but haven't been professionally diagnosed until 3 months ago at age 33.  I am currently on 25mg of Adderall, 1 pill daily in AM.  The 10mg &amp; 20mg did nothing for me in terms of concentration but I am noticing better results with the 25mg, though I think it needs to be upped.  Only one time I was up 32 straight hours but that was partially due to having to be in school that night as well as the first increase from 20mg - 25mg. I had problems sleeping before taking this drug and I still do, though I CAN sleep through the night. I have experienced weight loss and lack of appetite with sometimes being repulsed by food.  I crave more water now.  This hasn't been a problem since I am obese, and I have lost almost 20 lbs in 3 months.  I no longer crave a lot of junk foods and eat more healthy since snacking isn't as frequent.  My job tasks and school work have greatly improved!  I wish my mom wouldn't have just told me to apply myself better in school and actually had me evaluated.  I don't feel like a failure anymore with this new outlook and I am finally at peace knowing about this &quot;disability&quot;.

I took it for less than a week and felt jitterty. I opted to not take it on the weekends and on Saturday I could not get out of bed.  I thought to myself that if I took an adderol I would have the energy to get up that is when I knew I had to stop.  I have no desire to develop any kind of an addiction.

We saw very little improvement even when the doses were upped. Then they both got side effects, one was doing strange things with his mouth and the other was constantly picking his head(his teacher sent him to the nurse to check for lice cuz it got so bad) Last Monday the dr. switched to adderall xr 10mg the one who was having the mouth movements has improved alot! The other one stopped picking his head but started something new. He's CONSTANTY sniffling. He says he feels like he has no control of it. He's going to the dr. on Thursday so I hope we find something that works!!

This drug is insanely addictive and thats what I hate about it. Sure it works, makes you focus, you can go without sleep easier then others, it makes you lose weight (i myself lost 55 pounds), and it makes you more sociable with others. But the price you pay is that you become dependent on it. Why would you want a drug to do all the work for you? It's going to cause health problems, most likely cardiac, if not now, in the future. You'll have to stay on it forever (my doctor literally said that i would have to take it forever, im not kidding), and if you find it in yourself to quit, you'll hate the world when you go off of it. i tried to quit 4 years ago, got off of it for a year, and i couldn't take it, i had to get back on it. In my eyes, people do cocaine or meth for reasons similar to adderall. They need to stay up and get things done, feel happy, and they are addicted. Don't get on it. Learn to focus the old fashioned way. Because you'll still get that diploma, or certification, or acheive happiness and at the end of it all, you wont feel like you cheated or owe it all to adderall, you'll just be proud of yourself and have no dependencies. Thats soo much better and I really wish my parents would have just given me that option. Oh and one more thing, females have to get off of it when you get pregnant and thats scary to go through withdrawls and then go and be pregnant. I just had an early miscarriage... dont know that it has to do with this drug, but i dont know that it doesn't..

I hve not experienced the physiologic side effects, but i do notice i am not eating as much, but probably because I am not as bored so often.  I do believe that it has helped me quit smoking.   Immediately after begining this medication, I went from smoking almost a pack a day to two, just purely out of habit.  It keeps me so focused, I am not looking for any chance I can get to take a break.   The only undesirabe effect I have had is trouble sleeping.   I went from sleeping 10 hours a night to about 4 in a matter of two weeks.  This really has been a miracle drug, and I wish I would have been prescribed this when I was in high school and college.   It makes me kind of wonder what I would have really been able to acheive.

Work was easy, life was easy. After second month started having trouble sleeping. Eventually became an INSOMNIAC. I probably only slept around 4 hours a day. The medication also cause my skin to dry up. My scalp became itchy all the time and caused dandruff. My penis also became smaller and the skin around the head became dry and irratated. The medication caused my sex drive to decrease. Sex became painful and I felt a burning sensation upon ejaculation. I experienced severe cotton mouth as well. I stopped taking the medication and my appetite soon came back. The medication was addictive and when i got off of it, life was extremely difficult at first. I was tired ALL the time. I felt extreme exhaustion for the first week. My advice, stick to coffee and learn to pay attention.

I have suffered my whole life with ADHD/ADD.  I never knew or understood why I behaived the way I did, until my son showed the same symptoms and was diagnosed.  I asked my doctor about my symptoms and he recommended a low 20mg a day dosage.  I did not sleep for 3 days, I thought my heart would burst, but in three days, I read 4 books, all 400+ pages.At work, my productivity increased instantly. Instead of looking for the door, and at the clock, &quot;bouncing off the walls&quot; as my co-workers would tell me, I was focused, task orriented, and results driven.  My district VP, who I have known for over 10 years, even called and asked me, why my team is doing so well.  I have been on this drug for 6 months now, and it has helped me to change my life! I have my blood pressure checked regularly, I excercise more, because I can focus and not get bored out of my mind in 3 minutes, I eat better, because I can read labels and know what it is I am eating, because my mind is not changing thoughts every 2 seconds and I forget what the HELL I was reading to begin with, my wife LOVES ME, because I am focused when she talks to me and I can actually carry a conversation with her, because I can remember what she just said.  And you know what else, I actually sat down and wrote this message in just a few minutes.  I did not even get up, or even think about anything else, I did not have to stretch, scratch, move, fidget, adjust, look around, yawn, cough, or ANYTHING, because this drug helped me. I thanked my doctor, and I cried when I did, because I have awakened, my mind does not race, and after 38 years of life, my mind is clear.

I have been on adderall for 6 months 15 mg twice a day. Bad thing is that after 3-4 hours I'm so tired and need to drink anything to pickj me up. I do not like the XR as it makes me too jumpy in the first 2 hours. I plan to increase my dosage but dread the side affects. Overall, this drug is addicting, helps with add and weight loss but I wish there were something safer.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	10/1/2009 9:31:07 AM	I am 38 yr old mother of two. My experience is the time release(XR) is the best form the non time release feels like you are on a roller coaster.  The time release is very smooth.  Although I started on 20mg I believe after 5 years on this and now down to 5mg a day this is a very hard drug on my body as a women.  I have two best friends on it and although we love the weight it keeps off and how organized we think we are on it we all believe there is a dark side to this drug that no one talks about. Everyone seems OK in our lives except our husbands.  There is an edgy/anger piece that goes along with this drug..  I think it effects our hormones in some way.  My suggestion is start on a lower dose and move up but I am looking for more natural choices because I think this drug makes life go by very quickly.  I also think as a women you can not help but get addicted to the way you burn more calories and it automaticly suppresses your appetite.  If you are on this and are having relationship problems then you might want to look at this drug as a reason and not other outside things. Also I think if you take the wrong dose it can actually make it harder to complete some things. This drug is in the same family as Meth amphedemines.  If you take this drug you should really think about the similarities to being a junkie!! I stopped taking it for 6 months and gained 30 pounds and I started sleeping a lot and my house became a disaster.  There is probably something better out there, but I have not found it.

Unfortunately, I became HIGHLY ADDICTED to this medication. I am 21 and a university student and have been on adderall since i was 19. In just two years i developed a 100mg+ habit per day, ended up literally going crazy, cutting, attempting suicide, committed to a psychiatric hospital, and then drug and alcohol rehab. Since I kicked adderall, I have been just fine. Kids won't tell you anything is wrong, because it makes them feel so good they want it more. It severely disrupts eating habits (I lost 35lbs, and as a 5'2&quot; female, that's a lot), sleeping habits, and overall mood. I also found a sharp decline in imagination and overall creativity. Irritability, dehydration, diarrhea, malnutrition, anemia, and withdrawals were part of my adderall use that was prescribed by a psychiatrist for ADHD. PLEASE, if you are a parent wondering if your kid should be on adderall (which is an amphetamine salt, which is the single purest form of SPEED), think again. Is it worth it in the long run? It is SPEED that you're messing with here- incredibly serious drug. There are many many more behavioral modifications that can be taught that are much more effective, and MUCH MUCH less detrimental to overall mental and physical health. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am faced with the daily decision of taking it and being able to focus but risk getting the debilitating headache or not taking it and being completely clueless about what my professor just said.  I have begun taking nsaids on a regular basis to counter the headaches.  If I were to decribe the headache it is a sinus like pain that starts around my eyes and is usually limited to one side of my head.  The length of time I have been taking it could be a factor but a headache is listed as a side-effect.

First memories I can recall is around 5 years of age. I did not get it officially diagnosed until I was 50 years old.  I knew the stigma of Narcolepsy would interfere with job searching. I am now on a base prescription of adderall and adderall XR combination at 160mg per day. At times the ranges may go as far up to 240mg or down to only several.  All is depended on the days requirements.  I also try to take 1-2 days of Adderall free days to lessen the problem of drug tolerance.  The adderall still at the high dose performs very poorly in managing my microsleeps. I am also on Xyrem treatments for the last 5 months.  Xyrem is not working very well.  I have been diagnosed as a right clinical context narcolepsy.  I unfortunately am one of the exceptions to the effectiveness of amphetamines and the like. Even from the beginning, the amphetamines have had little effect on my body. History:  I was never a drug user and I never liked to drink alcohol. I still don't drink or use recreational drugs.  Never had any of the 'so called side effects' that amphetamines can give someone at the higher dose. In the past I have had provigil and ritlan with no effective treatment. If the above appears to be disassociated, I had more than several microsleep episodes trying to get this written.

The high from those two drugs combined is a whole new ball game. First of all Docs know nothing but to see you on your appointment and then get rid of you. If they payed any attention they would know that a person with a history of drug or alcohol abuse should not take adderall or adderall xr. But then again they keep us coming back for business. So, would that make them a legal drug dealer. Yes, it would. I had a chemical dependency to perscription painkillers. I realized something was really bad when I was taking them just to be able to function from day to day. I sought help because things were all jacked up. If I could make a difference in someone's life just by writing this little piece then all the pain I caused myself and everyone around me, then I would have to say it was worth it. If you have a chemical dependency the first thing you do is decide weather or not you want to continue that way of life, which is extremely painful. Second, commit to yourself in getting well. You will need a really good support system to help you through it. With hard work and dedication to yourself you will succeed. If you follow those three rules you will get through it with out a dought. If I had to go through it again I would have gone to the psychiatrist to get on suboxone so I could wing myself through it. I was on suboxone for one year exactly. If I would have just listened to my brother and not got on the suboxone I would have gotten over the emotional withdrawl after about 5 to 7 days. The physical withdrawls(tiredness,unmotivated)would eventually pass around three to four weeks. So, you could get through it in a months time verses getting on suboxone and wasting a year of your life.

I struggled all through out my 6 years of college and now at 26, moving into the ranks of working for myself and taking on several projects, I could really use some help. My buddy gave me some adderall and I probably got more work done in 2 weeks than my 6 years of college- mainly because I neither ate nor slept for days at time. I also found that I was able to pop these like skittles with frightening ease. I couldn't see taking this medication daily as I wouldn't risk my physical and psychological well-being for any amount of work or money. I believe this should be used as a last resort. One thing I have learned is to observe my work habits while on adderall vs. when I'm not and try to mimic those behaviors daily. This drug is certainly a tool for success but I feel that it shouldn't be used as a way of living.

But currently, my dosage has been increased to 30 mg each morning, with the option to take another 10 to 20 mg later on in the day during long work days. I have an ADHD sufferer's worst nightmare for a job: I'm mostly a paper-pusher/interviewer. I'm a social worker for a corrections department. I have piles of paperwork everyday. I also teach decision-making and social skills classes, which also require a lot of planning and organization. I had been able to negotiate with and compensate for my ADHD all through grade schools, high school, and college. However, my condition became dibillitating at my first &quot;career&quot; job with the massive amounts of paperwork and organization I was expected to perform. I'm in my early 20s and began treatment for ADHD at the beginning of August. I feel that the medication has helped me immensely. My family, fiance, and coworkers have all noticed the change in my work habits and all-around behavior. I'm quieter, more focused, and less apt to &quot;fly off the handle&quot; for minor things that don't seem to make much sense to anyone else. I'm pretty satisfied overall with my results. That said, I do experience some side effects. I have had pretty significant loss of appetite as well as weight loss. But for me, its not a major issue at the moment as I was already considered somewhat overweight by my doctor when I started the medication. If I continue to lose at this rate, I suppose it could become a problem. I also experience dry mouth pretty badly. I sometimes get it so bad that my whole mouth feels &quot;fuzzy.&quot; But luckily, I'm allowed to keep a drink on my desk at work :) Also, I occasionally experience headaches that I believe are related to the medication. But these aren't very often. All in all, there's some drawbacks/side effects, but the benefits far outweight them.

Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day	Namebadgerequired, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	9/2/2009 12:57:49 AM	I was diagnosed with ADD at age 41, and prescribed 20mg 1x/day. It helped a little but not enough to cause me to really follow a treatment track with enthusiasm...typical ADD. Anyway, I am now 46; I have had 4 different employers in that time, plenty of stress, depression, anxiety, low self esteem, etc. Three years ago, I had the double sleep study which revealed that I have narcolepsy. So now, my sleep specialist has me taking 30mg XR in the morning, and Adderall tabs of 20mg at 9am/noon/3pm for a total of 90mg/day. I have gone through highs and lows with this drug - more highs than lows. I think that the biggest drag in this whole process is that Adderall is just a daytime life support system for my exhaustion; it does enable me to focus, hustle, retain instructions, etc. But - I still have an incurable sleep disorder which never allows me to get restorative sleep. I am definitely addicted to Adderall; I get anxious when my doctor goes on vacation because he has done it in the past, without notice! Needless to say, I am changing doctors. Finally, I can relate to people that complain about the zombie effect. I have a great ability to entertain my family and friends with my humor, and sometimes it will just disappear for days. My new doctor said that he is worried about my heart; I told him that I am at peace with &quot;death by heart attack&quot;. He was not amused. I wasn't trying to be funny, just pragmatic. I need my Adderall and I think it works great for the right patient.

I got pregnant at 17 and was taken off all my meds. The doc told me that I would outgrow the ADD and probably wouldn't need to be put back on it after I had the baby. After a long 5 year struggle with the same problems I had as a child, my dr. decided to try me on straterra. I tryed it for 4 weeks as he suggested, and the only thing it did for me was drain my bank account. We tried several diffrent drugs, including the same one I took during childhood/adolesence without finding one that provided desired results. I was about to give up hope when the doctor decided to try adderall. A God send! I am now able to think clearly, something I haven't done in a while. I can concentrate, focus, and stay on task now. It helped me to be able to stay organized, and helped the constant aggrivation I suffered with. Thanks to this wonderful drug I no longer feel as if I am at war with my thoughts, I finally have some much needed relief from my mind.

My teachers have actually came up to me and asked if I  was the same person who was in their clas a week ago.  It has helped me get through fourth through sixth grade.  The only problem I have is that it made me want to do evreything at once and that really stressed me out.  I got mild depression becuase of that and I'm now taking an antidepressant AND Adderall.  It's kind of hard to remember to take both the drugs and I somtimes miss a few day on one or both of the drugs.  This drug worked on me but please find out exactly what it does to you before making a comitment to taking it.  Ask your doctor if you can start on the lowest dosage possible and graduly work your way up untill you find a dosage right for you.  Like any other medication it is a hit or miss and you should stop taking it if it worsens your condition or if you have side effects lasting longer than two weeks.  I hope my information helped!

I've tried Ritalin which made me feel nervous but after continued dosage increase did not help with focus &amp; attention, and Wellbutrin which helped with focus &amp; attention but had other intolerable side effects with increaded dosage.  Finally Adderall has helped with focus, fidgeting, increased attention, no problems with procrastination, I can patiently listen to others, and experience less anxiety.  I had had some loss of appetite , agitation, and stomach upset with an additional 10mg in the afternoon (so I'm back to just 10mg in the morning), but have had no loss of libido. I'm actually on the amphetamine salts, the generic, because of insurance coverage issues.  This medication has been very helpful to me.    
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	TheDoc, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	8/4/2009 1:09:43 PM	As a Doctor myself, I have to stress that when it comes to Adderall in either the XR or IR forms, there is no grey area. There are those patients who do extremely well on this medication and others who were perhaps misdiagnosed or physiologically intolerant of the chemical makeup of the drug. The bottom line is: If you need it, it can work wonders. However, if you're one of those who doesn't truly suffer from ADD ADHD-Hyp, then you may gain some benefits, but you will also have more incidence of negative side-effects. My personal experience with the IR has been wonderful. Most everyone has the associated loss of appetite, and general &quot;fidgety&quot; feeling when starting treatment, but these do subside. However, they have a nasty habit of resurfacing later on in treatment. This usually accompanies an increase in dosage, but can pop up for seemingly no reason at all. The best advice I can give regarding treatment with amphet salts is: If you need it, then it can help tremendously. However, if you don't need it, you're better off with those awful energy drinks or a few cups of coffee. Hope this helps.

Our family doctor decided it would help him concentrate in college.  Immediately I noticed that a generally tender-hearted,goodnatured young man became cruel, moody and for lack of a better definition psychotic.  He started abusing alcohol, risky sexual behavior, and would lie about anything.  It was like a alien had taken over my son's body.  It has been a nightmare and I would never encourage any parent to give this drug to their children.  My son has been off of it for about 1 week and right now he is a fragile shell who has suffered with depression, vomiting, headaches etc.  My hope for his once bright future now rests on his ability to overcome an apparent addiction and not to be drawn back down that road.  This is not anything you want to put into your body.  I feel like my only son has been taken from me and I don't know if I will ever get that same bright eyed, enthusiatic young man back.

First I dropped the lithium and took abilify.  The improvement in how I felt (bipolar and side effects was almost instantaneous).  Also I am surprised that your doctor has you on so many meds.  Some of them (nighttime) are duplicates.  My doctor gradually lowered my sleep meds and put me on only Trazadone for sleep.  If I were you I would really consider trying to drop some of the meds and change bipolar and sleep meds.  Hope this helps.  (Abilify works GREAT for me)

Although I have had problems with paying attention, getting started with projects, etc., I was able to get by. The work in school, naturally, has become harder. I have been a B/C student for awhile now. For the last month, I have yet receive any assignment that is less than an A. Menatlly, this drug has helped. Physically, not so much. I have noticed that I am more hyperactive. I am constantly fidgeting with my hands and my legs are shake profusely. Also, my eating habits are terrible. I was at a slim 135 pounds to begin with before I began the medication and I know for a fact that I will have lost weight the next time I see my doctor. One side effect is loss of appetite. This effect is extremly noticeable. For me, I very very rarely feel hungry. Just last week I forgot to eat ANYTHING for two straight days. Overall though, if you are careful and responsible this is an effective and easy-to-use drug. Hopefully, this helps.

I did notice a loss of appetite, and I was able to pay attention a little better, but I dont notice much of a change.  I take 30mg 3 times a day.  I have not found any other person taking that much.  In order for me to take all 3 doses I start at 4:30 am when I get up to go to the gym.  I have the hardest time sleeping at night, which makes me tired the next day.  I am not that happy with this medication, and I want to try something else, but everything else I have tried or am on makes me gain weight.  I also take Celexa, a sugar pill, sleeping pills when needed and I still have the same problems that Istarted with.

It does help me focus. I started taking adderall 6yrs ago in college, cause hated ritalin(doesn't work for me, just gives me insomnia), starting at 10mg and quicly going to 30mg, it's starting to wear off. Time release doesn't work, I'm on 30mg now and the wanted affects wear of after about 3hrs. Then i'm still left with the unwated side affects; like INSOMNIA, drymouth, and nausea. Like I said thou, adderall does work great and does what its ment to do.

I'm overall satisfied with this medication.  I noticed that my mood seems to be more even, I have a better handle on my disorder versus the other medications I've taken, and most of my other symptoms are under control.  I have noticed weight loss but my doctor told me before hand that it would happen. Being that I gained some weight after I stopped my previous medication, I didn't mind that too much.  I have also noticed more dry-mouth than my other medications so I'm drinking a lot more water through the day, but I don't mind that so much as I drink a good amount of water anyway.  One thing that I will have to say is that I keep having to 'readjust.'  My doctor, who I love, started me on an extreme low dose and is working me up to my 'stable' point which has spanned over 8 months now.  Getting to the point of 'stable' is my biggest issue since precautions have to be taken. Due to the nature of this drug, that the risk of addiction is high, my doctor and I are taking it slow.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	6/23/2009 4:11:16 PM	I have been taking adderall 20mg once a day and this drug is very affective in treating my ADHD.  I explained that I have a very hard time concentrating.  Whether face to face conversations, reading, or in meetings it was very difficult to give my undivided attention to someone or a group. Additionally, I have struggled for a long time in school, college especially and thought it was just lack of sleep. However, both of my brothers have ADHD and after talking to my doctor about my condition he recommended adderall 20mg.  I was jittery at first (simular to too much caffine) but now Im getting used to it.  I now do not crash everyday after work and no longer need my afternoon nap.  I also can focus on conversations and remeber things much better.  It enables me to be more productive and I can get much more stuff done than before.  It does curve my appetite too so make sure if you take this med. to eat as you did before.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	13-18	6/17/2009 12:08:11 PM	i am a 16 year old. I started taking adderall at the age of twelve. When i was on the drug it was very effective. It helped me concentrate in school, calmed me down from acting out, and helped prevent me from doing bad things. Although it has done good, it has also done bad. For example, i started losing weight because i never had an appetite, i became more distant with people because i was quiet all the time from focusing on things, and i also became needy of it all the time. I have been off of the pills for about a year now and I'm doing just fine. It is extremely hard to get out of the habit of needing them. It takes time to get out of the habit, but eventually it will work. Trust me.  Adderall can be very addictive and although it can benefit you, it may also destroy you in some ways. So one tip to take into consideration if you want to start taking adderall is to start off at a low dosage and work your way up until you feel it is doing its job.

I was diagnosed with ADD as a child, but I not took the medication.  I am 35 now and am a small business owner.  I was making small, little stupid mistakes that I just easily overlooked.  My Dr. started me off with 30mg twice a day. I have seen these reviews and have yet to see someone taking that much.  I had all of the the effects for about a month and then they all eventually went away.  The drug overall has improved my attention disorder and even made me more productive.  It allowed all of my energy to be creative.  I still use it today at the same dosage but I found it better for me to take 60mg in the morning and let it run its course through the day.  If you do need to take it. Remember that every ones body responds differently to medication.  I suggest to experiment the time gaps in the beginning and see what best responds to your body.  You will become addicted to it after a while, no choice in that, but just use your months supply evenly.  It has been a success and I researched this med.. I accept the cons of this medication, but for me &quot;someone who really needs it&quot; the pros weigh out the cons.  it has made me more productive with my life and for my family responsibilities. If you &quot;REALLY&quot; are not diagnosed by a physician. Please remember that you will get a reverse effect and it will be equivalent to taking cocaine.  But for those who need it it will have a reverse effect and make you more focused and in a clear state of mind, without the million things around you distracting you from your realistic goal.Good Luck and Be Wise! Parents, Be alert of your kid on this if applicable, it is becoming a known street DRUG for abuse. Thanks!

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity		3	1	3			6/8/2009 10:35:36 PM	I am junior in high school and have been taking adderall for 3 years. At first it seemed like a miracle drug. My grades went up considerably and I felt that I had gained a sense of control. I was prescribed 30mg a day including one 20mg pill of adderall xr. The side effects were harsh in the beginning and I lost a lot of weight. The next 2 years I would take it regularly still having the same side effects but very mild. In short, I could go off the pill and feel fine for any amount of time. But I began to feel a sort of dependence on the drug about a year after. The loss of appetite seemed to be a motivation for me to be thin so i started to up my dose a little bit. My grades went from a 3.3 to a 2.7 and so i figured I was immune to the drug so I started to take even more. For the past about 6 months I have regularly been taking at the least 50mg and at most 70mg a day. Sometimes I don't know why I am taking it I just do. I can honestly say in the past week I have slept in total maybe 10-15 hours some nights not sleeping at all. My heart is constantly pounding and my hands are always shaking. I hate it but i can't help it. My parents dont hide my pills or anything and dont keep track of when they get it so it makes it easy for me.I am always very moody and today I had a nutri grain bar and thats it but I dont even feel hungry. I didnt think drugs prescribed to myself could be so addictive but they are. I suggest people not to take them to begin with.

I was started on 20mg of Adderall xr, then went to 25 mg xr, and now I take 25mg xr in the morning around 6am, and then an Adderall IR, 10mg, around noon to one p.m.  I think Adderall works great, the problem I had was that even though it is an XR formulation it seemed to wear off around noonish everyday.  I was never able to get &quot;all day coverage&quot;.  In February my doctor added the 10mg IR &quot;booster&quot; and it has worked great ever since.  He told me that every one's body metabolism is different and some get longer coverage than others.  This is what worked for me.  I was worried about sleep issues being on this dose, the amazing thing is I actually feel like I sleep better since being on this medication.  When I lay down to go to sleep I don't have a million and one things floating through my head like I use to.  It's like the background &quot;white noise&quot; is gone.  My thoughts are so much clearer now and I can actually get things accomplished instead of 20 things half accomplished.  It's too bad people abuse this drug, it's makes it more difficult for people who use it for legitimate medical purposes to get it.  All of my other medications I can get a 90 day supply in the mail.  With Adderall I have to go to my doctors office every month and pick up my prescription in person.  Other than that absolutely no complaints.  Good luck to all.

The medication works well for him, I have been keeping in touch with his teacher, and she said that he does well in class. The only thing I don't like about adderall is that you don't sleep well, and don't want to eat. And my Grandson went from 49.9 lbs. back to 44 lbs. He is small,9 years of age, and only 49,9&quot; tall, but that is still too much weight for him to lose. It is very hard forme to get him to eat, he rather go without.Thank you sh

I am one of them I didnt like the idea of it at all but the doctor told me it would be better for my son.  He was on it for 2 weeks and I will never put my child back on this medicine I will deal with his ADHD another way.  This medication made him withdraw from his friends in school, he didnt want to play outside,  he was hillucinating and he actually was a completely different child.  Please if you have a child who has ADHD please watch while your child is on this medication.  
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/22/2009 1:45:49 PM	I began taking Adderall 10mg three months ago once or twice a day.  I work full time and am in graduate school.  I also train significantly (20+ hours weekly) for 10K races and triathlons.  So to put it lightly, I am a busy bee.  Adderall has allowed me to focus on one task at a time, improve my work projects, write papers, and train harder.  With regards to side effects, I do have a significantly lowered appetite and can experience issues falling asleep at night if I take a second dose after about 3:00 in the afternoon.  I also would consider going up to 15mg twice daily in the next couple months, so I feel that the drug builds a tolerance quite quickly.Adderall has changed my outlook on daily life.  It has improved my focus.  I finally feel excited about my life and living it!

I've taken adderral for a few years now and it has been a tremendous study and work aid.  Those who take it must be careful due to the outright strength of this stuff.  For about a year I would say that I was addicted to adderral.  I would take too much, too often and get more from friends when I ran out.  During this time I had extreme mood swings, anxiety, loss of sexual interest ability, etc.  Plain and simple I was not myself at all.  I lost weight and I felt as if my personality changed.  After realizing the dilema I stopped taking it for a bit and got healthy.  Now I take the recommended dosage on the prescibed schedule.  It is effective and since I am aware of the side effects I make sure that I am eating right, sleeping enough, etc.  All and all it is an effective drug however those taking it should be very mindful of the possible downside.  Finally, I do not like most children should take this drug, and none should do so in high doses.  If children cannot do anything without the aid of medication, then they will be dependant on this stuff their whole like.  I still function and get work done in a demanding job with or without adderall.

I've always thought that I had minor ADD. I tried Adderall and I had a great experience. I felt focused, energized, driven, and over all very happy. I was thinking i might take 20mg dosage mon, wed, and fri. I feel it might decrease my risk of dependancy, decrease the amount of unneeded weightloss, and make me more driven (aside from my good grades i feel that its due to my ability to learn quickly, though i never pay attention and never really try hard in school) I want to pay attention i just cant. I would like some feedback on peoples thoughts. also i have no history of drug abuse, addiction, etc. I play sports and lead a very healthy lifestyle. I just don't feel driven.

Was working fine then began loosing focus again. Doctor increased the dosage to 20mg a day, half twice a day. Was working fine then I started to notice I wasn't focusing as well. I do not abuse the medication. So I thought I wold look up this medication on your site. What my medication looks like you have something of the complete opposite. I take the generic of Adderall. Mine is peach and it has 20mg on the back and the number and the letter of b 973 on the front. But your site said it should be dark orange. I noticed last week SOME of the pills were a little dark orange around the edge but not all of them. I also noticed that when I had my prescription filled just this past Sat. that the phyarmist typed on the bottle (20mg TABBRR) what is that suppost to mean. I also noticed that the medication usually takes several hours before I notice and difference as far as focusing that is. How do I know if I am recieving the right medication? I have my prescriptions filled at CVS.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Niecie, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/12/2009 10:41:24 PM	I am a 49 yr female... I always knew I was differrent. I felt like information went into my brain but went right out the other side. I would read, listen to a lecture or be in a conversation and end with no recollection of the information I was given. How was I to explain this to a doctor... I thought they would think I was crazy. I rehearsed over and over what I would say to them to make them believe there truely was a problem. How much easier it would be to go in and show them a cut, bruise or broken bone... they could fix it. How could they diagnose or fix a problem they couldn't see and I couldn't explain. I spent 7 years in and out of the doctors office. She first put me on prozac, treated me for an inter-ear infection, had me get all of my old fillings replaced, got glasses,treated me for allergies, etc. All these things were good but there was still something much more. She gave up, one day she said &quot;I can't help you&quot;. Talk about a heart break and a validation that I was crazy. One day I read an ad on Straterra... explaining the symptoms of adult ADHD. I asked my doctor if there were special test for that. She said yes, as she rolled her eyes, but she would have to refer me to a shrink...here we ago again! The psycologist had me diagnosed in moments. No special tests were needed. The Straterra has helped for about 6 years now but there was still something more that I couldn't put my finger on. I have been going to doctors now for another 3 years to finally get one to take my extreme fatigue seriously. I took a sleep test and I have mild narcolepsy. My doctor has recently added adderall and I am finally content that what I have been silently struggling with all my life has been discovered and properly treated. I breaks my heart to pieces to think I raised my 3 children without this help. I struggled so badly just to make it through each day and hide my feelings of &quot;stupidness&quot;. Now at almost 50, I feel like I have a clear mind...and a new start on life.

I have to say this medicine is a life-saver.  Instead of starting my day with 20 tasks and ending the day with 20 tasks half-done, I now concentrate on one task at a time and do no move on to the other task until the previous one is complete.  Side effects for me:  total loss of appetite, weight loss, dry mouth.  I find myself drinking approx. 80 ounces of water a day and the thought of food repulses me.  I now drink Slimfast or Boost as I know it's not healthy to go all day without a bite of food.Overall, I am very pleased with the results of Adderall.

It worked wonders for me. Kept me very alert more focused. Only side effects I had was a little shakey, mild high blood pressure but only when I first took it, and higher resting pulse rate. I also had lack of appetite which I thought was a plus. And weight loss. I lost my job and couldnt continue to take my adderall. I was back to my sleepy fatigue ways it was horrible. So I was dying to go back on the adderall plus I had gained about 30 lbs!!!So I have now been back on the adderall 10 mg bid and my side effects have gotten worse. I feel the med works like it did before but my b/p is high sometimes 150/100 and my resting pulse is 90-100. I sometimes get &quot;pangs&quot; of pain in my chest like 2-3 times a day and I have shortness of breath sometimes. Like I need to take a deep breath. It is making me nervous. I think my b/p was a little high before I started adderall so not sure if its directly the adderall.I do have loss of appetite again but have not lost any weight. Which sucks!! But I have only been on adderall for about a month. So maybe I just didnt lose it yet.When I first started taking the meds last summer I did sometimes take up to 40 mg in one day.I know Im not supposed to but I would if I wanted to study or get up early the next day. My fatigue/sleepiness gets so bad sometimes I physically cant get up in the morning. And sometimes I can sleep like a whole day. So maybe thats why I lost more weight, too. Has anyone else had these side effects that I am now having? I have an app. with my primary physician this week for the high b/p. Just to make sure all is ok. Im only 30 yrs old and dont want heart probs.now!! But I like the adderall and hope I can stay on it.

And she may want to take me up to 20 mg twice a day depending how I am feeling. Just 5 day ago I was switched to generic Celexa (I take 10 mg twice a day for 1 week and then will increase to 20 mg twice a week) Rigt now I am not feeling too great....I have periods where I feel good and have energy, other times I am in the dumps and tired. Not really sure if this is the right meds for me....The jitteriness is bothering me mostly...anyone have any thoughts about this?

I take 20mg of prozac and 45mg of adderall spread out during the day. I was very happy with it at first.Its like i woke up completly for the first time in my life and got everything that i needed to get done accomplished. I have now noticed that I bruise easily, my limbs become numb and tingly occasionally and my circulation seems to be altered a little to where I have noticed it cant be good. My feet do swell and they turn purple if I apply a little pressure to them. My perception of objects seem to be a little off cause i run into everything. I also keep these lumps under my scalp? It seems to stay in the same top portion of my scalp and it just feels lumpy like theres fluid or something trapped in there. Would like to find out if anyone is experiencing the same things. It does wonderful keeping me from taking a nap everychance i get because i just cant go on but I am starting to wonder if it is worth it?

Etc. I also was the kid who just looked out the window in grade school. My psych, decided to give me a test and bam, I have ADD. and was given the generic version. After reading these reviews, I can relate. I have horrible tirade mood swings, I don't feel like I am getting more work done during the day, I focus on things that are not a priority,like ebay. I also leave the office so exhausted I feel like I have lost me. I have no energy to do anything. Errands are a big deal, working out, forget it. I feel like I have no time, because I waste a lot of it. Procrastinating. It is ruining my life. The only good thing is it keeps my hunger at bay, and my weight is at 120. I think I am taking more and more to keep awake during the day. What is so wonderful, your doc gives you this stuff, and no one tells you to watch for side effects. I wonder if I was off all these meds how I would be. I am 41 and feel like a 90 year old taking a bunch of pills each day. One to bring me up, one to bring me down, one for depression one for anxiety. I have never been one to lose patience, and I lose it all the time. I have ruined relationships because of it. I react, don't think.  I feel like I need rehab.

I am 33 years old and wonder what my life could have been like if I had this medication during my school years. Adderall has been a lifesaver for me! I always felt like I was being left behind in school because the others could learn things so much faster than I could, but since Adderall I feel like I am on an even playing field.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Michael, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/7/2009 5:55:01 PM	I come from an good middle class, educated family and discovered that I was ADD recently.  I am a high school teacher, an athlete and a father of a beautiful 5 year old autistic child.  As I learned about autism I saw there was a connection with ADD and I thought I had it.  Well I have always been very ant-meds but I was still very curious to try and see what meds could perhaps do for me.  My ADD symptoms have been fatigue, innattention, foggy thinking, procrastination to name a few.  For the last week I have been taking 10 mgf of Adderall twice daily.  Although I have only taken the medication for 5 days it has been really helping me tremendously.  I am calm and relaxed and I can comfortably sit still.  I have a lot more patience for my son and I feel better in general.  I think people should however be very careful with this medication and take it very carefully. For me this medication has (for the very short time I have tried it) been a huge help.

Edema (Swelling/Fluid) in the ankles &amp; feet is a seriouse side effect from Adderal and indicates a circulatory problem (blood flow) usually due to a heart problem. Most likely a temporary side effect but a serious one. If you stop taking the drug, symptoms should go away unless serious damage has been done or it's poss it could be related to another condition or a drug/food interaction with Adderall. Call your doctor/pharmacist. Also, Review drug info on WebMD.

Very satisfied. Sometimes I have a slight headache, which is not distracting and only very mild pain.  I seldom suffered from headaches prior to the medication. I sleep less but slept to much before. Still get (plus or minus) 8 hours. I had a heart stress test and no probems found but will have an EKG more often due to my age. On the plus side I feel much more comfortable with myself and others. No &quot;hopped up&quot; excessive euphoric feelings. Feel I am better acomplishing daily tasks along with anything unusual which may come up.  Very greatful for having it prescribed. Only recently started the Adderall and wish some MD had prescribed it for me decades ago.  I have concerns over some of the possible side effects and intend to discuss taking &quot;medication holidays&quot; with my MD. Married over 25 years and my wife is glad I started the medication, 20mg, twice daily. I do notice if I miss a dose but nothing sever and no &quot;craving&quot; for the drug. Adderrall maynot be for everyone but it sure is helping me.
Other	teabird55, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/20/2009 12:43:32 AM	I was prescribed Adderall for ADD without hyperactivity. I began with the XR but found that the dosage of 40mg was to much so I cut my dosage to 20mg.  I still felt like I was getting to much to quick, so I asked my doctor to precribe the regular 20mg generic which are scored so that I can break them in half and continue the meds at an even pace.  I have great focus at work, but by the time the day is finish I am so tired and washed out I have to rest.  This medication gives my brain the ability to focus perfectly however my energy level has not increased all that well. I eat less, but I've not lost weight and not that I'm looking to loose by taking this. I have notice a major problem with water retention and the swelling of my feet, ankles and hands. Almost like I am bloated.  I was wondering if anyone else was having any of these symtoms.  If you have please let me know.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/2/2009 11:11:26 PM	I have been on Adderall for almost 2 years now. I like the XR pills MUCH better than the fast acting pills, but can no longer afford them due to recently losing my job and health insurance. I used to take 25mg (XR) in the morning and that worked well, and I noticed less side effects.  Now I take 10mg of the generic amphetamine salts 2 x's a day. Since starting on the medication I have less difficulty prioritizing my day and schedule, retaining information, starting and finishing tasks, and paying attention in general. On the other hand, I have developed nervous habits I can't break like biting my lips, playing with my nails and a crazy desire to smoke, feel awkward in certain social situations (which is TOTALLY not me), feel edgy and moody at the end of most days, and sometimes have trouble making fast decisions and conveying my thoughts clearly. Over all, I feel the benefits of the drug outweigh the negative side effects (I used to be a total spaz and be asked almost daily if I was &quot;on crack&quot;, which really messed with my self esteem) so I continue to take it, but I cant help but wonder if I should try something else.  Any suggestions?

He started on the Adderall about 2 months ago and thank goodness has never had any of the side effects that go with certain ADD medications.

My son would focus more in school and be more calm but he developed anger issues, and he would yell at his parents and siblings which he hadn't done before.

My brain finally woke up, I could focus and get things done, I had energy, I would gladly do dreaded tasks, and I finally felt normal. Then after 2 or 3 months, it was not so effective. At 4 months my doctor increased the dosage from 10 MG to 15 MG twice a day. The outcome: I broke out in a rash on my stomach and sides by the end of day 1. Even after stopping Adderall for 5 days and starting back up on only 5 MG twice a day, the itching and rash would return. Will someone tell me why this reaction might occur? I do take a small amount of thyroid medication for a slightly underactive thyroid (Armour Thyro 30 MG), but I do not think that is the problem. I have also been on hormone replacement therapy for the past 5 years. I would be lost without Adderall to help with my ADHD. I have suffered from this condition for years, and for me it has only gotten worse with age. I tried Strattera about 4 years ago and it had far too many adverse side effects.  Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated...

My mind was everywhere, I had no motivation to do the work, couldn't explain why. My ADHD is.. well, I am hyperactive just to the extent that I find I am always moving something, just slightly, for instance like wiggling my toes. I'm also the daydreamish type, which isn't easy in college. Benefits of Adderall, in my case, included more energy, increased focus, increased calm, and an increased ability to express what I had to say because my thoughts weren't as scattered. I could follow the teacher easier in class, things made much more sense.. it was as if my mind was on steroids or something. Like steroids, Adderall had its side effects too, which in my case included mood changes when it wore off (I heard Adderall XR prevents that, but haven't tried), but I'm talking extreme irritability, and normally I am not like that at all.. so personality changes.. I kept to myself, felt my empathy leave, feelings and emotions numbed SIGNIFICANTLY. felt dead inside. Sure, I could concentrate on whatever I CHOSE, and I didn't magically want to do school work, that's the catch. If you're like me, you still have to make that conscious decision to do the work.. and once you do decide to, it is a heck of a lot easier to concentrate. If you start the doses do so slowly.. when I was on too high a dose, I felt so stressed, had high blood pressure, &amp; I was angry, &amp; too concentrated. Please consider trying other options first. I got off adderall, was tired for daysss, learned more about ADHD &amp; more about myself.. &amp; I don't have it all figured out but I feel alive &amp; unaltered &amp; like myself &amp; EVERYONE can tell when the real me is showing.. having people who understand &amp; love me the way I helps me want to care for myself better by eating better, sleeping earlier, exercising &amp; relaxing more, &amp; being alone, without distractions when I study. Be easy with yourself, DO NOT GIVE UP, you ARE NOT alone!

In addition, I have severe generalized anxiety disorder.  I tried every anti-deppresant ever invented with no improvement.  Adderall 20 mg 2X a day works mircacles for me. No fatigue no anxiety no depression or daytime sleepiness. I tried Provigil which increased my anxiety.  Provigil is too $$$ and ineffective in my opinion.  I truely beleive that Adderall has many uses other than ADD/ADHD and Narcolepsy disorders.  Further research should be done to prove it.

For those of you that abuse the drug I wish you well. Good luck in the ER!!! P.S.S. TAKE THIS SPEED OFF THE MARKET FOR GOOD. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/4/2009 3:45:15 AM	I feel like many doctors are prescribing far to high of a dosage of this medication to start. I am currently prescribed 30mg/day in 10mg tablets. I take one and a half before heading to my early classes, the other half approximately 5 hours later to get through my remaining classes, and am still able to come home and take a nap in the afternoon before taking the third one in the evening to study. Following this dosage I have never been shaky, dizzy, sleepless, or anything other than focused and happy.I simply don't understand how a doctor could start someone at a dose of 30mg at a time twice a day. That's asking for a heart attack. I've thought about switching to the time release form but I like having the ability to modify how much I'm taking at each point in the day so I'm most productive.

This drug has helped me very much. As a child no Dr. knew what I had. They thought I was just a very active child. That it would pass. When it did not pass they put me on Ritalin. Then after about the 6th. grade my father said it was all in my head. So he took me off of it. Until about 6 yrs. ago I went on Adderall. It has saved mylife. I can sit and talk to someone without getting up or asking over and over what they said. I can start and finish things. Yes I eat a little less but to me I do not care. I came from a time when there was no drugs not even a name for it. The Dr.s made my mother think she was a bad mother. So yes this drug can be used for bad. If not taken the right way. But for people like me its the answer to my problems.

My grades in college improved dramatically (I am now graduated) and I am very focused, accomplishing any task hand. This works great, however, if I am tired and I take this medication I will get lightheaded and have heart palpitations. I suggest not taking this medicine in the late afternoon or evening because it WILL prevent you from getting a good nights sleep. Other then those few down points, this drug has changed my life. If taken responsibly it does more good then harm. Please watch out for what I have experienced: Dry mouth, sleeplessness, circulation changes (warm spots on hand and feet)loss of appetite. For me, the benefits out-weighed the detriments, but it will be different for everyone.

It makes me feel like my skin is crawling. I was on Vyvanse and I loved it. But, my doctor switched me for two months to see how it would do for the long days at school, work, home etc. Just bad bad bad. One, and the only good thing I can can about it is that it started working right away. Then, when it kicked into high gear it was all down hill.

It's like speed, expect it's perscribed. People are easily addicted to it, you suffer withdrawal symptons like you would a drug. I do not suggest this medicine.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	1/15/2009 1:03:41 AM	This medication has worked since the first month i have been on it. I had no problem getting school work done, taking notes, taking tests, doing homework, paying attention at meetings, finishing all my jobs at work and keeping my room organized. It seemed to always do its job, but without ANY say was changed to another medication and seem to experience much anger, no appietiet, a feeling of numbness and get depressed at the end of the day. Aderall was the medication that worked for me, not Vyvance.

The positive: I see a huge change in my work habbits, and I'm able to get more tasks done in a shorter period of time.  My mood is actually BETTER and I feel happier.  I've lost weight (which I have always had a hard time with).The negatives: My hands and feet are always cold, sometimes my vision gets blury, I forget to eat which has caused me to lose too much weight at times and also causes my hair to fall out sometimes, I CRAVE cigaretts (I don't even like to smoke, but I can smoke a pack every few days while on my meds), dehydration, lightheadedness, and very dry, itchy skin in my pelvic area.  Sometimes my hair folicles get infected which I haven't figured out if it's due to Adderall or not just yet, but it started about a month after I started taking the meds.I like how well it's helped me, but I worry about the long term side effects.

It works wonderful for the ADD symptoms. I was able to study and concentrate. However, the side effects are not worth it. I had insomnia, shortness of breath and increased heart rate. I felt like my heart was going to beat right out of my chest. I now deal with my ADD symptoms without medication and I'm a lot happier.

A few months after starting it, The pharmacy had trouble getting it , there was a mix up with the Dr. and I couldn't get it for a few weeks. I started up again and had HORRABLE  side  effects! collapsed, was in the hospital for several days. And after. that, my teeth are ALL loose, and I need extensive dental work.

I'm on it, 10mg per day and am so stoned and dissoriented I can hardly stand it. It did not help the ADD. I am having really strange thoughts, like the dog in a bowtie and tux, and laughing my butt off over anything. Tried to tell Health Plus I can't take amphetamines, Bureaucrats playing Doctors! 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	1/8/2009 6:00:46 AM	I started taking Adderall XR a year ago, w/o a prescription.  I am in my last year of college and up until last year, I could never pay attention in class or study.  I started taking 20mg when I had to study, and instantly my grades improved.  I now take it whenever I have class to attend or when I am studying, which is between 2-4 times a week.    I start to feel it about 30-60 mins after I take it. If I'm tired, it wakes me up completely(I am never tired during its duration). It lasts about a total of 6 hours for me (female, 110 pounds).During these hours, I only desire to study and learn. In class, I am now very attentive and class goes by so much quicker for me.  In the past, I just daydream and can't stand sitting there for more than 1.5 hours.  Now, I can sit through a 5 hour class.  I also participate a lot in class now, it makes me want to show everyone how smart I am, haha.  However, when I am on it, I do not like people talking to me because all I want to do is study. People now always tell me how much of a nerd I am, which makes me feel really happy :)Side effects: dry mouth, my old O.C.D. tendencies spring up, I do not eat (I lose weight during the part of the week that I take it), I smoke cigarettes (I recently quit and never desire one, but when I take adderall, I smoke a lot), I cannot sleep until 5am even if I take it at 8am.I do notice that I build a tolerance to it whenever I take it like three days in a row.  It doesn't last as long.Basically, during those 6 hours, all I want to do is study.  I'd imagine that if I took it on a day where I had no studying/class, I'd probably go NUTS.  I guess because I am normally focused in everything else, just not in schoolwork.It has definitely helped me (my GPA is now 3.6, compared to 2.0 before taking it) and I do not crave it on the days that I don't take it. However, I can definitely see how detrimental the side affects of this drug can be, and I'm so glad I only have one more year of school left!

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	1/6/2009 1:52:21 PM	I was not the normal add patient. my legs would shake all the time, my mind was else where constantly, i was not hyperactive, i could not listen and write at the same time, and had to stare into the eyes of whoever was talking in order to follow a conversation. Above all i was so unorganized in thoughts and tasks. Adderall changed my life. Its not a drug that instantly makes you organized or extremely good in school, that is your part, it just gives you a boost and focus that you need, but without effort on your part things wont change that much. I have to say this medication does change one as a whole, in every aspect of life. 
Other	dawn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/5/2009 1:38:40 AM	This drug is an excellent solution to the ADD I have, not with hyperactivity. The bad rap that these medicatios get due to the minority or those who abuse it is criminal. This drug and other medications of it's class are so difficult to get for those of us who do use it responsibly, the pharmacies do not want to carry it, due to cost or lack of need. The doctors are refusing to treat with it and rely on inadequate and ineffective subsitutions.

I had dislexia as a child, and when I was younger, if anyone in our family had a problem, it was to be kept a secret. I finally got help, and found out I have ADHD. I have been on this medication for 3 months now, and what a complete turnaround, talk about 360! I can focus more on important things, I even noticed a change in my driving, instead of running around like a chicken with its head cut off, I have slowed down and started enjoying things, and am much better at dealing with with problems instead of running away from them, I have also been writing a journal everyday, and remembering things alot better, and feel I am thinking before I open my mouth first. the only problem I have noticed lately, is that at night, I get a little edgy. other than that I love the fact that I feel like I am finally in control of all the racing things that used to go on in my head, and now I can sit back and relax for a change, and organize my priorities, whereas before I could not.

Is this something I should be worried about?

I had tried Effectior, Wellbutrin, Serequel and others but all had side effects that were not good for my work/life.Adderall seems to work best with me. It helps my mood, keeps me at the keyboard longer without wandering around the internet and stuff and helps me take care of issues in life before they becomes tragedies. If you suffer from depression but do not like the effects of the SSRI drugs, give Adderall a try.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Photographer, 35-44 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	4	5		35-44	12/15/2008 9:45:49 PM	I am a successful nationally known professional advertising photographer who was on Adderall for about five years and then decided that I did not need it anymore because all of my old ADHD habits where mostly gone. I was off of them for about three months and all of those long gone adhd habits that had played havoc with my life started coming back one by one. Unpaid parking tickets, loosing my keys, rash decisions, unfinished project after unfinished project. Within six months I had almost lost my photography business that I had worked so hard for and had collections agencies after me etc.  Wow what a bust to my ego! I guess I really do need to be on Adderall. It's as if when I am not on Adderall I know exactly what it is I need to do to keep my life running smooth...I put together my to do list but the to do list never gets completed. Yes I am a successful advertising photographer with lots of talent...but without the discipline and focus to apply that talent my world falls apart. I guess I just need to take it...it is what it is. I know there are lots of talented artists who take adderall...and I do not feel it makes me any less creative....or for that matter any more creative. How one little adderall XR pill makes the difference between being reasonably disciplined and totally irresponsible, however, is beyond me...but for me the reality is just that. I am now back on Adderall 20 MG XR and things are going great again. Hope this was helpful to any other artists out there who are struggling with the to medicate/not to medicate question. In my case the choice was made for me...I do not even think I would still be in business without this drug..no kidding.

Causes me to be giddy, then twitchy, excited, fast heart rate, slight urges to do or say things. Helps with homework a little, but makes me feel kind of weird. The weirdest symptom has to be when in school the drug causes me to be very open with my life to others, and expressing feelings to people.

I have lost 20 lbs, and it does curb my appitite. I must not have ADD or ADHD because the side effects are it puts me to sleep, I sleep better while on it, My dosage is the generac version 20mg 3 times a day on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.On Mondays I feel a little more alert, but after that I just want to take a nap. It has no negative effects on my pulse or BP.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/27/2008 10:18:49 AM	I have had ADHD, most likely since I was a young kid (I'm now 24), but diagnosed a little over 1 year ago.  I recently finished graduate school, and stopped the Adderall since I stopped seeing the MD.  Now that I've been back on it (about 2 weeks) I'm much more focused, I don't drift off when I'm speaking to clients and feel more motivated to finish my work on time.  I'm also  not binging as often as I used to, which is extremely helpful since I have gained 10 pounds in the last 6 months.  I don't feel aggressive or angry to the point where its affecting my life and hurting others.  Of course, I still have to make some behavioral changes to improve my organizational skills, but that's not something any medication can fix.  Don't expect it to change everything, as part of the treatment for ADHD is to learn new tools to combat the symptoms.  This medication is not a good idea if you or any family members have a history of substance abuse or dependence, since you are predisposed to those conditions.  If you have any psychiatric issues in addition to the ADHD, you must speak with your doctor about them, since treatment will be counterproductive.  You play the greatest role in your treatment-not the medication.

He has improved his focus at school. Surprisingly even his handwriting improves with the medication. His teachers can tell immediately if I forget a dose. It works well for him in school, but he has gone from being a sweet and gentle kid to an angry person. He acts almost manic- huge mood swings- from happy and confident to overreacting and hypersensitive and angry. I am not sure how to manage his schooling if I take him off of it, but his mood disorder is becoming more pronounced as he is nearing adolescence.

This was my second round in the third grade after being held back because of lack of attention and comprehension. Throughout the years I went off and on with various ADD medications trying to find out what works best for me. I am now looking at graduating college in December and was prescribed Adderall at the beginning of this semester. I have been a stellar student this semester and have accomplished more in one semester than I have in my entire collegiate career. I echo some of the previous posts regarding the problem with jitters and increases in tobacco use. I am not a a doctor and in no way am I posing as one on this blog. However,  i would recommend if you are seeing an increase in your tobacco habits try using hard candies to suck on when you have the urge to smoke your 4th cigarette in a row, this helped me reduce my urges and aided the hand to mouth habit that is associated with many smokers.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/8/2008 9:56:04 PM	I was just diagnosed with ADD at age 53. I have been very successful in my career, just exhausted with trying to keep all of the thoughts in order.  I am able to get things done and it makes me very calm.  I worry about becoming dependent on it, so I am looking for some natural alternatives so I do not have to stay on for several years.  I have read that ADD and sleep apnea are common.  So I am planning on getting sleep study to see if this may be part of the reason.

I was diagnosed w/ ADHD 2 yrs ago.  I've been taking this and it's like I have a whole new brain in my head.  It also elevates my mood too.  I can definitely see and feel why this drug is a schedule II controlled substance.

Other	fashiongirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	10/31/2008 3:13:33 PM	I was diagnosed with borderline narcolepsy, CFS, and fibromyalgia as a young teenager.  I have taken many things to keep me awake-uncluding provigil and ritalin.  Provigil helped, but I was still tired all of the time and would still fall asleep at the drop of a hat.  I have been taking adderall 20mg 2x a day for only a short time.  It has made a big difference so far.  I am always very careful with medications, so I am very nervous about the long term effects.  When I take adderall, I do not want to eat for 3-4 hours after, so I have not been eating breakfast or lunch.  My boyfriend and my mom (the closest people to me) have noticed a change in me.  I can make decisions easily (never used to be able to do this) and I am not as emotional.  It has helped me to stay awake, focus, and live like someone without sleep disorders, so for the time being-I am very happy.

My doctor moved me down to 12 mg to stop the weight lose, which it did. I did however notice that it was not working as well so I was placed back onto 15 mg. The 15 mg dosage no longer worked as well as it originally did so I was bumped up to 20 mg and than once again to 25mg and in the 8th grade I was finally bumped up to 30mg where I remain to this day in the 11th grade.Side effects I have experienced:Lose of WeightLose of ApetiteDepressionO.C.D symptoms (extermely prevelent in my last two years)AnxietyParanoiaP.T.S.DIt is strange I go through a living hell almost day by day which may or may not be because of the Adderall but I can not just stop taking it because I fear being the way I am when I'm off of it during my everyday life because I get really &quot;crazy&quot; when I am not on it and eat a lot and just am moody and its pretty bad so I stay on it even though sometimes (more than less) I feel like a am losing my mind. I sometimes wonder what I would be like today if 8 years ago I had not been put on Adderall. (I actually did not have ADHD in the beginning it was ADD but it seemed to have developed into ADHD.)

I'm able to look at people now and be able to have a conversation without tripping over my own tongue(saying something that doesn't make any sense). I feel confident about just being me for the first time in my life and I'm 32yrs.old. The medicine doesn't make me feel drugged up like other meds I've taken in the past. Which was due to the fact that some doctors brushed it off as conditions such as depression or just anxiety(due to being depressed). It really has fixed some major problems in my whole overall way of life. I'm very pleased that I have control back over myself again and hope it stays this way.

His mother had him put on this medication about two months ago. The first day was great. But since then, we are in a situation that is far worse than before. He is very angry, violent, and destructive. We have three other young children and our six year old hits then, kicks then, and goes out of his way to couse then harm. After reading these reviews, my husband and i are calling his doctor to see if his meds can be switched. There are some pretty scary stories in these reviews. I would seriously reccomend reading the positive and negative comments before putting your child on this medication. In our opinion, our son is getting worse and not at all better. Be aware of all side effects, please.

I have been on and off adderall, and usually on very small dosages.  It usually helps, but unfortunately I get side effects pretty bad from stimulant drugs.  The jittery feeling, increased hear rate, and loss of appetite.  The jitters were the worst.  I could focus my mind but I still felt squirmy and totally &quot;out of it.&quot;  Sometimes, I was TOO focused, and could only concentrate on what was going on in my head, and felt out of touch with the outside world.  As far as concentration for school goes, it was very helpful, but my doctor took me off it because he was worried about my health.  I tried the XR once, but did not like it as much because it took too long to work and was not as strong.  no other drug seems to have been as helpful.

We tried Provigil but the headaches were too much.  So far this drug has been very helpful.  And one point I should make, is that I follow my doctor's recommendation to take a &quot;holiday&quot; from it periodically to maintain its effectiveness at my current dosage.

I finally went into therapy just over a year ago at the urging of my wife and was diagnosed with ADHD. I started taking Adderall about 8 months ago. I have found that Adderall is very effective at helping me to focus and listen. It helps me to be more deliberate in my actions, I'm not just drifting through the day. In my classroom I have found that I am able to listen to myself better and not be distracted by those students who give me that 'I'm so bored' look. One of the most interesting effects I've found is that I now actually hear and listen to the lyrics of songs! - never did that before. Looking back at my life, all the way to when I was 6 years old I now recognize the symptoms that had always been there.  I feel that the treatment is working for me, but as my doctor says, the worst part is that I'm 48 and have only now finally taken care of a life-long problem. I take 30 mg. (15 mg standard 2 x a day). I did feel the side effects for about the first two or three days (teeth grinding and dry mouth) but they subsided and I don't have any issues with that now. I've lost a few pounds, but I love to eat and  once I start eating, my appetite is fine. I know that I'll have to continue with this, probably for the rest of my life, but I think of it as a simple compound that my body chemistry is simply missing - so it helps me a lot.Finally I would say to those of you suffering horrible side effects, stop, and get another opinion! If the side effects are that bad, then you probably have a different problem. Amphetamines are an important drug that can work well for those who need it, but if you don't, you are abusing it. I thought that it would be like the speed we experimented with in high school, but it's not. It is an essential part of my life now, stigma or not -

I still catch myself not listening while I'm spoken to and I honestly don't know if adderall is worth all the conditions I read about.  I read that there is usually withdrawel when this drug is abused.  I took it for a few weeks, never took more than the prescribed dose and sometimes took half the dose.  I then took nothing for a few days and felt extremely tired.

I switched over from Focalin because that drug did little to improve my ADD; it just made me irritable once it wore off. I'm on 30 mg twice a day now. The drug puts me in a good place but it doesn't seem to accomplish its actual purpose. I know I've become dependent on it even in this short period of time. Other users have noted this drug should be avoided if you have an addictive personality. I agree completely. It never occured to me that I might have ADD,I was more concerned about my depression. Anyways, my psych noted that I consume about three caffinated drinks a day along with a pack and a half of cigarettes. Now this drug is just another one of the stimulants I consume throughout the day to feel normal, or at least like what I have come to consider &quot;normal.&quot; Seriously, I've met herion addicts who expressed concern when I told them I take Adderall. This drug is dangerous. Part of me thinks the companies behind it are guilty of endangering a lot of people, but when I remember how I felt just after a few days of being off it, you won't see me trying to stop them.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	DevinT, 19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3		19-24	9/27/2008 5:21:59 PM	In high school, my mom kept on me to do my schoolwork, which was good.  However, half way through college, I started failing classes not having support, so I went to the school counselor.She helped me out a bit with a schedule, but still in crunch time, halfway through a Term (quarter), I just couldn't focus for homework.  She brought up ADD, so I contacted a Psychiatrist.My psychiatrist wasn't there, so I had my initial assessment with a stand in.  She said I probably have Bipolar II (hypomanic-depressive).  Shocked, I still geared up and looked up symptoms and this and that.  Sure, so I have mild/moderate Bipolar...I thought everyone did.I had an appointment with my real psychiatrist, and he was on the edge on if I was Bipolar or ADD.  Apparently, a lot of the symptoms overlap.  It was possible I have both, though, so I scheduled another appointment and took Lamictal for BP2.The appointment after that was halfway through the term.  The mood swings were better, but I still couldn't focus.  I was &quot;driven to distraction&quot; as he put it.  I would procrastinate to the point where I was not confident I could get the work done, and then to cheer myself up, I would do the very thing that I used to procrastinate (like a video game).He prescribed me this stuff, Amphetamine Salts.  I took it the day after he prescribed it...and for good reason.  I had an assignment due the next morning.  I had a meeting to prepare for and run.  I had important people to email.It felt like I was sipping on a heavily caffeinated beverage all day.  That's when I'm most motivated.  I got all the emails sent out, I ran the meeting just fine, and I edited 8 pages of a document that I have been sitting on for over a year.The side effects I experienced were dry mouth, muscle tension, strange busts of tiredness that go away in 10 minutes, high blood pressure (expected), feeling a little cold, easy smiling, and restlessness.It's been 3 days.  I actually WANT to do work now.  So weird...

I was finally diagnosed w/ADD when I was 20.  All my life I STRUGGLED through school (constantly daydreaming, forgetting assignments, awful  comprehension). I studied so hard and still earned mostly Cs. Teachers suggested to my parents that I be tested for ADD but I refused because I thought it meant I was dumb.  When I went away to college I did not have my parents reminding me to study or do homework.  The work load and subject matter was increasingly more difficult until one semester I ended up with a 1.5 GPA.  At that point I had enough of the struggle and I made an appointment with my Doctor.  After going through testing I was diagnosed with ADD and was put on Adderall.  I suddenly started to really enjoy school and on top of it all, I really wasn't dumb.  I ended that semester with a 3.85 GPA.  I got an A in Quantitative Business Statistics and loved the class. I continued on with excellent grades and enjoying school and graduated from a State University with a Bachelor of Science.  My only regret is not starting this treatment sooner.  I think that years of struggling through school, feeling left behind, and feeling &quot;stupid&quot; has a negative impact on a child's development of self confidence, self esteem, and perseverance in life. For people that are &quot;on the fence&quot; about taking medication or allowing their child to take meds to treat truly DIAGNOSED ADD/ADHD, ask yourself this..... If(you/your child) had diabetes would you not give your(self/child) insulin?  Everyone should have all the tools they need to succeed.  I am thrilled to be succeeding in life!!

I stopped taking it for one year and returned to my problem of not being able to focus and complete a task.  I asked for a low dose 5mg. (not XR) that I could take once or twice a day as needed.  This has worked well for me, keeping my focus, completing tasks and no side effects.  On days when I don't take it at all, it doesn't seem to bother me.

No doubt I will be in bad shape if/when I stop the adderall, I have to be hooked on it...but that's better than the life I had and my mean spirit that made everyone around me miserable before I started this medication.  I'm 55 years old, this has changed my life....I don't have the rapid heart beat or sweats...I just feel calm and like we all would like to feel...and like some people report, I don't have hyper times where I clean or work myself into a frinzy...

First, I had a Doc put on Adderall XR. Then he took me off because I was having trouble sleeping. He didn't tell me about non-extended release and life went back to days in bed for me. I switched Docs and new Doc changed my regime and included regular Adderall. Currently, I am taking 60mgs of Adderall. 30 mgs 2xs days. Without it-I am more likely to succomb to days in bed other forms of depression.

I am a 28yr old female and I wish a physician would have diagnosed me sooner and maybe I would have done better in school. It is fantastic. My productivity at work has improved TREMENDOUSLY, my concentration and focus have done a 180 in my professional and personal life. For those who complain that they are &quot;addicted&quot; and this is a &quot;bad&quot; medicine. Then you probably have an addictive personality and have it in other areas of your life too, OR have abused the &quot;uses&quot; of Adderall. I take it on the weekdays and am fine on the weekends. I don't &quot;freak out&quot; or have withdrawls!? If your having such a problem (those of you) seek HELP!!! Like alcoholics go to AA..They're not going to &quot;pull&quot; alcohol because people ABUSE it or become addicted?!

I am also taking adderall, and know in my heart that I am addicted, and struggle with knowing this everyday.  With not wanting to refill my script, but knowing that the addict in me will call my doctor and get a refill.  Knowing that I will become emotionless and cold, sleepless and edgy, but with a clean house and unhappy children who don't understand why their mom is so tense and angry.  I know that I will start having to take Zanax and Ambien to calm down at night, and that the divide between my husband and I will grow bigger.  This medication helped me at first, it felt like legal meth.  Because that is what it is.  The sad thing is, I was working in the substance abuse field when I began by adderall journey.  I am not saying that everyone will experience what I am going through, but my sister also has the exact same problems.  While I thought we would be having cookouts and taking our kids to the park, instead we are swapping scripts and pills and cleaning tips.  I caution everyone who is thinking about taking this drug to consider whether they can do it responsibly, and their family history of addiction.  Reading these other reviews makes me feel much less alone, but also very sad that so many people are having these problems.  I realize that I may need help to get off of it, but that is very hard when you work in the field that I do and your professional reputation is on the line.  I use up my script in less than two weeks, and then have two weeks without it.  The two weeks w/out it are so much better, but the addict in me never listens.  Every month I think I can do it responsibly.  I just wonder, when is it gonna be to much?  I know the saying one is to many and a thousand is never enough.  In my case, that is so true.  Please be careful.

I have a &quot;Mentally challenged&quot; friend who has adhd or a.d.d and he had a prescription of Adderall.Since I was a stupid young teen,I loved experimenting with pills I had no prescription to.After the first pill I felt on top of the world.I could speak better/faster/more intelligent.I could focuse better,I had NO ANXIETY what so ever of any sort.I had REALLY bad social anxiety and fears of situations before they even happend.But with Adderal,it disapeared 110%.In fact with Adderall,I WANTED! to go out and socialize,when usually I would just hide in my room for days/weeks/months((no joke))so finally I got my own perscription.The doctor wasnt sure about it,but I told him about all the countless benifits I was having,and he finally let me have it.    Of course there was a downside to this to though =(  Eventually,I started to abuse it.Taking it more often than I should have.I would even chop it up and let it dissolve in water.Stay up all night &amp; pull all nighters (which was still kinda fun,,I got to wright some of my best guitar riffs back then and clean my room spic and span)) but I got real irritable when taking tooo much.OMG and the TEETH GRINDING LOL!!!!Another thing I disliked about being on close to slightly over amount is my penis would shrink greatly lol.Though I could still &quot;get it up&quot; when needed.It looks like I came out of cold pool.    Anyway,,,,I really miss this pill,almost 10 years have past,I'd like to give it another try but be a little more responsible this time.

I didn't even want to get out of bed in the morning. I couldn't function and my thoughts and actions were scrambled. Adderall has really helped my overall condition, although i dont like the 'speed-like' feeling i get from it sometimes. My Dr. prescribed me on 15 mg then to 20mg. The 20mg is usually too much so i take 10mg in the am and 10mg later on. It has been a life-saver. I am aware of the abuse of this medication, also, and I was worried at first about taking it, but hopefully i wont have problem coming off of it in the future.

Right now I take 90 milligrams a day of Adderall non-time released. I have days where I am tired, on these days I take more than perscribed. In my opinion Adderall is highly &quot;abusive&quot;. When you take a medication long enough your body becomes immune and the medication isnt as effective as it was when you first started taking it.I dont think Adderall should be prescribed to children under the age of 18. All it takes is a simple 20 question evaluation and you are prescribed a drug that may forever change your life. I have tried to stop taking Adderall and I have not been successful yet. I get so mad at myself when I sleep for 5 days straight (when im finally back to normal) and then go back to the Adderall.My advice to anyone condsidering this medication is to get a second opinion. Honestly, I know I dont have ADHD or ADD, the Adderall makes me have ADHD. I didnt need this medication when I was prescribed it 3 years ago and now I cant get away from it. I have faith in God that He will get me through this and allow me to feel again. The Will of God will never take you where the grace of God cannot protect you. God bless you all!!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Truth (Patient) 	3	2	2			7/14/2008 1:47:08 AM	I believe I have a mix of hyperactivity and inattentivness.. I'm easily distracted, like to be on the move (as if driven by a motor), its hard to stay on task, I zone-out/daydream here &amp; there, I find it hard to be motivated, especially in school (unless I am genuinely interested in the material &amp; feel it really applies to my life). I procrastinate, can be quite disorganized, and stress out because of this all! Thats when I dont take Adderall.  Only somewhat effective because the tablets tend to wear off as the day progresses which results in irritability, they initially get me down to business. I'd hoped that side-effecrs wouldnt apply to be but well in reality they do. this drug really is no joke and should be taken seriously because of its habit-forming tendency. i dont like the idea of depending on a substance to do things i used to be able to do without it. true, those things were harder to do before Adderall, but: when i would go a day or 2 without it, or just be on a lower dose, i found that the fatigue that set in as a result (side-effect) made those things harder than it had been before ever taking the Adderall! Essentially Adderall had picked me &amp; dropped me lower than before =/ I don't want to go back off of it, however i do want my genuine self back, the one that isn't so serious and annoyed. high blood pressure is another thing to look out for. this can raise it. it makes me tense at times. But if you're like me you'll like it AT FIRST. It helps me work &amp; i mean efficiently, but I don't always need this stuff.. maybe when i have a paper due but not when just hanging with friends. i made it without Adderall but it wasnt easy &amp; it especially isnt now that i've been on it. Learning about ADD helps me understand myself better &amp; discover under what conditions i'm best able to work. this'll make a difference in whether I decide to continue it. I of course respect that the severity of the ADD in any case also must be addressed. Dosage is also very important.

After trying several different meds, this one is the only one that has made a difference in my ability to wake up and get going.  A big difference.  I take 40 mgs when I get up and sometimes another 20 in the afternoon.  It has made my life so much better.  It is not perfect, but I'd rather take it than feel like I did before.  When my new Dr. said she wouldn't be able to prescribe it, I cried.  My quality of life was at stake.  I changed doctors.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	CollegeStudent, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	19-24	6/26/2008 6:00:49 PM	I am a 23 year old college student.  I started taking adderall to help me with my school work about 7 months ago.  Before the medicine I procrastinated, could not finish a projects, was disinterested, and unmotivated.  When I take this medication I shed all of those characteristics. I am able to study for about 5-8 hours straight and obtain all the information. I am in my senior year of college and thought I could use a push to finish the hard classes. I became interested in learning; I grasped concepts easily, and became level headed and rational.  I will say though, there is a huge downside.  I got bad headaches, lost ten pounds, blacked out frequently for a second when I stood up, chest pains, and numbness in my hands. When on the medication, I lost my connection to emotion and was very irritable.  I tended to be cold and distant.  I know this medicine works but I did not want to put my body through the side effects any longer.I have stopped taking this due to the person I was becoming.  It takes more discipline for me to study and stay focused but at least I feel like my true self. This drug is habit forming. I thought I could not get an A on a test without it, but I did and I can.  Plus now when I get an A it is more rewarding knowing it was all me who earned, not the adderall.  
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	6/26/2008 12:54:20 AM	Freshman yr of college i was diagnosed with ADD, the Inattentive kind. My experience with Adderall has been a love/hate relationship. I started on 20mg in a.m. &amp; 10mg in p.m. It gave me more energy, made me mentally sharper &amp; I felt normal &amp; happier since I was more able to communicate &amp; think clearly. I was happy.. at first. Then I noticed I could stay up WAY late. Then I'd sleep in &amp; miss the classes I'd finally begun thoroughly doing the work for. Also, friends pointed out Id become irritable &amp; mean at times. I agreed but was upset because of all the good adderall was doing for me otherwise. The tablets wore off later in the day, causing my moods. My prescriber recommended a higher dose, I agreed &amp; I liked it, I was focused on getting my stuff done. STILL, I was.. cold, emotions were distant. IMPORTANT: check before you start this if theres a history of addictions to substances like alchohol etc in your family as this can really be HABIT-FORMING, as in my case. Also, Adderall doesnt allow refills. This was prob when back from out of state college &amp; I had insurance- coverage issues, which forced me to go off adderall. DIFFICULT. I was SO tired, moreso than EVER before. felt like a moody addict &amp; sad &amp; like doing NOTHING.2nd day with no Adderall in my system, woke up during the night &amp; threw up. Horrible &amp; bizarre. BE CAREFUL, listen to your body's signs if on it. Try keeping lowest dose possible. Off adderall, I still had a job to get &amp; chores ETC when just functioning was a task. Gained back the weight i'd lost, plus a few. After that I felt better each day, but back to my spacey, scattered &amp; anxious self again. Caffiene helped, in big amts. Insurance is fixed, I caved &amp; am back on it. They say you'll feel like a different person. Maybe, I feel my old Adderall self returning, more focused but mean. My family has noticed. Mom said i'm not my old self. &amp; I fear I'm becoming dependent again. Im taking lower doses &amp; may switch to Dexedrine or Adderall XR. Think.

It is a hardcore stimulant that is similar to an illegal group of drugs if you catch my drift. Has helped me but I'm not sure if the benefit has exceeded the cost. I can't imagine children taking it so do your research first. Causes anxiety, mood swings, and an overall feeling that can only be described as BLAH.

I notice I am able to concentrate and focus better. My boss says I look less tense.  I don't take things so personally and my self esteem is increasing.  I have difficulty with math and understanding what I read, but I am hopeful I will improve in that area.  This medication has given me hope.  I also have depression and take zoloft.  One thing I've noticed is sometimes I get extremely sleepy in the afternoon.

I am also on Zoloft &amp; Lamictal. I have noticed an increase in anger and rage over the last 2 years or so, and I have been researching ALL of these drugs in order to find out if all 3 are causing these highly charged emotions, or just one or two. The smallest incident can absolutely en-rage me to the point of screaming and then crying out of frustration or just plain anger. I'm wondering if anyone else has these issues with adderall, in particular. I am not even sure I could function without this drug, but I want off ALL of them and I need to taper myself off them. I know my liver is damaged from them, and I fear with the anger I have inside me, someone will get hurt or someone will hurt me. Another issue for me is that these drugs aren't manufactured in the United States, and the big Pharmaceuticals contract with China &amp; India which aren't quality controlled. This actually makes me VERY angry, so I am going to get off these and try to be normal, and IF I still have these destructive emotions when I'm off them, then I must seek help elsewhere. Adderall in my opinion is a very dangerous drug and giving any ADD drug to a child, adolescent or adult is irresponsible and the drug companies do NOT give a hoot about people, as it is ALL about PROFIT. The FDA is just as corrupt as the big Pharma, and together they are in collusion and both have made billions on people's lives and deaths.Research it yourself and open your eyes to the corruption in our country, including our own government in regard to the big Pharma's and the FDA. It will scare the HELL out of you!!!
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	grj1983, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	6/10/2008 4:07:07 AM	It's a restricted prescription, just like narcotics. It's hard for me to obtain,but if I don't,I do bad things. I hit someone head on in my car, for ex. I think taking this drug for 10 years (since age 15 or 16 or so), has also had me turn into a raging psychopath when I'm coming off it. It only gets worse. I don't know I am acting badly, other people who know me complain. I think it's impossible to fix ADD or ADHD, because... why is it such a problem to not be able to sit still? Isn't everyone fat these days because they are far too lazy? Seems dumb to try to fix people who are hyper or not attentive. The world is a boring place. School is boring too. While this substance improved my grades during school, I found no satisfaction in my life. It numbs my feelings. It makes me more agressive and mean. But as far as helping ADD or ADHD, I don't think it does that at all anymore. My thoughts still race, I still get distracted, I am still bouncing with energy. I am on 90mg a day. Thats as high as it gets. Even though it doesn't help, I take it because I am afraid I will hurt someone else if I stop. I do not know who I am without this medication. People who take it to feel less tired are abusing it. People who give it to kids SHOULD NOT. People who take it to be less depressed are abusing it. It's not for depression. I'd reccomend exersize for that (not a doc). Besides all that, I'm tired of having to spend my time chasing after this drug every month to fill up on my prescription, because some people think it's cool to take it recreationally. THAT is the dumbest thing of all. This is the least fun drug, ever. They should adjust it so there is no more false euphoria from this drug in anyone. I never felt euphoria of any kind from it. But to give it to a kid that DOES (even legally), I could see it as being addictive. I've been medicated since I was 5, Ritilan, countless anti-depressants and then back to the desoxyn and Adderall.Yeah-I don't even talk to my parents anymore.

Feel this med must be a little stronger!  Would be very cautious about giving to children especially younger ones. Seems I've had more severe mood swings with this med.  Believe the ritalin worked a little better &amp; probably would be better off w/o it too. Started these type meds during period of extreme stress mainly for depression.  Now that stress is less believe I've become a little too dependant on it. I would suggest trying all other measures first &amp; especially with children who are dependant on the parents judgment. My Doctor said he would be curious as to how much physical activity a child is getting before trying these type meds. Maybe try increasing that first. Basically proceed with caution &amp; honesty.

Has made me stop taking my SSRI, and feel like I accomplish things. Was taking 20mg XR once daily, then twice daily, but due to price, went to plain. Seems to work longer than XR. But through discussions with my dr, we've decided to do the 20mg plain, and depending on how I feel, can take a 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or whole pill. Prescribed at 1 pill b.i.d. but may drop to 1/2 pill b.i.d. with 1/2 pill p.r.n. ... This med has worked wonders in me. Won't recommend it to anyone, though, because it is a Class II controlled substance and they may sound like an addict going to their Dr. :) Wish the generic that I'm on didn't have this odd flavor to it though ... 
Other	Taximan, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	5/9/2008 9:32:04 AM	I was given 15 mg a day of this for my chronic exhaustion. However, I quickly realized that it has made my depression go away. The problem is I need about 40 - 60 mg to get rid of the depression. My pdoc won't give me that much, and so I remain depressed. I don't know what to do because nothing makes my depression go away like Adderall does. I also find it's not necessary to take it everyday. I find it best to skip every 3rd day so I can sleep. It does cause insomnia, but I had that before I ever took Adderall. This is like a miracle drug for me. Now if only I knew a doc who would give me enough to last all month.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	brett, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	19-24	5/6/2008 6:26:16 PM	I'm 20 and in my first year of college. I was diagnosed with ADD in 6th Grade for my lack of ability to concentrate, I was/am quite the day dreamer. The Doc put me on 5mg Adderall XR I believe. My freshman year the dose was increased to 10mg. At the time I didn't know fully how it effected me, all I knew is that it made me want to throw desks at the teachers that irritated me, and that I was unhappy and pissed of for no reason. I switched from adderall to stratera, then to ritali LA, but I prefered not taking anything because of how they effected me. In January I started back on Adderal XR @ 15mg and I told myself that it's worth the sacrifice to have good grades and be able to focus, but I  now that I am older I am more aware of how it effects me. My grades immediately went from C's to high B's and the Highest gpa I've had in years. I quit taking it when I realized that it was destroying my life in the following ways:-Extreme OCD behavior-Depression-AntiSocial behavior-Muscular twitches-Dependence-Most of all, Loss of identityNaturally I am a outgoing person, I love people, I'm easy going, and always have a smile on my face but Adderall flipped my world upside down. I would not recommend any parent putting their child on this medication under any circumstance, if you care about them at all. ADD is not a disorder, it is just a way to classify people who function on a higher/different level than the average population. ADD is a gift that our society hasn't learned how to handle. My recommendation to parents would be to look for and encourage the abilities and gifts your child has, and be as supportive as you possibly can. They need to know that they are brilliant, creative, and gifted. The reason ADD'ers can't focus well is because they are constantly thinking! What kind of world do we live in when thinking needs to be medicated?!

It seemed to help at first, I was concentrating better, keeping up with tasks, and getting more things done. However, I'm also being treated for depression, and after only a few weeks I started noticing the symptoms of my depression coming back. After a full month on the drug, I was extremely irritable, overreacting to stress, crying at every little thing, snapping at friends and family... I really damaged a relationship with one friend, sadly. Upon talking to my doctor, I found out that Adderall can cause heightened emotions, which is exactly what I was trying to treat with the depression medication! She offered to put me on a mood stabilizer drug as well, but I said just take me off the Adderall and try something else for the ADD rather than adding another drug to fix its side effects. I'm trying Strattera now, we'll see how it works. The drug did what it was supposed to do, but honestly, my ADD isn't bad enough to warrant taking a drug with this kind of side effect.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	4/28/2008 1:39:04 PM	I first saw a doctor when I was 17 yrs. old seeking treatment for depression and constant lethargy. However, after answering a short questionnaire, I was diagnosed with ADD, and have been on Adderall (which was helpful at first) ever since. Now, I've been on the medication so long that I can't remember who, or how I was before I started taking it. In addition to causing my mild OCD to become full blown routine-altering OCD, I find that the medication increases my irritability 10 fold (especially when it's wearing off, and especially within the last year). I'm not sure if it is the medication or simply life circumstances that is now causing me severe depression, extreme lack of motivation, and weird and very sudden mood swings. I have also experienced more common side effects, like jaw clenching, tension, dizziness, and increased heart rate. I would like to try to stop taking the medication now, but feel I am dependent on it and am afraid of the withdrawal effects. I worry about the long term side effects that I may experience from taking this drug for so long, and the misery that it may/may not be causing me presently. I would NEVER consider putting a child on this medication.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	Cat-mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	4/27/2008 3:04:38 PM	I have taken a low dose of adderall for about five years, and it has changed my life. My ability to think ahead, anticipate and avoid problems has dramatically improved. My abilty to articulate myself improves dramatically on adderal  especially with a low dose.  I can understand the consequences of my actions with a clarity that I wish I had earlier in life J My over-all attention span has dramatically improved in the last five years  and it remains significantly higher even on days when I choose not to take adderall. To me, that is amazing. Tasks I once found painful, I can now do quickly an efficiently with patience and perfect detail  even off adderall. A large part of why I think I see a lot of improvement is not just the medication, but also all the other things I do to combat ADHD.When I need to learn something new (e.g. a software program at work) adderal helps me quickly learn and absorb the new information, and remember facts. It is a dramatic change from my past abilities.When I first started taking the drug, I had heart palpitations. It is definitely hard on the heart. BUT then I started to add regular, gentle but rigorous aerobic exercise to my routine (which, btw, is a non-prescription treatment for ADHD), my heart became stronger, more conditioned than before and the palpitations stopped. My resting hr is 45 bpm, and my blood pressure is ideal, or close to it. This also will solve any insomnia problems.I recommend this drug  FOR THE RIGHT PERSON. Fact is we are all built differently. Which is the whole reason why drugs like this are made in the first place. Depending on your peculiarities, it may not give you exactly what you need.  That doesnt mean this drug wont be very helpful to someone else. I look forward to the day when these types of drugs can be prescribed and monitored more accurately.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	c_jernigan, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	35-44	4/21/2008 11:26:17 AM	My initial response to Adderall XR was great - it changed my life, but then ... and there is always a &quot;but&quot; in life - the effects began to wear off and then I think that Adderall began muting my endocrine system.  In a nutshell - it significantly reduced my level of perceived anxiety. I didn't realize it, but I was probably living with a &quot;4&quot; on a 1 - 10 scale for general anxiety.  Adderall brought me down to a 1 or 2.  I think that basically after a month or two my adrenaline and other things were basically either all used up, or the receptor sites were burned out.  Basically there was no &quot;fire&quot; because all of the fuel had been burned up.  Also, I think that I had some mild depression creeping in - I became somewhat unmotivated, and really didn't want to do much physically.After about 1 year my libido dropped like a rock, my testicles felt as if they had shrunken to 1/2 their normal size.  My body temperature was always low - it was routinely in the mid 96 to low 97 range.  I had no physical strength nor endurance - where I had been previously in good shape and could crank out 25 pushups at any given time, I could only manage 20 or so &quot;girl&quot; pushups (supported by knees) after which time I was exhausted.  After working out, I didn't feel as if I was gaining any benefit or very minor benefit, almost as if I was having a muted recovery.  After initially becoming more organized I began slipping back, then I was maybe only 25% of my initial organization. I have stopped taking XR on a daily basis and have begun taking it only &quot;as needed&quot; - what my doctor doesn't know will not hurt him.  I think that something needs to be recharged - I am now an advocate of &quot;drug holidays&quot;, every other day usage, or simply &quot;as needed&quot; be that at work, or home. I never found myself feeling mentally addicted - but I did have brain fog for a couple of days when stepping down.I was on 30mg/day Adderall XR - 40yo male - ~18 months.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/16/2008 7:26:13 PM	I have been taking the XR 20mg a day for about 6 months now and it has completely changed my life. You would have never known I had an attention problem because I was a very active teenager.  I was involved in sports, many extracuricular activities and worked since I was 16 so my mind was constantly focused on something different.  It became a problem after becoming a single mom.  I couldn't organize any thought.  If there was too much going on I couldn't focus to organize it.  I didn't pay bills, I took extreme chances, and even forgot I was a mom sometimes.  After finally confessing to my mother how i felt she suggested talking to my PCP.  He gave me the 20mg XR 6 months ago and now I feel as though I am actually living my life.  I have since fixed my finances, gotten promoted at work, and enjoy my time with my daughter so much more.  I would suggest this treament to anyone as long as their Dr. agrees.  Use caution when taking this it can be very addicting, and should not for children that have no gone through puberty.  i have lost 30 pounds since start because of the lack of appetite and amount of exercise i do.  I also have about two nights a week that i have trouble falling asleep.  over all I thank myself every day for being able to communicate how I felt.  I am finally the person I always wanted to be and never thought could be.

Its been a miracle for my school and work life.  However, this drug is addicting and can easily be abused.  It has really helped me but I worry about my dependence on it and the effects it may be having on my heart in the long run.  Using this drug takes a lot of self discipline but if you can be responsible with it it can truly help the quality of your life.  I have suffered with Attention Deficit problems my entire life and once I was diagnosed as an adult and I started taking this drug I finally felt like I was a normal functioning human being.  I am not a space cadet anymore, I can finish tasks, ext...  I recommend this drug but with caution.

It's difficult for me to sleep sound (taking 1 mg of Ativan at bedtime), so I'm not sure about taking another dose.  I'll be increasing to 30mg in 1 week, but will that help my afternoon crash?  Also, is there anything out there that can help me sleep better?Overall, I'm super stoked on Adderall...It's been the only thing that has helped me concentrate (I'm reading books like I just discovered how to read)...

I set the alarm for an hour before I need to be up and when the alarm goes off, I wake up just long enough to swallow the pill with a bunch of water then I go back to sleep. Without fail, I wake up almost exactly an hour later feeling awake and energetic. The energy continues throughout the day and wears off in time for me to fall asleep easily. Until the early evening I have very little appetite but if I decide I have to eat, it's not difficult and generally my appetite returns a bit once i start eating. I feel totally able to pay attention to my work, writing papers, reading textbooks, focusing in lectures which was impossible before Adderall or when I miss a dose. I took Ritalin for several months before switching to Adderall with no effect at all.

It helped alright. It helped me pull al-nights without feeling tired the next morning. I could work through the whole night in fact. However, it took a full 24 hours to get out of my system. Until then. no matter how badly my system craved sleep, I didn't feel tired and could not fall asleep. I felt really miserable. Without it, I wouldnt have dont well on my exams. But I would never take this unless I had to. It makes you feel funny. puts pressure on your head, and makes you stay awake. Overall, not fun to be on. A better schedule works much better.

However, the side effects as of late have been interfering with my job. 2 hours after taking the medication with food, I begin to hot flash and sweat a lot. I drink massive amounts of water to counter this, but then am left with having to urinate constantly. I also experience bad cotton mouth.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/1/2008 12:21:45 AM	I have always struggled in school and my parents did not believe in ADD or ADHD.  I would listen to someone talk to me for 10 minutes and not be able to tell you one word that they said.  I went from a D student at a very good university to making the Dean's list.  I have read a few negative reviews of this drug, and I must say that I believe those who had negative opinions about the drug were either on the wrong dosage, or did not need the medication in the first place.  This medecation has changed my life. After 5 years of struggling in college I finally graduated, 1 year after starting adderall.  I am proud of myself and proud of my work.  Also,  I no longer experience the anxiety that I always had before I started the medication.  I would use caution while taking this medicine, because it can be easily abused.  If you abuse it, you will not get the results that the medication is prescribed for.  If you start taking it for the purpose that it is intended for, it can and will change your life.

I am now 25, and I decided to try this medication perscribed by my new psychiatrist; who has rediagnosed me with ADHD.  During the first day of two 30mg. tablets I did fine, with the exception of a few jitters.  I wasn't sleepy or depressed as usual.  After consulting my doctor, he said it was a sign that I should double my dosage.  Then came the second and third days.  I was a maniac!  I would sit for hours preforming illogical tasks that I couldn't stop; like combing my hair for 6 hours.  My eyes were dialated, I ached from being tense, and I also felt disconnected from the world.  I was very irritable, paranoid, dizzy, sweating, short of breath, and OCD.  I couldn't fall asleep without prescription medications.  I was too anxious to even take the trash out.  I will never take stimulants of this kind again.  Afterall, I know I am bipolor, but the thought of removing that diagnosis gained enough of my trust to try stimulants.  I've never felt more crazy!  The days just flew by and I have no idea what I did.  Needless to say, I'm looking for a new doctor.

It is very difficult to take this medicine as prescribed because it keeps me up all night and has terrible side effects. I've experienced extreme anxiety that did not exist before I started along with chest pain, tightness in my chest, labored breathing, jaw pain/teeth clenching, headaches, dizziness, loss of coordination etc... I've tried lowering the dose as well as raising it but still experience the same sypmtoms. I will be fine taking it if I havent had it in a few days but the come down is so terrible that I am unable to sleep properly for the next 2 days and experience a hangover so terrible that I am unable to take it again for at least 3 days. It did help me concentrate but makes me extremely antisocial and fearful of speaking in a classroom or out in public. I was not like this before I started taking it. I also have been getting terrible panic attacks so bad that I need to lay down and force myself to sleep until it passes. After I did more research on Adderall and realized it was just SYNTHETIC CRYSTAL METH in a pill form I am no longer suprised at the hell I went through. I think it's terrible that the FDA is allowing so many citizen's to become pharmaceutical speed addicts...especially when it is precribed to a child.about me- age 23 female 130lbs

For years I have had a hard time sleeping at night without taking melatonin or simply sleep every night. Also have always had a hard time concentrating and focusing on reading/work. Finally decided to go to a doctor to see what was up. I decided to stop taking all sleeping pills beforehand. Doctor prescribes 15mg/ 2x a day (non-xr, I did not want the XR as I already have a hard enough time falling asleep). After taking adderall for a few days, I has undoubtedly made me MUCH more tired - within an hour or two of taking my pill I could easily fall asleep. In fact, I would prob use these to help me fall asleep as they make me more tired than a full dose of simply sleep. Have not helped at all for concentration or focusing. I feel like I'm more in &quot;my own little world&quot; and less hungry. I would find it hard to imagine that taking more would do anything but intensify the effects it has already had.

I talked to my doctor about it after I got an office job. I too am one of those people that can read every word in a paragraph and have no idea what it said because my mind was elsewhere. I couldn't listen to a solid sentence someone was saying to me for the same reason. After taking adderall I worked so much more efficiently and understood a lot more. It was as if my head was pulled out of a cloud or something. I really wish I had been more aware of this condition in high school. I was always a decent student making average grades but it was very difficult for me to really understand and grasp things, especially in math. I had a very appathetic attitude towards high school and my efforts to go to college were lacking...and as a result of that I still haven't gone back to school. Knowing how much better I could have done in high school if I had been prescribed to it then really makes me wonder how much more I could have accomplished as far as scholarships and things of that nature. Overall, taken responsibly adderall has been 100% effective. The biggest side effect I'v experienced has been a lack of hunger. I've lost probably 20 pounds in the last 8 months. I just make sure I eat before I take it and drink nutritional shakes throughout the day.

Before Adderall I would begin reading the first few pages and not remember or understand what I have just read. And then have to go back again and read it over. Now reading has become a joy. I can for the first time memorize Bible Scripture. I'm focused.Also finishing projects around my home are completed. Befor I would have 5-6 little fix it jobs all going on and not completed. The same at work running around working my butt off and at the end of day, I'll remember invoices not made out that should of been done in the morning. This is all differant now. I do First things First and finish them to the end.            What an blessing For me and my family.Prayers are answered. Thanks Jesus....Again

Not diagnosed until my early 40's, I struggled to complete tasks at hand. Now, not only do I complete them, I'm able to go above and beyond the tasks at hand. As well, I'm able to keep my weight at managable levels. Also, my energy levels are up and my depression is all but ameliarated. I just wish the Dr would have found the Dx sooner.

By far the adderall is the best. Even though everyonce in a while my body builds a tolerence and i have to up the dosage. Mild side affects, loss of appitite, and insomina. But that is only if i take it later then 4pm.

For the first time i see why adderral is such a miracle.  You can still be your self you know chit chat whatever I believe that should never be controlled- and no brain chatter either. I highly reccomend adderall.

However this dug is very habit forming and I do not recomend children taking this medication at all. If you have to use this medication use as directed and have someone monitor you while taking, very easy to abuse. I took myself of the medication cause I noticed I was abusing it. The withdrawls off this medication are horrible and I don't recommend stoping this medication suddenly, it hurts. I felt like those people you see on T.V. coming off heroin.
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	addledinindiana, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	55-64	1/31/2008 4:36:55 PM	Adult ADDer diagnosed at 5 yrs 'hyperkinetic:' prescr barbituates. At 9, diff doc prescr Dexedrine: huge improvement. Family moved: no dr, no meds. 'til school insisted I be treated. New doc prescr Dexedrine. Life again improved significantly. Another family move: no meds, no dr.  Impulse took hold: I ran away &amp; got married. New OB/GYN precr Obetrol (Adderall) &amp; amphetamine for ADHD/extreme impulsivity. I felt normal again. First son was a Rit kid, diagnosed ADHD at 5 years. As an adult, my hyperactivity DECREASED, while other ADD symptoms INCREASED: inattentiveness, distractions, severe impulsivity, reckless behavior. I tried all the ADHD meds and methyphenidates do not work for me. On Dex Spansules &amp; tabs 'til the '90s. Thanks to Dex, I finished HS/college and attained a career (which didn't last). In '92, p-doc took me from ADD meds to HIGH doses of SSRIs. Spun out-of-control for over a decade.  Moved to IN in '02. After a couple of incidents resulting from my ADD I stopped SSRIs. Dr refused to prescr ADD meds &amp; said she didn't &quot;believe&quot; in ADHD. She wrote Provigil for &quot;focus&quot; and a CPAP machine for sleep disorder, neither did 'squat.' Hit rock-bottom 3 months ago &amp; found a NP who prescribed Adderall XR 20 mg. It helped a TINY BIT. At my pleading, she raised XR to 30mg &amp; added a 10 mg d-amp tab to be broken in half, 5 mg in AM with XR, 5 mg early to mid PM.Her concern is my age. Phys health is GOOD: no heart, liver, kidney, lung problems. Low BP all my life. Never smoked, rarely drink maybe glass of wine once a month. XR is slow-starting, so mornings are shot before I know it, then have severe sleepy period in mid-aft. XR kicks in again around 5PM but then I hyperfocus on all the wrong things until 10-11PM, when I binge &amp; fidget until I go to sleep with xanax around 1AM.Here is my personal dx: I'm under-dosed. On Adderall XR, a minimum 60mg x 2 plus 10mg D-amp x 2.Preference is Dex Spans + 5mg Dex tabs x 3.XR's inconsistent &amp; a rollercoaster ride.

There are times when I still feel sleepy, but overall it has been working well. I haven't fallen asleep at work, as I had been before at least 2 to 3x's a day. I have also been able to feel comfortable driving myself and my son. Before I would have someone drive and there had been incident where I had fallen asleep at the wheel which was very scary.

It has affected my job performance, school and home life. Recently My doctor prescribed me to adderall XR 20mg capsules after i addressed this problem with him. Since taking the medication i have been able to complete tasks without being distracted and my concentration is superb. Places i have felt &quot;lost&quot; in thought or daydreaming no longer affect me. Would reccomend for people with this condition but be sure to read all of the literature that comes with the drug.

I was not diagnosed with ADD/ADHD until the start of my treatment.  With this treatment I have noted some very distinct changes in my performance in college and now in my career.  I am a Mechanical Engineer in NC.  My focus at work seems to be increased but not over the top.  I finally feel that I can start a project and follow it through to the end.  Finishing the minute details that have plagued me in the past and that I have procrastinated with in the past.  I feel that Adderall oral is an effective treatment for my condition.  Although I strongly urge parents and students to take caution with using this treatment option.  I have noticed a weekly to bi-weekly occurrence of limited sleep for one to two nights.  This seems to typically happen on a Friday night and Sunday nights.  As this has continued I feel that there are some other treatments that I should attempt before settling on this one.  Also as I was diagnosed during my final semester of college with ADD/ADHD I noticed that I suddenly had more friends then the prior 5 years of college.  So parents, students in college with go to extreme measures to acquire Adderall from your child. This is also becoming an increasing concern for college campuses across the nation.  Like I said before, I believe, this medication should be taken consistently and you shouldn't miss many treatments.  Missing treatments has made me extremely groggy and lazy.  So caution to not taking it on the weekends.  I have noticed that when I continued treatment for 7 days a week I didn't have the haze, groggy and lazy feeling.  Also I reduce my dosage to half during the weekends. I hope this helps all in some manner.

Although it doesn't work like it used to, I can't function without it. It tends to make me a little irritable and anxious at times. Within the last 6-8 months I've noticed leg pain, tingling, and swelling. I'm unsure if it's related to medication. I've tried other meds but none has helped. Side effects can be annoying, but benefits are worth it.

I suffered from SWSD, Major dep. disorder, obesity, an other afflictions, and adderall seems to alleviate them all. The one draw back is it does give me panick attacks, but it far outweighs the side effects.

He wanted to try adderol first. I can definately tell a difference when I take my medicine, &amp; when I do not. My son was held back last year at school,&amp; at semester they moved him back up, so Im contributing alot of that to the adderol.

My apologies with my spelling but my problems is called ideo-pathic-hyper- somnia. This just means there is no explanation for why this is the way that I am. I have taken test after test, 2- overnight sleep studies and 1 -three day sleep study. My results have been seen by many specialtist and nothing. I am on 30mgs -3 times a day totalling 90mgs of adderall and 20 mgs of ritilin /3 times a day totalling 60 mgss a day and with both of these I can still sleep and sleep hard. I go through good days and bad days or sperts. The bad days or sperts out do the good days. I have tried every drug possible and every strength, I have tried anti-depressants, narcoleptic medications and nothing works. At first adderall was wonderful and gave me my life back, but it has been almost 3 years and it just doesn't do it anymore. It helps slightly but I have to force my self to do anything and everything. I don't know what to do anymore. I am willing to try anything, I just want to be normal again, I want to be able to play with my kids, I don't want to be cranky anymore. I want to live, I am to young to be this old. Can anyone help.

It wasn't diagnosed until March '07 and that's when my Dr. gave me Adderall. It gave me my life back. I started on 20mg/day, now I take 40mg 3/day. It took a couple of months to find the right dosage and level off. I would have to write a book to explain what I was going through, and what I was putting my family through...so I will spare you of that. But don't take this drug just to lose weight, it's a serious medication with some side effects. Go on a diet.

I have all A's in college and beforeI started taking it I was almost being pushed to drop out of high school by my schools administration. It tastes REALLY bad to me thats the only bad thing, they should make it in a capsul maybe? But it's been life changing in an amazing way for me. I no theres been some negitiveity about the drug lately but this drug helps so many people, I believe people need to be more caucious while taking Adderall but the lives Adderall is improving is amazing. It's really a breakthrough drug for people with ADHD.

Other	Fred, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/13/2007 3:51:40 AM	I took this medication because of my ADD problems in high school. My doctor originally started me off with a drug that is almost exactly Ritalin. I started with it in freshman year due to my lowly grades and noticeable problems. I started using the ritalin like drug, but saw no satisfying results. It also seemed to be correlated with having sleeping problems, appetite loss, and depression. So i stopped using it. When i went to my doctor and told him about  it he seemed to realize that the ritalin wasn't causing the stress and other problems, but it was just the the troubles of freshman year. The drug and my problems weren't actually connected. My doctor prescribed adderall for me in my sophomore year, and i almost instantaneously saw the improvements, faster reaction time, less daydreaming, and i could keep my grades up and remember my work with ease. Luckily i had parents that trusted me enough to let me keep the medication in my own place(in my room) because i was ashamed at first to have to take something to make myself better. It was as if it kind of lifted a disability completely off of my shoulders. Ive taken it all the way through college and stopped when i graduated, i experienced no real withdrawal, I just had to make a smooth transition which my doctor helped me with greatly. If taken in the right doses and not obsessed about it seems to be a very good help for my future and self esteem.Just realize that what you see as depression and other related things could very well be the much more stressful and much more dangerous thing called high school.

During that year my grades went from A's and B's to C's or below. Its not that i wasn't a hard worker, i just couldn't concentrate on school work. Its a great medicine and works if used correctly. There are a few complications with it if you take 40 mg or higher for a long period of time (i.e-years) i have read that there is a possiblity of heart complications. But if you stay at a healthy dose and don't go overboard..it works. Also, adderall XR is great b/c you only have to take it once a day, instead of twice a day. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/10/2007 6:05:27 PM	I have to say that I was very weary of using a drug for my adult ADHD (inattentive type) but adderall really makes my life alot easier. Though adderall is not a &quot;silver bullet&quot; it greatly helped me reach my potential as a college student. In high school I went undiagnosed and subsequently untreated which resulted in my sub par grades. It wasnt until college when I talked to my pyschiatrist who throughly evaluated me and first tried me on Ritalin which made me extremely tired, then finally Adderall. Adderall and therapy have allowed me to stay focused and acheive more than I ever dreamed possible. I'm now on the deans list with a 4.0 in my senior year of college. I was also really lucky to not really have any side effects or withdrawl symptoms, although if I take it too late in the day I have a hard time falling asleep, but thats to be expected from an amphetimine.

Also, the withdrawl when you forget to take it is exceedingly painful.

I can focus and pay attention much better than I ever have.  I think it is necessary for me, and I will still take it, but the reason I am only somewhat satisfied is because there are some pretty prominent side effects: Loss of appitite, hard to sleep, dry mouth, and occassionally stomach aches, and sweats

It slows my brain activity down so I can at least appreciate a converstaion.  I gave it a 4 star twice only becasue I have OCD too, and when I take it, it worsens my OCD.

As a college student, I thought it was normal to be unable to focus on my professors in class or to have trouble finishing my papers or reading homework assignments.  I would often become so obsessed with the details of a project I would not be able to finish and become discouraged. Adderall keeps me focused in class and helps me get my homework done in a timely matter. Now I don't procrastinate because I am confident that I will be able to perform successfully.

Nonetheless, - perhaps 50%+ of the time Adderall has been quite helpful in getting me in focus and on track.That is a great benefit because I find myself restlessly pacing much of the time and unable to initiate or complete projects, Often I have felt too defeated to even hoppe to begin a project. I have lived with thisa painful condition for 20 years or more. When I do dfocus i can becaome very effective and creative. It has been a strained interior battle to find ways to establish a balance and a rhythm in daily life.I also take the antidepressant Cymbalta and often I also need to take Artivan.So, it is a frustrating story. Adderall is a great help when it helps, and yet i worry about dependence and also the apparent habituation.All medications for mood and behavior seem to offer complicated trade-offs requiring frequent self-evaluation and consultation with doctors and also with friends and family. Often I feel embarrassed that I seem to need these types of medicines, and yet is  clear that for me they are helpful and also problematic.

I've tried 10mg/day in 2 doses and also 10mg/day in 1 XR (extended release) dose.  It has been incredibly helpful.  I get more done in 1 day than I used to in a week or more.  My husband doesn't come home to find me in the middle of 10 unfinished &quot;projects&quot;.  The 2 major downsides for me are the addictiveness and the loss of appetite.  I am a mess if I don't take it, and I am naturally a very small person to begin with, so the loss of appetite can be a pretty serious problem.  Eating &amp; maintaining a reasonable weight is a daily struggle, but at least now I can keep up with my responsibilities enough that I even have time to eat!

My symptoms did not include hyperactivity but rather the ability to stay focused on anything detailed for any length of time. Ex: Im an Internet Sales Manager at a car dealership. At the start of this career 2.5 years ago, I did not have the energy, patience, attention span to learn the intricates of computers/websites/email programs. Since, I rose to the top of my industry to level of Consulting dealerships on how to sell more cars from the internet.Had I been medicated in high school, believe I could've been able to excel much further in school and career at that time, not in my mid thirties.
Other		4	5	3			11/27/2007 6:05:57 PM	The main problem with Adderall is that it is extremely addictive. I started taking it to help me get through classes and work. I loved that it killed my appetite. I thought I'd be able to take it in moderation, but I take it everyday now. I just feel like a happier person when I take it. But I've noticed that I am distant and easily annoyed if I take too much. Sometimes I feel that I'm on the verge of having a panic attack. If I take 15 MG a day and I eat I feel amazing. But its very easy to avoid eating and take 30 MG because you just get so much done. Im very nervous that I will become strongly addicted to the drug. Im also nervous that I will loose too much weight. Scary.

My thought process is much more organized and my ability to stay focused on a conversation and tuned into the subject at hand has improved immensely.  I have over the years tried to slow and constrain my hyperactivity with lorasapam and other sedatives with only a moderate amount of success; major side effect was drossiness and fatigue. I looked into the possibilities of Adderall after speaking with a coworker who was prescribed Adderall several years ago and how he was able to continue his education due to his ability effectively concentrate.  After reading more about the symptoms associated with ADD it seemed to be a perfect match to my condition. This medication has reduced much of my public speaking inhibition; I find that I am more out going, in control, less critical of my self, and more inclined to participate in meeting and activities with minimum anxiety. My sexual drive is actually more enhanced. I am taking 5mg three times daily, but am still adjusting the dosage to alleviate side effects (inability to fall asleep at night) and achieve the maximum benefit. This has been an extremely positive life changing treatment for ADD.

I am the typical ADD patient. My mind was racing in a hundred directions at once so I wasn't able to focus on anything. Addy helps me slow down and focus my brain enough to acutally complete the tasks I need to and to do it efficiently. Of course, in the beginning, I got a few side effects - dry mouth, appetite loss, diarrhea (dont take with coffee - TRUST ME), and some insomnia. I also found myself craving cigarettes for some odd reason. I found that if I ate a meal before taking it in the morning that it almost eliminated most of them. After a few months your body will get used to it. I DO recommend that if you don't need it on the weekends that you don't take it. That way, your body won't be as likely to get addicted to it. I've been taking it for 4 years and I LOVE IT.

After finding out my older brother had ADHD I started looking into it. What I found was I was a dead on case. So it's been 2 weeks on Adderal and it has made my life easier on every level. Keep in mind it is a stimulant so follow the dose and be true to yourself and talk with your doctor about your reactions on the drug.  Sleep and appetite our at times and issue, but remember to eat frequently and don't take adderall near bed-time. The positives far out weigh anything else. You can actually go thru life and take things as they come.  It doesn't have to feel like you against the world when facing tasks, challenges etc.  A+ for this...

With others I lost weight and felt sickly 24/7 (sick to my stomach, weak, lightheaded, dry mouth, just generally terrible). I started taking Adderall, initially in a VERY small dose and I noticed significant improvement. My doctor and I played with the dosage and I'm so happy with the result. The ONLY set back is feeling jittery every now and again. The best solution for that is just to make sure you're eating an appropriate amount. Not tons, but just spread out small meals and snacks and this won't pose a problem. Eating this way is way more healthy anyways. So now I can focus and feel very optimistic about getting things done everyday instead of dreading everything and having no energy, will or attention to finish things (school work). Great drug. I was very nervous to start taking it because I normally refuse all medicine... but this REALLY helped. Just be careful with dosage and eating.

He is having severe mood swings (bordering bipolar disorder), is paranoid, violent, irrational, and unpredictable.  He refuses to consider that it is the medication.  I have noticed a pattern with him;  each time he has a big project at work that he needs to put in a lot of overtime on, he takes excess amounts of the Adderall.  Each time this happens, we have huge and dangerous fights, often started over some minor incident.  For instance, he accused me of being an irresponsible wife, mother, parent because I did not walk the dog every day.  I'm seeing a therapist regarding how to deal with his changes in behavior and irrational and volitile temperment.

Adderall has also helped with my constant fidgeting. The thing I don't like about it though is that when I'm put into stressful situation I feel more anxiety than before I started the medication. And so far, even though I understand others better, I still find it challenging to process my own thoughts quickly and effectively. I have so many things popping into my head that its all just a jumble and I cant get my ideas out in a way that works for others. Maybe thats just because I have only been taking it for a few months or am not on the correct dosage yet. Dont let it defer you.

I worry that I will have a heart attack and that I am too dependent on this drug.  However, I'm too afraid of life off of it to alleviate that fear.

She has had no side effects. From hoping that she would graduate high school to her being a top student in college, it has been amazing.

It works well for me, although it took a long time to find the correct doseage-10mg, but I could NEVER imagine giving this to a child. I am on a low dose and I really feel side effects. Such as tenseness, irratation, lightheadedness, and I just am not myself when I take it. Although the drug does work, I would only recommend it for adults that know their bodies well and know how and when it works for them. It does have sexual side effects as well. For those looking for something for a child, look for something other than these meds, they are NOT for children!

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity		1	5	1			9/24/2007 1:33:08 PM	I loath adderall. For whatever reason, it worked for about 6 weeks, and then my moods started getting weird. After taking Adderall for 2 months, I had several severe panic attacks. I never had a panic attack previously. I'd much rather be on ritalin.

Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/21/2007 12:16:56 PM	As an accomplished woman, I didn't know I had ADD until after middle age when increasing I couldn't complete tasks. Depression and loss of self esteem set in but once diagnosed and on medication I was able to slow down, concentrate and finish jobs. I never realized how my mind raced from subject to subject until I was on medication - 4 years now. 
Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/20/2007 8:14:25 AM	It was a wonder for me! I had spent tons of money in medical bills and doctors visits only to realize that what I was battleing with was adult ADHD. This hadn't been as much of a problem for me when I was younger until my job had changed drastically and I lost my ability to focus. Work was terrible and my performance was slipping which made me seem deppressed. Once I started on the medication, it has been like I am a different person. I don't give up on tasks, I complete them, I listen to people when they talk to me,and overall I accomplish the goals I set forth each day. Thank God my doctor finally listened when others did not.
