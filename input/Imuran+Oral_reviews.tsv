Ulcerated Colon	55-64 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5		55-64	8/9/2012 2:21:47 PM	Currently having a flare up for 8 weeks now. Blood test indicates I need to increase dosage.i have been on imuran for 3 years and have been free of flare ups until 2 months ago.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	NF, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/1/2012 4:28:46 PM	I've been on Imuran for over 3 weeks now.  I am being treated for Seronegative Spondeloarthritis.  Basically I am HLA-B 27 + and my imune system is attacking my joints causing severe pain to the point that I almost couldn't walk.  I am 26 years old.  I started out on 50 mil and just increased to 100 mil.  When I started and increased I was extremely nauseated for the entire day and couldn't eat anything, but I never threw up or had diahrrea.  So far there is no pain and it seems to be working for me.  I go to run my labs in a few weeks and I am anxious to make sure that it is not affecting my kidney/ liver/ blood cells.  I can say though that the other side affects I seem to be having include sleepyness/ tiredness all the time and my teeth burn when I drink anything now which did not happen before.  Also I was severely constipated to the point of hurting at first, but I took a few stool softeners and got some relief and I have not had to take anymore as it seems to kind of be going away.  I will leave another review once I see if it's affecting my labs and still working for me.  Good luck and God Bless.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Helen, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	3/4/2012 12:09:48 PM	Since I have other life-threatening conditions ie Lupus Anti-coagulant with thrombosis to Superior Vena Cava and both R&amp;L subclavian veins, I was already immune compromised, have had two granuloma's removed from L lung prior to being diagnosed with RA. Frequent and severe sinus infections,3 episodes of pleural effusion following lung surgery, HX if frequent pneumonias of vari-ing bacterial infections.  It just wasn't worth the risk to me.  Since being diagnosed with RA I have developed nodules all over my ribs and a new nodule on my R arm near a blood vessel and it keeps growing.  I presently take 20 mg of Arava with 50 mg of doxycycline daily.

It has significantly decreased the activity of my lupus with less outbreaks.  My concern is the affect it may have on my kidneys and/or liver.  Recent tests indicated a change in kidney function but I am being closely monitored by my reuhmatologists.  So far my liver and other organs are ok.  Will post any changes.

This drug combination will cause the Imuran to increase to toxic levels and shut down a functioning bone marrow system. My brilliant PCP did this and I ended up in the hospital at 10K a day. No one could figure it out, because doctors' are stupid. The pharmacy missed it, because CVS hits enter to bypass it's DUR in order to fill prescriptions quickly. This little adventure cost me over $10,000 in out of pocket costs. It was not my mistake and I have to come up with the 10K. Good luck out there, and be careful.

I have had my up and down moments when I had to take prednisone to help the process but I am alive and lead a very normal life. I still have frequent liver panels to check my standings but I'm doing well considering my long term treatment. But I always remember I was told I would have 10 more years to live if untreated but treated with Imuran, here I am leading a normal life with my own liver.

Well 5 yrs ago I was diagnoised with skin cancer. Still to this day I am having several lesions of the skin cancer removed from my body.  Approx. 20-25 lesions removed so far.  The Dr. told me it will never go away but will slow down, after 5 years it hasn't slowed down so when will it ?? Does anyone know that answer???  I look like a walking brown spot, the brown spots cover my entire body along with the lesions.  This really bothers me I will not wear shorts out in public because of the skin problem on my legs.  Honestly I feel more research needs to be done before they release medications.  Because now I will have saqmous cell cancer removed from my body for the rest of my life.

It's done wonders. However, I do get sick a little more frequently due to the suppressed immune system and my illnesses tend to last longer. I take a multivitamin and folic acid to counteract this as much as possible. That does help. It's kind of a pain to get blood work ever few months and I'm terrible at remember to do that, but overall, I'm very happy with this medication. It works so well, I sometimes forget I have UC.

The first six weeks were fine and most of my problems were due to the prednisone.  But suddenly I began vomiting and having a lot of diarrhea, along with weakness and loss of appetite.  My stools were also whitish.  My doctors took me off the imuran and I started feeling better immediately.  Because asacol has not kept me in remission, we'll have to discuss remicade or something else now.

It has been pretty effective in slowing (not stopping) the progress of this disease.  No bad side effects.  Coupled with prednisone, some side effects to be managed include night sweats, weight gain and insomnia.

Went on pentasa but had flareup and was put on imuran- 150mg in 2003.  It was very effective until this year when I am starting to have active Crohn's again and am moving on to a biologic.  After the resection I began to exercise and get into shape and felt better than I have ever felt.  I was also able to reduce my stress level and eat right and get plenty of rest.  All the side effects listed for this drug scared the hell out of me.  I had no side affects on imuran and felt better than I had ever felt.

Works great for the flares, but I now have yeast in my urine 2nd time in 2 months. While on the meds for the yeast I have to temporarilly stop the other. Pharmacist said this could be a chronic problem, not just with this med but all immune supressants.  I go to my doctor in a few days, this will be a rotten choice, more so since I am happily married and we are still active (if you know what I mean).  Would like any input if anyone has tried any &quot;herbal or natural remedies&quot; I've not tried anything like that yet.

Approximately 3 weeks after starting the regimen, I noticed cuts were not healing quickly, and my face broke out with pimples. I never had as many zits when I was a teenager! I have no idea whether it was efficacious or not---I didn't feel anything one way or another. I stopped taking it and reported this to the doc. Outcome is pending.

I've experienced very mild side effects but I am on a very low dosage (50 mg) so I am not sure if dosage is directly related to worse side effects. I don't know if other people experienced the same, but eventough it is working bringing my liver enzimes down, it didn't touch a bit the disease symptoms. What I mean by that is that I still have the symptoms related to AIH, MCTD, Lupus, etc... and they are pretty much as bottersome as they use to be before I started the treament. It might have stopped the cyrrosis process but it doens't make a difference in terms of symptoms... not sure if someone else experienced the same.

He's doing very well.  Has not been on predizone is 11 months.  He has his blood drawn every 3 months. His GI doctor started talking about Remicade this summer, but the increase in Imuran did the trick.  He's only going to the restroom 1-2 times a day right now.  Gaining weight.

Been on Remicade since - no picnic either with the colds and infections, etc. at the drop of a hat but it does help w/ Crohn's symptoms and the alternative (steroids) is not one I'm willing to try.

They think it is from all the trauma to my immune system (along with prior drugs I have taken).

Long time RA patient of over 35 years. Imuran worked very well for my RA condition for about 5 years, then side effects settled in with the advent of Skin Cancer. I was on 50mg x 4 a day and reduced to 2mg x 2 a day. The skin cancer remained a problem, so I need to evaluate staying on Imuran.

Only one thing: I am heading off to the doctor this week for suspected skin cancer. Now, it could be because I am fair skinned, red-haired, etc., and that my mom also has skin cancer, but I have always been so protected from the sun because of my fairness. I am a bit nervous that if this IS skin cancer, will the doctor make me stop taking Imuran? I don't want to go back on Prednisone to control my Crohns...

Other	happy2balive, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	4/22/2009 1:02:27 AM	I have dermatomyositis, after having &quot;serious&quot; side effects after 5 years on methotrexate, was put on Imuran. Typical side effects at first, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, hair loss, none of which were as severe as when first put on methotrexate. It has kepp my disease under control and my CPK numbers remain in the normal range. Have never attained remission, also on prednisone, but have been able to lower that dose which is great because my bones have suffered from the steriod use. Already have had to have two total hip replacements from the prednisone, constant broken bones for no reason except bones are so weak. My doctor says, the side effects of the methotrexate and Imuran are as bad if not worse than the disease itself, but better than not being able to move at all from the muscle disease. Still have to take two kinds of pain meds. Also have lung issues, whether from the meds or the muscle disease, not sure which.

You have to increase the dosage slowly and wait about 3 months before you can increase it again but once you get the doasage right, it really does help control symptoms.

Onset about 3 years after start of treatment. I have not been a sunworshipper, so I think the blame might lie with the prolonged use of Imuran.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	Valerie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	8/17/2008 1:12:16 PM	I purchased 180 quantity bottle and took 1 50mg Imuran 2x daily for 9 days. Negative effects of rash on arms one day and legs the following day, severe upper arm muscle pain in mornings. 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease		1	3	1			7/27/2008 8:19:21 PM	I only experienced negative side effects--the most bothersome to me: a tumor on my face, that had to be removed--because of Imuran's risk of skin cancer--leaving a very large scar on my face. I also had bad acne, but was also on prednisone and asacol. The cystic acne left scars, which goes nice with the large scar I have from the tumor--I had perfect skin before; now my skin looks horrible. It gave me yellow skin (possible liver damage). I was sick the whole time I was on it, kept getting infections, and was always vomiting. I felt unusually weak and tired, and I know it wasn't my disease--I felt normal when I stopped taking Imuran. It also gave me warts. I wouldn't recommend using this if you're young. This drug, along with prednisone, really destroyed my self-esteem and ruined my life. It has serious risks--leukemia, lymphoma, and skin cancer. Your doctor's supposed to monitor you closely while you're on it; mine didn't. If you do use it, you absolutely have to have a competent doctor. If not, Crohn's will be the least of your worries. The Mayo Clinic even points out that because the way Imuran works some side effects might not be noticed until years after using it. &quot;Also, because of the way this medicine acts on the body, there is a chance that it might cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used. These delayed effects may include certain types of cancer, such as leukemia, lymphoma, or skin cancer. However, the risk of cancer seems to be lower in people taking azathioprine for arthritis.&quot;[1] Your doctor should definitely tell you that before using it--mine didn't--and if yours doesn't, find a new doctor; that's their job; they're actually legally required to tell you that; they know nothing will happen to them if they don't though. So the ones that just care about money, they won't. [1]http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-info rmation/DR601561

Spent to weeks and had 12 blood  tranfusions 9 units of platlets and a shot every day for 2 weeks so that my bone marrow would start producing blood cells.

Within 3 weeks of taking Imuran I was in the emergency room with inflamed pacreatitus and swollen stomach stomach problems.  This drug basically cased my digestive system to swell shut.  after a CT scan, Upper chest X ray, Gall Bladder scan, ndocsopy and 3 days in the hospital it was found that Imuran caused the issues.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	mzmuskratt@aol.com, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/24/2007 6:04:23 PM	I was prescribed 50 mg in the am and pm. By the second dose, I was experiencing nausea. Second day: experiencing severe nausea and dry heaves. Third day: excruciating constant headaches.  By the forth day, I could not walk alone and all the other symptoms remained as well. I discontinued the medication upon doctor's orders. It took another five days to semi-recover from the symptoms. I still am having some mental comprehension issues (9 days after discontinuing Imuran) and my Lupus symptoms are increasing since my immune system is no longer suppressed (fever, rash, pain, fatigue, etc).
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	Midwest UC Warrior, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/4/2007 12:07:33 PM	Medication takes several months for full effectiveness, but has been very effective in maintaining remission. The upside: I now take meds once/day (rather than Asacol 3x/day), and I have experienced no side effects - my bloodwork always looks very good. The downside: Bloodwork every 3 months to monitor liver function. When the work schedule is hectic it is a nuisance to have to work in a trip to the lab, but it is certainly worth it to maintain remission. Also,the blood test that is needed to thoroughly check Imuran levels can only be done by a lab in California, and is not covered by my insurance (but I've only had to do that once).

I have had skin cancers that go away and reappear. The worst side effect is it is destroying my liver...my liver enzymes are off the charts and the doctors can't find a comparable drug that is less dehabilitating to the liver.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	10/25/2007 9:51:47 AM	This medicine took months to improve my Ulcerative Colitis and I'm still not in remission.  So my doctor had me go up to 150 mg. and now my hair is falling out.   
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	duffer, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/24/2007 6:15:31 AM	I've been using this drug for about 20 years and it has been extemely effective in controlling my Crohn's disease. I've had no side effects and no reoccurances since I been on this drug. I have my blood checked every 3 months, no problems.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	10/19/2007 9:52:22 AM	This drug worked well for me in relieving my Crohn's disease for a couple of years. The side effects were minimal, though I did catch colds much more easily and did get a case of chicken pox, despite having them previously. Unfortunately, it has stopped working as well for me. We don't know if we should edge up the dose, carefully, because of previous low white blood count on 6-MP or if it is time to move to Remicade or another treatment. 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	25-34	10/2/2007 2:55:13 PM	I still had a UC flare up in spite of increased dose.  Recently had B-12 and folate anemia, but seems to have cleared up with prescription pre-natal vitamins (not for pregnancy).  Recently learned that my doctor was suprised to find out that brand name drug &quot;Imuran&quot; was substituted with generic azathioprine and she said that they are different in the way the dosages are prescribed and that could explain why it wasn't working (my dose was metabolized too well by my body and thus was not therapeutic) for the past year.  She and I will begin adjusting my dose accordingly now, knowing that I'm taking azathioprine instead.  Be sure your doctor knows if your pharmacy/insurance substitutes generic for Imuran.  I'm also going to try to get off this med soon after the flare is under control so that my husband and I can start a family.  Not allowed to take it while pregnant or nursing.
