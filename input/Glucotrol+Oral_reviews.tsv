Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	ted, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	65-74	6/5/2012 2:48:34 PM	After being found allergic to Metformin (rash everywhere) for 1 year I took 5mg daily of Glipizide.  It works well, but when blood sugars began to climb for no apparent reason, I was changed to 10mg.  Now I have occ'l low blood sugar with night sweats, weakness, dizziness OR my morning blood sugar readings are 70 +/- a little too low for confidence that I am doing the right thing.  Has anyone else had irregular problems with adjusting dosages?   Thanks.

About 3 weeks ago, my blood sugar level was higher than 200. I admitted myself into emergency because I was experiencing symptoms that were very similar to Transient Aschemic Attack (TIA) - the precursor to a real stroke. The doctors have prescribed 5mg Glipizide (Glucotrol) in addition to my regular dose of 750mg of Metformin twice daily. I have been taking this cocktail for about 4 days now, and my blood glucose levels have dropped to below 150. I've also eliminated all external sugars from my diet - no fruit juices, no sweet dairy products etc - and am exercising for 30 minutes each day. I am restricting my diet to less than 250 carbs per day. I think the combination of diet, exercise, and medication is necessary to move the A1C and blood glucose levels in the right direction

I am replacing Glimepiride 8 mg with it. And I also take Metformin ER 500 mg twice daily, which I will continue, along with the Glucotrol 10 mg.

With the addition of this medication my blood sugar levels dropped where the doctor wanted them - lower than 150.  Along with diet changes and exercise I get occasional loose stools especially after greasy meals.  I do get regular (6 month) check ups for nerve damage, check toes, and an eye exam yearly.
