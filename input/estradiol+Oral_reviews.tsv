&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	Maema53, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1		55-64	9/6/2012 1:07:21 PM	I am 58 and have been dealing the menopause since age 49. With each passing year, symptoms became worse and worse.  Finally, August 2012,I was prescribed the lowest dose available (.5 mg).  The first week was good and was looking forward to happy days.  However, started experiencing swollen feet, ankles, hands, nausea like morning sickness, became extremely emotional, bloated stomach, itchiness much like hives, and sleeplessness. It made me a hot mess!  Dr. advised me to stop taking for a few days then start again.  Followed instructions and same symptoms re-appeared.  Had taken only for a month but I determined that the side effects far outweighed the benefits and stopped taking. I am not willing to sacrifice my well being for the sake of minimizing menopause. Had a &quot;partial&quot; hystorectomy and still have ovaries however they were tested as &lt;.08 .. so no function at all. Although it was simple to take 1 pill per day, I took evenings so that I'd have time to deal with the side effects and not interfere with my job.  Not willing to be a Ginny pig for the sake of menopause.  Menopause won't kill me; pills can!

I had typical pre- menopause symptoms. I had a full hysterectomy including cervix and ovaries. I immediately started having hot flashes, night sweats, trouble sleeping and dry skin and hair. I started estradiol 1mg and felt immediately different- no hot flashes, no night sweats, better sleep. But, after 3 mos. I began swelling in the lower abdomen (gaining weight) and felt sleepy and hungry all the time. I decreased the dose to .5mg but had the same problems. I went off completely and felt energetic again and lost 3 lbs. immediately. The night sweats and hotflashes also returned immediately. Not sure which symptoms are worse- now just trying to figure out how to feel good.

Was started on this medicine for my labido.  After being on this drug for about 2 weeks I passed out and was taken to the hospital.  tests run. found nothing.  About a month later I passed out again.  Taken by ambulance to hospital again. More tests run.  All have come back fine.  I found out online about this drug having a possible side effect of fainting.  Took myself off about June 30th.  No fainting spells since.

Taking a pill everyday is more of a challenge, but I am grateful I can get them for $4/mo. Pills have no taste, are tiny, no side effects, and work effectively.

The good things about this pill is that it immediatley helped me with the hot flashes and sweats. BUT, it made me very emotional and very tired. I can't sleep well, I am bloated all the time, my ankles hurt and are swollen all the time and I consistly have headaches. I recently took myself off of this (.5mg) and I noticed a difference within a few days. I felt &quot;alive&quot; and happy and I actually starting sleeping. BUT, the hot flashes came back and the sweats and I felt like I had the flu. BUT, headaches have lessened and I lost 6 pounds. 6 POUNDS of nothing but water! I was off of it for over 2 weeks and the hot flashes came back and were everyday but they are getting fewer. I went back on the pill just to see and within my second week being back on it I have headaches again and feel fatigue. My ankles hurt and are so swollen! I have decided to stay off of this medication; if you can tolerate the hot flashes they will lessen over time. My recommendation is to not take this medication. I have tried GNC Menopause Vitapak and am feeling awesome! People have made comments that they can tell that I am not on the hormones anymore. I am working through the hot flashes and they are getting better. To all you women experiencing the change, please pay attention to this review and try something else before going on this medication.  &quot;change&quot; to be better.

I started taking 2mg of estradiol per drs orders and it has been a whirlwind for the last year and a half. I decreased the dose by half after gaining 20 pounds within the first month of use. Started having manic depression and anxiety. Developed kidney stones and gout. Increased dosage to original 2mg and gained another 30 pounds and headaches, arthritis, mood swings, facial hair, eye changes (can't wear contacts anymore), extreme tiredness and migraines. I could deal with all of the rest if I was the same weight I had been before. I even went to clinical weight loss clinics and could never lose more than 4 pounds after 2 different doctors.

A patch was placed on me right after surgery which I wore for a few days... It irritated my skin and gave me a rash right at the patch site. Nothing major. Was given 2 mgs of Estradiol to take nightly. I am only 2 weeks post surgery but so far so good. I had a hard time sleeping and woke up a little panic attacky in the mornings on the patch but since switching to the pill and taking it in the morning I'm good. I might be a little moody but that could just be life as well and the ordeal I just went through. I have an occasional hot/cold/hot/cold thing going but every day its getting less and less. I remember what my mom went through after her hyst... I am grateful for this drug!

No more night sweats, no more hot flashes during the day.  I feel so much better.  I tried Premarin, black cohosh, and estroven but none of those worked for me. I can finally sleep at night and I love it.  Not too concerned about side effects (weight gain, etc), I have always taken very good care of myself and I eat right and exercise.  Highly recommend this medication!

Was doing great till now. depression, no energy. I called my doctor and he put me on 1mg, I have been on it for 17 days now and noticed the difference within days. Energy up, no depression, tenderness of breast but that is going away and now dryness of mouth and some discharge... putting in a call on Monday to see if need to drop dosage or just give it time. No weight gain like after partial hyst. which after several years tapered off and went back to normal.

Reading all these comments makes me wonder if I should be on it at all.  Have complete hysterectomy November 2011, and Im 49.  Hot flashes are almost totally gone, vaginal dryness, sex drive not so good, headaches, dry skin that is driving me crazy.  Some weight gain, 10 pounds, moody, &quot;my husband asks if that's the estrogen talking&quot;. and no energy.  IS IT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!! I can survive the hot flashes, I think.  Have been for 3 years and they have been insane.  Maybe a few more months, next check up and may be not taking anything anymore.  Thanks for all the help with all the comments.  Will start taking at nitetime to see if headaches go away.

They took everything: uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervix; all gone.  For 2 or 3 months following my surgery, I took Estradiol, but didn't feel a bit different.  I did gain about 18 lbs during that time frame though.  I stopped taking the estradiol and until recently, the only symptom I ever had was an occasional hot flash.  Now I have severe vaginal dryness, severe dry eyes (I cannot wear my contacts at all), my hair is noticeably thinning and gray hairs are popping up like dandelions. Absolutely NO sex drive. Facial hair and body hair is out of control; I have to set aside an hour a day for hair removal.  I'm moody, emotional.  The kicker:  I lost 50 lbs not being on the ET.  I am positive and my doctor agrees that if I go back on this or ANY estrogen therapy, I will gain weight back.  I don't know what else to do.  Going to talk to my gyn and primary care doctor about it.  Can't win for losing.

I was put on this medication after that surgery.  I have terrible headaches, am very emotional, and have trouble sleeping.  I have felt bloated to the point where my pants feel very tight even though I have only gained 3-4 pounds, but I am not sure if that is because of the medication (my doctor told me at my follow up that it was from my surgery - that I was still swollen inside).  I have noticed if I miss a couple doses that I get VERY moody and pretty mean.  I don't have any hot flashes though so I guess that is good.  I haven't been on the medication very long, but I hope I don't have to take it for years.

I had a partial hysterectomy at age 34 due to uterine prolapse so did not have my menstrual cycle to help gage where I was in the process of menopause.  After severe blood pressure fluctuations caused me to faint several times, I had a full cardiology work up with no concerns.  I was barely dragging through my days suffering from extreme fatigue, brain fog, depression and dizziness. My blood pressure was ranging from high to low so could not take medication for high blood pressure.  My cholestorol also increased significantly.  The cardiologist sent me to an endocrinologist who finally diagnosed me and put me on estradiol.  My estrogen levels were fluctuating wildly so it was important to get several tests done.  My internist thought my levels were normal after one test so I am thankful that the endocrinologist recognized my symptoms and stuck with it.  I felt some relief on 1 mg/day but had to increase to 2 mg/day to alleviate the worst symptoms.  I am sleeping 7-8 hours a night again for the first time in 5 years.  My blood pressure is normal and stable.  I have my energy back and do not feel depressed.  The benefits outweigh the risks in order to have my life back.

My doctor put me on some kind of patch at first and mysymptoms got worse so I quit that drug. Then about 2 months ago my hot flashes were out of control, so back to the doctor, and he gave me Estradiol .1mg. Now I am over emotional, depressed, and angry. I take other meds for my stomach and severe migraines, yet he told me to take it any way. The mood swings, eye troubles, concentration issues, and the continued flashes have made me stop taking it. I would rather put up with the flashes,and be normal, than overly moody, and forgetful, and just a plain basket case all of the time. The dryness, isn't an issue; that what KY is for.

In reading some of these reviews I am somewhat concerned. How long does a woman need to take this stuff on an average?  I'm only 43!  I gained 50# over the last year. Will I gain even more weight! Last, I am always tired due to a heart arrythmia on the slow side. Can I expect to be even more tired?  Does anybody know of another hormone that doesn't have the weight gain and tired feeling or could it be possible that I've already gained my weight because of the menopause? I spoke to my pharmacist yesterday specificaly about weight gain and she said, &quot;no&quot;! What are your thoughts? I'd like to nip it in the butt now! Thanks

I did gain weight after my partial hysterectomy 4 years ago and am a little worried after reading the reviews, however I am inclined to think that some of the weight gain is due to the hysterectomy and not the estrogen, since i did gain weight before and took no estrogen. the benefits of the estrogen far outweigh a diet change and i will stay on the medicine...but will look for a dose that doesn't cause so much nausea.

I have gained 40+ pounds and now have extremely dry skin.  No night sweats or hot flashes, but the weight gain and dry skin are unbearable.  I have also noticed that I have cramps in my calves and I worry about blood clots.  I have also developed the growth of very fine hair about my face, mostly near my eyes. My Dr. says that this is impossible.  I came to WebMD hoping for validation. I found some concerning the weight gain, but not the dry skin and facial hair growth.   I guess I'll keep looking and change my hormone dosage.

Since I have a family history of osteoporosis, though no symptoms myself, I continued taking it. During recovery from knee surgery earlier this year, I often forgot to take it, but once I was back on my feet, started the daily dose again. Soon after, I began having headaches - not occasionally, but every day. I had an MRI and a few other tests, and was eventually given Topamax. The neurologist I consulted said he felt I'd had migraine headaches all my life, and that they had for some reason returned. After taking Topamax for just a few days, I decided the side effect were not worth it, and so continued to struggle with the headaches. A few days ago, I ran out of the estradiol and haven't been able to get to the doctor for another prescription, so it's been four days without the estradiol. Much to my surprise, since I've taken the drug for the better part of 12 years with no difficulty, today I have no headache, for the first time in more than six months. The tight feeling in my head has simply disappeared. Time will tell, but I believe I've found the answer, and I will not ask my doctor to renew the prescription.

Immediate improvement. Have read lots on side effects which are worrisome, but haven't, to this point, experienced any problems.  Has been very effective in controlling night sweats, mood swings.  Vaginal dryness is minimal and relieved with lubricants so I can live with that.  My quality of sleeping is most important and I sleep wonderfully 98% of the time. I did gain about 25 lbs after surgery and did not think there might be a connection to this medication until after reading other reviews on WebMD.  I went on Weight Watchers a year ago and lost 40 lbs (and still counting).

I am afraid of what might happen if i dont, i get sweats all the time, not as much as before surgery or receiving this medication. i was emotional and got depressed easily before taking it and before surgery and now, i dont get as emotional or depressed. I had a complete hysterectomy @ age 41 and everything was removed and i am thankful that i no longer have the depression and mood swings that are apart of menstration and pms.

After trying different medications the first few years that didn't work, my doctor and I finally settled on Estradiol, which has worked for me for many years.  I had been taking 1.5 mg for years, but just recently I switched to 2mg to alleviate vaginal dryness.  It keeps me calm all the time. However, I do take Prometrium 200mg at night to prevent night sweats.  It works wonders.

The thing-hot flashes and night sweats that it was supposed to help has only intensified it. I am having more severe hot flashes, more often and the night sweats are as worse. Hoping that once my body gets used to it things will change. Don't know if I can stick with the misery!
Other	Sheri, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/7/2008 10:58:25 PM	I had a hysterectomy 6 years ago this month . The doctor left one ovary. Everything seemed good until Sept. of last year . I became depressed and suicidal. I went to my doctor and he put me on Estradiol at 1 mg.That worked well for a few months then my ovary quit working and my hormones or lack there of just went nuts so last month I went back and he upped my dosage to 1.5mg and that has seem to do it for me . I wouldn't trade anything for this hormone replacement and I know my husband and daughter wouldn't. When I forget to take it everyone knows it. It's a life saver.

I also have a terrible vaginal discharge and have baterial infections every other month.  I have recently began to have migraine headaches every week.

I am huge and always in pain because of the headaches.

Only concern is, how long should I take it.  Doctors vary in their opinions.  Complete hysterectomy results in only estrogen.  Its been 12 years but seems to also help with joint pain.  How weird is that?

Night sweats are very severe, and I had my hysterectomy in Dec. I still have constant hot flashes, and I feel like the only thing I have gained from this medication is the extra weight, which is very difficult to get rid of without added help!

Sometimes 4-5 times a night.  I am on Ethinyl Estradoil, .06 mg and so far it isn't working.  I am so frustrated.  My hysterectomy was in 93.  My mother has had both breasts removed from breast cancer and the cancer came back in her chest wall.  I worry about taking HRT, but my endochronologist tells me it's okay.  I'm worried but can't stand the night sweats.

I'm going to try switching to taking them at night to make a difference on that.  The headaches are there as well... my doctor seems to think it is lack of liquids, but I think its the med.

Trying to drink more water instead of eating more.  My side effect is mirgraines.  I wake up with them every morning and I didn't have them before, so the association is with this.  They usually last 1-2 hours only, so it is minor inconvenience at this point when the good outweighs the bad.
