Low Amount of Calcium in the Blood		5	5	5			8/29/2010 11:06:30 AM	Just wanted to let you all know that it cost me $1,000.00 to find out my yorkie had hyperparathryodism.  I give her a dose of calcitrol every day and have for a year and it works great. without it she has seizures and it takes a visit to the vet for liquid calcium by IV and cost about 800.00 dollars a visit. Hope this will help anyone that may have or know of a dog that has the same symptoms as a human.
Low Amount of Calcium in the Blood	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/5/2010 7:22:22 AM	15 years ago i had radioactive iodone given to me to kill my thyroid. We have never been able to control my levels.Thyroid Storm, cardiac arrest and now morbidly obese.I had a complete throidectomy.only for the dorctor to find  my parathyroid glands were damaged from the radioactive iodine.3 days after surgery I was taken to hospital by ambulance.My face,neck,arms legs were going numb, with musclespasms  and loss of coordination and the ability to speak. I thought  I was having a stroke!!! At the hospital they find my calcium level became dangerously low. 5 days later, 16 bags os calcium IV  my levels would not come up; Sooo...  on day 2 of my stay  they started giving me 4 calcium pills  4 times a day and 1 mcg of CALCITRIOL. by day 5 i came home. it has been 16 days and I am home doing much better   thanks to this medicine. With out this medication  i would still be hospitalized. There are NO SIDE EFFECTS!!  YEE   HAW 
Condition caused by Low Levels of Parathyroid Hormone	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/4/2010 11:13:41 PM	What a wonderful drug!!! 7 years ago I was diagnosed with adrenal inauffeciency and as a result of that I have also been diagnosed with hypocalcemia, hypoparathyroidism and hypokalemia, but I no longer have adrenal insuffeciency but will always have the other 3...without this drug I would be hospitalized numerous times to get IV calcium. If Insurance don't cover it because they say it is a &quot;Vitamin&quot; talk to them, mine was the same way but now they cover it I just need a DR note every year saying why I need to be on this specific drug...I agree it is very expensive but I am only paying $15.00 for mine each month.
Condition caused by Low Levels of Parathyroid Hormone	KristinaMoutrey, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/20/2010 11:10:59 PM	wow I cant believe there is actually someone with hypoparathyroidism....This is such a rare condition that I never know anyone that can understand what its like.  I love this med becuase I notice such a huge difference when I take it.  Before I was diagnosed I was in the hospital 1-2 times a week to have a calcium i.v. and now as long as my stress levels are low and im taking my meds I rarely see those friendly people with the wonderful food they serve to me.
