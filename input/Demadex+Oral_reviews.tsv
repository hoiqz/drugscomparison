Visible Water Retention	precious, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	2/1/2012 2:45:48 PM	After 3 days started violently throwing up. Hospitalized for 4 days. Released from hospital thought it perhaps it wasn't the drug and because I gained 11 lbs. in 6 days started taking drug again. Same thing happened. The drug worked I just can't tolerated it.
Visible Water Retention	wrdsci, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/29/2011 8:09:45 AM	I have been on Demadex since 2003 when a sudden water retention occured. Same condition my maternal grandmother had at the same age.Tried the generic torsemide which did not work.Excellent results with Demadex. Be sure to have a restroom available because it works within a half hour. I have had no side effects but I do eat a banana/day for potasium depletion and  have regular blood tests. Recommend highly.

Was on it for 6 months (a year ago).  I have found it to be effective when Lasix started to not work. The previous time I experienced the side effect of muscle cramps, which I have not experienced this time.
