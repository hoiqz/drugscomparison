They now get close to $300 for just six uses. At close to $50 a pop, I'llbe looking for something else in the future.

A buddy of mine let me try his Muse today when we were playing around and it worked. Almost too well, because I started feeling the pain of being over engorged. But it sure was a stiffie... and worked like a charm. Got deep inside him.

Third time I injected in wrong area, resulting in bruising -- no damage, but no erection. Can only use once a week. I plan to continue.

A firm erection that lasts about 2 1/2 to 3 hours and enables more than 1 time intercourse.  Penis is very sensitive following sex, but well worth the temp. discomfort.

The time it takes to work is a little long and the results lasted only 15 min. My usual erection was 35 to 45 min.

There is an long after burning effect which negates any results achieved, which in my case was not lasting nor functional. The discomfort is too great.
