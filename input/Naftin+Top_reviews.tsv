Told to apply all over both feet nightly for 6-8 weeks.  Had to stop after 5 days, account reaction.  Red rash of tiny bumps initially.  Now, blisters and swelling along with the red rash.  Will return to the dermatologist if the blistering doesn't clear up soon.

Athlete's Foot	bizobbob, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/3/2011 11:29:59 PM	Suffered for years (10) with what I thought was dry skin on my feet. Tried it all. Had settled on soaking and scraping every couple of weeks. What a mess. Went to the podiatrist for a case of plantar fasisitits last year. She took one look at my feed, said you got athlete's foot. Prescribed NAFTIN for a one month treatment. Results were instantaneous. Had new feet in within couple of days. $200 a 90g tube(GEL) only $20 to me with insurance. I swear by this stuff . Don't waste your time with vinegar, vicks, listorine ect. ect. Old wifes tales.
Athlete's Foot	 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	5	5	5			5/25/2011 9:36:05 PM	Athlete's foot between toes and soles of feet.  Dermatologist prescribed Naftin gel.  It was effective and within 3 days, condition cleared up.Subsequent occurrences have been treated with Naftin and condition clears up with each use. It is expensive, but experience is it's effective for treating condition.
Ringworm of Groin Area	haru, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	55-64	4/3/2011 11:49:04 AM	Started using this antifungal for a persistent groin affectation on my right groin, and within the next two days the totality of my groin area got irritated and started getting the same infection all over. Furthermore, new patches started on my hip-side and a bigger spot developed on my left  thigh - from my back to the mid-calf; later, most of the areas started bleeding. Definitely a horrible experience for a $250+ medical tryout.

Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	45-54	10/22/2010 7:55:59 AM	Slow developing toenail fungus that started near the nail bed of my big toe turning the nail white from bed to nail tip. Both Naftin cream and anti-fungal powder was rubbed into the nail each once daily. It took weeks before normal nail was seen growing again. The bad nail has almost grown out 10 months later.
Other	Lee09, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/26/2010 11:36:33 PM	Had fungal &quot;rash&quot; around nose and mouth for several months.  I tried every natural treatment available.  The dermatologist prescribed me Naftin cream, to be used twice a day.  After a couple days I almost stopped using it because it seemed it was getting worse, but I kept using it as I have heard about fungus die off and that it can get worse before getting better. I am VERY happy I kept using it.  Now, one week later, my skin is 95% better and I can be seen in public again without embarrassment! I would recommend this cream to anyone with a fungal problem.  Remember, keep using it even if it seems like it's getting worse!!!! I also used emu oil at night, as I heard it is anti fungal and can help the medicine penetrate deeper.  I never post reviews on medicines, but this one is amazing!!!! I'm so thankful the Dr. told me about it...
