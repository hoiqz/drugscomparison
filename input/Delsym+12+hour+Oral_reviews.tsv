Cough	Sagittarius89, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	3/16/2012 7:30:07 PM	I took this medicine at 11:30pm for a cough that seemed to be killing me. Around 12:30am, I felt extremely wired, the room was spinning, and everything was moving in slow motion. I became extremely hot and when I laid down, I couldn't catch my breath. On top of all that, the cough never stopped. This is absolutely the worse product I have ever taken!

Cough	momtoAva, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	4	2	Female	3-6	1/14/2010 9:13:04 PM	I gave the Pediatric Delysm 12 hour to quiet my daughter's cough - she is almost 4.  She had a half tsp in the a.m. and it seemed to quiet her cough a little.  Then my husband gave her another 1/2 tsp after dinner and it seemed to cause extreme excitability, it had been 9 hours since her last dose.  The early dose was due to our lack of communicating but it seems to be a pattern of initial bounce off the walls excitability.  It works to quiet the cough somewhat but not entirely.  She is still coughing about once every half hour.

Cough	Chi Guy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	25-34	11/13/2008 10:39:34 AM	I took this medicnie for cold symptoms and ended up feeling worse than before.  I had an allergic reaction to this medicine that came with severe dizziness, blurred vision, high heart rate, trouble breathing, nause and clamy palms.  I have been taking this drug for a while and this is the first I have experienced.  I would strongly advise people to be very careful when taking this drug.

Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	4/6/2008 12:04:19 AM	I have taken this medicine twice to try to help with my cough.  It eased it at first, but then I didn't sleep at all, everytime I closed my eyes they popped back open.  Also, it caused my eyes to dialate and made it extremely difficult for me to see.  I'm not sure why this happened, or what else could have caused it.  I wasn't sure it was this medication until this last time I took it, it was the only thing I took and that is what the result was.
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	25-34	2/12/2008 9:29:57 PM	I thought this would stop me from coughing but it only slowed it dowed it down for the first hour. Since then I haven't noticed a difference. Not impressed and it was twice the price of other over the counter cough syrups so I wouldn't spend the money for this again.
