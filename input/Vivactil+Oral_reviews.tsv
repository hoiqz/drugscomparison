I have been on this and several other medications for 4 months. I do not think this medication is working for me at all. I am supposed to take up to 3 15mg as needed but it never takes the migraine away. I always end up taking my very exspensive treximet.

Now the cluster headaches are back, I asked my dr to prescribe the drug again, I know how well it worked to control the headaches.The only side effects I have experienced is weight loss and dry mouth. Compared to the headaches, I can handle the side effects, I literally do not have an appetite. I can already see an improvement with the headaches.

A condition of Narcolespy that causes loss of muscle control. My knees will buckel. I cant lift my arms. I cant hold up my head. My vision blurs. I slur my speach. I retain complete alertness but I am unable to function otherwise. This usualy happens during extreme emotion. For me its laughter. I cant laugh without these things happening. Vivactil stops all of these reactions from happening.

Tried over 10 other prescription medications that had absolutely no effect on the migraines but made me dizzy, nauseous, etc.  This medication is the only one that has worked, and was worked completely.  No side effects.

I also take this at bedtime which I am now accustomed to, just think I need to take more milligrams.  I am being treated for sleep apnea with this medication.  It makes me sleep but I also take cholesterol and high blood pressure and a heart pill too besides a newve pill to. Just curious as to your opinion, I also have rheumatoid arthritis in my hands bad too. Now I am an outside person, volley ball, horse shoes, badmitton.  Now I can't do any of these things without paying for it later.   I had a kenelog shot about 3 weeks ago and that really helped this time so maybe that is my solution. I would greatly appreciate your input.  Thanks Melinda Knight.  My email address at home is mininjax57@comcast.net

This medication has been very effective in treating my headaches and has been helpful in allowing me to rest better during the night. I currently take it twice a day. 
Depression	teachingkids,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female		11/5/2007 12:44:57 PM	I experienced ringing in the ears at day 3. This messed up my hearing but I thought I could live with it. My doctor told me to stay on the medication and that it would go away. On day 8 I experienced suicidal thoughts. That I couldn't live with so I stopped the medication right away.
