It helped to relieve my sensitive stomach,,food allergies, and frequent stomach upset but I would get so tired in the afternoons at work I could fall asleep typing.  I run every morning so I would take it right before and was fine~ but the afternoons ..just horrible fatigue....

Started taking Zantac and it seemed to stop working after a while.  The burning, throwing up, gurd, etc. all came back.  I tried Zegrid and it's a miracle drug.  I can now eat chocolate, drink orange juice, had soda and fruit.  Amazing.  I also have blockage in my throat and it seems it's a little more relieved.  I can eat and it doesn't come back up.  Thank you manufacturer of Zegrid.

Before he was in so much pain at times.  He ended up at the hospital twice because of the pain.  He would have choking spells as well.  Since he started the medication, he is like a new person.  He does not have as many choking spells and the pain is almost non-existent.  He has no side effects from the medication.  It has really helped him so much.

Then He decided to try this. As I as well had surgery to try and control the acid reflux problem, which did help) But Zegerid in the powder form worked best for me. Some side effects but it is worth it. This is the FIRST time I have remarked on any medication.But again for what ever reason the pills where not effctive as well as the powder form for me. And it is instant relief within mins.

I continued to have heartburn and acid reflux daily while taking Zegerid.  Also had the lump in the throat feeling.  I finally went to my doctor, who started me on Nexium (free samples), and within 3 days I had relief.   Now seven days later I am symptom free.

They all work for a few weeks but then the side effects take hold and then I switch to another one.  Zegerid was good for me for about 3 weeks - I started to experience burning in my chest - chest pain - nausea - &amp; then diarrhea. I have had a cardiac cath because of all the chest pain I have had - about 2 yrs ago - and no cardiovascular disease was found.  I have GERD - &amp; I am now to the point of contemplating GERD surgery because I cannot be on these meds for the rest of my life. It helps the herat burn - but too many side effects that will shorten your life ( low B12 - low Calcium * Vit D ) PPIs are really only for short term use.

The problem is the side effect.  I get very tired and dizziness occur that seem like I had a seizure so I was taken by paramedics to emergency.  Might belief is it depleted my B12 in my body.  I was seen by cardiologist, neurologist, endocronologist and could not find anything wrong.  I had my small and large intestine cut off for some digestive problem.  From then on, I had to get B12 shot. It did deplete my B12 in my system.

I am losing weight, and half way through the second bottle of zegerid.   It works wonderfully, better that rx meds that I have taken in the past.

I'm now taking Prevacid and that, too, helped for a while.  Again I started taking two a day and now it's back.  I'm going to a GI doctor to get help.

My ENT prescribed Zegerid 1 week ago and my tinnitus has subsided to what it was before which was tolerable. My Primary Physician is concerned because he thinks 40 mgs twice a day is too much.

I have been having problems for months of constipation, lack or motility, gas, water retention and back pain.  My doctor was not helpful with treatments.  I noticed that my discomfort started after taking my medications, so I looked up the side affects of my medications.  I stopped the Zegerid and everything was back to normal!  I should have looked into my medications months ago.  Zegerid is a good medication unless you suffer from the bad side affects.

My symptoms included: semi-frequent acid reflux, bloating, shortness of breath (because of the bloating), and general discomfort in the epigastric region (may or may not be an ulcer - hasn't been ruled out yet). The pills lessened the bloating and eased all the other symptoms within hours of taking the first pill. The only side effect I've experienced thus far has been headaches, which are totally tolerable in comparison to the discomfort I was in before taking the medication. If you have the same or similar symptoms, I'd say it's at least worth a try since everyone reacts differently.

My stomache on fire. cramps that would stop you in your tracks. waking up in the middle of the night holding your stomach in pain and agony, waiting for it to pass. i believe the main cause was stress. no ulcers were found through tests and i was clear. however, i was still in heavy pain. i went to a specialist who gave me zegerid, and told me to take it twice daily. well, i took zegerid as soon as i got home and once more the next morning. i felt great. the pains went away. i was able to sleep. for the next few weeks i only took zegerid as pains started to come on. an hour later, the pains would go away... my suggestion, take as needed, not as suggested.

Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	Mimi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	7/29/2009 6:16:59 PM	Be very careful not to take to much of the Zegerid.  My pharamists told me to make sureit is taken 12 hrs apart.  I was taking it to much and it was reducing to much acid inmy stomach and I was getting bacterial pneumonia every other month because there was not enough acid left in my stomach to kill the bacteria. Results: acid reflex at night (DO NOT lay flat) and the bacteria would wash up into my lungs. Thus causing bacterial pneumonia.  The Zegerid does helpalot but try to get by on one a day.  I learned more talking to my pharmacist thanmy doctor who gave me NO information as to overdosing on this stuff.  After a few months your system has enough build up thatone should do the trick.  Those of you withside effects may be taking to much.
Other	paramedic268, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/26/2009 12:29:19 AM	I have had moderate to severe GERD since 1992. I have taken every medication under the sun for this problem.  The latest has been Protonix (and the generic form) which has worked for more than 5 years.  Recently I began to experience more symptoms including bloating, vomiting and other things.  Talked to my PCP and he did the immediate referral to gastroendologist  who scheduled the upper endoscope and changed me to Zegerid.  So far this has been working really well. I have not had any return of symptoms, and I have tried some of the trigger foods.  I hope to get another 5 years of relative good times. Hopefully the scope will be relatively benign and a change in meds will work.

Two weeks ago started feeling a bit dizzy. Three days ago after lunch, terrible... dizzy, headache, stomach ache, bloated. I felt I was going to pass out. Took Advil, 2 hrs headache went away but stomache problems continued.  Next day, I stopeed the Zegerid butafter light lunch, dizzy, terrible haeache, stomache ache and cramps, legs weak.  Called Dr said it cannot be Zegerid.. too long for these side effects but to stop and go see my PCP. Next day, same symptoms.  PCP stopped Zegerid,did EKG, BP was 110/80 (even though I had not taken my BP pill in 2 days).   Today, woke up with bloated stomach but it felt better. Even ate chicken soup and sandwich.  Stomach feels lot better slight cramping..but dizzyness/slight headache does not want to go away.  Was this just too much dosage for one person to take in one day?  Could Zegerid side effects take 3 weeks to develop?  I want to say it was the Zegerid b/c stomach feeling better but don't know. Please help
Other	yomiguelito, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	25-34	7/21/2009 3:54:33 PM	I have hypertension.  I was given Zegerid 40/1100 mg 3 wks ago by ENT for symptoms of acid reflux.  I take Zegerid twice daily (AM/PM) along with Zantac 300 (also Rx by same ENT).  I don't know if it is Zegerid, but i began feeling slightly lightheaded two weeks ago...but two days ago I felt i was going to faint.  After lunch, i felt dizzy, bad stomach cramps, terrible head ache.  Took ibuprofen felt better. Next day, dizziness (esp after i ate a light lunch), bloated, terrible head ache. I stopped Zegerid (by self) today... stomach feels bloated, slight dizzyness and head ache returning.  Could the Zegerid be causing this?  Is this way too much med i am taking?  Is it possible to for side effects of this med to gradually take over? Can the sodium bicarbonate be hurting my bp?BP is 110/80.   Called ENT, advised to stop ASAP.  doesn't think its Zegerid.  Please help.  I think this medicine is causing this
Inflammation of the Esophagus with Erosion	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	7/14/2009 10:36:33 PM	I have had to get my esophagus stretched out once a year for the last 3 years.  My symptoms included being unable to swallow anything at times, even water.  Since the last endoscopy and taking this med for 3 months, I have not had any episodes.  Notice that I have gained a few pounds though.  Also the pill is a little large, an ironic problem for someone who has difficulty swallowing.
Condition in which Stomach Acid is Pushed Into the Esophagus	Katie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	6/8/2009 10:29:23 AM	I have acid-reflux and have been taking Prilosec for quite a few years with minimal results. I had problems at night mostly and particulary after eating something spicy or acidy(such as tomatoes, vinegar etc.)I had gone to my doctor inquiring about an endoscopy to see if I had any errosions in my esophagus. She referred me to a gastroenterologist who did the test. He told me that I had a hiatal hernia which can add to the reflux. I told him that I was having to use any type of antacid I could get my hands on several times a day and at night. He prescribed Zegerid for me and the problem has all but gone away. I do still on occasion have to use an antacid but, no where near the amount I was using before Zegerid. I have not had any adverse effects at this time. I have been on it since late February. The main things that give me problems are the acidy and spicy foods but, I usually only have to take one dose of the antacid in this case and the problems goes away. This is the best thing I have ever used for my reflux. I use the 40mg capsules. My insurance does pay and there is a printable $30.00 off coupon on the offical Zegerid website which helps too. My doctor sent me 12 of them plus I can print more. The coupons expire on the 31st of December this year but, my doctor says he thinks the company may reinstate the coupon for next year. With this coupon and my insurance, I only pay $5.00 per month for my prescription of Zegerid.

I highly recommend this pill.    I have a disk problem and hate taking medication but this product is worth a try, i fell great! IF YOU SUFFER YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

I mentioned I took Zantac 150 for heartburn and indigestion, so he prescribed Zegerid.  Taking Zantac completely eliminated all signs and symptoms of my GERD, but I was still having chest pain.  On the Zegerid, I am very tired, dizzy and have been violently throwing up.Also, I would like to note someone's symptom of hair loss: That is most likely due to an eating disorder which caused the esophageal damage in the first place.

The very first day I noticed a huge difference plus you only take it once per day. My coughing is 95% gone so I think in a few more days I'll be great again. I'm 47 yrs old and for 3 months have been choking and coughing constantly during the day and at night. This followed a surgery so I thought it was tied with the anathesia tube. I never have heartburn (which I have found is happens sometimes). Try this medication--its worth it.

But I must tell you, this stuff really works. As a patient I've tried anything and everything from: Zantac 75 &amp; 150, Prevacid, Nexium, Tums, Alka-Seltzser, anti-bloating medication, milk of Magnesia, Pepto, Aciphex, you name it I've taken. If I were you and going crazy like I was I would give this one a try. What do you have to lose? Sleep? Most likely you already are if you have this...

My doctor put me on zegerid 40mg, and within a few hours I felt better. I was able to sleep in my own bed without burning pain, heartburn, and nausea for the first time in weeks! But when I took it the next day, it made me really sick so I can't take it every day. The side effects are vicious, but if I fast for at least 16 hours before taking the medication, it helps a lot. I take 20mg now, twice a week. Between pills, I take pepcid complete and B-vitamins. Since taking zegerid, I've been able to eat a lot of foods that I couldn't eat before. I hope I dont have to take it for a long time, because it can be pretty unpleasant, but it has helped a lot with the burning stomach pain and acid-reflux.

No acid reflux, but sometimes extreme pain.  Dr gave me a five day sample of Zegerid.  Woke up at three in the morning with a migraine and horrible stomach pain, along with a terrible taste in my mouth.  Now after reading other reviews this seems to be a common side effect.  He never told me to take an hour before eating, so perhaps that's what the problem was.  Getting scoped soon to find out what the problem is.  Was on pantoprazole after being in the emergency room, which seemed to work much better. will give this med another few days.

Zegerid caused chest pains that are so bad it makes you cry you cant belive how bad the pain is. I only took it 3 days and had to change to Aciphex. This Med needs to be taken off the market before it kill's someone. It makes you feal like your having a hart attack , bloated with gas and sick to your stomach. It get's bad after you eat.

I've never has any heart problems, do not smoke, drink alcohol or drink any caffeinated beverages or ingest other stimulants.  I've taken the Zegerid twice.  The first time I threw up after two hours and then was nauseous  and afraid to eat anything the next day.  On my second and final attempt, I barely averted another tacchyarrythmia  event after feeling a lump in my throat, I started to feel like I couldn't breath, my heart began to almost race uncontrollably and my stomach became irritable.  The sodium is a very bad thing for me as I try to limit my intake of salt, so I would caution all people taking this medicine to be aware of the potential side effects.

The usual dose for a PPI is qd (daily) but I don't have acid reflux every day, but I know when I feel it coming on I can pop one of these and the bicard goes to work in less than 15 minutes and the omeprazole keeps working.  The people that complain of &quot;chest pain&quot;... it's called indigestion and it's from the GERD that you're taking the drug for.  If you think that you know more than your GI doc then take a stab at actually learning medicine, not reading a PI or the internet's side effect profile and magically getting the symptoms.

Medication Treatment for Healing Erosive Esophagitis	herbalt, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	19-24	4/29/2008 10:51:27 AM	I had posted a few weeks back about my GERD condition; recently noticeably worsened with constant belching and the lump in the throat feeling (globus hystericus).My first GE (gastroenterologist) prescribed me zegerid, which did help too much so I stopped. I went to another GE recently and prescribed zegerid again, this time double the normal dose: 2x 40mg. It def helped at first but it's like fighting fire with fire. Although the lump in the throat feeling subsided, not completely, I experienced headaches, sudden weight gain, constriction of throat (like asthma which I have never had before..the suffocating feeling was alone not worth taking zegerid), mild depression, bloating AND no appetiite. Great if zegerid works for you, but unfortunately, my case is not that simple. Doc wanted me to take zegerid indefinitely..I personally do not think it's natural to take PPIs the rest of your life...esp when I am in my early 20s. Maybe I am too optimistic, but I feel there is a better approach to this, whether other meds or herbs.Along with cessation of coffee/citric fruits/fatty foods/white flour/most tomato-based foods (although it doesn't seem to bother me)/carbonated drinks, eating small meals, no cigs ever again, exercise and not eating 2-3 hours before bed, I am also taking multiple herbs that I have spent many, many hours researching. Many of the herbs are supposed to help with the healing of the esophagus and stomach lining but the ones I feel worth mentioning because of its immediate effects are: deglycyrrhizin licorice (DGL) and chamomile/slippery elm tea. I just bought some other herbal remedies that have equal claims of effectiveness so will soon find out. DGL (chewable form) is AWESOME.

At first I thought that it was a miracle drug. That was until I began having chest pains/ heart palpatations, leg cramps, shortness of breath, and finally ended up in the Cardiac Unit of the hospital for 4 days this past week. My doctors think that the Zegerid is the cause of the heart/chest problems and told me to stop taking it immediately. I have spent over $20,000 in medical bills only to come back and find out that this so called miracle drug was the issue the entire time. No one suspected that the drug was the issue since it is basically derived from Prilosec, and none of my side effects were listed or known to be caused by this drug. I would not recommend this drug to anyone long term as it has caused me some very expensive and troublesome damage.
Inflammation of the Esophagus with Erosion		4	5	3			4/10/2008 9:08:04 AM	have really bad reflux esp when burping; had the lump in the throat feeling (globus hystericus) and took zegerid. it def helped. i do experience the side effects of abdominal pains every so often. i have tried the herbal approach but i think that is a more proactive method. in my opinion, healing of the esophagus needs to be treated with a retroactive approach since damage has been done and needs to be healed immediately before it may become permanent.

I also get weird headaches and diarea.  I tried Nexium,40mg, which made me so sick, dizzy, had to stop it. I get chest pain up from top of stomach up, what feels like my chest bone that hurts, especially after eating.

I was suffering from extreme acid reflux all of the time. It was usually worse at night.  I would start coughing and couldn't stop.  I had a burning sensation from my chin to my stomache and some chest pain.  Once I started Zegerig it all completely stopped.

I was bloated and felt nauseated and after having the scope the doctor found out I had two ulcers.  He changed my meds to Zegerid and it works great.  No more burning in my chest and the bloating and nausea are much better.

As others have stated, it seems to take effect in just a few minutes, and it really gets rid of my GERD symptoms completely.

(50% of children get it)My symptoms are ulcers, diaherra and nausea.  I took 2 nexium and 2 prevacid and had minimum results over 3 years.  The first day I took Zegerid I stopped having those symptoms.  Excellent medicine.

It is expensive.  I use it before going to sleep or if I awake with that nasty taste of acid coming up into the back of throat.  This is best GERD medicine of all!

I was told I would be taking this for the rest of my life to prevent the full onset of cancer, so it is nice to know that there is something out here that works.  I'm blessed that my doctor knew what I should take that would help instead of playing a guessing game with my health.  I would recommend Zegrid to anyone with acid reflux, gerd, etc.

Its the ONLY one that worked for me.  I tried Nexium twice a day and that didnt even help me.  Only one zegerid a day has kept the doctor away!!  They have coupons to help out with the copay!!

There have been times when I've had extreme discomfort and within one minute after taking Zegerid it totally went away as if nothing ever happened. In my opinion, Zegerid is a miracle drug.

I have been on every PPI out there (Prilosec, Nexium, Prevacid, Aciphex, and Protonix). By far Zegereid has worked the best. I have no symptoms, sleep comfortably, and have no side effects (i.e. Headache, Nausea, or cramping). I would recomend this to anyone
