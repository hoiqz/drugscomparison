Started off with , which I loved; but was removed by FDA. Amitiza is currently the only drug approved currently and it is horrible. I'm constantly nauseas and just UGH feeling. I did participate in the study for linaclotide and am counting the days until final approval by FDA for its release. For those who hate amitiza or just don't feel like it is fully effective for them.... Linaclotide is soon to be your answer. Can't wait to be done with amitiza!

I have suffered with pain, gas, and constipation so long that I can't remember when it actually started. This week I was diagnosed with IBS and my doctor advised me to take only ONE pill at night for the first few weeks. This is to reduce all the nasty uncomfortable side effects that others have reported. I haven't had ANY negative side effects yet. I will report as time passes.

I'm a 24 yr old female, taking Amitiza 2x a day.  Day 1 on Amitiza - explosive diarrhea; pretty close to colonoscopy prep bad. Then, no BM for about 3 days.  I'm about 2 weeks in and have consistent morning nausea, afternoon headaches/stomach cramps, and no consistent BMs!  I find I'm either having explosive diarrhea, extremely painful BMs, or wierd-looking BMs that aren't relieving.  I'm frustrated, but I feel I need to give it a full month and then decide if I want to continue with it; plus, it's real expensive.

In the past I have gone as long as 10 day without a BM resulting in severe cramping, cold sweats, fainting and  trips to the emergency room.  My doctor prescribed Amitiza about 3 months ago to be taken along with a daily dose of Miralax.  The combination has changed my life.  I can now travel - which had become close to impossible - or at least difficult, painful and embarrassing.  There is an adjustment period of increased gas and discomfort,  those symptoms diminished with time.  Amitiza has been a godsend for me - hang in there with the initial side effects and good luck. This must be what normal feels like!

It has helped me I take it 2 x a day with no side effets amitiza has but fluid in allowing stool to pass with ease.

In the beginning, it was great and I was confident my hemmorhoids would finally be able to heal. Now my body has seemed to adapt to Amitiza and now bowel movements aren't coming daily and while some are still soft, there are others that are hard and extremely painful to pass.I've decided to stop taking this medicine and just take a daily stool softener at night. What I need is soft stool so healing can take place. Having the occasional hard tool is putting me back at square one.

Side effects during the one month that I stuck with it were diarrhea, stomach cramps, depression {probably over side effects}, indigestion, low energy, cough, loose stools, aniety {understandable, as the month wore on}, finally unable to control bowel movements, cramps, involuntary quivering, and heart pounding...made the decision that I would rather have small hard marbles, than what I was experiencing...had previously tried both metamucil and miralax {not at same time!}...under care of gastroenterologist...I eat 25-35 grams of fiber each day, drink at least 8 glasses of water, and moderately exercise...don't know what else to do

(that's if i take it with NO FOOD). However, i am gaining weight and i DO workout and watch what i eat as i have no spleen, for the most part my larger intestines are gone and little to no pancreas due to surgery, hence, me being on this drug.i have not read one review as yet that talks about weight gain, and YES, i do have the side effects of back-pain, nausea, bloating, gas etc.bottom line is, this dug does what its suppose to do when taken without food but it does carry side-effects. i am just wondering why it makes me gain weight and I AM SURE OF THIS. If it makes you &quot;go&quot; often, what could possibly cause the weight gain?
Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	chrisdcd, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	1/22/2012 1:21:55 PM	I tried this med about 3 years ago when not a lot was known about it. The constipation was becoming worse, I was diagnosed with IBS, and I was starting to affect my quality of life. I had some of the side effects; shortness of breath, diziness, and such. Freaked me out and I stopped taking it. Over the past few years the constipation has gotten considerably worse and my family practitioner again suggested Amitiza. I reluctantly agreed after exhausting most other avenues. He prescribed me 24mcg twice daily. I know my body and I have the trial and error game down. I ended up taking one pill in the morning first thing when I get up and drinking a 16 ounce bottle of water with it, sometimes a cup of coffee if I can handle it. Within an hour or so I usually have a bowel movement. It is pretty much straight diarreah at this point, but I'm ok with it. Sometimes I will go two or three times in the morning, it depends on what kind of condition my stomach is in that day. I don't have any of the severe side effects that I read about, or that I experienced the first try. I think some of what I experienced the first go around was because of what I had read and I was just a little afraid of the medication. The one thing that I have noticed is that I do have a little more fatigue than normal and also at times I wonder if I am a little depressed. I'm not certain about the depression because I'm also a recovering alcholic and drug addict. My IBS symptons did not become an issue until I got off the substances. Funny how our bodies work. I've read a lot about this drug and IBS and it seems to work for some and not for others. My bowel movements began pretty much immediately, and it has continued that way. Again, I take it once a day in the morning on an empty stomach with a large bottle of water and it works very well for me, although it seems like an explosion went on in the toilet sometimes. LOL. Its better than hurting for days at a time.

I am once again up late at night with gas, nausea, bloating, swollen hands (can't get my rings off!), and wondering...why?  I guess I felt so physically and emotionally bad from chronic constipation that I was willing to do anything!  But, hey, I DON'T deserve the icky awful feeling!  And I'm tired early in the day and nauseous all morning at work.  My abdomen is bloated (yikes! Anything inflamed in there?  Hey intestines, are you ok???  I guess I kept hoping that this would be &quot;the answer&quot; (switched doses, took only once daily).  I am so sorry that I have continued to put myself through this!  Yes, the constipation drives me crazy, but this is far worse!  
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	hopeful, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	2	Female	45-54	12/19/2011 1:18:41 AM	Having been chronically constipated since a far back (at least this is what I am told) as toilet training, this drug was initially an answer to my prayers.  Now, the side effects are really interfering wtih my life.  HORRIBLE NAUSEA.  Bowel movements that are not bowel movements at all, but water and waste that seems unnaturally formed.  It also works differently with on-going use and in inconsistent as to when it is effective.  My worst experience: when it is effective, it has kept me in bed feeling as though I was sick with the flu.  On other occasions, it has not worked at all.  I've had to change the dose several times (twice daily at 24mcg is too strong, 8mcg's twice daily does nothing).  I thought this would be relief from the sluggishness and cramping of constipation (fiber supplements, colace, miralax, etc.do not help at all).  Perhaps the makes of this drug can make it a &quot;cleaner&quot; drug, meaning have it hone in on symtoms more effectively without the spill over effects on the body that cause side-effects that really affect quality of life. They are definitely onto something cutting-edge here, it just needs some fine-tuning.  Also, there pharmaceutical reps are pushing this big time to doctors and sadly doctors have little training in how to dose it correctly to suit patient's individual concerns.  Doctors prescribing this should try it once!!  
Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	BeefeeGoogie, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	12/9/2011 3:53:28 AM	I originally was given doctor's samples of the 8mcg Amitiza dosage and got good results almost right away,but shortness of breath.  My doctor was concerned about the shortness of breath and wanted me to try Aloe Vera juice, which didn't work.  So he agreed to prescribe the Amitiza.  However, my ins. wouldn't pay for it.  Fast forward to last night: I am visiting a friend in a foreign country where I can buy it over the counter for the equiv of $3.50 per ten capsules(!) Yay!  But they only had the 24mcg dosage of the Amitiza instead of the 8mcg.  I took one - noticed a little shortness of breath, but not too bad.  In the evening right before going to bed, took the second capsule.  I wake up a little later with; profound horrendous nausea unlike anything I've ever experienced before, sweating, searing headache, pretty bad shortness of breath. I was afraid I was going to defecate,vomit and pass out all at once on the way to the bathroom! I managed to get myself back into bed, very frightened and I wondered if I needed to go to hospital.  I'm not a religious person, but I prayed to God for the horrible four-fold side effects to cease, and I'd imagined that this was what eternal torment in hell would feel like.  I was never so relieved in my life when I started feeling some relief from the excruciating side-effects, about 10 minutes later. Horrible headache and weakness the next day, but had decent bowel movement - worth it? NO! I'm going back to OTC stool softener/laxatives, and am grateful I survived this horrific Amitiza medication side-effects experience.

I have had chronic constipation my entire life (I'm 33). I was so hopeful and excited to begin taking Amitiza. I have taken it twice a day religiously for 6 days. It produced a BMx2 the first day (accompanied by nausea) and 1 BM the second day and nothing since. I'm pretty anxious about this so I'll be calling my doc first thing Monday am. I'm scared of what this could indicate. I have my first colonoscopy in 3 weeks (oh joy) and I'm actually looking forward to it because I want answers.

Within a few days of taking it I had daily bowel movements and I was elated. I take the 8mg twice a day. But now it is causing me to have 3-4 soft bowel movements a day...in which I don't like. My stomach is also a little loud at times and uncomfortable. I've had no side effects as long as I make sure I take it with food. So I'm going to only take one a day and see if that works for me. I think the med is very expensive but still worth it to me.

I couldn't go to the bathroom for the life of me and in instance I didn't go for almost a month. The Doctors were ready to send me to a University or last resort placing a bag on my side. I told them no under no conditions that I was too young to have this done to me. So the Doctor gave me the chance to live a normal life and prescibed this medication. Do I love it yes and for me the side effects were minimal compared to what it would have been.

I DO WISH IT WAS CHEAPER THO. OVERALL I AM THANKFUL FOR THIS PILL I GET TO ENJOY MY DAY OFF NOW &amp; I HAVE A BOWEL MOVEMENT AT LEAST EVERYOTHER DAY.

I has numbness in mu hand my migraines best gone forever they return back worst ever head pounding ever with walking. I had bloating , gas pain, nausea really bad and itching on my chest after one use took at 6:30 pm every thing was find walk  up to body being really sick in am. Horrible feeling ever. I could not lay down nothing help so I just lay on the end of the bed standing up. Even to walk it hurt pain level of 20 plus.Today was the most miserable day ever. I took a pain pill that did not help. I still did not use the bathroom. I gave up and pray to God to help please. And his did help me. I stay in the bed after I finally could lay down and the massive headaches in my head even hurt to cough and walk.So now I been down all evening. The med cost $239.00 with out insurance to whom that do not have it and $6.00 co pay for me. Really this medicine had me hopeless I had to call on God. Thanks for answering my prayers I was taking the Total body purifier with the colon clear formula got it on line at Walmart for $19.99 and it work pretty good maybe I might try that again but I do not know why a pill so small look like a stool softer can cost all that side effects. I still believe in my mind medicines cost more problems then that benefits. I think strokes etc. heart attaches  comes from medicines the dam side effects all medicines had in them they create another problem just to cure one really I hate taking any of them except fro a Tylenol. Take Care everyone get better any advise to help me start using please let me know or email me @ paula_maysl@yahoo.com

So needless to say I have gotten use to the side effects.  I still have to drink Kleri tea about once a week to have a bowel movement.  But it relieves my bloating and the pain that I have with IBS.  Without taking it I feel like I have a huge basketball sitting inside my stomach.  I am realizing the side effets that I may have are the tightness in my chest.  It goes away immeditly if I drink a full 16 oz of water right when I feel the tightness.  I also feel the anxiety and the weird feeling of life.  But to feel better there I have to run daily and that corrects my mood.  So Its worth taking because it gets rid of the bloating and uncomfortable feeling in my stomach.  You just have to figure out how to correct the side effects. :) Good luck!

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement		2	3	1			7/28/2011 3:48:40 PM	I have been taking Amitiza for 2 months. I was ecstatic initially a) that my insurance FINALLY partly covered it, and b) that my bowels began doing SOMETHING daily, though the movements were mostly liquid, incomplete and gassy. But the side effects (not intolerable at first) have increased - flulike symptoms, dry skin (painfully dry face), bloating, and gas rumbling noisily around my insides - and now I have been diagnosed with rosacea on my face for the first time in my life. I feel exactly as if I have mild food poisoning, and I have a suspicion. I believe Amt probably irritates the colon lining so it produces a lot of fluid (there's no other reason the colon would do this), which also fires up the immune system to fight a possible invasion/stomach flu. To have this going on every day in your system has to be really deleterious to some of us. My whole body is irritated now. My face is a red sore mess and my lungs feel inflamed as well. I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't autoimmune consequences for susceptible patients from this overpriced drug. The Amitiza website is evasive about the mechanism of this drug - &quot;Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels increases fluid in the bowel&quot; (btw they're present in the lungs as well)...has been associated with cancer in humans in medical abstracts, and even laymen-patients know that chronic irritation to mucous membranes can lead to &quot;changes&quot; in susceptible people. Who's susceptible? I have stopped trusting prescription drugs, and when a prescribed pill makes me feel really awful, I do a little investigating. No more Amitiza for me.

I have had constpation for decades with fissures and prolapsed rectum.  With this med I do find on occassion I get upper GI cramping shortly after I take it however, I believe that may be my fault for not drinking enough fluid or eating with it.  I have found my abdominal bloating to disappear when I use it, to the point people have asked if I have lost weight!  My only issues are that I sometimes need to be careful passing gas, (air may not be all that sneaks out) and I forget to take it twice a day.  Once I get relief from the bloating I have found I can cut it to once daily and get the same effects.  I don't need to use it constantly, only when the constipation interferes with life. I have never noticed any side effects.

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	rmercury, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	6/26/2011 11:32:59 AM	I have been taking this for 3-4 years highest dose 2Xday. It takes it a little while to kick in. As for side effects, my entire body is sore all the time my knees are the worst. I get tightness in my chest but all of it was worth it to be able to go to the bathroom or that is what I thought until recently. In  the last year my body has started swelling and feeling bloated from hands to feet. I have also gained weight which makes no since because I do cardio an hour a day then weight training (both) 6 days a week. As of today I have decided I am going to quit taking it and see what happens. Wish me luck.
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	HelenJ, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	45-54	6/18/2011 7:25:41 AM	I have severe IBS for many years.  I have had rectal surgery for fissures and fistulas caused by it.  I have constant rectal bleeding.  I started this medicine about a week ago.  I have samples for 8mcg's.  Came with no literature.  I immediately started with nausea and vomiting.  Then I could not sleep, and when I did started having weird, unpleasant dreams.  Then this morning finally fell asleep and was awakened at 4am with a severe muscle cramp in my leg that brought me to tears.  Got up two hours later and decided it had to be these meds.  Got on the computer and varified it.  So far the side effects are outweighing the benefits.  If these side effects don't dissapate in the next couple of days I am calling the doctor and taking myself off this.  By the way, my bowel movements are minaminally inproved.  I feel for the people taking the higher dose.  I lost two days of work from the naseau and vomiting.  I did find that they sell an over the counter naseau gum made from ginger that is used for chemo and does help.  The pharmacist recommended it.  Its all natural and was not costly.
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	19-24	6/5/2011 10:02:40 PM	My doctor started me off on the 24 mcg dose and about two or three weeks later switched me because it cased awful stomach pains and I started having issues being able to feel my hand and feet. Then the doctor put me on the 8mcg and the pain went away but the strange numbness just kept getting worse but I figured it was nothing. A few weeks went by and I wokeup suddenly real early with the numbness, the strange tight almost charlie horse like pains in both shoulders and I felt like something was smashing my chest and it was hard to breathe. It was really scary. My doctor said that it couldn't be from the medicine that it wasn't on their list of side effects nevermind I have never had this numbness before. Now that I have been off it for about 2 weeks the numbness is a little better.So it sure sounds like a side effect to me.

Its so frusterating and if I don't go everyday I become so bloated, which is annoying since i works out and it stretches out my abs! Ive taken amitiza as a sample for about two weeks now. At first I loved it and i become regular for about a week with soft formed stool, but now my stool is kinda going hard again=( Also, I get nasuea and diarreah if I tak eit without food. I get some tightness in my chest and after reading others reviews, now I know why I can't sleep at night! I am now more sluggish too which isn't good. I don't like the side effects and even though it makes me regualar, I can't deal with feeling sluggish and not sleeping through the night. I will just go back to eating lots of fiber plus cereal and taking miralax every other day which has no side effects.

I also was diagnosed with gastroparesis, don't know where that came from. end result was for me to try Amitiza. 24 mg works within 2 hours of digestion. I do get lightheaded dizzy and very nauseated with chills have to lay down can feel bowels moving. my stools are watery in consistency and it takes a good 45 minutes several trips to the library before i'm completely empty. i do feel better but the process interrupts my schedule. cannot leave home or plan anything for at least 3 hours. taking. I do have joint/back pain as well as always feeling tired and weak and just ill.

I don't know if it takes longer for it to actually make a difference but so far I'm not impressed with my results.

Thats when I realized I needed serious help and need to take this seriously.Started seeing a gastroenterologist and had numerous tests and medicines. Nothing worked. Pain and discomfort was becoming quite unbearable.But I have been taking Amitiza 24mcg for about 2weeks, I had a bowel movement nearly an hour later. But the 1st few days, I did have extreme nausea, gas, dry mouth, headache, and dizziness, within 15 mins. The nausea and headaches made me not want to continue this product. But I promised myself to give it at least 2 weeks. And I have had at least 2 bm's everyday since taking Amitiza and the symptoms have decreased.FYI: my little tip...suck on a few halls or peppermints after u take Amitiza...it will lessen the nausea, tremendously.

I had constant diarrhea and nausea and stopped taking it. My doctor then suggested that I take fiber tablets (Fibercon) at noon followed by one Amitiza after dinner and then SennaGen(a natural vegetable laxative) before bedtime. After a few days I had a normal bowel movement and a firm stool. I had to try different doses of the Fibercon and Senna Gen to realize a good result.

So bad that I had to home school at one point because the pain and bloating was so bad. I looked like I was pregnant all the time, even though I'm a teenager and am very skinny. I didn't expect this to work as well as it has, but I feel almost normal again. Be cautioned, it isn't a wonder drug. I still have to be super careful about when/what/how much I eat, and I eat copious amounts of bran and drink a ton of water... but this combined with Amitiza has made a great impact on my quality of life. I started out on 8mcg, but quickly went up to 24mcg. If it stops working, you may want to up your dose. But as with any drug, it's probably best to start on the lowest dose so you don't shock your body. Sometimes I feel a little nauseous from it, but compared to what I was living with before, I'll take that any day! Other than that, no side effects. The only way you'll know haw it affects you is to try it for yourself. The key is using it as part of an OVERALL treatment. :)
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	Troubled Amitiza User, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/19/2011 3:54:56 PM	I was giving this as a sample last Friday. There was no insert with it, so I had to look up the medication on the internet. I took one Saturday night. Sunday afternoon I started having weird feelings, weakness,faintness,weird thoughts. I figured it was from the Colonoscopy I had on Friday, and was just tired. Sunday night I took pill # 2. Monday morning  I woke up feeling weird; like I wasn't me. About mid morning, I went into full Depression/Anxiety Attack mode. I called the Dr. to see if I was having a reaction to the Anesthetic and they said that would have been out of my system. After finding this website, I figured I was having the SEVERE depression side effects from this; and have since stopped taking it. I would rather have IBS~C than end up in a psychic ward somewhere!!I was very troubled that there wasn't a insert in the sample box, and on Amitiza website, it says nothing about Depression. I am 5 years free from taking depression meds so I know this medicine is what triggered my symptoms.

I have tried everything: laxatives, more fiber, more water, exercise,bulk laxatives, Miralax, Zelnorm. . .nothhing worked until Amitiza.  I've been taking it for about 3 months.  It's truly a miracle.  I've had no side effects except an occasional headache, but not &quot;pooping&quot; gives me a raging headache, so I'll take this any day.

Of course nothing did &amp; I have been taking so many different kinds of laxatives as well. Then they have been trying me on different diets because I have lost so much weight &amp; no one can figure that out either. I have other medical conditions, so I have to be careful what I can take &amp; I am always getting blood tests. The only side effect I have had with the medication is nasua when I didn't take it with food one morning. But I have taken this med every day for the past month &amp; I have yet been able to have a bowel movement on my own.  I have to enema my self every other day to clean my self out. It is not fun. I would think by now the drug would be working. The only complaint it has helped is th chronic pain, but even now that is coming back. I still get bloated every day &amp; still don't feel like eating. When I am hungry &amp; eat something I can't eat much. I especially can't eat meat because it just tears up my intestines.  I really thought this was going to be a miracle drug for me. Boy was I heart broken.
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	lep, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	11/21/2010 9:47:02 PM	My son has suffered from chronic constipation with fecal soiling for the majority of his life since potty training.  At first we thought he just wasn't training, and then we thought he was waiting too long to go.  Our Pediatrican sent us to a gastro dr.  We tried senekot, miralax, and I think it was zoloft.  Senekot &amp; miralax helped some but my son still had soiling when involved in activities such as running and playing ball.  The zoloft was working well but caused dizzy spells and was taken off the market.  The Amitiza worked wonderful once we got him cleaned out with the icky drink for colonoscopies.  He has almost no problems now. Ocassionally he'll have streaking but nothing like the &quot;filling up his pants&quot; he use to have.  After a year and a half of virtually no soiling problems and 4 clean x-rays we have begun backing him off the medicine.  I hope we don't regress.  It took 4 years with the gastro dr. to get to this point.  Because of the constipation my son has a stretched place in his colon.  If that place continues to be a problem we will have to consider surgery.  I wish that parents were given more information about constipation.  Many children (especially boys) experience problems.  Since my son's diagonsis I've talked to at least 3 parents whose boys had similar symptoms and thus went to a gastro doctor and recieved relief with various medications.

I am allergic to all laxatives so far that I know other than amitiza, altho that is the only perscribed laxative med that I have been given besides miralax. when miralax became otc, i could no longer take it bc of severe vomiting like all the other otc laxatives. I regret that I have had to stop taking amitiza after a month n a half bc i suffer from svt and have a heart murmer. this med caused severe shortness of breath and rapid heart rate for me. looks like im going back to taking milk of mag once a week. i am not allergic to it, but getting up in middle of nite and constantly going til completely dehydrated isnt fun, but neither is constipation. i did however gain weight(have chosen not to get on scale)bc i stayed hungry all the time on this med. since i have been off of it for a week, my appetite is somewhat under control but im back to way it was before..i never get urge to even go, when i start feeling bloated and realize its been a week, ill take milk of mag. i caution anyone with heart problems or even anxiety to not take this med. I did not catch reviews stating problems with that until i repeatidly had issues after taking it. still waiting on the perfect drug for my condition...ive tried everything.

Dr put me on Miralax and I had ok results, but had to adjust up to twice a day, even then, results weren't what he wanted but better than without.  Dr wanted me to try Amitiza so he gave me 16 days worth of 8 mg to take twice a day with food.  I only made it 4.  All four nights I didn't sleep at all and had muscle fatigue.  First day I had stabbing stomach pains and was scared to eat.  2nd day I had nausea.  3rd day I started to get flu-like symptoms.  4th day I had all of the above.Honestly I'd rather feel uncomfortable with no meds or just with Miralax, than take this drug and be actually SICK

I was prescribed 24 mcg of Amitiza (a strong dose); it worked after 3 pills but now, a week later, I am using the bathroom 5-7 times per day with severe urgency and explosive diarrhea.  I think I need a weaker dose.  It does give me stomach cramps and nausea, but it's usually only the first few hours after taking it.

I have been taking it twice a day for about 6 days now and I have NOT had one BM since I started Amitiza! The only thing I have been having is nausea, tightness in my chest, heartburn, cramping and being very tired.  I couldn't sleep through the night before I started Amitiza, but now I'm up most of the night...I will be calling my doctor in the a.m.!  Its so hard taking care of a 5yr old when I feel so bad!
Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	wasstoppedup, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/27/2010 4:05:32 PM	I started taking this medication when I was finally diagnosed with constipation predominant IBS, and it has been a wonder drug along with the Miralax. Used in conjunction with Miralax, I have a good bowel movement everyday and sometimes 2-3 times a day! YES, the side effects took over when I first began the medication, but after about a week, there were gone. The side effects are not nearly as bad as the constipation was. The only problem I have with it is the cost. It's $100 for a 30 day prescription of 60 - 24mcg. Fortunately, I have been able to cut back to one a day and stretch it out the prescription over two months. I have read some of the reviews and realized that people are not taking this medicine as prescribed. It's supposed to be taken everyday to work properly. At first, it may give you a good bowel movement everyday then slack off for a few days, but it will eventually regulate itself. 
Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	8/25/2010 12:58:29 PM	I found relief from my IBS-C symptoms with this drug at 8 mcg. I find if I drink a lot of water and still use fiber, it works better. I tried to increase the dosage for greater results but that increased the side effects. The results and side effects are inconsistent from day to day but I still find benefit overall. It even reduces bloating/distention which nothing else I tried did. Some days I have flu-like side effects, some days I have weaker results. Some days I feel ok in both aspects. I also have fibromyalgia and this medication has definitely increased my muscle pain to the point where I might have to discontinue, even at the less-than-normal starting dose I'm on. The fibromyalgia reaction hasn't subsided in almost a month since I started. Since there are few drugs to treat both IBS-C or fibromyalgia and I'm equally debilitated by both, I have quite a dilemma. I hope that Linaclotide (a similar chloride channel drug) comes to market soon without fibromyalgia side effects and/or Prucalopride (a drug that works via different, possible more Zelnorm-like mechanism) becomes available in the US.
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	debace1@aol.com, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	8/23/2010 3:56:34 PM	I was prescribed this 3 weeks ago. I was taking it twice a day. I am a very energetic person and I had no energy while taking this. I had a mild headache every day and had body aches. I truly felt horrible.  I also had gained 5 lbs. After reading the reviews, I realized it was probably the medicine making me feel so horrible and I stopped it.  It has been 3 days off of the medicine and I am feeling like myself again. I have my energy back and I have lost the 5 lbs that I had put on. As far as helping with the constipation, it did ok at first but really didn't help much. The side effects were far worse than the constipation!!

I started the Ametizia 1 wk ago and it seems to work- I woke up the next morning after 1 dose and my stomach did not hurt! For the first time in  many,many yrs I had no pain. There ARE side effects though. I had major headache,trouble sleeping and BIZARRE dreams. But after such misery for so many yrs-- I will live with it and the high copay if the drug continues to work.

The MD always says &quot;drink more water and take more fiber&quot;.  If that worked I would have been happy, but fiber 3 times a day does nothing.  The Amitiza does work, but it is inconsistent.  Side effects make it difficult to take, having to plan what days I can afford to feel nautious, and generally off, not to mention being able to visit the bathroom readily the 3 hours or so after taking.  Overall it is providing a fair amount of relief.  You must eat food when you take this, and the more the better, or nausea is a real problem.  If I can't find a generic version however the cost may prove to be too prohibitive.

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	2	Female	65-74	8/5/2010 3:03:57 PM	When I took the 24mcg dose with dinner the first time, I had severe heartburn during the night and difficulty sleeping. I stopped. Now I am trying again, taking only 1 24 mcg dose, but after breakfast. The first day produced several somewhat hard stools; the second day more well-formed stools and then two bouts of almost liquid diarrhea. I tried the 8 mcg. dose twice a day on the next day, according to my doctor's suggestion. However, that did not produce anything during the whole day and I actually felt uncomfortable and constipated. Went back to the 24mcg. dose the following day. Again, several moderately well-formed BMs, but still not complete; some straining to produce pellets as well. I probably should take the 24mcg. twice a day, but feel apprehensive about taking the pill at night since even the 8 mcg. dose gave me  tightness in the chest and a headache which were particularly hard to deal with during the middle of the night, and made  it difficult to stay asleep. My normal life is on hold while I try to adjust to this Rx. I was previously on Miralax, as well as Citrucel, Colace, and Aloe Vera gel, but I felt the Miralax was beginning to lose its effectiveness. In any case, it almost never produced complete BMs, and often too many for convenience or comfort. I have dropped the Miralax and the Aloe Vera (2 oz. 2x a day) while on the Amitiza. My problem off medicines or OTC items is inability to go or hard pellets; on medicines or OTC, however, I usually go TOO often, many smallish BMS, even if soft and not hard to pass. Yet reducing the amount of the Rx or OTC item doesn't seem to help me find a happy medium. Don't know if I can stick with the Amitiza much longer.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/14/2010 9:08:15 AM	I recently had Gastric Bypass Surgery.  A side effect of this surgery is difficulty with bowel movements.  Since taking the medicaition I have a bowel movement everyday.  Since loosing so much weight I am now starting to experience the side effects of the medication.  Currently I am on 1 pill 2 X's per day 24 mg.  I am now experimenting with doeage to see if I can take it once a day or every other day with minimal side effects.  Taking two pills per day is becoming an ordeal that I can no longer withstand.  I can deal with the side effects in the morning, the evening pill puts me in bed 10-15 min after taking it.  I can't function so although I find many positives in this drug and would highly recommend it, I have to adjust dosage so that at this lighter weight I can tolerate the medication.

I am really not a fan of the side effects of this medicine. Soon after taking the medication I feel like I've taken a muscle relaxer; within 30 mins of taking the medication it hurts to breathe and I feel as though I'm trying to gasp for air; my joints ache so much that I can't pick up my kids anymore; I haven't been able to sleep more than 4 hours total per night; I got a cold 2 days after taking this which feels like the flu because of the joint achiness. As far as working; it has improved the frequency with which I go and the straining has decreased a bit but like another user I feel so nauseous before, during and after it far outweighs the 'positive'. I hope it works for all of you fellow patients. :-)

I've used amitiza sporadically and it really helped with the bloat and constipation. I am only into day 2 of 2 pills x 2/day. Have experienced urgent runny stools as well as regular stools since using it and I am cautiously excited about being able to eat anything I want by using it without looking 8 monts pregnant with bloat and the pain and pressure that go with it. I was previously avoiding gluten and dairy to control my symptoms and feel really ripped off about my food choices especially at social functions and hope this will help me to eat normal again.I have good px insurance nd can afford the drugs more than the special gluten and dairy free foods.

I was in terrible pain and found myself taking laxatives every day for 2 weeks. I was prescribed Amitiza and it is wonderful for producing bowel movements. I have a weird side effect to this. I get very nauseous when I have to use the bathroom. I wouldnt feel like I need to go but when the nausea hits I've discovered I really need to go. After using the bathroom my nausea went away. For me, I find nausea unbearable and cannot function with it. In addition, my stomach didn't hurt. Rather, it felt uncomfortable and weird b/c I could feel and hear my stomach gurgling and my intestines moving. Not unbearable but it's a weird feeling that I don't really like. Just have to decide which is better: constipation or nausea?

This medicine has been a life saver.  I use to be on zelnorm which was great, but this is great as well.  I actually have normal looking poops instead of &quot;rabbit pellets&quot; that hurt when going to the bathroom.  I have had no side effects, and I only hope that this stays on the market unlike zelnorm.  My fear is that doctors will prescribe this to people that it is not intended.  The last thing I want is for them to pull this medicine off the market because it took a while for something to be as great as zelnorm.  I would not be afraid to try this medicine if you are one of those people it is intended for.

Just recently, it has not been working as effectively.  I will have to see what my doctor recommends now.

I already take meds for bp, reflux and high cholesterol, so what's one more, right. I have only been taking this medication for a couple of weeks. The first 3 or 4 days I had great results with no side effects, but now I am having constant headaches, shakiness and fatigue (which is seriously interfering with my exercise regimin). I feel lethargic most of the time and once again not having regular bm's.  Right now I feel the side effects are worse than the symptoms. I'm going to talk to my Dr. and see what he says. I have tried just about every other remedy there is, (perscription and otc), with no good results. Not sure what the next step is going to be, except maybe to see a GI doc.

I am able to have a BM everyday with no problems. I have been on the medication for over a month now and can't say enough good things about it. 
Other	Yvonne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	4/1/2010 10:15:56 AM	I stopped taking this medicine because i had a major problem with a side effect, it was hard for me to breath all the way, i hade tightness/dull feeling on the center of my chest like if somebody really heavy was sitting on my chest... It did help with the constipation, but i also would get very dehydrated even when i still overhydrated? I dont know where that comes from but medications can effect everybody differently...but just be aware about this pill. And stop taking it if these side effects happen or if you dont feel right. Also i had extreme gas pains as well.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	3/30/2010 3:17:37 PM	This medication is greatly effective on softening hard stools. I have been experiencing some difficulty breathing , like heavy-ness or tight dull feeling in the center of my chest, but other than that and also when i pass a stool , to much soft stool tries to come out all at once causing my old anal fissures to split again.
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	3/25/2010 12:51:15 PM	I noticed someone else said they were terrified to try this drug. I was too after reading some of the reviews. Perhaps some of those people didn't need such an extreme measure, I noticed alot of them said they were going back to miralax or stool softeners...Let me say, NONE of those work for me I've suffered from chronic constipation for years (since I was a baby actually) and in the last 4 its gotten incredibly worse. I couldn't even get a colonoscopy because drinking an entire 238gm bottle of miralax didn't work...literally did nothing. My doctor said he's never seen that one before... and I ended up in the ER with dehydration and vommiting. There they tried to do an enema and that didn't work either... My doctor prescribed me Amitiza and I'm on 24mg 2x a day. This is literally the only thing that works for me, and I am so relieved to have something. I started out taking it once a day at night because I wanted to test it out after reading about the horrible side effects. I don't have any of the side effects except for I'll get tightening in the chest. Since I know whats causing it it doesn't bother me and usually subsieds within 30-45 min. And I'd rather have a little anxiety for 30 minutes than be constipated for 3-4 weeks. If you suffer from chronic constipation and nothing is working for you, I would highly reccomend this drug. It has been such a relief (no pun intended) to have something that makes me not have to center my life around fiber, laxatives, and when my next movement will be. Give it a chance if you're anything like me!! I am so glad I did. 
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	londonrain17, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	3/18/2010 1:40:03 PM	I will be honest in saying that after reading the reviews I was terrified of taking this medication.But then I realized that so few were good reviews and I figured that the majority of people who review drugs only review them if they have had a bad experience-same for people who review doctors or products so I took the medication. I am a chronic pain patient and the medications used to treat my health issues cause me to only be able to use the bathroom once every 10-14 days.Needless to say I look like I am four months pregnant most of the time and as someone who has dealt with anorexia for the last 17 years the weight gain associated from not being able to go to the bathroom has me very uneasy. Unlike so many people on here I have had very few side effects with this medication-24mg 2x day. The one side effect that is the biggest problem is how exhausted it makes me and to be honest that is the only side effect I have had with this medication. It has worked. I now am able to go to the bathroom at least once every other day-sometimes I am able to go twice a day. I have had this problem for years and the only thing that would work was the kind of medication that is used before a colonoscopy and that medication is very harsh so it was a route I did not take.So far I have been happy with this medication and I am hoping that the side effect of being tired will go away with time. Anyone who is afraid to take this medication due to the many bad reviews should just take the plunge and take the pill because you will never know if you don't. What works for some people does not work for others so it is worth taking the medication to see if this is finally the medication that will help you and if it isn't you will know and you will be able to switch to something different by talking with your doctor. I went in thinking the worst about this medication but it has actually worked very well for me.
Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	Vic, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/17/2010 4:41:05 PM	I have suffered with chronic constipation most of my life. My doctor recently gave me Amitiza to try. I experienced the most common side effects such as nausea, blotting, headache, and shortness of breath. But the worst side effect I experienced was horrible body aches like you get when you are coming down with the flu. I stopped the medication for a few days then took another pill. Just like the first time I experienced the same side effects again. I can handle everything but the horrible body pain. I took Ibuprofen but it did not relieve the pain. The body aches lasted for almost 24 hours from just one pill. I called my doctor about my reaction. He had not heard of body pain as one of the side effects. I am so disappointed with this medicine. I was hoping to be one of the lucky ones and finally get relief from my constipation. I think that maybe more research should be done on this drug on its side effects.

I have suffered from chronic constipation all my life and nothing else seemed to relieve it. When I first started using it (only for the first few days), I did feel a little sleepy after taking the pill and the BM that came soon after was diarrhea like. I'm glad that I stuck through my body adjusting to it because now I have a BM at least every other day and no longer have the uncomfortable bloated stomach. If you can live with the gas it gives you like I have learned to, I'm sure you'll be very happy with the results.

After that the b.m.'s were once or twice a week, which was a big improvement for me. However, I have now been on the drug for app. six months and it seems to have nearly lost it's effectiveness. I have doubled my dose on my own, and still am only having one b.m. every week or two.  I may have to switch to somthing stronger soon.

Therefore, I am on many medications, many of which are constipating in their own right. I have been taking stool softeners and fiber supplements for over 3 years.  When I started Amitiza in August 2008, I had the 24mcg dose.  That proved to be too high a dose and caused major side effects.  Now I am on the 8mcg dose, which is a lot better.  I take it only PRN (as needed) when I go over 5 days without at BM of any kind and have tried all of my other options. This last week I took it and noticed that the roof of my mouth, my tongue and my throat were all raw and very sore (not an anaphylactic reaction). Has anyone else had this reaction?Also, I've had terrible flatulence that smells like something crawled up and died inside of me.  I've also had nausea up and over what my regular meds give me.  I have to cook for my family and nausea makes it very difficult to do, let alone eat what I've cooked. I won't be taking this med again anytime soon.

Always felt a little queasy with bloating.Also, couldn't seem to think straight anymore.

I'm  hopeful that after a few more months on this drug, I will see some further consistency.  I just dont recall turnning into an old lady obsessed with her bowels.

I have not experienced a single side effect.  I take it in the evening with no &quot;effects&quot; the following day at work.  Prior to Amitiza, I would be bloated and very uncomfortable by the end of the week, then locked in the house on weekends after taking laxitives.  I feel normal again.  I'm using the samples now and waiting for my insurance company to approve payment on the prescription.

In the beginning it didn't do anything for me. But for the last two weeks I have had nothing but diarrhea and recently starting having severe abdominal pain. So I'm going to stop taking it and make a doctor's appointment.

This medicine has done an awesome job in keeping me regular without the cramping from other drugs. The only draw back would be the price, I wish they would make a generic!

I am still only taking the samples but after reading these reviews I feel all the same horrible side effects.  Nausea, difficulty sleeping, gas, extreme headaches, sweating at night..possibly high BP?  These side effects allow me to not do my job and I seem more confused than normal... I am not continuing.

In the beginning I experienced gas but this passed, then my stools became frequent at least once a day very soft, then to like water. But nothing so unbearable to overshadow being able to get rid of waste until now.... I have had a urinary tract infection for 7 days that I can't get rid of by means of OTC, water &amp; cranberry juice so I have a Dr. appt. tomorrow. I stopped taking this medication last night. Research on the web showed this to be a Less Common side affect.

I tried everything, including acupuncture (did not help). Amitiza as incredibly expensive and all it did was make me fell like I had the Flu. I was taking 8mg twice daily and had almost no effect on my bowel movements. I since have switched to an OTC drug, generic stool softener that gives me no side effects and is just under $5 at my local CVS. Taking this daily has allowed me to produce a bowel movement almost daily and this item does not create any form of dependency.

I was put on this drug two years ago.  I ignored the nausea and many other side effects because I was going every day.  This summer I was diagnosed with hypertension and put on two different BP drugs, then another for irregular heart beat.  I was so over drugged I could hardly get out of bed all summer.  I went to my GP's PA and he thinks it's all the medication. So I quit taking everything. It all started with the Amitiza.  I am never taking it again.  I have been taking my BP twice a day and it is now normal with no medication.  Do not take this drug. I am so upset that the cardio Dr.s didn't check the symptoms before they started over medicating me.

BTW, I have been taking it for one week twice a day and nothing has happened.  I was really hoping to get on a somewhat normal sechdule and I am very dissapointed.For me, my side effects were nausea and headaches.

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	Trish, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4		35-44	10/20/2009 1:28:13 PM	I have had a lot of intestine/bowel problems my whole life.  As I got older it got worse.  I never felt like I could go to the bathroom and be done without going several more times that hour.  My days and nights were like this with a lot of cramping.  I started taking amitiza recently and it seems to work quite well.  I can stay out of the bathroom for hours at a time now.  I found that I don't get sick to my stomache if I be sure to take it with food (like a meal).  I have been very happy with is to far.  Except for feeling nautious, especially if I don't eat enough when taking the pill, I don't really have any of the other side effects.

Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	F. A., 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	10/12/2009 5:00:09 AM	I have a low motility problem and IBS, due to a misdiagnosed, delayed appendectomy (ruptured) and 8 days of antibiotics 15 years ago. I took Propulsid until it was taken off th market and it worked great, although I was one of those who had severe chest pains from it (did not realize it was the drug). I took Amitiza for 4 months with great results, then quit my job and it took 4 months to get my Medicare going and get back to my doctor. Cost prohibited me from getting it without insurance. I have been taking Amitiza for about 10 days this time, with great results. I have tried every laxative, fiber usually adds to the problem and others have to be taken every day - not good. With constipation I get nausea, heartburn, severe cramping and fatigue. I vomited once after taking my Amitiza on an empty stomach, so take it immediately after a meal before my stomach has a chance to empty and no problem. I had slight headaches and some loose stools within the first week of starting the drug both times, none now. I do have some heartburn in the evening but a Tums fixes it, unlike from constipation. I took a couple of stool softeners today and had to take them once a week or 10 days the last time I took the med, but have to take them every day without the Amitiza. There is some urgency which is welcome for me as I had no urge before. I take 24mcg twice a day and if my stools are too loose I skip a dose which is rare but does happen occasionally. I am so grateful for this drug, it certainly is not right for everyone but for some of us it allows us to live normal lives. I used to think people were crazy to obsess over their bowel habits - now I understand.

Everytime I take it, 24mcg, I have horrible cramping and gas, tightness in my chest, and am extremely nausuas.  For the first few days everything ran right through me! I was excited, but then it all stopped, I constantly feel like I have to go, but nothing comes out!  I would not reccommend this medication to any one who wants a life outside of the house!  I felt so sick for about 3-5 hours after taking it.

Started the amitizia, the 2nd day had a great bowel movement, nothing the first day. inconsistent bowel movements since. some cramping and general uncomfortable feelings before a bowel movement, including the feeling that I NEED to go and cannot until maybe the third try.  Brings on one very loose stool and then the remaining stool is difficult.  Tonight is amitizia's last shot with me.  Phillips magnesium so far has worked better.
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	9/23/2009 8:41:40 PM	This RX worked very well for me before I had a baby. I was given 24mg to take 2x/daily. Side effect was tight chest which I thought was my asthma until I read other reviews and saw similar complaints. After I had my son I couldn't even take 8mg because everything went right thru me. I guess the baby changed my body's reaction to it. Im still looking for a medication that will give me some relief without living in the bathroom. 
Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	35-44	9/22/2009 7:54:06 PM	I have only been on this medication for 2 days.  I can say I have had more BM in the last 2 days than in weeks combine before.  The problem is since I take it after I eat I have some of the worst bloating and cramps.  I am willing to stick it out to see if the bloating and discomfort get a little better.  My Dr. did warn me about cramping in the begining but if it doesn't go away I think I will have to stop taking it.  Thanks to all the other posters it is helpful to know what to look out for.  I really hope I can make this work not sure how much more I can take.

I was up all night with severe diarrhea (almost as bad as a prep for a colonoscopy). I immediately stopped taking it, and called my doctor, who is now giving me an endoscopy; who claimed that this medication should not have done this to me. 1 day of taking this and it did this to me. I couldn't imagine taking it longer!!

Regarding my bowel movements it has worked consistently. Also the side effects have been as consistent namely: stomach pain/cramps, chest tightness, tiredness/fatigue and bloating.  I wouldn't take this medication if the alternative wasn't so bad (severe constipation).  My advice to someone considering this medication is to carefully weigh all options available to you before trying this medication: the cost and the side effects somewhat outweigh the positive results.

This is a MIRACLE DRUG!!! He takes 24mcg in the morning and 8mcg at night. It took some time to find the correct dosage for him, but once we did he has not had any problem. I would very highly recommend this medication for chronic constipation sufferers who like something that is extremely easy to take, and works wonders. It has literally saved my son's life!!!

It make me feel really weird, I experienced tightness in my chest and shortness of breath. My upper body felt numb right after taking it. It also gave me chronic diarrhea . After approximately 3 months, I have hardly any side effects and I finally have pretty normal bowel movements. I have been chronically constipated for almost my entire life and this medicine has become a lifesaver for me. You have no idea the measures I've taken prior to this medication, to try and have a normal life, and until now, it was terrible. I am so thankful that my body adjusted and that this medicine works for me. Hang in there!

I was really worried about going back to teaching in the fall. I finally quit taking the Amitiza, and things seem to be getting better.  I have a feeling I'll still be taking a laxative ocassionally.

I called the pharmacy and was told to stop taking it immediately. I also found out i was not supposed to take it at all because I have a Hiatal hernia. This has got to be the worst medicine i have ever taken. That was over 2 weeks ago and I'm still breaking out in a rash. Think twice before taking this medicine, I wish I would have. If you should need help stick to Mirilax.

This is the first medicine to regulate my bowels without pain. Although I love it for that the side effects are overwhelming and I've made another appt with my Dr. My side effects are tightness in the chest,neck and abdomen, shortness of breath, pain in chest when I take deep breaths, and anxiety. In addition if I've missed a dose for over 24 hours (2 doses) when I resume the first dose consumed leaves me extremely anxious and ironically my right hand from fingers to bicep is cold. It feels like I have an IV in the arm. This is why I made another appt so I'll see if it's related or not next Monday.

At first I thought the side effects were from the Savella (I stopped taking it since I thought that was the problem), but after stopping the Savella, I realized all the side effects were from Amitiza. I had severe anxiety, mood swings, extreme fatigue (terrible for someone who already has it!), dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, terrible headaches, and glossy eyes. If not for the horrendous side effects, I think the product did do it's job for IBS. Too bad it about ran me to the emergency room!

Adding enough water throughout the day plus exercise has helped also.  My fear is the need for long term treatment since has to be approved by my insurance.

Unfortunately, this relief was short lived, and after two weeks of working miracles, I've been left back at square one.

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	Helen, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Female		6/15/2009 8:28:34 PM	I have been giving this medication to my 88 year old mother. It has not worked well for her. She only has one bowel movement a week and then only a small amount. The movement does not look like she is constipated. It is loose and has no appearance of what you would expect from someone that hasn't went in a week. When she does go it is only after using supositories.

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	newuser, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	6/6/2009 4:45:42 PM	I quit taking it the first time around since it made me drowsy. I decided to give it another go several months later and to keep taking it to see if the sleepiness slowly goes away. Some success within the first two days, but very lethargic.

All I do is sleep. Within 1 hour of taking it I have to lay down.  It works well and relieves my constipation, the first drug that has helped me.  I will ask my DR if I can get the lower dose. Maybe that will be OK. It feels like I took a muscle relaxer as the side effects occur so quickly.

Although I don't find it as effective as Zelnorm, it is a great product!  you don't realize how well it is working until you stop taking it.  I take two at night time and have a bowel movement every morning.  I highly recommend it!!!

The side effects that I have endured are as follows: severe nausea, very bad headache, fast heart rate, dizziness, terrible reflux (to the point that I had to double my medicine for this), hives all over, sleeplessness, fatigue, weak eyes (when I get sick, my eyes are the first to show how ill I am) and no relief for what I am taking this medicine for in the first place. I am stopping this medication and going back to my OTC, which cost a whole lot less and the side effects are nothing compared to Amitiza. I dont know who or what they tested this drug on, but whoever or whatever did not have or give an opinion. They need to change something in this medication so that there are not so many side effects and have much better results.I would not recommend this medication for any reason. BEWARE!!!!!!

I was diagnosed with chronic idiopathic constipation with ibs. This drug works great inpromoting a bowel movement, but I'm experiencing side effects that are interfering with my daily activities. Dry mouth, fatigue, and depression are the most prominent. I'm giving it a little more time to see if the side effects diminish but overall I'm satisfied!

I just figured it was because of my poor eating habits - and that eventually I would go.  So I would walk around feeling miserable for days and days that turned into weeks.  Well I had started weight watchers &amp; started looking @ exactly how much fiber I was eating.  I could eat 30g+ and still be constipated and need to use a laxative at the end of the week +.  My doctor looked at what I had been eating and gave me some samples of the Amitiza to try.  I'm only taking 1- 8mcg pill a day and I am telling you this is like a godsend.  I can't believe I can acutally go to the bathroom at least every other day.  I can't believe this drug has actually been out there and I totally missed it!  I love it!  No more correctol, or epsom salts or anything else I have tried over the years.  And when I say I have tried everything, I really have tried everything.  
Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	jjevan s97, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	25-34	4/16/2009 8:07:32 PM	I have been taking Amitiza for 3 months 2 8mcg pills per day in combination with Lactulose 1 tbsp 2-4 times per day and I don't think the Amitiza does anything because I work at a doctors office and was given some samples for my chronic constipation and it took me taking 3-24mcg pills and two days and I finally gave up on the amitiza and took a dulcolax. The Lactulose howerver is a life saver!!!!! Works like a charm if I take it regularly with the Amitiza. My doctor has told me I would be on Amitiza for a looooonnnggg time and after 3-4 months to ween off the Lactulose but I finally have the right combo to help my problem. And yes it does make me nauseated everytime I take it so I have to take it right before I go to bed or I'll feel the nausea. I have 2-4 BM every AM before I go to work so I have to get up an hour early but just to have a GOOD BM every day is worth it.

As a result of the same I was prescribed Mag Oxide.  I discontinued the Amitiza and returned to Sienna which corrected the mag level.

So I took the 24 mcg Amitiza hoping to &quot;gently&quot; relieve my constipation.  For 3 days now I have had severe cramping and diareha.  Don't take this medicine!  It's been horrible. It's not worth it!  I'll go back to taking the Metamucil!

In that time consiptation has been worse and I've developed a very bad skin rash.   I have had to take steriods for the rash and my body seems to be dehyrdated even though I am drinking water constantly.  This was prescribed by a GI Doc from the Mayo clinic.I was not a Zelnorm user but this Doc feel that Zelnorm should never have been taken off the market.

ONLY AT THE BEGINNING! ;-)When I first started taking it I had dry mouth when I woke up in the morning, no appetite(lost 4 pounds), and my heart would beat rapidly after taking the meds. But that was just my body adjusting. Within the first week I went to the bathroom  everyday. Now I've been on it for over a month. I'm going to the bathroom, daily or every other day and all the side effects are long gone. ;-) I take the highest dose twice a day with a meal. It is my saving grace. Before I took this I was going to the bathroom, once every week, and that was only because I was talking a laxative. ;-( In addition to the medication, I add benefiber into a pint glass of water once a day (to increase my fiber intake) and start every morning with plain quaker oats add water &amp; microwave for three minutes, add some butter and brown sugar) Hope this helps you....;-) Also I am a 30 yr old female who lives in NYC.

I am not going to take it any more.  I found help by taking Magnesium.  I read that the side effect was diahria, so I thought it might help.  I take 500 to 750 mg a day and I can have a bm about twice a week.  Without it, I can have a bm about once every week to 10 days.  My doctor checked my magnesium levels to make sure it's not too much, but it's been fine.  Maybe it will help some of you.  good luck.

I have had IBS-C all of my life - and had chronic colon infections with septicemia nearly as long.  I am finally regular, and am no longer sick.  It's like clockwork: I take the pill, twice a day, and an hour after I take it, I take a bowel movement.  I am nauseous for about ten minutes before I have to go, but once I go, the nausea is gone.  I would never, ever stop taking this medication!  The year since I've started taking this has been the best year of my life, colon-wise.
Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	19-24	3/15/2009 11:17:16 PM	My doctor perscrcribed Amitiza 24mcg 2x daily and a laxative for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.  The combination of the two drugs was effective, however the Amitiza caused severe nausea.  I was not able to sleep after taking my evening dose and not able to concentrate on my classwork during the day.  I stopped taking the Amitiza because it seemed to interfere with my life more than my constipation.

Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	3/14/2009 2:08:52 PM	Background:  I am a 43-year-old female. My health is very good.....I am extremely active - crossfit, etc......my diet is quite healthy (whole foods, no red meat)  After open abdominal surgery to remove a huge benign tumor (I'm only 105 lbs and thought I was pregnant) I started having &quot;bathroom problems&quot; and was diagnosed with Constipation Predominant Irritable Bowel brought on by trauma to the gut.  Amitiza:  Although this product worked for me after only one day of taking it 3x/day as prescribed, the side effects are HORRIBLE.  An hour after taking the first pill I thought I was having an asthma attack or coming down with a chest cold or pneumonia - my chest was terribly tight, and I had a persistent cough.  I didn't relate it to the medicine until I took the second pill, after which the tightness worsenend.  The morning after my first day of treatment I was amazed at the results, however I had a throbbing headache (I'm not prone to headaches). These side effects might go away with time, but I don't have the time or patience to wait and see. There has to be a better way of treating this condition.
Other	KC, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/12/2009 5:49:25 PM	I took Amitiza 24mcg gel caps for irritable bowel with mild constipation for only 3 days.  Each dose the symptoms of nausea, bloating, &amp; acid reflux got worse and it did not help my irritable bowel.  On the last dose I felt flushed and my face was visibly red.  Even with insurance this is an expensive medication.
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	martyre, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	55-64	3/7/2009 9:42:28 AM	While this medicine produced a bowel movement fairly quickly, I experienced a severe tightness in my chest and a sense of shortness of breath. This is a reported side effect listed as Dyspnea said to have acute onset within 30-60 minutes of taking the drug and usually lasting less than 3 hours. However, I experienced this effect about 12 hours after taking, and the feeling lasted much longer than the three hours noted. I struggled with shortness of breath for several hours. It was a very uncomfortable feeling. I don't think the positive effect of the drug is worth the side effect.
Other	Ricktoid, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	35-44	3/6/2009 2:08:09 PM	I have been on this medication for a little over 2 weeks.  Over that time I have experienced nausea and dizziness making it almost impossible to do my job (Software Engineer).  I have been taking the 8mg twice a day and for my movements its been great (1 to 2 a day of normal consistency).  I am going to try taking it once at night and skipping the morning dose.  If it still impares my ability to work, I will go see my doctor for something else.

It works GREAT!! I am very pleased with it. I do get nauseous for a little bit after I take it, but its well worth it. I have IBS and my doctor gave me a sample (8mcg) and it worked wonderful so I am now on a prescription for it. I am VERY pleased with it. I can go to th bathroom everyday now and I feel relieved when I go.

In spite of taking amitiza 24mcg  2 capsule daily and  1 capsule every other PM I still need to take a dulcolax suppository every 3 days. Which I may add works great and only costs @2.29 for 12 suppositories ( generic)  Can't afford Amitiza ( $ 281.69  for 90 day supply)

Stool becomes impacted and difficult to evacuate.  Due to previous pregnancy lower anus folds over on itself and is complicated by bladder herniation.  I get relief from Amitiza however the nausea becomes overwhelming and bothers me.  I would welcome any suggestions other than surgery, not an option at this point according to my gastro dr...apparently this is very common in women who have had pregancies/delivery.  Bad muscle tone in rectum.

I read all the reviews and was so scared to take this but I know medicane effects people differently.. So I decided to take it and see.. I have lost 10 pounds since last Monday. Not bloated, I always felt like I could take a needle and pop myself to deflate.. But not any more! The only down fall is that it is very expensive. I have good insurance and pd $50.00 for 1 month supply.. But it is worth it! very satisfied!

This medicine really didn't work as well as it should of. Maalox or Mylanta are both bowel stimulants as well and help with other G.I. symptoms. Found it hard to take evening dose because you take it with water and bladder would wake me up at night. Not worth the $45.00 extra a month that it cost when it did not improve condition. May try Activia Yogurt for constipation and will stick to Donnotal or Bentyl for pain and bloating symptoms.

If I even looked at a raw carrot, I'd have stomach cramps and be bound up for days.  Since taking Amitiza 8mcg, I've had relieve from all my IBS symptoms and am able to eat salads again (in moderation, about 3-4 times a week).  The side effects have been manageable, if I have any at all.  Frankly a little nausea and cionstipation relief beats what I used to go through!

I will not be taking another dose.

I do get cramps that are very unfortable at times but it definetely helps me go to the bathroom. I was on a higher does for three months and now moved to &quot;maintenance&quot; dose my doctor called it. It is not working as well but I am going about every 4 days which is much better than how it was without the drug.

It worked the first day. It hasnt worked at all since. I am experiencing severe headache, vomiting, water retention, and stomach cramps. Luckily I have health insurance so the cost wasnt a factor but I am extremely disappointed that they charge so much for a drug that doesnt help.

However, it produced several serious side-effects.  The first was headaches, which were relieved by tylenol.  The second was severe and debilitating dizziness to the extent, walking,driving or working became dangerous and unsafe.  I am now undergoing neurological testing, balance function testing and seeing a neuro-otologist as well as a neurosurgeon to fix these conditions.  DO NOT TAKE THIS MED.  There are other safer, tried and true meds you can use that will not endanger your health.

It worked for me, but after talking to Dr. he asked if I wanted to try a higher dose and I said I would. Keeping track of how it works for me.  Will start higher dose tomorrow and I'm sure it will work just fine.  I had no side effects with 8 mcg, 2 times a day.  Will see how 24 mcg works for a couple of weeks.

It took me about a month to figure out what was making me sick and $7,800 in medical bills.  I have Barrett Disease, hiatal hernia, Acute Gastritis with gastric erosion and h.pylori.  I do not know for sure but with these systems someone told me that Amitza was vitamin B and apparently with my condition I could not break down or handle vitamin B....I do not have all the answers but thought I would share my experience anyway since it costs me so much money.

Since then, can't tell it does Anything except cost!! I still have to rely on Miralax and 3 stool softeners daily.  Been on it for over two years; my G.E. is 'glad I'm still taking it'.  Will stop this foolishness immediately!

Then after a few days, I had colon bloating, gas, very painful diarrhea.  I read the directions on the insert, and it said to give it a few days, but this is rediculous.  When I see my Dr. next week, I'm going to tell him that I want to take something else.  I can't be on the toliet 8 times a day.

Other	Tina L., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	12/16/2008 4:40:49 PM	This was prescribed for me when my abdomen was bloated following bowel resection surgery and my Dr. was insisting I was constipated, which I wasn't. The side affects are terrible. I was fatigued, thirsty, retaining fluid and now that I'm off of it I realize I wasn't sleeping well either. I got a 2nd opinion from a GI Dr. and he doesn't even prescribe this drug due to the side affects and cost and hopes the FDA will remove it at some point. I feel much better now that I've been off of it for 2 weeks.

With this many meds, you'd think I'd be in the bathroom all day. Overall, I haven't suffered from side effects except the occasional dry mouth in the middle of the night. But I don't think the product has worked all that much for me. I still feel the symptoms of IBS, maybe slightly downgraded. My doctor says to give it time which I will. I've had this problem since I was a child, so I can't expect the medicine to work overnight.
Other	7-12 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	7-12	12/13/2008 7:58:45 AM	Daughter has been taking this medication now for 3 months. She has cystic fibrosis. Her mucus acts like glue with her bowels. Miralax, xelnorm, corolase, docusate, and many other medications have not worked. She is not able to take the miralax as she isnt able to handle  the volume of liquid. Her pain is terrible when she takes this medicine. She seems to hurt everywhere, complains of her tummy hurting, and massive headache. I do not recommend this medicine as the side affects are more of a problem as the orginal issues. She had feelings of her &quot;lungs&quot; hurting. Which reading these reviews I have to assume its chest pain. This medicine has not been approved for children of her age, Doctor had to get special approval. I wish I had not ever agree'd to this meds. Kind of feel guilty.

It is extremely effective, I have not been able to go this easily in 5 years.  What a relief.  There is a downside, however.    For 2 hours after I take the pill, I experience headache, body aches, fatigue, runny nose and shaking (exactly like I'm coming down with the flu).  These symptoms go away after 2 hours.  I did have a bit of difficulty sleeping but its only been 2 days so I cant be sure it's from the drug.  I will continue to take it because the benefits outweigh the side effects.

I have RA and do not need anymore joint pain. I was given samples from my dr. but everytime I think I will use it fear of the unknow takes over. I think I will hang on to the samples for a while longer and try to deal with the IBS-C by taking Miralax. I was on Zelnorm before they took it off the market, sometimes I wish they would bring it back.

I am wondering how severe their IBS symptoms actually were if they find the side effects of this medication are worse than their IBS symptoms.I will say the first day on this medication was the worst. I had so much nausea &amp; was either throwing up or running to the bathroom every few minutes with diarrhea. Then again- my body had not relieved itself completely for some time. I think the side effects that i feel the most is the diarrhea. I do take two pills as directed &amp; the nausea is not a problem if i take with food as directed. Sometimes i get a head ache, but it is nothing compared to the horrendous pain i had from the IBS cramping. For me- I'm glad i dealt with the first couple days of &quot;side effects&quot;. It has definitely made a difference in my life.

I then had a not so impressive bowel movement, considering the extreme trauma I had to endure. I thought maybe that's just the first time, but after the second time I thought I was going to vomit up my dinner, and no bowel movement.  By the third day I realized how afraid I was of getting sick to my stomach when it was time to eat. That's not good when you actually should gain weight. (Food= Pain) Even taken without food I felt constant nausea, and no results. How this works well with some people and horribly with others, that should be sorted out. Some of these symptoms could be life threatening, so I wouldn't be so irresponsible as to recommend this drug.

I take the 24mcg capsules twice a day everyday and have had several instestinal obstructions because of it. Zelnorm worked better and didn't have&#160; all of the side effects, Bloating,nausea, extreme pain, weight gain, intestinal obstructions and hospitalizations with IV Morphine to reduce the pain and surgeries and enemas to remove the obstructions. My Dr. has recommended me to take stools softeners daily and Miralax for no bowel movement after 3 days with the Amitiza. May as well not take it at all..it does nothing except make things worse.

I finally went the a G-I doctor. After having several test he diagnosed me IBS-C. He prescriped amitiza. The first time I took it I thought I was dying. I was really unsure about taking it again. I took it again with the same result. I then started to take it once a day but only at bedtime. I have been taking it at bedtime for a week now. This works so much better for me. I have had less bloating and have also been going having bm's more often.

The first dose made me very nauseous,stomach cramps(like a volcano about to erupt,but nothing),chills,headache,and tired. I had also had a flu shot that same day so shrugged it off. The next 3 doses I had the same symptoms, with no BM, I have never had stomache pain like with this med,I also had abd bloating. That 4th dose was my last dose, I couldn't stand feeling like that. My MD has changed my diet(before Amitiza) to mostly soft or liquid food and said I could do enemas a couple x's /wk. So I'm back to the enemas (water and olive oil) no side effects(so far) and instant relief. some way to live huh.

I also am taking Miralax starting this morning as well per Dr.'s order.

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement		2	3	1			10/15/2008 12:14:03 AM	I have PCOS and IBS-C.  When I took the medication twice a day, I didn't feel anything and all of a sudden a few days later I felt like I couldn't move until I had a bm.  I just take one pill a day now; however, I honestly believe the medication has affected my monthly cycles which is not good for my PCOS.  I have been late twice and experienced spotting when I have been taking my birth control regularly and never spotted prior to this medication.  Not sure if this is the medication for me.

I took it for IBS with chronic constipation twice a day. After 5 months however I began getting incredibly dizzy after taking it (with or without food) and began getting migraines at least twice a week. I then switched from the 24MCG to the 8MCG and no longer had any of these side effects. It works just as great but now I don't have to allocate time out of my day to recover from faintness, dizzy spells and headaches. Certainly recommend the 8MCG twice daily with food.

And by work I mean firehose discharge, lift-your-feet-off-the-floor bowel movements. Sometimes nothing, sometimes everything, it's kinda fun trying to predict what's going to happen.

The only side effect I've experienced has been shortness of breath, which has been very mild and doesn't last long.  In general, I feel that this drug has worked very well.  I am currently only taking one 24 mcg capsule a day. The only thing that I've noticed about the effectivness of the drug is that sometimes I get hit with mild diarrhea rather quickly, and sometimes it seems like it hasn't done anything.  Time will tell if I will get adjusted to it.

I asked my doctor to put me on the stronger dose of 24mcg twice s day with today being my first day. Today I have had lots of bloating but no results yet. I just took the second dose hopeing the bloating goes away and maybe I can get something to happen. So far the only thing I have found that works for me is 4 Dulcolax one day than 4 more Dulcolax the next day. I have had chronic constipation since before I was ever in school and I am now 53 with the problem getting worse all the time. I have tried every laxative on the market with nothing working.

The first day within about 4 hours I had severe stomach cramps and watery diarrhea followed by what I thought was a bad case of the flu.  I had chills, fever, lethargy. I was feeling better by the evening.  Thinking that it was just a mild case of the flu, the next morning I took another Amitiza and the same thing happened again within about 4 hours. I then looked up the drug on the internet and found that many others had the same symptoms as I did as a result of taking Amitiza.  I will never take this drug again.  The FDA needs to looks into this drug and get it off the market.

This medication can have serious side effects and should not be taken by everyone.
Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	2	2	2	Female	19-24	9/10/2008 8:52:06 AM	I started taking this medication three days ago.  My doctor said it would take a couple of weeks to work and get my body used to it, but so far it has been stressful.  For a couple hours after I take this medication, I experience nausea and chest tightness (it feels like you are breathing in freezing cold air).  I am tired most of the day and can sleep up to 6 hours during the day and have no problem falling asleep at 9:00 at night.  I still have not had a bowel movement, though I feel like I need to.  
Other		3	5	2			9/10/2008 3:11:06 AM	I have been using Amitiza for 2 years. I had abd surgery and have periodic obstructions from adhesions. It has helped me keep things moving in the bowel.However I aslo have Sjogrens and have been noticing my joint pain becoming severe and waking with stiff painful fingers. I quit taking it a week ago and my joints are feeling better. This is listed as a severe side affect.I'll stay off it for a month and see if my joint pains decrease. So far I seem better.
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	2	5	2	Female	35-44	9/6/2008 6:31:54 PM	I have been taking this drug for three days.  After about thirty minutes, I am nauseated, after about an hour I feel jittery.  Then, I have to go to sleep and literally crash for two hours.  It knocks me out.  I'm going to try to take it with Miralax, and will finish my bottle of Amitiza, but will probably not refill my prescription.  I can't deal with the bloating (which was my initial issue in the first place), the abdominal pain, and the nausea (even with meals).  I have two children and can't afford to just get &quot;knocked out&quot; in the middle of the day after taking this medicine.

I have taken every drug under the sun and nothing has worked for me. The first day taking Amiitiza, I experienced slight nausea and headache. I usually have a BM once every 2 wks, and this has made it once every week. It is an improvment, but there has got to be something better out there for me. Even laxatives such as Ex-lax have discontinued to work for me. My colon has grown immune to all of these drugs. Any suggestions from anyone? I'm willing to try just about anything at this point.

I had difficulty breathing and hives. The hives lasted for 8 months. I was repeatedly told by my doctor that the hives may have originally been caused by the Amitiza but there was &quot;no way&quot; they could last that long. Much to his suprise, a biopsy showed that the hives were due to either an auto-immune disease (which later blood tests ruled out) or a &quot;severe allergic reaction to an ingested medication&quot;.

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	7/31/2008 12:05:09 PM	I am on my 3rd day taking Amitiza and so far I am please with the results. Day 1, I was so nervious about taking it due to reading too many bad reviews online but I went ahead and took it anyway. I had mild nausia and a slight heache but other then that I was fine. I had 2 normal BMs that day (a miracle for me). Day 2, I took the pill and within an hour I had some bad nausia and headaches followed by stomach cramps. About 2 hours after taking the pill I had a BM with diarria. Afterwards I felt much better, I still had a mild headache for the rest of the day but all of the other side effects went away. Day 3, so far so good, it's been about 2 1/2 hours since I took the pill. I had a little bit of nausia earlier but it's gone now and I had 1 BM so far. I'm hopeing that the longer I take it the less the side effects will be. I would like to tell anyone hesitant to take this drug due to the side effects to go ahead and try it. The side effects so far are not enough to make me stop taking this drug.

For me, it does what it's supposed to do.  The only thing that worries me is the chest pain.  I've been on it for 2 days now (1 8mcg pill a day) and I always seem to get chest pain.  
Constipation Predominant Irritable Colon	Daren , 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	4	1	Male	45-54	7/25/2008 11:51:52 PM	Dr suggested Amitiza to treat severe constipation as a result of chemotherapy. I have been on Amitiza for about two weeks and it worked great when used with a stool softener. Two weeks to the day after taking the drug morning and night as prescribed I developed welts on the upper legs and arms. Dr looked at them and felt they were an alergic reaction to Amitiza and suggested I stop it. I have also developed hand and foot pain. That coupled with neuropathy from chemo is painful. Too bad because the drug worked for me with no other side affects.

After four days of a crampy stomach and absolutely no BMs, I stopped taking the drug--and wham, the next day I was hit by nearly every side effect on the list (except, of course, diarrhea).  I have taken, and still take, several drugs with heavy duty side effects, but this was insane.  I hate to think what would have happened if I had taken the Amitiza longer....And so I'm back to vomiting up Miralax.  Joy.

My doctor started me on amitiza along with miralax about a month ago. Taking the two meds together works very well for me. I have not experienced any type of side effects thus far. I have had somwhat normal BMs though. I would recommend that you eat before taking this medicine and try it with some sort of laxative to avoid possible side effects. But overall, I must say that this medicine has worked great for me and I would recommend its use.

I have used everything from Dulcolax to Miralax. I used Enulose until I went to see a Gastroenterologist a couple of months ago and was introduced to Amitiza. I have been taking Amitiza for 3 months now. I started out having naseau for the first 3 weeks. Which eventually went away. This is a very inconsistent medication. Some days I am bloated and some days I have Diarrhea and some days I have a hard time just having a bowel movement. I find myself straining all the time now which is really bad for a person. Since, I have overactive bladder it makes my bladder frequency worse. I thought that Amitiza was going to be the permanent answer for me but I am very dissapointed. Now, I need to find another medication for Chronic Constipation. I do not recommend this medication to anyone.

The constipation relief only brins loose stool and only lasts about 2 weeks.  This drug should not be on the market!!!!!!!!!!!
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	6/10/2008 11:05:46 AM	After having taken Amitiza for approximately 4 months, I landed in the hospital retaining 12 pounds of fluid, inability to urinate or have a bowel movement, extreme pain, and shortness of breath.  These are all side affects of Amitiza that my doctor did not tell me about.  I was instructed to stop taking Amitiza immediately and within 3 days most simptoms subsided.  I would recommend using a different drug or making your doctor tell you all of the side affects before you take Amitiza.  For me, it was definately not worth it.

I have gained some weight and think it is mostly water retention and swelling.  Wondered if it was related to this Rx.  I never had nausea, dizziness, etc.  I would love to see Zelnorm back on the market.  The price of Amitiza is outragous!

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	4/3/2008 4:02:13 PM	2-3 weeks after starting this drug, I experienced sore throat, body aches, flu like symptoms and swelling legs and feet. I just thought I had the flu. Three months later, I am still sick. I've been on 3 diff. antibiotics and doc put me on lasix for the swelling. I just read about the side effects of Amitiza---sore throat,swelling, &amp; sinus problems. THIS DRUG is why I have been so sick. The side effects are slowly going away,and the drug actually worked (for constipation) great for me for about 2 months, now I'm having trouble again. New doctor wants me to try the same dosage with Miralax to see if that combination might work.  He also spoke of increasing the dosage, at some point.  We'll see. Been wondering why I've been so sick, this is unreal, my doctor NEVER told me it could be side effects from the drug. So, I have to take drugs to take this drug! But so far the benefits for me have outweighed the side effects, especially since they are finally going away. The jury is still out on this, as I have a sore throat while I'm writing this!

And boy, after reading the reviews, I'm petrified!  I was on Miralax, and my doc just switched me over.  A lot of complaints from you all are bloating, abdominal pain and gas, which I have already have and am hoping goes away with the relief of having bowel movements.  I did notice that I had nausea this morning, and I didn't eat anything with it.  A lot of you recommend to eat with this med and to take it at night.  I'm gonna try that.

The bloating and constipation have gotten so painful I had to try something. I have tried every stool softener, laxative and fiber pill/powder available; without results. I thought Amitiza would help...I waited for a day off and started my first dose, I felt very sick to my stomach and dizzy. It did generate the beginning of a movement that was watery and didn't offer any relief from the fullness/bloating/pain. After running to the restroom numerous times and only delivering a small amount of matter I still had cramping/pain and gurgling that kept me up all night. I stopped after the first dose due to ill effects and having to work. Wish there was something to stop the bloat because the constipation is painful enough.

The first months works wonderful.I was so happy as if I won the lotto.I have BM @ lest 2x a day. I did not experience any side effect and I was very very happy with it.For some reason after the first month I start feeling uneasy taking the pill after I had breakfast.  The nausea was unbearable and I stop using it.  I was on laxative for the past 3 months and one friend talked me back into giving it another try.  This time around I took the pill right before I go to bed. Tonight will be my second night. I just hope there will be another pill that will work with little side effect.  I am only 37...how will i go on with my life if i need to be afraid of taking the pill?????

I drank plenty of water &amp; took Dr. Natura but still nothing. This has helped me thus far. My doc started with a few samples and it worked! No side effects. (Knock on wood) ;-)

Side effects are minimal; some swelling of fingers. Some dizziness experienced, but I have a history of positional vertigo, which may aggravate it a little. After about a week, it appeared somewhat less effective, and I added a few stool softeners. I then took a few days off and started again and voila! Regular again. Never experienced watery stools or cramping. Long term use I can't vouch for yet, but it has been great so far.

When I started back. I had no control over bowel movements. Very Watery. messed up sheets in the middle of the night and could not make it to the restroom on time.but it did work instead of taking 25 senokot every other day.

I had nausea at first and stopped taking it, but my doctor talked me into trying again and making sure I take it with meals.  It works great for me except that sometimes I have very loose stools and must be close to a restroom.  I have had a couple of &quot;accidents&quot; while away from home.  I was taking Fibersure, but it caused extreme bloating and gas -- uncontrollable!  Dr. switched me to Citrucel -- no gas or bloating.  I also take 2 laxatives twice a day.  (my colon is twice as long as it should be and I have had severe constipation all of my life). I have gained 15 lbs since starting on all of these meds and a high fiber diet.  I don't like the weight gain, but I do have more regular BMs (at least 6 - 8 times a week compared to once every two weeks if I was lucky).  I have never taken Zelnorm.

After 5 days went to 2x daily, again nausea for a couple of days. Nausea subsided, and though there was not a big change in BM's after the first 8 days, I felt better overall - less bloating and abdominal pain. But I noticed intermittent chest pains and difficulty taking deep breaths. Temporarily discontinued treatment and am waiting for follow-up consultation with my doc to determine if I should continue treatment.

The side effects outweigh the effectiveness for me. Please write the FDA to make Zelnorm an option for those of us who have so much trouble with this drug..

I was, and still am, taking Librax but it wasn't helping me be &quot;regular&quot; so my doctor is having me try Amitiza.  So far its helped me become more &quot;regular,&quot; I only take it once a day after dinner.  The only side effects I seem to have is head aches and I found once I have taken the pill I can't eat anything more and hour or so afterwards because I start to feel as if I might vomit.  Other than that I'm pretty happy and I no longer feel as if I can't go or once I do go can't stop.

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	55-64	2/5/2008 7:32:12 PM	The side effects were too difficult to live with. Extreme nausea with each dose about an hour after taking with a meal. Finally went to once a day. Then had two episodes of passing out after taking them so I gave it up. I'm back on MiraLax. Too bad. I wish someone could develop an easy to take, safe medication for our problem! 
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	35-44	2/1/2008 12:38:14 AM	I have had chronic idiopathic constipation for a long time and had to depend on laxatives.  I was never getting a full nights sleep because the laxatives would start working before the alarm went off.  I have been on Amitiza for a few weeks now.  I experienced some nausea in the beginning but you have to take it with food.  My only big complaint is the bloating and the gas.  My bowels movements improved greatly in the beginning but now they not so regular.  All in all I have had decent results with Amitiza but the bloat and gas was the one thing that I wanted to go away as a result of not moving my bowels for several days.  I am still unsure if I am going to continue using the meds.

Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	45-54 Female 	4	2	3	Female	45-54	1/24/2008 10:45:08 PM	I have been taking this drug ever since Zelnorm was pulled off the market.  I think it has actually worked a little better than the Zelnorm in helping with the constipation but the side effects are pretty bad. The nausea, indigestion and achiness can be very hard put they pass after about an hour.  I also cut back to only taking it once a day because of this. I hate to stop taking it altogethar because nothing else has ever worked his well. I don't ever want to go back to where I was before these prescription drugs became available.

But the side effects far outweigh its benefits.  I've had terrible headaches everyday and the nausea is almost unbearable. I too miss the Zelnorm.  It worked and I never had any issues with it and I was on it for four years.

It has helped tremendously with my constipation. However, I do experience minor to severe headaches everyday and a drop in blood sugar if I take the medicine with a small breakfast. I recommend taking it with lunch and dinner. This will help prevent the drop in blood pressure, but still expect a headache.

I experienced nausea, bloating, headache, achiness in my legs, a general malaise.  It did finally work, but the side effects are almost not worth the results.  Don't know if I'll continue taking or not.

I was getting desperate. Does this medication work right away or should have I waited a little  longer before going back to laxatives.

Muscle cramps have increased dramatically.

I have previously used Zelnorm (with no results) and Bentyl (with horrible side effects). I found the side effect of nuasea is reduced if I take the medication with a large meal or large dairy portion. i am VERY pleased with the results so far.

I was one of the first few to take this drug. I had to go to Baylor in Dallas, Tx. to get it. I wish the FDA would put Zelnorm back on the market. That drug was a life saver. I've had to quit my job I have IBS so bad.  Some days I can't get out of bed I'm so sick with cramping, bloating, weak.
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	10/21/2007 6:00:31 PM	I am taking this medication after 6 months of acute constipation. I am going to have a breath test with Lactulose, to determine if I have an overgrowth of bacteria. I certainly hope that I do, so that this can be corrected. The only problem with the Amiteza is that it creates a liquid stool. AT first the gas and abd noise was huge, but that has simmered down. So, the plus is that I am actually having a bowel movement. The down side is that it is liquid and when I have to go, it is urgent.

I have dificulty having bowel movements easily. I have been taking this medication (24mcg, 2 times daily AM/PM) for about 2 weeks. It works good--too good! I now have very loose stools in the mornings. The BM will start about 90 minutes after taking the pill. There is supposed to be a lower dose version (8mcg) coming out soon. I hope this dosage will not produce the loose stools. I haven't hade any other side effects from this medication yet.

I recommend taking at night because when I took it in the morning I was nauseated all day at work.  It also causing a burning pain in my throat when I take it and my co-worker takes this medicine as well and has experienced the same pain.  Overall, Amitiza works, but be prepared for some intense side effects.
Chronic Difficulty having a Bowel Movement	Yvonne, 55-64 Female 	3	4	3	Female	55-64	9/19/2007 2:31:26 PM	I have been on this medication for one week. It has relieved my chronic constipation but replaced it with loose stools bordering on diarrhea.  My doctor prescribed taking the drug 2x daily.  However, this produced very, loose stools, painful gas and stomach discomfort.  I reduced the dosage to 1x daily and noticed some improvement.  Since reducing the dosage, I have less gas, my stools are more firm, and I have little to no stomach discomfort.
