I had a lumpectomy and mammosite radiation. I'm also on Arimidex.  I had Herceptin every three weeks for one year.  I am one of the few who have had Herceptin alone - no chemo.  I did have the drippy nose and still have thin, splitting and breaking finger nails.  Otherwise, no problems.  I was diagnosed in Nov 2010.So far, so good.

I an now getting once every 3 week infusion, my fatigue is getting better, my life is becoming mine again, thanks to Herceptin I belive.  Bone pain is nothing compared to the outcome without Herceptin....

HER2 Positive Breast Cancer	Arkansas, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	65-74	3/8/2012 5:13:41 PM	I took Herceptin with Chemo for four months.  I was sick 24 hours a day the whole four months and ended up in the hospital twice.  I think most of the sickness came from the Chemo instead of the Herceptin.  Since I only take the Herceptin now I feel a lot better.  The biggest problem now is runny nose, red swollen gums that bleed every time I brush my teeth.  Also, the inside of my eyelids arered and look like ulcers.   Both of these problems started the first week of Herceptin with out the Chemo.  I am wondering if I am the only one with these side effects because I have not read about any of these except the runny nose.

No chemo.  70 yrs. old and also MS.  I am counting on it working on the HER2 positive breast cancer.  Chills and fever for 4 hrs. after infusion.  Nothing more after taking 2 tylenol.  Had echocariogram before starting and will be monitored frequently.  Will do this for 1 year if all goes well.

So I currently have been put on hold. Now I had an echo test which showed a &quot;leaky Heart valve&quot; I want to know if this has happened to anyone else? Can Herceptin be a part of this??

HER2 Positive Breast Cancer	Leslie, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	55-64	11/14/2011 3:51:39 PM	I was diagnosed with HER2 Positive Breast Cancer 2 years ago. Previous to this I had AFIB 1-2x per year and used medication when necessary. After 1 year on Herceptin they had to stop it 4 weeks early because of my AFIB on a daily basis. I have not recovered. I am in AFIB 2-3x per week and am exhausted with little energy. I would love my life back. I had an ablation but that did not help. Did herceptin save my life? I cannot say. I am a shadow of the person I once was.

HER2 positive.  Began chemo &amp; Herceptin Infusions 3/1/10. had 8 chemo treatments every 3 weeks and Herceptin every 2nd and 3rd week for 6 months &amp; now have Herceptin every 3 weeks.Scanned after every 2 cycles and began to show shrinkage in the first scan.  I had cancer in my right breast, lymph nodes, liver and bone.  2.8 cm in breast and 3.1 in my liver.  No sign of either after the 6th chemo treatment but went ahead and did 2 more cycles to make sure. 9/8/10 = lumpectomy on right breast and on 3/1/11 began my 2nd year with  Herceptin and am told that I will need to continue with Herceptin indefinitely.  Combined with the chemo gave great results with the tumors in the breast &amp; liver, but not without severe side effects.  EXXXXXXtreme fatigue, severe muscle &amp; joint pain continues to this day, very brittle and thin fingernails.  Of course I lost my haireverywhere and the only place it did not return is in my nose.  The hair on top of myhead is thick, curly and gray with darker roots. No radiation so far.  Continuing with Herceptin infusions indefinitely every 3 weeks.

I do have some mild side effects: some foot swelling and mild body aches. I had an allergic rx with the first dose, but have been fine since. I have a very aggressive form of bc-IBC, and I believe that Herceptin has kept me going all this time, along with chemo intermittently.

It was easy to tolerate and I didn't notice any problems taking it at all.  I am thankful that it is available for triple positive women like myself.

I had a lumpectomy and 13 nodes removed, only 2 positive. They had to go back into my breast 3 more times over the next month until they got clean margins. My breast is now very deformed, but it's still there! I did 3 rounds of chemo and started heceptin. I had to stop herceptin after 3 months because of the muga results. After 4 months I went back on and am now only 2 infusions away from being done. 52 treatments is alot, but if it reduces my rate of reoccurance, the weight gain, fatigue and back and joint pain will have been worth it. 
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	11/8/2010 12:11:47 PM	I don't really know if the drug is workingthe chemo was ok for 6 mths now con't with Hercepin for another 6 mths. worse complaint is swelling, legs and feet and numbness in the toes.... how do you get rid of the swelling.... gained at least 20 lbs over the course of chemo....no hair anywhere !!! Will finally see my doctor in 2 weeks ( haven't seen her since she sent me for treatment)maybe i'll get some answers then... Everyother doctor i've seen keeps telling me the same stuff you can read on line.  I wish they would get they heads out of the books and give me some realy information not statistics.....
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	10/18/2010 12:26:41 PM	I have been on Herceptin for 5 weeks and truly it is so easily tolerated. It is givn weekly along with chemo every 2nd week and the results are amazing: after 2 treatments my tumor has shrunk by over 1/2. No side effects but I remain very active in mind and body...the whole key is a good attitude and a fighting spirit. I will remain on Herceptin for a total of 20 weeks then surgery (lumpectomy) radiation and Herceptin for a yr. This journey is soooo doable, not a bowl of cherries but the results and outcome make it worthwhile. I am grateful and happy to be over being scared.

I am very thankful for Herceptin.

This drug works very well. So if your doctor has you on this drug stay with it as long as you can. If your heart can take it the worst thing I can say is sometimes it is a drag to have to go for treatment every three week, and your nails become brittle.  Other than that it is a wnderful drug for those of us with HER2 breast cancer.  I hope this is helpful for you.

My Muga Scans showed no signs of problems with my heart. I had severe fatigue, breathing problems, rapid heartbeats and weight gain that became life altering. The doctors couldn't find a cause, it was Herceptin. I had CHF due to Herceptin and nearly lost my life. The scans failed to show a problem until I was having CHF. Herceptin has helped many people but for a few this drug is deadly.

For the past 2 months I have experienced extreme redness, dryness, and tighting of my eye lids. The skin and tissue of my right check is swollen, puffy, red, and extremely dry.   My eyes water often.  My oncologist dismissed it as nothing or a reaction to my eye make-up.  I have worn the same hyperallegergic eye-make for many years.  I have gone four days without any make-up after a treatment, and it is worse.  It seems to get better as the week goes on, and then flares up angerly after my infusion.   Please, has anyone else experienced this.  It is very uncomfortable and disconcerting.

I receive it weekly because of my rx to drug.  For a while I have been having joint pain but it got a lot worse about 6 months into my treatment.  That being said I am cancer free right now so it is working.  Hence, I will continue it until the end (72 doses total -- 12 with taxol and 52 Herceptin only).  I thank each day I can tell all of you I am happy to be alive.

My last injection of Herceptin was Dec 2008. Heart pumping action was diminished some but returned to normal sometime after treatment. Side effects seemed to be minimal. I worked all through my treatments. So far I am doing fine with no signs of a cancer return. I think this drug worked, easy to tolerate and I'm glad my doctor included it in my treatment options.

Most important, my tumor has gotten significantly smaller with this medication. It is standard to receive Benedryl with Herceptin to avoid allergic reaction. However since I had to drive myself to Chemo, I forwent the Benedryl because it makes me too sleepy to drive. I said that to make note that I did not find any allergic reaction to Herceptin at all. I was told that it can cause left ventricle damage to the heart, but so far so good, the echo looks ok.
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer	Dianne, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	9/12/2009 2:27:54 PM	I had a dbl mastectomy, with IDC/DCIS in one breast only, 2cm tumor, ER/PR weakly positive, grade 3, no nodes, no vascular invasion. No sign of IDC/DCIS in area around tumor. I did 5.5 cycles of Taxotere/Carboplatin with Herceptin for one year. I am assuming that surgery alone would take care of this monster but I did the chemo/herceptin anyway because of the her2 positive - I am 3+.  I have 2 more herceptins to go. Basically I feel fatigued and have sleep problems. Heart is holding up at 70% -echocardiogram every 3 months. I would really like to know if 3-6-9 treatments vs one year or 2 years is beneficial? Herceptin has advantages but how is that measured?  It is too bad there is no way to tell if herceptin is 'working' in one's blood sample. If it can cause so many short and long term health problems I do believe there should be a way to tell which women it will have a benefit FOR. Maybe some of us need more, or less, of this drug. The only way we know is by not having a recurrence, and many women who are her2 pos, have never had herceptin also never have a recurrence. Seems a bit of a crap shoot. So - are you scientists working on a way to see if herceptin is having the effect it should on an individuals immune system?  How did one year become the standard?

The doc stopped my Herceptin treatments several times during a one-year period of time due to decreased heart function.  My ejection fraction rate went from 68% with no heart problems whatsoever to 35% a year after stopping Herceptin.  My heart has not regenerated as my onocologist told me it would.  I just had an echocardiogram and it shows I now have mitral regurgitation (which can only be fixed with open heart surgery), ischemic heart disease any several other major problems.  I went from being totally healthy and fit to being fatigued and in constant joint pain.  I am so angry about Herceptin and its side effects.  My oncologist said my heart would regenerate after stopping Herceptin.  After 1 year and 5 months of stopping Herceptin my echo shows heart disease and major heart problems I never had and never expected.  I am now faced with the prospect of open heart surgery.  I am only 58 and extremely upset that this has happened.  I wish I had never taken Herceptin.  Be very careful!  God be with all of you taking this drug.

After 2 months I took a PET scan and the cancer was gone. (it was in 3 places plus nodes) I give 100% credit to herceptin.  I had ZERO problems or side effects from it. It was all the chemo, once that stopped, so did the side effects. I continue to go for MUGA scans and everything is perfect. Herceptin saved my life.

I was given Herceptin along with chemo.  The first 6 months I did not experience any side affects.  The next six month I had moderate to severe stiffness in my joints.   I finally realized I was given a steroid the first 6 months thats why I didn't have stiffness. Taking an over the counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory really helped. It took about 3 months for my stiffness to go away.Its been a year and a half and I feel normal again.

I am experiencing muscle aches and shortness of breath.  The doctor seems to feel this is more the daily dosage of Arimidex, rather than the three-week infusion of Herceptin.  I also take the Zometa infusion every six weeks to help strengthen the bones.  I'm not sure of the cause and effect of either treatment, but the side effects are disturbing.  Hopefully, it will prove to be worth the discomfort.
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer	sunny, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	5	Female	55-64	4/16/2009 3:25:23 PM	I had 12 months of Herceptin treatment after 4 rounds of chemo. I just finished last treatment. Compared to the chemo the herceptin was a cake walk. I did feel a little tired and my taste buds were not good for the 1st wk after. I do have severe bone pain in my knees, which I see a pain DR for, other than that I feel good &amp; pray for a great out come. My Dr. had me have a MUGA scan every 3 months &amp; actually my heart went from 76% to 78% which is great considering the history of heart disease in my family.  Over all I have been pleased. I can live with the bone pain with meds. Bless you all.

FINALLY in sept 2007 my doctor sent me to a cardio doctor. i am now jobless and fighting heart disease and heart failure. don't let this happen to you. i did 36 weeks of herceptin. breast cancer was a breeze compared to this. make your doctor listen, i was not given much info on heceptin and my doctor told me it was safe and chances of heart problems were not likely to happen to me. i am a breast cancer survivor,and i am alive thanks to my determination.
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer	Marci, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	5	Female	45-54	10/20/2008 4:36:38 AM	I received herceptin during my chemo treatment and now herceptin only for 1 year ending 12/2008. I too had real bad muscle aches after the first couple of treatment and fatigue. But now I still have ongoing mucle aches it is not as bad as the first couple of Herceptin treatments. My heart scans have been good and not sure is the fatigue and muscle aches and chemo brain are from chemo, radiation and herceptin or all off the above from this last year of treatments. I want to know if anyone has continued Herceptin after the one year? I feel like it is working and really don't want to stop and risk a reaccurance. I feel like the herceptin is keeping the breast cancer away. My onco doc said the studies on Hercep do not indicate any longer term use gives better outcomes...Any one have any experience on longer use of Herceptin? Please respond. I can't find any information any where else regarding longer use of herceptin.

I had a lumpectomy and underwent 4 types of chemo including Hepceptin in a clinical trial from Sept thru Jan then eht Herceptin for a full year, then 5 weeks of radiation. Yes, there were side effects: hair loss, bone pain, anemia, fatigue, depression..but I am still here and cancer free SIX years later!!! I feel very BLESSED to have recieved Herceptin ( I had a 1 in 3 chance in the clinical trial) and thank God every day for the doctor that developed it!!!

I have a lot of pain (compounded by Fibromyalgia) and fatigue hits unexpectedly but considering the chemo I've been on and radiation treatment (33) - that's not unusual. My 1st mammogram/ultrasound since diagnosis was clear - so I'm very hopeful that this drug is working. The benefits far outweigh the side effects for me. (I'm also monitored with echo cardiograms every 90 days)

I feel confident that it is going to work for me and the side effects are worth it.  I have experieced fatique,weight gain and overall soreness in my legs.  These could also be from chemo that I finished in December. Can't wait to put all of this behind me!

I have joint/muscle pain and difficulty walking - especially in the morning. Fatigue comes and goes and can be severe at times. I continue to work fulltime and hope this drug is working to kill the Her2+ protein.
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer	concerned neice, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/6/2008 11:31:58 PM	my aunt received this drug once  week. each week she would report to the doctor that her cough was worsening, she would swell more, she was hoarse from day one, and never seemed to get any better. the doctor listened to her lungs and told her that there was nothing wrong with her and continued the treatments. after four months of treatment, my aunt is dead. all because a doctor is too stubborn to listen to his patient. to make a long story short, ONLY YOU KNOW YOUR BODY better than any one else. if you feel like there's something wrong, there usually is. keep letting your doctor know that you are not comfortable with herceptin infusion, if you have severe symptoms. don't let the negligence of a stubborn doctor take another life.

I will probably stop it on my own if my doctor won't agree with my symptoms. I showed my legs increased about 1/4 in size and i never gain weight that much in my entire life.

As i speak right now, I'm in severe muscle and joint pain. I've told the Dr. , however, he denies the reports I tell him. I'm stopping it myself. That is only one side effect, I have more.
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer		1	1	1			3/21/2008 1:39:23 PM	This drug nearly killed me after my third infusion.  By the time my doctor, who dismissed my distress over the phone, would see me in his office, my blood oxygen was 82% instead of 100%.  At 80 you die. My heart was 4X bigger than normal, one lung was filled with water and one was 80% filled with water.  I had ten additional pounds of water in my chest cavity.  I fired my oncologist after I left the hospital a week later.  He refused to admit it might be herception, but the 7 other oncs at the Regional Oncology Center disagreed with him.  Every doctor who has read my chart in the past 2 years (7) have told me it is a miracle I am alive.  They do not know how I made it.  I did have congestive heart failure and was on 3 heart meds for nearly a year.  I am 57-- very young looking and very healthy--  not overweight.  I jogged for 25 years and used speed walking and nautalis after that.  I was not overweight.  Meanwhile, I am still cancer free.  If you are going to take this drug, never let your doctor make you wait five days to be seen if you start coughing. Mine never mentioned an ER, even.  He said it was nervous hysteria making me cough from the phone.  NOT.

For the most part, I experienced no side effects.  I started training for the Susan G. Komen 3-Day 60 mile walk and began having serious stiffness after long walks (6 miles or more).  It was bad enough that I could barely stand up for a few hours afterwards without lifting up with arms from chair.  I also experienced edema in my feet and ankles on a trip I took to Colorado Springs.  Within a month of finishing the Herceptin treatments, about 90% of the stiffness went away.  I was also taking Arimidex and have been taking that now for about 1-1/2 years.  I still have some stiffness when getting up, but nothing like the Herceptin experience.  It was only when I exercised a lot that I experienced this.

Other than that, no problems. I will be on it for a total of a year once I'm done. So far it's been about 3 months. I hope it works!
