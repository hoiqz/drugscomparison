No &quot;dopey&quot; side-effects like other pain meds, and 1 tablet lasts 8 hours for me. The other pills were every 4 hours. It completely relieves my pain &amp; manages it, so I don't have to start over with the cycle of treating the pain and getting it under control.

Pain	kitcarson, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/18/2011 1:00:49 AM	I only take this when my pain gets severe, so since my back surgery on my lumbar 5 they did the fusion and it took on one side but not on the other side of my lumbar.  A sonic nerve afects my right hip to my left leg. I have a high pain tollorate so I get by with talwin a day.  It only covers up the pain just long enough for me to get a few things done here at my home.  I have no side effects as long as I take it after I have food in my stomache.   This is the only one I found that does relieve me of pain for up to 8hrs.   My dr. has it down for me to take one every 12hrs, but i stretch just one dose per day.  Some days I do try getting by without any, and my dr smiles when he can tell I dont let drugs over take me.   I have been on workmens comp disablity since Nov 21, 1980.  I dont ever regret for having the surgery.
