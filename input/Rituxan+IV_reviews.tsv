Prednisone was the only drug that gave me relief. I had 2 rounds of Rituxan 4 weeks ago &amp; am still waiting for relief from the terrible pain in my knees &amp; hips. I hope it kicks in soon!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/21/2012 7:17:02 PM	I have a pretty erosive form of RA with very high CRPs, RA factors, and sed rates when I was diagnosed 4 years ago.  I tried Enbrel and Orencia with no improvement.  I have been on Rituxan for nearly 3 years and now I sometimes forget I have RA.  I get the itching throat reaction during the 1st infusion but not during the second.  I feel a bit weak for the 1st few days but I have no side effects after. I don't take any steroids, pain meds, or any other drugs.   This drug has been a miracle for me!

I took it the r chop combo for six cycles. I am now taking it every twelve weeks for maintenance. The down fall is the fatigue, weight gain and joint aches. This drug helped me tons!! I am a 30 year old survivor.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma	Linda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/10/2012 12:05:20 PM	I was diagnosed with stage IV follicular lymphoma in January 2010 (2 years ago). I began with an initial treatment of floudarabin and rituxin simultaneously and I have continued to receive rituxin alone in 4 weekly treatments every six months. After one treatment a PET scan showed greatly reduced cancer cells throughout my body and after a year my bone marrow was nearly clear. I feel good physically and am as active as ever.During my first rituxin infusion I suffered from swollen throat, difficulty breathing, and some paralysis of my mouth.  The nurse slowed down the drip and gave me additional benadryl and we made it through, though the process took about ten hours.  Since then I have had no difficulties or side effects from rituxin  until just recently. During my most recent series I developed persistent sores on the sides of my mouth.  I will talk to my oncologist about them but I believe this is a standard side effect. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	linda, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/5/2012 10:58:17 PM	I was prepared right in order to avoid side effects from Rituxan with steroidal IV and Benadryl first hour. 2 hr into Rituxan infusion I developed severe side effects, life threatening. If the excellent team of doctors and nurses wouldn't work on me with knowledge and experience, I wouldn't write here. Right after 2 hr into infusion I developed terrible itch in ear and scalp; in 2 sec burning pain developed from scalp down to my feet followed by huge dark purple hives and huge blisters all over my body. Oxygen tank was administered when my throat started to close and I hardly remember anything after. I was for another 8 hr at the hospital on steroids (IV) and IV anti histamines. 3 weeks after, I still on Prednisone and Benadryl, still terrible pain/sensitivity of the scalp and ears, terrible itch of the scalp. Due to life threatening experience I cant even use Rituxan again. I cant even describe the burning pain all over the body, such a scary experience.  I don't wish this on anyone. Please be very aware of side effects and immediately let the nurse know if you feel any changes. Seconds matter to save your life, this is not a joke-drug.  Best of luck to you
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Eva, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	2/27/2012 2:58:10 AM	During first infusion, my throat started itching and I got a slight reaction.Doctor added more benadryl and slowed down the drip. Two weeks later I had the 2nd infusion and they did it very slowly.Into the IV they injected steroid, benadryl and gave me 2 Tylenol.I had to wait almost 2 months before the Rituxan kicked in.They gave me a Medrol Pack to help me get into remission.I am now not suffering with rheumatoid arthritis pain and it is a blessing, but I have come down with the Shingles on the left side of my torso and it is very painful and itchy.I am feeling very tired and fatigued. I took antiviral meds for one week. Not sure if the Rituxan lowered my immune system and that is why I got the Shingles. Hanging in there.I will see my Rheumy next week to discuss this.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	55-64	2/16/2012 2:00:22 PM	I have been receiving Rituxan by infusion for 6 months. This is my second round. I have been amazed at the wonderful results I have had with this medication. It was almost like being RA free! However, when it comes time to receive the infusion that's another story...I have a serum reaction and am extremely nauseated for at least one month. I take Ondestran (sp) for this, but it doesn't help that much. All in all I feel the days free of RA are so worth the hassle of nausea.

I lived a perfectly healthy life until 3 years ago when I woke up one morning and couldn't lift the sheets off of me in bed. Went through a divorce (guess he was too young to deal with it all) and have been on several different meds trying to find something that works. I'm starting Rituxan in two days, I'm really nervous about starting it, but I have been trying to remain positive. This site REALLY helps me with reading everyone's comments, although I can't really find anyone in my age range to talk to about it. I will try to post an update after Wednesday, with hopefully some good feedback. Orencia, methylpredisolone, prednisone and sulfasalisine has all not helped me at all. All I want to do is get on the ground to play with my daughter, teach her how to play softball, just have fun with her... I wish you all the best.

The second night was the worst since I felt like my lungs were closing up. This is the second time I've had the treatments. First time I was pain free for almost 3 years. I hope to have the same success this time.

Used it every 6 mos. (1/week for 4wks) for 3 years.  PET Scans, etc. have been great.  Am back on &quot;watchful waiting&quot; because they are &quot;afraid&quot; to let me take it any longer.  No side effects. Used a port in my left arm. Drove myself to &amp; from treatments. Wish someone would write a paper about my wonderful success!!

I have been having Rituxin infusions every 6 mos for the past 3 yrs.Before Ritluxin I was on many different meds, but they were not effective. I had been falling frequently when my neurologist wanted me to try rituxin. Since using that I have only fallen twice, which is a MAJOR improvement.
Rheumatoid Arthritis	T-girl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	5/29/2011 11:44:49 PM	Although the first infusion takes several hours, it is otherwise no more difficult than any other and I had no immediate infusion reactions. However, several weeks down the road I showed up with kidney damage. It's not yet clear whether or not my kidneys will heal. Meanwhile, after 2 infusions and 4-1/2 months, there is no evidence that the Rituxan has had any effect on my severe, advanced RA and I'm on the highest ongoing dose of prednisone of the past 23 years in order to get by. I've also been on antibiotics much of the time from respiratory infections, and will not be able to try another disease modifying agent until I've recovered from the Rituxan. I had high hopes for Rituxan, which have been dashed. (The most effective medication for me so far has been Humira, but I don't have adequate insurance coverage for it.)

Had Rituxan on 3/3/11 &amp; 3/17/11. had appt w/ my rheumy yesterday &amp; she was shocked. all my labs indicate that Rituxan did absolutely nothing for me. had horrible flare ups the last 2 weeks - sed rate &amp; other RA markers up so high...even higher than when I was first diagnosed in 2003. So, we are moving on to Actemera. Again, Rituxan did absolutely nothing for me. Hope the rest of you have luck!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Moe, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	4/25/2011 9:18:01 PM	I'm back w/ a follow up post after 1st posting here on 3/20/11. It's been 5 weeks since my last post (a little over 7 weeks since my 1st infusion; over 5 weeks since my 2nd infusion). I thought the Rituxan was working but I feel back at square one (when I first got diagnosed &amp; had the most painful flare ups) in the last 3 weeks. My doc keeps saying to give it 3 months, but I don't know how long I can last. I'm back on pred 20 mg/daily, then she wants me to again taper down to 7.5. Just want my old life back! A.M.s are the worst, so hard to get out of bed, and the last few days, I have really had no relief throughout the day. Yesterday, my ankles and knees hurt so bad, I could hardly walk. My rotator cuffs have been killing me &amp; it's all I can do to get some sleep. Pain everywhere. I'll be a sport &amp; give it 3 months; however, I'm already thinking of changing MD's (my current one just took over my former MD's practice; I'd been w/ my former doc 8 yrs &amp; loved him to death. This new one graduated from med school in 2005. Only difference is, she also has RA.) I am praying, praying, praying all the time for some relief. I'll write back in a few weeks. Wish me luck!

A brief trial of Humira provided no relief. My pain and disability were only relieved by steroids.  Soon after my first infusion of Rituxan, I was able to begin to taper the steroid dose (it has taken many months to wean completely off).  I have always been  very active.  I am an endurance cyclist and run agility with my dog.  Rituxan has enabled me to basically function, as if I was disease free.  Six months after my first round, I was given a second series of two infusions, although I was RA symptom free.  Very few side effects...basically a couple of sleepless nights after the medrol dose given with the Rituxan.  My labs are normal except for a slightly lowered WBC (3.9).  I feel well and am now steroid free. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Moe, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	45-54	3/20/2011 4:10:19 PM	I've been on lots of different meds (Vioxx, methotrexate, Remicade, Enbrel). Vioxx pulled from market, MTX caused liver inflammation &amp; biologics stopped working after 6 mos-one year.  The jury is still out for me on Rituxan, as I just completed my 2nd infusion 3 days ago. First infusion didn't seem to do jack at first, but swelling/pain seemed to start subsiding. Now after 2nd infusion (so course of treatment #1 is now complete), I am feeling better. I can actually get out of bed in morning, and after 2 hours feel &quot;warmed up.&quot; However, I'm still on prednisone (15mg) daily plus Celebrex 2x/day, so I don't know if it's actually the Rituxan or other meds that are helping. Looking forward to 6 weeks out when I think I'll really be able to feel if Rituxan helped. Infusions were super easy, had great RNs, comfortable hospital setting, every precaution taken to make sure I didn't have an allergic/adversary reaction to Rituxan. Again, it's wait &amp; see. I'll check in in 3 more weeks, then at 6. Good luck to y'all!

Except for a couple months break I've been on chemo ever since. When tumors break out I go on full treatment with several drugs. In between I'm on &quot;maintenance&quot; of only Rituxan and Benedryl. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for this drug. I am so grateful!
Rheumatoid Arthritis	Sheila M, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	55-64	1/22/2011 12:20:48 AM	I've had 2 treatments for my 1st month &amp; plans are to not have another for 6 mo. Very encouraged with progress - no flare-ups as before requiring injections &amp; trips to the ER for morphine, toradol, prednizone &amp; IV fluids (all intraveinously). Feel terrible for a couple of days with severe fatigue, nausea since 1st infusion (lost 10 lbs in 2 wks)and headaches. I've tried EVERY drug for RA but have always gotten infections and had to stop them. Hopefully, I can stay on Rituxin and it will work. I've had RA for over 30 yrs; I am now 57. I also have osteoarthritis, bursitis, tennis elbow and many other medical conditions. I am also bipolar &amp; have suffered from severe depression, including a suicide attempt. I rarely have depression now, partly due to feeling better; however, my mania has increased.

Led to Dx of WM same month. Started 860mg Rituxan every 3 months, along with decatron steroids and alkeran chemo. Steroids once per week, 12 pills per dose. Chemo 5 pills per day for 5 days, then nothing for rest of month. Originally IgM was at 7,900. After one year, Igm was down to 2,500. Discontinue steroids and chemo. Retain tri-monthly Rituxan. Now, 18 months later, Igm at 2,000. Have had only one side effect with Rituxan, and that was severe flushing of the skin into a deep red. Stopped treatment for 10 minutes, then resume slowly. That was two months ago. Once, early in the treatment, awoke in early morning freezing, with severe shakes. Took three blankets, and an hour to calm down. That, and the incidence of flushing during treatment have been the only side effects in 18 months of treatment. Oncologist trying for as low IgM as possible, but further treatment dependent on Neuropathy condition, which has not receded completely. Still have no feeling on bottom of feet, and serious pain if I walk too much. Also, as reported earlier by someone, tips of fingers have almost no feeling. Tend to drop things a lot. Dr says that nerve regeneration in hands and feet may well take another 2 years. As far as using the drug, I will have to continue a 3 month infusion for no telling how long, as the Waldenstroms is not curable, only treatable. As the French say, &quot;C'est la vie&quot; (that's life)

My BP dropped and I had stroke-like symptoms for days after treatment. I was supposed to get 4 treatments but they stopped after one due to the neurological side effects. I still have numbness and tingling on my left side. However, my ITP has stabilized with platelets over 300k.  I would be very cautious and only do this with docs with lots of experience.

I've tried several other drugs in the 4.5 years I've had MS. This is second best after Tysabri. It's great not to have to think about taking medicine but once a year. I have no symptoms, except I'm more fatigued with this medicine than Tysabri. I've also had a few bladder infections in the last 6 months that caused extreme fatigue. I never have bladder infections, so I don't know if the drug has had an impact on that or not.

My neuro said that people in wheelchairs would start walking after the first two infusion.  However, I felt I needed a wheelchair after my second infusion.  Although I was able to take the medication easily with little to no side effects, I felt my legs getting weaker instead of stronger.  Will be discontinuing - definitely not worth the risks for me!

But in late 2009 I became very anemic so this time (feb 2010) we did Rituxan with Treanda.  First treatment left me EXTREMELY anemic and had to get a blood transfusion.  Felt soooo much better after that.  I was pretty fatigued for about 2 weeks following each treatment (had 4 each 4 wks apart.)  I also broke out in a bad all over rash - bumpy red, small blisters and itchy!!  High does Prednisone was the only thing that helped.  The Doc thinks it was the Treanda I was reacting to, but Rituxan can also cause rashes - so who knows?It's now been 3 months since my last treatment and all my lumps are gone, and I'm almost back to full strength - though still tired a lot.  See the doc in a couple more weeks for a follow up and blood work - we'll see...

Rituxan has given me a new lease on life. I am able to do things I haven't done in years. 6 hours is a long time in a chair along with 2-3 days of fatigue, but it is worth every minute to feel good for 6 months.

By August, I was critically anemic and losing weight uncontrollably. The Dr. placed me on IV chemo, including Rituxan, Cytoxan, and Fludarabine at 4-5 week intervals. The treatment literally saved my life and has given me a future. It's tough for three days after the drugs are administered, I can't eat or drink much during that time and keep it down, but thereafter OK again. The medications helped me, my blood numbers are going in the right direction, body weight is easier to maintain, and energy levels greatly improved! One issue with the Rituxan: I had a strong allergic reaction to it (scalp itching, rash on abdomen, shortness of breath about 15 min into the IV). Even though I was given Benadryl beforehand, they had to give me a Hydrocortisone IV to stop the allergic reaction. Thereafter, Benadryl + Hydro became part of my chemo regime, and I could take the Rituxan OK.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	molly, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	2/3/2010 8:24:56 AM	I was diagnosed with RA about 8 yrs ago and have been in remission for about 5 years.  Had been on Enbrel until fall 2008 (flu shot?) when flare prompted dr to put me on Humira.  Started having severe monthly flares after receiving seasonal flu shot Oct 2009 (now banned from flu shots!).  Had 1st Rituxan infusion mid-Jan 2010 and 2nd 2 wks later as directed.  1st dose stopped RA from traveling within my body several times per day, and helped lower body immensely just after 1 day.  Upper body joints remained inflamed and painful.  1 day after 2nd dose left my joints virtually pain-free; range of motion still limited though.  Side effects remain of nausea, sweats, chills, but I'll take them over the joint pain anyday as they are temporary.  Both times I was prepped with tylenol, benedryl, and an steroid so I no adverse reaction during the infusions.  Definitely a good thing so far!

Other	ITP Leanne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	25-34	1/26/2010 12:39:25 AM	I had acute ITP and was given this drug four times. I had a very uncomfortable reaction during my first session, throat closing, sweating, etc. But the nurses slowed the drip, gave me steroids and slowly started up again. I did not have any other reactions. It has been over a year since my last treatment. My platelet count was 5,000 when I started and has been well over 200,000 for more than a year. This drug appears to have cured my ITP, and for that I am thankful. However I now have a serious case of GERD (chronic reflux). One of my doctors suggests that the drug may have caused this because it is a very powerful drug and can be very hard on the rest of your body. But the bottom line is: I WOULD recommend this drug for treatment of ITP. It was unpleasant and it may have caused another problem, but it worked to raise my platelet count.
Progressive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	Ms. Theo. Mammy, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female	65-74	1/1/2010 9:31:07 PM	Was diagnosed in  June 2008 with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) First round administered July, 2008 had an initial allergic reaction consisting of itching, hives,  was given an antihistamine and continued treatment without incidence. 2nd round Sept. 2008, pre-treated with antihistamines, no allergic reaction and no remission.  Side effects included loss of equilibrium, memory impairment, progressive paralysis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.  Patient died in July 2009.  While this is not common, the fact that it is an untreatable and 100% lethal condition, it must be noted in order to assure a truly informed consent, as it is a possible complication to the administration of this medicant.

Have had some fatique, nausea. Drinking a lot of water thru out the treatment has helped-couple of gallons per day. Beverages with electrolytes help as well. Also am given demerol while receiving Rituxan. Really helps with any reaction during infusion. Have had lymph nodes become enlarged during the treatment period. Dr. said it's just waxing &amp; waning-scary. Have 2 treatments to go and no port. Hope this works, Dr. is very optimistic. 2nd round of Lymphoma-had radiation first time.

I still have to do the maintenance rituxin - 4 weeks every 6 months for two years. Here is my question: Is anyone getting a vibration or strong tingling feeling for no reason? Now if I bend my head down, my legs really vibrate a lot and act like they are going to stop working-kinda like a mis-fire in the electronics!?!?! Hard to explain. I don't like to complain or even comment to the doctor, because I always get the &quot;Huh, never heard of that before&quot;.

Rheumatoid Arthritis	kemmy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	45-54	4/22/2009 11:53:45 AM	It sounds like I am in the majority when I had high hopes for this treatment to stop my RA disease progression and symptoms. After my second round of two treatments (the first only helped for 10 weeks), my rheumatologist is satisfied that the Rituxan has stopped the diseases progression, that is, the synovial inflammation that causes damage to the joints. Although I do feel better than on any other treatment (I have also tried many-8 or 9), I still have tenderness and moderate pain in all of my joints (bilaterally head to toe, basically), varying degrees of fatique (not extreme as before) and 1-2 hours of stiffness in the mornings. I do not have noticeable swelling in any of my joints on this treatment, which is great. I am also still on Methotrexate and now Plaquenil and occasion, dose packs of steroids. Is this the best we can expect? What percentage of RA patients can be treated and be symptom free except for a few bad days here and there?? Thoughts???

I was hoping this wonder drug would be the one that works for me. Unfortunately, I've had some tough side effects that aren't necessarily listed on the drug website. Extreme fatigue, swelling of the feet, coldness in my lower legs &amp; feet, tremors, even joint pain have been my experience. It's been a month since my first infusion and I'm praying for the day it will be completely out of my system. The cost for my first infusion was over $13,000 - I would have felt better if they gave me the money rather than the medicine! :)

The hard part about it, I have had problem breathing when I walk, or my heart would just beat really fast without me doing anything. I have a types of seizure that my Dr can not even stop. I have more problems now then what I start out with when I went in to get treated for the ITP. And I can't get nothing done about it. I have a seizure problem, and they did not know the side effect between what I was on and the Rituxan.

I had an allergic reaction during my treatment and it took 6 hours to complete. I have to take Benadryl and Steroids along with the Rituxin. I slept most of my treatment from the Benadryl and then couldn't sleep that night from the Steroids! Other than being a little achy and having the chills, I feel fine. Hallelujah!!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	25-34	5/2/2008 2:25:10 PM	My hematologist perscribed this medication for my chronic ITP (platelets below 5,000) and I had already had my spleen removed for the initial occurance 9 years ago.  The initial treatment was very unpleasant, it gave me hot and cold flashes, chronic cough and my throat went numb.  In the three following treatments they increased the benadryl and decadron they gave me prior to initiating treatment which caused no side effects during the treatment but for 12-48 hours I have facial flushing, swelling of my hands and feet, headaches and trouble sleeping.  I also have horrible heatburn and feel fatigued all the time.  On the bright side my platelets are up and better than they have been in 6 weeks.  The excellent medical care I have received helps also.  All in all I would recommend it but only as a last resort.

That helps with any possible side affects. (fever and allergic reaction). When I get the infusion it takes 5 hours, they give it very slowly to determine how it will affect you.  My blood pressure usually goes down, which is not serious, but it happens.  I am fortunate that I do not experience any other side affects from the drug.

Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia	R. Holcomb,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		9/18/2007 3:49:49 PM	Year 2000 macroglobulinemia diagnosis. Year 2003 surgery for ovarian cysts(benign) resulted in a 6-month bout with MRSA and vancomycin   blood transfusions. 9months after clearing up MRSA and being released to my oncologist,  I had 5300 IGM and 7.2 hemoglobing, and was down to 92 lb. from l35.  Enter 4 weekly Rituxan treatments; within 2 weeks of last infusion, I woke feeling better...not long later IGM of 550, hemoglobin of around 12.  This was early 2004.  Today hemoglobin is under 9,IGM 2500,blood viscosity 2.0  I'm tired and experiencing some new complaints.  Tomorrow I, if things go well, start a re=take of 4 Rituxan treatments.  Wish I could tell how they'll turn out...or maybe I don't.   Rita Holcomb
