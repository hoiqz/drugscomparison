Other	Danielle05, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/12/2012 4:23:47 PM	This drug has helped with nausea when I had a migraine so bad I was vomiting and had the nausea. So when I think Im going to get a headache or have pain then I take this and it stops it immediately! I can still take this medication at work, I do feel a little drouzy but its nothing I can't deal with. It just makes me calm. Overall a good effective drug.
Vasomotor Rhinitis	jshermo, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	5/11/2012 3:03:05 PM	I was Diagnosed with vasomotor rhinitis a few years ago. Since then I have tried many different meds, the only effective ones have all slowly been discontinued (D-allergy, AllerX, etc). Ive been on this for about three months now. At first, I thought this was a miracle drug but now not-so-much. I really does controls my congestion and post-nasal drip and the nausea I experienced because of the post-nasal drip. After 3 months of use, I am experiencing swelling just about every where, even my face. I have a stuffy nose and experiencing some weight gain, even though I have increased my activity level. I also have some muscle stiffness and blurred vision. So now I'm on the search for yet another drug. I cannot function without something to manage my rhinitis.

I was diagnosed with IBS and started having severe nausea. I was prescribed zofran 10mg at first but it did nothing. I was then put on promethazine 25mg and it has helped a great deal. The only issue is that it makes you very drowsy. Sometimes I get so drowsy I can barely stand. I also use it when I have an upset stomach. Unfortunately it does nothing for the upset stomach part but it does prevent nausea and vomiting.

The morpine causes me to feel vry nausea and sometimes full vomiting.  Since I have taken this about 4 X a day, my nausea has slowed a great deal.  I feel so tired most of the time and have not been able to do other chores and things.

The medicine triggered migrane headaches which I could not get under control, until I blacked out from the pain, and was in the hospital. I did not know where I was or even what day it was. I had blacked out for three days. Felt like I was in a dream. I now only take this when I run out of my Zofran which helps aleviate my stomach problems better.

It does make me very tired, so I can only take it at home (I take OTC motion sickness pills per Dr when I have to be out).  I have nausea with stress and when I get ulcers and very little helps.  This medication always helps...I can rely on it to offer relief.  And usually I don't mind feeling tired because when I am sick like that I just want to be in bed anyway.

Only lasts 2-3 hours out of 6 hr dosage rates but that is plenty of time to allow some sleep. This medicine has codeine, too. Take with Cefprofil antibiotic. This may be counteracting the reactions some have experienced on the antibiotic. So far treatment with this medication is adequate other than a slight change in vision for short period of time.

I probably use it 6 times a year or so.  it hasnt failed me unless i took it too late, The sleepiness side effect is major though, and once the nausea clears up it makes me very hungry, but i usually stick to pretzels or something lite just in case.  I am a real baby when it comes to nausea and vomiting, so i am grateful for this drug.  If you take it before or at work you probably wont be able to function long and you shouldnt drive on this medication.  It can make you sleep for anywhere from 5-20 hours but if you ask me, thats good for your body when you been feeling that sick.  If you dont want to fall asleep drink some cocacola which is also a stomach calmer, good luck and i wish the best of health to everyone

This helps wonderfully, and even has the additional benefit of relaxing me just enough to allow my other meds to work better.

Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	8/11/2010 2:02:01 AM	I have recently been diagnosed with sever Inflammatory Bowel Disease. I'm nauseous on a daily basis, whether I take Promethazine (generic for Phenergan) or not. But if I combine the Promethazine with Librax for IBD, it usually helps. But it seems taking just one or the other isn't enough, I usually need both. The only problem with Promethazine or Librax, is they both cause a lot of drowsiness. Sometimes even taking both of those together it doesn't help. So I take lots of ginger tablets, and drink lots of Ginger Ale and Ginger Tea. I suggest for anyone with IBS or IBD to take Promethazine, and possibly even Librax. Just make sure you have someone else to drive, otherwise stay home!

Ive always had insomnia so i continued using Promethazine every night until i lost my insurance, and wasn't able to afford going too the doctor for the prescription. I wish the FDA would allow Promethazine become an OTC medication,not everyone is able to see a doctor when they have severe nausea or vomiting! It definitely helps with nausea due to pregnancy,and helps as a great sleep-aid for people like me with insomnia!

If taken at the first sign of a migraine with the nausea aura it will put me to sleep, thus escaping the pain that most surely ensues. It is EXTREMELY strong, I'm 36 years old, 5'8&quot; 200# and it knocks me out within 35-50 minutes. It is combined with an anti-histamine so dry mouth is a very common side affect for me.

I wouldn't be able to take the proper medications if it weren't for this medication! I have read other reviews about throwing it back up but if thats the case then you should be getting the rectal medecine cause it works faster and you can't throw it up! It's definately not the medecine's fault that you are throwing up this will only help you!

Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	9/12/2009 12:42:42 PM	I was first prescribed this for nausea and vomitting, and it worked wonders. Bit of sleepiness the first couple times I took it but after a couple days I felt surprisingly less sedated than I had been led to believe going on the pharmacists word and the reviews I have read. The sleepiness was really not all that bad, GREAT for helping me fall asleep, not too hard to stay awake and alert once you know your personal tolerance to it, the right dosage and ANYONE can go take a nap from this medicine, however the 25mg dosage I take does not overwhelm me with tiredness. I have continued to take it for allergies, help with calming and sleep, as well as for odd here and there nausea I still get. Has also worked surprisingly well by itself in treating mild pain (and obviously taken with an opiate pain killer it will potentiate the effects however it was a somewhat effective mild pain medicine on its own) So my overall personal view on this medication is that it is great, however everyone will experience it differently. I can say though that the pros for me at least have outweighed by a long shot any mild side effects I experienced and have been safely and effectively taking it for a few different problems without any real side effects noticable by myself or my doctor. Would greatly reccomend for nausea. Would also reccomend for allergies. I broke out in severe hives and once again this medicine stepped in to prove extremely effective. Truly in my opinion a versitile drug with many indications.

I'm used to it now, so I'm not sleepy during the day any more.  It has also helped me get better rest at night (pregnant women normally don't sleep well).

Nausea and Vomiting	iamcbh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/7/2009 2:39:08 AM	A few weeks ago, I became extremely ill.  At first, I thought that it was indigestion.  After several hours of horrific abdominal pain, I assumed that I had food poisoning.  Prior to this, I could count on two hands the number of times I have vomited in my life.  For about 12 hours, I endured the worst pain, nausea and vomiting that I have ever experienced.  I couldn't even keep a sip of water or ginger ale down.  Finally, I went to the emergency room.  I was writhing in pain and severely dehydrated.  When I was admitted, I was given an IV with fluids for my dehydration, dilaudid for the pain and promethazine for the nausea/vomiting.  What a relief!  Less than five minutes after the promethazine was administered, my nausea completely subsided and the dilaudid was working well for the pain.  After tests and an ultrasound, I was diagnosed with gallstones.  I was given a prescription for 25mg promethazine, along with hydrocodone for my pain.  The pill form of promethazine has been just as effective for me as it was when I had it via IV.  Last week, I had my gallbladder removed and the surgery went well.  I have taken the promethazine in conjunction with my pain meds to prevent further nausea.  The only noticeable side effect is the drowsiness.  Honestly, I like that this makes me drowsy, as I battle insomnia and this helps me sleep.  Sleeping is important regardless, but especially since my body is recovering from surgery.  I would recommend promethazine to anyone that is experiencing nausea!  It was truly a life-saver for me when I was feeling the worst I have ever felt.  I know that I have had promethazine prior to this, as it is mixed with codeine in prescription cough syrup.  That combination has been effective in the past for anytime that I had a serious chest cold with a nasty cough.  Terrific medication in my opinion.

Nausea and Vomiting	Father Tony, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/24/2009 11:57:57 PM	I have a Terminal Illness and suffer from chronic Nausea, I was started on this medication but in it's brand name (Phenergan), about 12 to 15 years ago and have gotten my RX's filled with the brand name or this name over all those years and it has worked for me each and every time.This Med. can cause drowsiness when you first start taking it.  So be careful for the first a few days to a week or so, if your going to take it long term then your body should adjust it the Meds and the drowsiness will get less and less every time.Like I said before, 15 years or so later and it's still the only thing that works each and every time I use it.  I would never ask for or use anything else for Nausea.  The best part is I never knew it worked on Motion Sickness, another problem I now get as well, Woo Hoo I'm going to bet it'll work... So look for my UPDATE when I get to try it for that too.  Good Luck and You All Feel Better.  God Bless,Father Tony

It felt as if someone was draining me of all my energy--not a good feeling.  Right now I'm trying to stay awake on my job; it's about 8:30 p.m. and I took the pill last night at around 11:30 p.m.  The lasting effect this drug has is horrible--over 20 hrs. later and I'm still sleepy.

I'm a diabetic and take it for nausea due to extreme blood glucose fluctuations.  I also take it to relieve the nausea that comes with my migraines.  Promethazine has been administered to me via IV when I've been hospitalized for diabetic ketoacidosis which causes me to vomit violently and even have dry heaves.  It totally relieves any nausea have have, regardless of its cause.  Other anti-nausea medications have triggered itchy, twitchy reactions or have done nothing at all.  When administered through an IV, it makes me extremely tired, but when taken orally, it doesn't make me sleepy at all.

I was in the ER with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. The nurse gave me Promethazine for the vomiting and Demerol for the pain. 24 hours later I was back in the ER due to a reaction of the meds mixing together and all of the muscles in my body were contracted. I couldnt move, my toungue swelled up and filled my throat and my jaw tightened up so far that I had a hairline fracture when all was said and done. It was very scary, and if I wouldnt have known, I would have asked them to just let me be sick! Please be careful and ask about drug interactions.

It made her pretty sleepy (of course, that might have just been the exhaustion from being sick), and she actually hyperventilated for the first time while on it (just a minute or so of crying and she was hyperventilating). The hyperventilation made me nervous so I cut back as much as I could on the medication.

For nausea it's extremely effective. It did seem to make me drowsy in the beginning of the treatment.The only bothersome side effect is it seems to cause extreme dry mouth.

Nausea and Vomiting	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/23/2008 2:16:06 AM	Works wonderfully. Takes away the N/V and cramping associated with stomach problems. I usually just have to take a half dose. I do have a 2 year old so I'm a little paranoid about being drowsy. This seems to work for me.

This is a very good medicine.  I have also used it for vomiting and diarrhea.  
Nausea and Vomiting	ScotishKnight, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	2/19/2008 5:15:42 PM	I have taken Promethazine tablets, IM injections and the compounded gel for almost 15 yrs. I am constantly nauseated, suffer from anxiety, and motion sickness, however, this drug does the trick!. It eases my panic attacks, prevents nausea and vomiting from motion sickness, and WORKED GREAT when the family was down with that 5 day stomach bug.I was a bit nauseated throughout it, but never threw up! I like the ease of the gel for my kids when they are sick at their stomachs. It no longer makes me sleepy, but it does relax me a bit. The shots are a hassle because you develop little lumps at the injection site if you don't exercise and drink lots of fluids, and the only other drawback is, that if I take very many in a day on an empty stomach it can make your stomach feel on fire. Works great tho' all in all, but if you can take it with food, or even milk, the nausea will go away, and it will definately prevent vomiting!

Later on, I ended up using it again when I had to take a regimen of antibiotics that I didn't tolerate too well. All in all it works great, but each time I've taken it I've slept for at least 13 hours! It does take care of all the N/V symptoms, if you don't mind sleeping all day....

Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/21/2007 8:06:14 PM	I used this when first diagnosed with Barretts esophogus and severe ulcers. I woke up every morning nauseated and regularly vomiting. But this took those symptoms away completely within 20 minutes of taking it. Not only did it stop the nausea and vomiting it also helped me go right back to sleep. Works wonders.
Nausea and Vomiting		5	5	4			12/11/2007 6:22:16 PM	My doc gave me this when I had a stomach virus to help with nausea.  It helped me so much!! I still take it when I feel sick to my stomach.  It works like a charm but it does make you VERY sleepy!  I recommend taking it at the end of the day (if possible).

Once I took half a pill with a drink of water but it didn't go all the way down.  It took a while for the pill to go all the way down and even after it did, but throat burned.

I was prescribed Promethazine to take with it, and it made such a HUGE difference.  I could relax and know the pain would subside without the worry of feeling sick as the pain subsided.

I am a High school student, and when i took this drug, it made me very tired.  It works quickly and effectively but i do not recommend it for somebody who has alot of work to do or has a very important job, because you will most likely fall asleep or come very close to it.
