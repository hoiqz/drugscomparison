I have been on it since August 2009.  I used to have horrible mood swings and those are gone.  I am now stable.  I take 240 mg at night and have had no trouble at all.  May make me a little sleepy.

I got parkinson like symptoms and am not able to work at this time because of my balance and the tremors in my hands.  I may be in the lower percentile, but I  was only on  the drug for one month before the symptoms started and it  took another five months for a neurologist to diagnose my drug induced parkinson symptons. I want my life back. I am hoping these symptoms are not forever. I have become a two finger typer.  I probably will not be able to go back to0 my position as a Construction Inspector with my lack of balance. I am off the medication 9 weeks and am only slightly improved...so watch out...

Other	Anna, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	12/13/2008 11:59:54 PM	My son (23 years old today)has been on it for 4 days taking 60 mg. in AM and 60 mg. PM.  He just got off of Rispidole(it wasn't working for him and made him very hungry). and he started geodon and does nothing but sleep. The insurance company would not cover 3 pills a day (we were going to do 40 AM and 80 PM which would be 3 pills a day but we had no choice but to give him 60 and 60 which is only 2 pills a day.  After it wears off, he's very restless and his behaviors start to reappear.  After he receives it at PM he can't keep his eyes open and sleeps again through the night.  AM before medicated, he's restless again.I give it to him in AM and he sleeps for 3 hours. Please advise.I'm waiting for the doctor to call me back.He's also on Clonazapam (Clonopin) and Depokote. He's MR and ADHD with serious behavior problems.  He's been hospitalized recently due to behaviors.  I've had to take off work constantly and I'm down to 6 days.  after that I don't get paid anymore. I ready to 302 him if he has another episode and just leave him at the hospital until they find a medication that works. I heard Lithium works well with Depokote. But I also worry about all this medication and it's side effects.   Desperate please help me.  AC

Use of this drug I believe killed my mother.  She was given only one injection to &quot;calm&quot; her at an emergency room.
