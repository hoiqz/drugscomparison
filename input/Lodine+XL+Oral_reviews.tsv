This medication has made a huge difference in my life. My arthritis of the hands and lower back has received relief. My knees have also shown improvement. I recommend this medication to everyone in need of improving their quality of life while living with arthritis. It's worth a try!

Doc says it's worth the side effects - I'm not so sure.
