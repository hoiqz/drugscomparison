Absence of Menstrual Periods in Woman Who Has Had Them	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/6/2012 8:06:14 AM	I have not had a period in 6 months, so my doctor prescribed Provera 10mg for 10 days.  On day 5 my bleeding started.  I had some cramping but not too bad.  I am a little nervous as I was told the bleed would start approximately 7 to 10 days after I was done with the medication.  However, it has done what it was prescribed for!

I was told to expect severe PMS symptoms and that this could be the &quot;mother of all periods&quot; but it hasn't been that at all. I didn't have any PMS symptoms, or any side effects from the drug whatsoever. It worked wonderfully for me, that said, I also had many tests before starting it that indicated there wasn't any other reason for my period stopping other than stress/hormonal imbalance. I think that these tests should always be done before Provera is prescribed. Just my 2 cents, I hope everyone has as much luck as I did.

I am not complaining, but the doctor said it puts me at an increased risk for endometrial cancer. I had taken Provera before and knew it would work with some side effects. Hearing the big C I decided to give it one more try. By day 2 of taking The medication I could no longer stand myself! I was irrationally angry and would explode over the smallest things. I was significantly depressed and decided to stop the medication on day 6 of the 10 days. I am a teacher and I can not continue this way. I have been taking Provera off and on for years, but I do not plan to take it again!

Cycle spots for a day then is heavy the next day.

After stopping the birth control pill, it was a guessing game to when I was going to get my period. Since my husband and I are ttc I went to a new doctor to see what really what my next steps were. After an internal sonogram he prescribed me with Provera for PCOS. I took it for 7 days with no side effects. On the 5th after taking it I began my period and it lasted for 7 days. The only major side effects were cramping and heavy flow. I had bloodwork on my third day of bleeding to test some hormones and everything was normal. My blood sugar was a little high at 110 so now I'm on my first day of Metformin. Provera worked well and I'm happy to be on my next step to conceiving.

Called doctor on day 12 who had me come in for more blood work to see if I could take Clomid as planned.  After bloodwork, my period started more normally (still on day 12 after 10 days as prescribed).  Flow was normal but cramps were debilitating for that one day.  Could not work, eat, function, or sleep.  All fast and furios, and then cramps and bleeding abruptly went away as soon as they came.  While taking this medicine I did experience some light bloating, cramps, and breast tenderness. But the 24 hours of insanity cramps have definitely discouraged extended future use.  Maybe two more rounds, tops.  
Absence of Menstrual Periods in Woman Who Has Had Them	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	8/5/2011 4:09:41 PM	My doctor put me on this medication because my husband and I are ttc but I have not had a cycle in more then 8 months. The doctor gave me this to take for 5 days and then Clomid to take on the 5th day after I start my cycle. I took the Provera and then waited the 5 days and nothing then about 14 days later finally got the spotting my doctor promised!!! I did get severe headaches and menstral cramps with this medication but it was all worth it if I can finally conceive. I am praying hard that the combination of the provera and clomid will work. 
Absence of Menstrual Periods in Woman Who Has Had Them	TiffanyW13, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/3/2011 11:14:39 AM	I am 27, married, TTC, and have been off the pill for 10months.  I have very irregular periods averaging about every 45days or more, sometimes none at all. Which makes it hard TTC because u don't know when you're ovulating :/When i was on the pill sometimes i would get a period and sometimes not.  I was nervous about taking provera but was eager to fix my cycle to be able to chart ovulation.  I have had NO side effects what so ever while taking provera and got a period 3days after ending the last pill(10days).  After reading some of the reviews I want to make it clear that in order to get a period you must ovulate(release an egg in hopes of getting prego)if you don't conceive that egg is wasted &amp; turns into a period. Provera is a hormone the causes you to have a period. Provera helps regulate your cycle, not ovulate.I will be starting Clomid to assist me in ovulation : 50mg 1pill for 5 day Starting it on 5th day of my period (brought on by provera).  Clomid should not be taken for more then 6months as it increases your risks.Wish it could be done naturally, originally I felt broken wondering why me but sometimes u just need a little help. I've put off taking clomid for a couple months, and we're ready to have a baby yesterday,so lets hope by the end of this month we'll have good news.

Other	Evieoh, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	6/26/2011 3:41:06 AM	I had taken prover with famera about two years ago because my husband and I were ttc. And I took if for ten days and about a copule days after I had my af. The first time I had taken it I was always so hungry, and o thought that it was the famera that I had taken not the prover. However just recently I went for an annual check up and my dr prescribed provera alone and I only took it for five days because I haven't had an af for three months now. But this pill made me soooooo hungry I the entire five days I took it and acouple days after I was extremely hungry. I am not saying the pill does not work but the way it effected me was It caused me to be hungry I did try to control it but I felt like I had not eaten in days every time it was strange. and I gained like four pounds within that week that I had taken it.

Provera was prescribed to induce a &quot;flush&quot; of my uterus as opposed to constant &quot;breakthrough bleeding&quot;. Took Provera for 12 days and a definite flush ensued 3 days after stopping. I experienced breast tenderness, lots of hot HOT flashes, mood swings, nausea, dizzieness, and SEVERE cramping when AF came VERY heavily with lots of sizeable clots. I would have gone to the hospital but Doc's office said it was b/c of the provera and to try to fight through it. MotrinPM helped, because it knocked me out cold lol.

Absence of Menstrual Periods in Woman Who Has Had Them	MrsHAPPY, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/9/2011 1:33:34 PM	First off, I hope that everybody who is unsure whether or not they want to take Provera will read this. I say TRY IT! If you have the prescription, give it a try, it is not a experimental drug. It has worked and continued to work for a verity of women with a verity of problems.I was sort of hesitant at first to writing a review, but I felt like I had to, hopefully this helps some of you. You might be scared like I was at first after sitting here for hours reading every comment about Provera. I had not had a period for about 2 and a half years. Come to find out I have PCOS. I am married for almost 4 years and we have been TTC ever since we got married. We were never expecting that I could have PCOS. My gynecologist gave me a prescription for Provera so i will be able to tell the Reproductive Endocrinologist I'm schedule to see next Monday if I had the breakthrough bleeding. Again I remind you I did NOT have a period for 2 1/2 years, I was give 10mg for 12day, I know its usually 10 days but I guess its been soo long she gave me 12 days, by the 10Th day, I was spotting! I made my husband take me to the zoo (for a day of great quality time and so I could take a nice long walk because even after so long of no period I was still able to tell it was going to come) I got in a 1 1/2 hour walk because I know its good to get a  flow going. Here I am only 7 days after finishing Provera, with a normal constant flow, not too heavy. No horrible symptoms before or after taking it other than normal period symptoms. I think I actually hard more symptoms with a period while on BC. The only symptom that I could say I have is moodiness, really irritate. I blame that on the period not Provera. I was really expecting the 'worst period ever' like I had read but it was not bad I only had two days of a heavy flow. Though it did last a little longer than a normal period. I hope this helps anybody who was on the fence about taking Provera. Don't let others experiences influence you

I was on vacation and wanted the bleeding to stop as I could not go anywhere for an extended period of time.  Was told that I did not ovulate.  Took it for 10 days.  Had light bleeding for 10 days, then heavy bleeding on and off for additional 7-10.  Called the Dr. and was told that this was normal and that I was shedding the lining.  If she mentioned the longevity of all of this, I doubt that I would have taken this drug. No side effects except for cramps, swelling of breast mood swings.  Would not recommend for stopping the bleeding.

I did not quite get the part that I was supposed to only take it 10 days and then stop... Not sure if it was me or that my dr didn't explain that very well. I took it for almost a month, maybe that's why I haven't had a period!  Has any one else had breast tenderness after coming OFF this medicine? I know it is a side effect of being on it.. But since i have also been off my BCP, I guess I should go get a pregnancy test...

Up until about 2 mos. ago, I was having regular periods. Then I stopped having a period for 2 mos. My Ob-Gyn prescribed the generic form of Provera for 5 days, and said I should have a period within 3 to 7 days after finishing the medicine. On the 3rd day, I started my period. I didn't experience any headaches, weight gain, or extreme moodiness while taking the pill, BUT 24 hrs after taking my last dosage I felt like I had been run over by a mack truck! That is the only negative side affect I had. Not sure if the drug caused this or if the onset of my period caused the extreme tiredness and irritability. That is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars on my satisfaction experience.

I have been on birth control for 5 years and in Dec 2009 my husband and I started trying to have a baby. Once I went off birth control my cycle ended. My ob/gyn put me on Provera. I take it for 8 days. It gives me extreme moodiness, weight gain, constantly tired during the day and unable to sleep at night. My period starts 4 days after I stop taking it and only lasts for 3 days. It has been almost a year since I have started taking it and I still have not conceived. Hopefully when I go back to the doctor he will take me off of it and try something new.

On the 9th day after the last pill I did start my cycle. I do have heavy bleeding, but the doctor had said that would happen since the medication is to strip the lining of your uterus. I have experienced extreme fatigue and dizziness. It hasn't been unmanagable, and I am looking forward to hopefully conceiving soon. Overall the medication has done its job, I just hate feeling so tired and wonder how long it takes to completely be out of my system.

It's been almost a year year and I'm still at the same weight that I gained six months ago (22lbs)It just won't budge.

I had clamps put on and i stopped having a cycle all together. When i started taking it i got so sick to my stomach with it, i couldn't eat. i was told it should &quot;kick start&quot; things and if i dont' take it every month it doesn't help me at all. I developed a rash from it all over my chest and arms. When i did start it i had a cycle for 10 days then off a week and then started again for 5 days and stopped a day or two  and then started again for another 3 1/2 days. It was horrible. I now refuse to take it i would rather deal with not having a cycle than to deal with the major side effects and the on and off cycles.

The biggest thing I'd like to share is that it made me very moody. Sad and also easily irritated. I don't typically suffer from &quot;PMS&quot; but this was an extreme PMS, haha. I finished taking it 4 days ago, and it stopped my period right away, so it has worked to my knowledge :)

So I waited and finally 2days after the withdrawl I started, now when I am done I can try to concieve for a second child. Going thru the side effects was bad but what do you expect when you dont have a period for over 3months. Def. worth taking the meds, but everyone's body is different and I wish nothing but hope for whomever else has to take this med.

I stopped taking birth control at the end of March after being on the pill for 9 years. Prior to the pill I had regular periods..and I was regular while on the pill. After stopping birth control, I got a period 6 weeks later. Then I didn't get a period for 2+ months. I visited my OB-GYN for an annual visit...she prescribed Provera. I took it for 10 days. It did cause acne &amp; moodiness. Similar to PMS symptoms...so nothing that I couldn't handle though. I got my period 6 days after stopping Provera. Guess it works! Now I hope that my cycles continue to be regular after this point...so we can work on getting pregnant! Great medication.

This poducts does not work and i would not recommend it to anyone. The mood swings are very bad, I get very angry!!!

It works very well, as I have noticed after the last pill I always have my period within 2-3 days. The side effects are pretty intense, though. It makes you feel as if you have very bad PMS. Cramping, intense breast soreness, moodiness with weepiness, etc, are common. If you can handle two weeks of constant PMS then it's worth taking, because it really does work.
Other	fauowl, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	13-18	7/9/2010 12:46:11 PM	My doctor put me on this because my old birth control was causing me to bleed abnormally, my period was a week late and then lasted for like 2 months. Now that I'm on this, and I have been for 4 months, I have only gotten one period. I missed the first 2 and my doctor said it was normal, then I got my period for the first time on this new birth control, I got it on June 17th and I still have it, it's July 9th. So far, it hasn't solved any of my problems and I really don't like missing/getting super long periods. It's frustrating. And my doctor just says, it's normal.

I have not started taking it yet because of all of these comments. I do not wish to have to go through all the side effects. My Dr. gave it to me because I have not had a period for about 8 months. My boyfriend an I are trying to concieve, but I noticed that a lot of the people on here are taking clomid afterwards. Would any of you suggest to do that or just try this first? I'm so confused. I just really want to have a baby. We have been trying for 4 years and nothing.

Had a lite period in Feb.  I was 5 days late for my period this month, and now that I've started, I haven't stopped.  Went to the dr Monday (3/15), put on provera 10mg/10 days.  Started the pills on Wed, stopped bleeding for 5 hrs on Tuesday and now back to bleeding bad.  Just one month ago I had to have 2 units of blood due to low blood count, and the dr hasn't bothered to let me know what my blood count is now.  I don't like the continual bleeding.  I have a stent in my heart, high blood pressure, diabetes, neuropathy, depression and RLS.  don't know when this suppose to make me stop bleeding, but considering going to the ER.

Every since I started my cycle at 15 it has been irregular. It went from every few months and I would see a cycle to pretty much non-existent. I been on a mixture of birth control pills and provera for over three years. With both birth control pills and provera if i do not take them as instructed then i will not have a cycle at all. This year I have been really concerned with not having a cycle and starting a family. With the provera like clock work I take my pills for 10 days and 5 days later I have a cycle and it last for 5 days. Even when I had my irregular cycles they were NEVER this heavy. With the provera and birth control pills I have experienced the WORST cramps ever!!! CRAMPS are total trash and I could deal without them!! Even pay money! I have heard so many different thoughts about both birth control pills and provera how they affect women. Every womans body is different and reacts to medicine different. My best suggestion is to have a open and honest relationship with your ob/gyn. Let them know exactly what your objective is and how medicine affects you. If you don't like it or it doesn't provide you with the results you want you will be surprised what other options are available to help you acheive your goal. Medicine, out patient surgery, eastern medicine practices etc. Just keep trying, be positive and researching!

I tried to call my doc but he isn't in and the &quot;nurse&quot; was no help.  I guess from reading another review, to take it for a few more days and see what happens.  My husband and I are trying to concieve, but my cycles are irregular so doc put me on this generic provera to start my period up then try chlomiphine, so hopefully the provera works for bringing my period then hopfully the chlomiphine will work thereafter so I can become pregs!!

The first day I took the pill I was very nauseated, but by the time I took the second pill the next day I had no side effects at all. My doctor said I may have increased PMS symptoms, but I was one of the lucky ones and barely suffered any PMS symptoms. My period was much more heavy than normal, but suprisingly I did not have severe cramps like I expected.

However, it would at least come every 2-2 and a half months. I was totally freaked when it didn't show up for 4 months. I went to my GP who did a pelvic exam and said that everything was normal. So he put me on Provera to start my period. I took it for 10 days and 7 days after the last pill my period came. I was worried when it didn't come sooner, but was glad when it arrived. I didn't experience any noticeable side effects. However, during my period I had cramps that were more severe than normal. Overall, it did it's job!

I got pregnant in Dec 2008, had a miscarriage in March 2009, and 6 months later, in Aug 2009, still no period. My doctor gave me 10 pills, 10 mg. I took them at night bc it made me VERY sleepy/drowsy.  I was told that I'd start my period within the first 10 days of coming off Provera, typically between days 3-7.  My last pill was Thursday night, and I started spotting that Saturday afternoon. I spotted the rest of the weekend, with my &quot;period&quot; coming on Monday. I called my Dr to see what day I should count as Day 1 of my cycle, and she said to count that Saturday as Day 1. She said any bleeding/spotting on Provera (after the last pill) is considered a period, to count that first day as Day 1. I start taking Clomid on Day 5, to get me ovulating, hoping to get pregnant again.  The only real side effects I had was a slight inability to concentrate as much, hot flashes &amp; cramping (which was probably due to my period getting ready to come) and like I mentioned, it made me very sleepy when I took it, so I recommend taking it at night.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with Provera. It made me have a period, just like it supposed to. Now I move on to the next step, taking 50mg of Clomid for 5 days. Hope this gets me pregnant again! Good luck to you ladies and I hope your experience is as good as mine was.

I have not had a period in several years because I was on the Depo shot.  My last shot was the 1st week in Oct 08, have not had a period yet.  I had been on Depo and pills pretty much all my life due to cysts.  I took my 10 Provera last nite, Doc says I should start a period in 7-10 days after stopping the meds.  I am seeing alot of ladies thinking they should start bleeding right away, that is not suppose to be the case, per my doctor.  I have gone the past 9 days side effect free, until today.  Not only do I have no energy, but for some odd reason I am experiencing nausea, but I'm not sick to my stomach, and the hot flashes!  Now I know what my mom went thru during menapause.  Of coase my side effects aren't listed!!  Good luck to everyone!!

At first the medicine was working great. I did need to adjust taking the meds at night. It helped me to sleep through the night and my emotions were not near as amplified. Two weeks after the start, I had a complete regular (my regular) cycle. Heavy bleeding for 3 days, using super tampon with maxi pad, changing every 1-2 hours. After 4th day little more than spotting and lasted for another...well I am on day eleven and still spotting. I have also notice EXTREME mood swings, &quot;bitchy&quot; behavior, crying non-stop, and a general feeling of worthlessness. I love my job, and today I needed to force myself to work. I am typically real easy going, well adjusted, flexable very positive person. I hate this medicine, I never want to take it again. I want my life back!

Bleeding stopped after 2 days, but bad headaches,very high blood pressure, blurred vision, fatigue,increased heart rate. After 1 week I started spotting and cramping and still have elevated blood pressure which means more medicine.Happy the heavy bleeding stopped, but scared about the high blood pressure.Started cutting down on dose and spotting &amp; cramps started again.Is the dose to strong? What is the answer?

She said it will be heavy and there may be clots but not to worry. I was on the pill for two years, stopped in March. Got regular periods and then I went 70 days without one, so my doctor ran a serum, or blood, pregnancy test (I had taken 7 at home urine tests - all negative) and also had my thyroid's effectiveness checked. Everything was normal there and I wasn't pregnant so she put me on Provera. It was inexpensive compared to the pill and just as easy to take. Felt a little woozy the first two days and ate everything chocolate in sight but seem to be doing well now. Can't wait to see that period again soon! :)
Absence of Menstrual Periods in Woman Who Has Had Them	Aleigha, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	7/18/2009 10:53:34 PM	My ob/gyn prescribed this for me when I stopped getting regular periods. The pills themselves are not difficult to take - very small pills taken once a day for 10 days. I guess I would say that they are effective, they did bring on my period, however this is where my dissatisfaction comes in to play. When I was getting a normal period I had very light bleeding for no more than 3 days. With the Provera, I started bleeding the day after my first dose. Not period bleeding, but spotting. Enough so that I had to use a tampon. I'm now on day NINE of bleeding and now it is so heavy that I have to wear the maximum absorbancy tampon along with an maximum absorbancy maxi pad and changing them every 3-4 hours. From what I've gathered from my doctor's information and posts I've seen on here, most people only START their period after they've finished the 10 day cycle of pills and have a period for about 5 days. Two full weeks of bleeding is NOT pleasant. Here's hoping my body will get off its lazy hormonal butt and start menstruating again on its own. This is rediculous!

Because I was very regular before starting OCPs, I was so suprised and stressed when my period never came! After about five negative home pregnancy tests I finally approached my OB about the problem. She said it was totally normal and put me on Provera (10mg daily for 10 days). It wasn't even 24 hrs after my last dose that I started my period. While taking the medication I experienced nausea, mild depression, and extreme fatigue. However, I was so happy to see my period come that looking back it was totally worth it.

I was noted to have complex hyperplasia with atypia. Went through a D&amp;C &amp; hysteroscopy. I am being treated with this because I am only 32 and do not want to get a hysterectomy. I have been on this since 6/17/09 and the only side effects that I have had so far is sore breasts and I have been bleeding for 2 weeks now. Is this normal? I was told that I have to take this for 4 months non-stop and I will have to go back for a second biopsy in 3 months.  Has anyone else had to take this medication for this reason?

On June 2nd I got my first period after having gone 3 months with no period. It has been two weeks today from the first day of that period and now I'm experiencing light bleeding. I'm beginning to wonder if its from ovulation or implatation bleeding. I'm going to wait it out and see what happens.

Put on birth control to  get the periods under control- they didn't stop so after another full month of bleeding I was put on 10 mg Provera 3 times a day (30 mg total).  Within 2 weeks the period finally stopped, I am tired but I think that is due to enemia, I think the stuff is great, no side effects except for a really nasty headache yesterday and fever- I hate to say it but I will take the headache and fever over the period any day!

The decision to administer provera was made and it was successful in stopping the life threatening tendencies. The patient was then taken off provera after two three years and the self mutilation returned.  This man has been in a nursing home for four years but now needs to be treated mutilation again. The doctor who prescribed provera has seen excellent results in treating MR with tendencies to sexual and mutilation behavior.

Even after the 10 days of taking them, I still have mood-swings like crazy, and while on the pills I get hot flashes.  Im 26..I shouldnt be getting those yet.  Its a good drug to use if you have irregular cycles, but personally I can't deal with the mental changes its making me have.

I had my last period January 6th, and after missing two cycles my MD decided to give me a 10 day dose of 10mg Provera. I have been taking it for 5 days now and feel like I would if I were pre-period. I do feel a little more tired than usual. I wish everyone luck and good health. It is emotionally frustrated as a woman to not be able to just menstruate normally. My doctor said that it is due to having irregular periods. I was told to take the Provera and around 14 days after starting my period I would fertile due to ovulation. I am hoping this works.

I was on my period for a month and finally broke down and called my doctor.  I'm at &quot;the age&quot; for menopause.  I had skipped a couple of periods (which I loved) and then had this one, which just wouldn't stop.  My doctor put me on Provera for 10 days.  By the third day my period had stopped totally.  At night I did have night sweats a couple of times, but I had been having those anyway so I really can't say the medication had anything to do with them or not.  I do know however that I had no side effects...no bloating, irritability, weight gain, cramping, nothing!  I really wish that I would have called my doctor sooner.  Don't let your period go for as long as I did.  The 10 day supply of Provera cost me a little over $9.00 and it was well worth it.  I would highly recommend Provera for excessive bleeding.  It sure stopped mine.  At 54 years of age I have more important things to do than worry about being padded all the time!
Absence of Menstrual Periods in Woman Who Has Had Them	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	2/6/2009 3:22:30 PM	I have always had irregular periods. I was on birth control to regulate my cycles, but once I stop taking it, my period stop also. Before starting provera in January 09, I haven't had a period since June 08. My period came on 7 days after taking provera. This is the 9th day of my cycle and my period is still lingering around. My legs aches and breasts are tender and have been for the entire time. I just want my period to end. I'm trying to get pregant and have to test to see if i am ovulating or will I need some type of fertility drug.

I got my period 4 days later, I will start Clomid on my 4th cycle day and I can't wait! I also have PCOS so I really hope everything works out for us. Good luck to everyone who is trying! The only problem I have had with this medication is that the day I got my period it was just spots but my lower back really started to get sore and it's still sore but at least I'm having a full period this time!

About 2 days after I stopped taking them, I started spotting and a few days later my period was in full swing. It lasted 5 or 6 days. I had slight cramps but nothing major.  I haven't had any other side effects so maybe this will keep my cycle on track like the Md wants it.
Absence of Menstrual Periods in Woman Who Has Had Them	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	1/20/2009 9:08:29 PM	I was placed on this medication because my husband and I were trying to get pregnant and I did not have a normal cycle after going off birth control (1 period in 6 months). I have had a lot of issues with the medication. I gained 20 pounds in the first few months after maintaining the same weight for 10+ years. I am incredibly moody, bloated, and in pain during the 10 days that I take the medication. I reported these issues to my doctor who informed me that my weight gain was not related to the medication and I needed to see a dietician.

All I needed was a panty liner. I started taking it on 11/21/08 and finished it on 12/2/08. As of 12/18 we aren't pregnant and was wondering if/when I would have another period. I have had PCOS for 6 1/2 years now. I was always told to just keep taking my birth control until Nov. of this year when me and hubby told the dr. that yes we was trying to get pregnant. I hope this provera will start me another period soon because I have put on approx. 25 pounds in the past 4 months.

I am waiting for my period to start so that I can take Metformin like a lot of other women so that my ovaries will start working again. Hopefully this works. My doctor said that if I don't start my period within 7 days of ending the pill to call her. I'm nervous to find out what the next step is.

I was diagnosted with thickening of the walls, Cysts and Fibroids. And I started getting my period every 20 days apart. I have two more days left of this pill, and I will very unlikely never take it again. The cramping, mood swings, freezing all the time. headaches. Oh my god, what a nightmare. And the back ache that I did have before taking this drug, has increased by 200%, so have my cramps. I was able to deal with the back pain and cramps before, now it is unbearable. Something is telling me, when I do get my menstrual cycle I am going to be in for a long haul for a few days.

July 07', and came for 2 days in April; it has not come back since.  It has been apx. 2 wks since I finished my script and I have not recieved my period.  Does anyone have any suggestions, i.e., maybe I should take it for 10 days, not 5?  I've been irritable since I began taking it, and have been experiencing cramping and breast swelling/pain... it feels like mhy period is coming, but it's not here!  Is it possible I did begin to ovulate and am pregnant, or cant that occur on this med?  Im going in to the Dr.s this wk, but any advice from those who've had similar experiences is appreciated!*I am currently on 8mg of suboxone/ day- maybe that is affecting results?*

Due to hormone issues, Md put me on provera to regulate as well as keep my cycle light and less clots. The first few days of the 10 were terrible. I felt sick, I assumed my body was adjusting.  Finally 7 days after my 10th dose I had my period, along with bad cramps.So I feel nothing has changed. Maybe I will give it another month.

Also I took it at night before going to bed, and had no side effects thus far I would highly recommend Provera.

My gyno wanted to take out my ovary (I was 19 at the time).  Once she sent my to an infertility doc he put on provera.  I have the occasional pain, but nothing close to what I used to have.

Noone told me what effect it should have or when it would help. I went to the ER because I had been bleeding all month, after having my normal period. Had not had any issues with irregularity or spotting in 15 years. Noone asked me if I had a history of kidney disease or depression, and the Dr totally disregarded the fact that I had uterine and cervical cancer in 1997. I have had horrible naseau, headaches, hot/cold, lethargic during the day, unable to sleep at night, tightness in my chest, and alot of difficulty breathing. Also super emotionally erratic. I am 36 years old. The bleeding was much worse while taking the pills, then slowed somewhat for 2 days after stopping, and I am now back to bleeding pretty heavily. When I called the Dr, I told them I didn't have insurance, and they asked me when I thought I might have some. I guess I am just resigned to bleeding until I pass out and am taken to the ER again. Will NEVER take this drug again.

Yes, it gave me my period on the eighth day, but for the nine days I took the pill and several days afterward, I felt the most abhorrent I felt in years.It felt like a mild version of the flu.  Constantly cold and shaky, with awful nausea and indigestion.On top of that, I was always sleepy and my head was always fuzzy.  Studying was a nightmare, and I couldn't even carry on a conversation because I was so out of it.Oh, and did I mention the cramping and aches? My entire back hurt after two days, and only stopped about three days after I stopped taking this evil, evil pill.  However, this was only topped by the terrible cramps that felt like a screwdriver being twisted over and over by an angry, steroid riddled behemoth with a nasty grudge.And then there was the spontaneously bursting into tears when watching Married...With Children.  Need I say more? Nobody should cry while watching Married...With Children.In conclusion, while I appreciate the fact that this finally started my period and everything has returned to normal, I think I'd rather stick my head into an oven than ever ever take Provera ever again.

I am 56 years old.  Have been taking provera 10 mg - up to 60 mg a day to stop heavy bleeding, clots etc brought on by the uterine fibroid.  I find the provera does eventually work - I usually have to take provera for about 3 weeks to stop the bleeding, only problem I have experience has been shortness of breath - and probably elevated blood pressure caused by the provera.  The alternative to provera is to have a hysterectomy - and I refuse to have a hysterectomy since I am hoping my fibroid should shrink.

It only took five days after the last pill for me to get my period. I didn't have any side effects or anything. I was fine. I'm starting on day one of provera again and I only hope to have the same results as last time. Every women's body is different from one another so the day your period may show up can be anywhere from 1 - 15 days past the last provera pill so don't stress about not getting it the last day of the pill. lol althought we would all like that, its rare that it happens. Good Luck to all

It had been three months since my last period and my husband and I are trying to conceive.  My doctor prescribed this medication to &quot;jumpstart&quot; my cycle.  I am happy to report that despite the overly negative reviews I had read, I had absolutely no side effects from this medication.  I took the pill in the evening in case I felt sick, as so many women stated they did, and was pleasantly surprised when the 10 days had passed and I never experienced any of the side affects I had been told would occur.  My period started two days after I stopped taking the pill and aside from a slightly heavier period, which is expected after not having one for three months, I felt great.  I have even been able to maintain my exercise regimen and diet :-)  For those taking this pill for the first time, know what could happen but dont plan for the worst.  I almost didnt take the pill because of the reviews and I would have missed out!

I personally like it because then I know that I am going to get my period! To top it off this is  the way I get Pregnant, I take this for 10 days then I wait normally 10 days for the cycle then on days 5-9 of the cycle I get to take letrizole(femara) for fertility, have intercourse days 10, 12,14,16,18,20. It does come with risks and such but god only gives us what we can handle! I have a beautiful daughter becasue of this treatment, and trying for another. I have PCOS and endometriosis. I am also missing an ovary so ladies and gents(if you read this) miricales can happen, don't give up, waste all of your options.

I can honestly say the headaches, irritability, mood swings, tired all the time are what I also feel and the weight gain... but overall, it did slow down the bleeding and the hard core cramps have gone away.  I've been taking this medication for about 2 months now and now I'm waiting for my period to start.  Is this medication suppose to help you get pregnant also ??

The only problem was it caused major moodswings, even suicidal thoughts.This drug nearly destroyed my finances, marriage and well, ended my life. Take precaution w/ this medication.

This medication has alleviated my problems except for some cramping that still comes and goes. Overall I feel much better even though it took 3-4 weeks to really kick in.  The only side effects I have experienced is some swelling in my hands and feet and occassional bouts of dizziness.  I may be a little more emotional than normal but the side effects are insignificant compared to my original problems.

I started spotting in Nov. Cysts on my ovaries where found by ultrasound in Jan. I went through a hysteroscopy and D&amp;C in April. Pathology came back normal and was told I have PCOS. Most likely the reason I haven't gotten pregnant in almost 7 yrs of marriage.I just finished my first 10 days of provera with no side effects. I haven't spotted since I started it which is a good thing. So hopefully, it will get everything back to normal and we can try again to get pregnant.

I have had problem periods, fibroids and cysts for 20 years.  My gnye put me on this to stop my bleeding and pain which it eventually did after 2 months. I am taking Provera 10mg DAILY for six months, at which time I will have a biopsy.  I have now gained THIRTEEN pounds and am more moody than normal.  I am not happy about the weight gain but am happy to not be bleeding and in pain.  I am worried about what is going to happen when I suddenly stop the med?  
Absence of Menstrual Periods in Woman Who Has Had Them		5	5	4			6/5/2008 9:47:43 PM	My gyn put me on 10 mg 14 days on/ 14 days off. This is my second month. The firsdt month, I gained 10 lbs!!! I'm having mood swings, extreme sore breast, and hot flashes. I did have a period which last 9 days instead of my normal 4 days. I do think the benefits is better than the risk. I usually only have 4 periods a year which isn't good since I wanna have a baby.

The only side effects I encountered were nausea and tender breasts. I took the pills at night so the nausea happened mostly when I was asleep. I would occasionally wake up in the middle of the night and feel nauseous but, I was able to go right back to sleep.I did not encounter the heavier bleeding as some did. I would say overall that the medication did what it was supposed to do and I don't have any complaints.

Days 3-8 were extremely heavy to the point I had to call out of work and keep my feet elevated.  It was horrible! I called the doctor and they put me on Aygestin to stop it now.  Aygestin took 2 days to stop it and I have about another 16 to wean off yet.  As far as the doctor can tell, I'll have to still have surgery for the cyst.

She put me on this so that I could start my period to start Yaz. Before, when I would have a period (even though they were few and far between) they would be regular, four day heavy-at-first-light-at-the-end periods. When this pill finally got me to bleed, it was the longest, lightest period I'd ever had which I thought to be a little strange. My &quot;period&quot; lasted 6 days and was so light I hardly ever needed tampon. Hopefully when I get done with this months pill packet (Yaz) I'll have a normal period. Just curious, has this happened to anyone else?

Absence of Menstrual Periods in Woman Who Has Had Them		1	5	1			1/23/2008 8:04:14 PM	After no period for four months, I was prescribed this to get my period and after three days I have been constantly urinating (5 times in one 1 hour 45 minute class!), dizzy, tired and irritable the whole time. I don't know if I can keep taking this. The doctor claims &quot;it's all in my head&quot; but the side effects all say that it may be a blood sugar problem. I don't know what to do =/
