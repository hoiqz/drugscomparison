Other	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	3/19/2012 11:20:21 PM	This medication caused me to have severe nightmares about my child, that felt very real to me. Overall, I would rather have the sinus problems, than ever take this medication again.
Stuffy Nose	AJR, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/13/2012 2:00:47 PM	For me, this particular drug works wonders, It doesn't take long to kick in. My only complaint is that I wish it would last longer.I suspect the different levels of effectiveness depend upon the individual's condition and symptoms. I take this occasionally when my allergies are at their worst combined with a stuffy nose, most often at night.Despite it having stimulant reactions, I don't have trouble falling asleep, but that might be due to my hypothyroidism. I'm below the normal level of metabolic activity, so this just brings me closer to normal levels as a bonus.

Absolutely worthless! I have better results from eating Altoids candy and drinking hot tea than I do from this garbage, Sorry meth heads had to abuse a useful and inexpensive medicine and the government had to take it away, so now no one can access it without a doctor's permission.
Stuffy Nose	bushhw, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	11/24/2011 11:11:39 PM	The product as stated does what it says it's going to do. It reduced nasal congestion and consequently, redcucted congestion in my chest. The only draw back is it works, as stated, for four hours.  I wish it could last for at least 12. Unless I can find something that works longer, I'm sticking with this product.

Other	sudafed pe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/16/2011 11:25:11 AM	I have used Sinutab Headache and Sudafed PE (headache/sinus) for 40 years.  It was suggested to me for (shortness of breath), it also relieves sinus pressure, allergy-related headache and fatigue.  I get headaches from scents (perfumes, flowers etc) and also certain foods that I eat (apples, oranges, watermelon and many more) I often feel fatigued for no logical reason and if I take one single (one pill, not the suggested 2 pill dose), I feel so much more energetic.  It has been a &quot;miracle drug&quot; for me and I am having a hard time finding it.  I wish someone would tell me what I can take in its place.

Stuffy Nose	Joe, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	25-34	12/3/2010 12:08:59 PM	Phenylephrine has been a disappointment for me; it offers not relief at all for stuffy nose. All the other products oxymetazoline hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine &amp; loratadine etc. work much better; however, it seems I have to cycle through various products and none offer a long-term resolution. Might be time to visit an allergist...

Other	JimBean315, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	1/13/2010 8:55:13 AM	One INT and 5 doctors couldn't help my my severe vertigo.  They wouldn't recommend decongestants because it would raise my blood pressure.    This drug allows my middle ears to drain and my vertigo gets better everyday. I told the doc and he did a double take on my blood pressure because it was down from 92 to 74.  Maybe it lowers the blood pressure and maybe getting well lowered my blood pressure and anxiety.  I have been taking about 3 10mg pills a day for 6 weeks, I worry about long term effects.

Nothing has  ever even come close to working for either of us until my husband, in an attempt to give me some relief went and randomly bought this product for me to try.

I only recently visited an allergist, only to find out I showed NO reaction to any of the 125 allergens for which I was tested! I have used compounds containing Phenylephrine 5 mg until it was removed from the market, and nothing else seems to help. I am getting the most effectiveness from Astelin nasal spray, but sometimes even that doesn't do the job- - - very frustrating!

Stuffy Nose	KJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	2/28/2008 12:17:53 PM	This stuff works great. I'm using the cheapo safeway brand called Mucus Relief PE. It dries me out quickly and effectively. The sinus pain and pressure are greatly relieved, though I do have to take it more often than I would like. Every 4 hours or the pain comes surging back. Hopefully with the use of oral antibiotics and this OTC drug I will be rid of this acute sinus infection within a descent amount of time.

Other	Kim, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/23/2007 1:55:28 PM	for years I have suffered from the feeling of fluid and pressure in my ears and head. I had vertigo and nausea. I went to the dr &amp; the ENT and the allergist none of them could tell me what it was or how to deal with it. I even work in a dr's office and all of their suggestions failed. I have tried many medicines none helped. This stuff cleared my head and relieved all of my symptoms. I wish I would have found it sooner. I buy a generic brand  99 cents for 18 pills and there are no weird additives like OTC sudafed or others. I am so grateful for finding this medicine.
