On the plus side, I tried many fiber options &amp; enemas to try &amp; treat my problems with constipation related to diverticular disease.  This has been the best treatment  I have found, and NO MORE ENEMAS. I think the product is great, only wish it was in a pill form for convenience.
High Amount of Ammonium in the Blood	chinup, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	45-54	11/19/2010 8:39:29 PM	I have been taking this medication going on 6 months.  When I left the hospital( taking 30 m 2x's a day) my ammonium level was in the normal range.  My first doctors appointment 3 days later (and was taking the same dose) was in the 80's.  Went to 3x's a day 60 m, and my levels started to come down.  A month ago it was at 105. Went to 4x's( at 60) a day.  Back to normal range.  I can not go anywhere there is no bathroom.  As for the gas I would fit right in at an old folks home, and for get being in an enclosed space (car).  If they could bottle it I probably could send a ship to the moon.  That is the worst side affect ( except people do not want me around).  Not taking it would be really bad (dead).  Hep C is also not a good thing to have.

Impaired Brain Function due to Liver Disease	meganms401, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	1/20/2010 4:51:59 AM	Seriously guys, I know this sounds weird.. but for the gas I have found something that works...Coke (or Pepsi, etc., any carbonated beverage I would guess). I know, but my mother put it in her beans to take the &quot;gas out&quot; so I tried it. I hardly ever drink sodas b/c I am on a low sodium diet and anyone knows they are horrible for you even w/o a health condition. It doesn't take much, like half a glass.. Hope this helps someone...

This drug works but like the others, the gas and the bloating and distention of my stomach is horrific!  Feel like I can't bend over stomach protrudes so bad!  Discontinuing use.  Was on Amitiza, but made me nauseated so bad I had to discontinue that too.

After discovering lactose was an ingredient in this laxative, I understood. Why is lactose added to a laxative when so many people are lactose intolerant?

Incomplete or Infrequent Bowel Movements	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	2	Female	25-34	8/19/2008 12:15:47 AM	This medicine has been used to treat lack of bowel movement all together. The diagnosis is &quot;nonconclusive&quot; no stool. When I take the highest recommended dosage to the least amount, my stool is then immediatly liquid. Not a daily remedy, especially is I'd like to eat or do anything. Time taken about 3 weeks. Have been instricted to use it as it works in moderation of doseage. I haven't hit a happy medium at all, yet.
