Other	ToniW., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	8/29/2012 11:07:31 AM	I like this medication! It has really helped me with my spasims in my back, legs and neck. And also helps me sleep. I do not get any weird dreams from it, the only side effect I get from it is the nausea (but it only lasts for a little while then it passes) This drug is very helpful for me because I have MS and Fybro, so there are days when the pain and musle tightness is so bad I can not function at all! (and for those that have these problems too, know exactly My doctor neurologist started me on this medication when I was in the hospital because of the weakness and stiffness in my arms legs and back, so much to the point I was unable to walk, and this drug is really helping me. I highly recommend this medication! Very very helpful!

I suffer from spinal stenosis,back pain,lumbar chronic,degenerative joint disease,cervical spine canal narowing  at the c-4 and 5 level.I had a brain subarachnoid hemorrhage in2003, which left me with short term memory loss,spasming of the left arm and neck area along with involuntary muscle movements of the left hand. The use of this medication has relieved the muscle spasms in the neck and left hand. I take this medication 4 times a day and have recomended it to several people who have post operational pain that normal pain medications don't seem to help.

It didn't do anything except knock me out at night from the beginnng. A couple of weeks later the horrible charlie horse in my right leg decreased to 4X/wk instead of 7. BUT, at week 3 I broke out in hives head to toe! Not knowing it was the baclofen, I took Benadry with no decrease in hives! I was told not to stop too quickly, but how fast can I taper? I am also having general malaise and tight chest!Guess I'll call the Dr tomorrow :(I am very active and am trying to swim daily to get the nerves to calm down.

Doc prescribed it for shoulder pain that resulted from MRI machine.  I have HBP and am on Diovan.  Baclofen gave me weird dreams, made me loopy,got agressive, made me sleepy during day.  My BP shot up to 219/116 usually around 120/80.  Also had terrible swelling in feet and legs. The ER doc gave me all the tests related to my condition(even tested for blood clots).  He said that blood clots were one of the side effects.  Thank heaven I din't have that.  He gave me Lisinipril and my BP dropped to 160 thank goodness. The moral of this story is watch out for this drug if you have HBP.  It may save you a trip to the ER.

Have had some sleeplessness and fatigue, some anxiety, 1 out of body dream (kinda cool) and q incidence where I thought I saw a spider in the shower but  wasnt one... Not a big deal for me cause I was aware of hallucinations as one of the side affects so I talked myself out off panicking.

Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/1/2012 11:37:28 PM	I have extremely severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome, to the point of needing a Fentanyl patch, Hydrocodone, and a neurostimulator to function barely normally.I was given a Baclofen rx a few weeks ago during an ER visit for muscle spasms caused by the neurostimulator and have found that the Baclofen has cut my use of Hydrocodone in half without any problems with withdrawal.I have some problems with sleepiness, and notice that others have reported hallucinatory visual or auditory effects. I've studied neuropsychology (phd) and think this may been related to the sleep effect. Lack of sleep can cause hallucinations by essentially causing a person to enter a dreaming-type state while still awake. This happens to me at around 50 hours of being awake.I've noticed that with less than 7-9 hours of sleep, I will slip into that sleep/dream state since taking the Baclofen. I just deal with emails sitting down after waking up, but think that the hallucinations that others are reporting could be related to taking the medication and not getting enough sleep, or taking a higher dose.I would suggest monitoring your mental state when going on this drug, and to be aware of potential effects related to sleep, especially when being active. Hallucinations can be an extremely disturbing side effect, but they are less frightening if you know that it is likely a dream-type situation rather than a serious mental health problem. If you do experience these side effects, try getting more sleep before calling a psychiatrist.But so far it has been a great pain reliever for me, and should be investigated further for IBS patients, especially those who aren't helped enough by Donnatal or Amitriptylene or other -triptylene drugs. Flexeril and Robaxin have no effect on my IBS pain, only Baclofen seems to help.

I can drive now without the muscles balling up in my neck, which had been causing a bad burning feeling. I have had no problem with drowsieness, have had some problems with gas, headaches, and some really intense pain in the right arm, which might be totally unrelated to this medicine. I did miss two days of it and just about pooped my brains out, was unable to get to the drugstore to get a refill. Don't want to do that again. I'm only taking one 10mg pill at bedtime and want to keep it to that. I will eventually have to have surgery on the neck, but have to get over osteoporsis first, I'm told.

Baclofen pump will not help w/the arm spasms so I decided to not go thru spinal surgery when it won't really help what is most bothersome.

I would get several of these spasms every night. Then my feet started to spasm and my toes would twist in every direction until the spasms subsided. It was very painful.I was going to a pain specialist for my chronic back pain due to bulging lumbar discs; arthritis &amp; fibromyalgia. I told him about my calves and feet and the painful spasms I was having. He put me on Baclofen 10mg every 6 hrs. Then he increased it to 20mg every 6 hrs. I found immediate relief on 20mg. I take it in the AM and at bedtime religiously. If I forget my dose during the day, I will have spasms. Baclofen relieves my spasms immediately. I am also on Soma, a muscle relaxant, but it never stopped the spasms I was having in my calves and feet. You'd think Soma would stop the calf &amp; feet spasms, but it only stops my other muscles from going into spasms. Baclofen still makes me drowsy when I take it even tho I have been on it about 8 months. I try to take it every 6 hrs as prescribed.

I have periphial neuropathy in both legs, I use it for the arthritis that has just recently crept into both hands. But, what I couldn't understand were the headaches I was getting, then I picked up this months supply, &amp; right on the bottle it says &quot;MAY CAUSE HEADACHES&quot;. That is the first time I've seen that, maybe I didn't read the fine print. Now I have to see what alternative the Dr. may have, because the headaches are really bad to where I was using my pain meds for them. Doesn't make sense. It worked great for one thing , but causedin me a terrible side effect.

I take it 4 times daily (10 mg)and have for over two yrs. It is far better than either methocarbomol or flexaril, as it does not make you sleepy, although it does tend to make you want to stay in bedif you take it before laying down. It made me feel weird and &quot;drunk&quot; for the first month or so, but as I adjusted to it eveything went back to normal. It is a fantastic drug for me. It controls the terrible muscle spasms in my back, neck, and legs that are completely debilitating, otherwise. I still have them occasionally, but they are less frequent and last less as long as they did before. I say ask your doctor about it, give it a try and a chance to get into your system and let your body adjust before juding it. Personally, I do not think I could function well without it.

Its been 7 years and without it i couldn't be the mobile person i am today. I love thats its non addictive versus the various alternatives. I couldn't imagine my life without it as i wouldn't be anywhere mobile if any to what i am today and daily without and problems or side effects. Obviously there will be some at first, but after long term usage i've got nothing bad to say at all about this drug at all. If i expected to take it for life id consider a pump but i hope that after more therapy/strength to my legs that i can decrease the dosage more and more to nothing at all.

At first it helped my pain more than the pain meds I was taking at the time. Lately 'tho it hasn't been able to help the spasms and I am also on soma 350. I also had a pain med pump for more than 6 years but after losing weight I had problems with the size of the pump. Now I suffer from more spasms and an abnormal muscle on the side of my back adjacent to the pump side. Still waiting for the final word from the Neurologist about the situation.

Muscle Spasms caused by a Spinal Disease	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Male	55-64	3/8/2011 7:43:44 AM	I am using this to help with muscle spasms caused by trauma to my neck.  I have foramen narrowing on both lateral sides from C-2 to C-4 to include severe narrowing of the left C-3 joint.  Of course the future will be some sort of surgery, but I do want to wait to see if maybe I can get &quot;better&quot; by using yoga and meditation.I find the baclofen only moderately effective. It does nothing for the neuro-pain, but I don't expect it to given the occlusion of the joint and neural pathways.I do experience very strange and vivid dreams which are usually not pleasant.  I also remember the dreams, which is bizarre,given the content of the dreams.Baclophen seems relatively &quot;safe&quot; but I keep my dosage to the bare minimum.  I have stopped taking it for a while during cycling training and races because I think it can decrease proper muscle function.I think if you have neural pain that this med is a good thing to try.  I didn't experience any withdrawal symptoms while I was briefly off the meds.  It makes me a bit drowsy but I counter with a small dose of coffee in the morning (about 1/2 cup).I have not experienced memory loss or recall while using but some people do.  Watch out for that side effect.

My original injury date of 8/5/79 I broke my neck damaging my spinal cord. Back then I was prescribed Baclofen but had major problems with side effects. Used diazepam instead until 2009 when I could no longer function due to the long half life of valium making me continually tired. Went back on Baclofen starting with a low dose. It was ineffective for controlling the spasms. As my doctor increased the dosage reaching 20mg 3x daily. It worked somewhat but gave me insomnia and occasional panic attacks. After reaching 25 mg/3x daily with increasingly worse side effects and less than good spasm control we decided I was better off using diazepam. Exxperimenting a bit on my own while keeping my doctor in the loop I have found that using diazepam (5-10mg) in morn and at night (helps me sleep) and taking 15 mg of baclofen in the afternoon seems to be the happy medium.

Other	4kenseth17, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/14/2010 5:40:18 AM	I was originally presciribed BACLOFEN by my neurologist after my Myasthenia Gravis diagnosis in '94. MG is a neurological/neuro-muscular auto-immune disease that's main symptoms is that it constantly works to make the body weak with a low immunity factor. Therefore I took MG meds, (Mestinon &amp; Prednisone), that increased my daily muscle/motor function! My bowels &amp; bladder spasmed 24/7 &amp; Baclofen GREATLY, (still to-this-day), helps regulate my intestinal spasming &amp; discomfort. WITHOUT Drs. orders; I also used Baclofen to relax my bladder muscles during my times of dealing with passing Kidney Stones! Don't use so much that you CAN'T urinate; but if bladder spasms are severe enough...stones will not progress down through the wall passages &amp; make their way out in a more comfortable way.***I'm anxious to speak to my neurologist though, wondering if I increased my Baclofen Rx dosaged; if it could help give me relief for the constant nerve pain in my face. As for any drowsiness I've encountered, one should discuss their decision with their Dr. that prescribed the Rx to you. In the beginning, I felt some drownsiness, but within maybe 2 weeks, as my body adjusted, I was no longer tired or feeling any side effects. SIMPLY PUT..&quot;The benefits outweighed any negative affects that arose&quot;. But ever person is different. One things FOR SURE..do NOT attempt to decrease Baclofen Rx dosage or stop Baclofen Rx 'cold turkey'! Please notify your Dr. &amp; have THEM give you a tapering schedule! I learned this from experience!!!

I have spinal fushion at L4-L5,sciatia,muscle spasms,degenerative disc disease. I slept for 4 hours after taking 1st pill, waiting to see what happens after 2nd one. Helped the spasms alot! Just hope it doesn't make me sleep all the time because this is to be my daytime muscle relaxer.Fingers crossed that this will be THE Pill and I can get away from the other pain meds.

Other	hopeful, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	45-54	10/26/2010 5:53:37 PM	Taking for MS have fewer leg spasms,less tremors but sometimes spine feels very weak,almost like my legs cant support body.My feet start to feel weak like I have to sit down.Also I started on 10 mg 3x a day and Dr increased to 20 mg 3X a day due to knee and rib stiffness hoping that would help.I read that some are taking as needed,but I hear the drug dose can be reduced to find what works best, but not just stopped for fear of side effects-the dose has to be gradually reduced.Is anyone else taking pills eight hrs apart ? I am still haveing the stiffness around my rib cage and in my knees I have been on meds since July also take 300 mg neurontin at night only seems to help.They say it takes a couple months sometimes for level of drug to work the way it should.I will hope for the best and thank all for the great information shared. 
Muscle Spasms caused by a Spinal Disease	lauralivesay, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	10/24/2010 12:03:00 AM	I have alot of problems with my spine and have been in severe pain for 2 years. About 7 months ago I began having muscle spasms all over my body. I have been on baclofen for almost a month now and two days after starting it my spasms went away! I have had dizzeness, headaches,nausea and forgetfullness with this medication, also at first it would &quot;knock me out&quot; and I would wake up in the middle of the night and try to eat or smoke while still half asleep. (Now I can take it without falling asleep) I feel the medication had me too asleep to know what I am doing. All of that has gotten alot better, I sometimes need phenegran for nausea and still wake up and try to smoke and fall asleep with lit cigarettes but I think it is getting better because I don't do it as much. When you start this medication use caution because it will make you fall asleep easily and there will be nausea and forgetfullness but it will get better after a week or two.Overall I am very glad I started taking this!

However, it made me so weak, tired, and forgetful, that I could barely function.  It also caused me to retain fluid terribly and I practically stopped peeing all together.  I was taking Vesicare for spastic bladder, and it interacted badly with Baclofen, so I dropped Vesicare and slowly weaned myself off Baclofen as well.  Now I only take 10mg of Baclofen as needed for spasticity and pain, but not every day.  It works well for me at that reduced dosage, too, but without the side effects.

Until I was put on Baclofen two weeks ago I had had no sensitivity in my fingertips for 20 years.  Within a week I could actually feel hot water on my fingers and it burned!  I was so shocked I thought it was a fluke but no, I can still feel the heat.  I can also feel my left foot for the first time in seven months and am hoping eventually I can regain some manual dexterity.  I just wish my last neurologist would have prescribed baclofen for me; to me it has been a wonder drug.

I have spinal stenosis in C3-C5, with disc bulging. I was having the worst headaches of my life, spent 24-7 with heating pad and flexeral did nothing. I also have fibromyalgia, diabetes w/ neuropathy, and a ruptured disk (severe) at L5S1(post -op). This drug does make me more sleepy than I'd like, I also take a lot of other meds like Klonopin, Amitryptiline, lortab 7.5, Metformin, and Zestrel. To make a long story shorter =)), this drug made all the difference in the world. Does take a few weeks of use to get best results. I now take 10mg Q8 hours, and it helps me sleep, the neck spasms have all but disappeared. I do recommend for any muscle spasms. this makes Flexaril seem like just a brain relaxer. For those just starting, if no overt side affects, then keep on for several weeks, it can take time, and higher doses may be what you need. I quit taking all my meds for about a month, just tired of the gastric problems and that resolved but it was a miserable month. May have been withdrawels from this and the Lortab. Either way, I've learned that my quality of life is better with them than without them except the Metformin and thats a whole other story. Good luck to all. Loved the remarks about eating our young by one of you. I was especially excited by the story of being a quad and now walking. That is amazing.Compared to some of your stories, I feel blessed to be in the shape I'm in, and some days I hate the shape I'm in. Happy New Year.

Had some of the memory loss and uppityness described by some others I was reading. I was in the army while using it and became very aggitated with my superiors if used before work. I also took with Tramadol, and had one really odd side effect that made it impossible for me to acheive erection. Not common in very many 23 yrs olds I dont believe, had to be the meds. Since being off for over 6 months my memory is better and sleep is normal as well as my sex life. It was a really good drug though, helped me through some rough pains.

He is in a nursing home and was prescribed either 10 mg or 20 mg Baclofen daily by the nursing home doctor. The doctor did not tell me or discuss this change in his treatment. From May until now I noticed and increasing weakness, slurring of speech and tiredness. It became extreme and I finally questioned any change of medication. I discovered he was on oral baclofen. He has been taken off it now and in two days, his speech is already audible and his ennunciation clear. He has made it through the morning without falling asleep. He can control the driving stick of his battery driven wheel chair. On Sunday he was practically bed-ridden.He tried this drug 20 year ago and it had the same extreme effect. I would not have allowed it if the physician had discussed the administration of it with me. The disturbing thing is that the doctor did not follow up and notice what was going on and discontinue the drug on his own.

It seemed to help, but I experienced a side effect that has me puzzled. When taking Baclofen I felt like I was on &quot;speed&quot;. I was more focused and could stay on task better. I had more energy. Here's the weird part, as long as I was up and moving about I was a dynamo, but if I stopped, sat or laid down and especially after eating I would literally fall asleep. I finally stopped taking it after my dosage was up to 10mg 3x a day. I haven't been able to find any information that even hints at this side effect. Anyone else experienced this?TIAm3doc

Suffered since for over 4 years with spasms, etc, with only being given Soma for it along with pain meds. Then they finally gave me oral baclofen. It helped nearly immediately, and I was angry that they didn't give it to me sooner. However, starting last year I began to have some short-term memory incidents, awakening in the morning and other times of the day when I've been napping, and at first not knowing all sorts of things, like where I am, what year it is, etc, etc, for a few seconds to a few minutes, until I get all my memory back. Then the other night, however, for the first time, I apparently had a severe short-term memory loss while I was apparently awake beforehand, the first time that this ever happened to me, I believe. I then, on a hunch/suspicion researched baclofen online and found out it apparently can cause short term memory problems when mixed with some other meds. Therefore I am interested in knowing if anyone else has gone through this.I'm therefore going to slowly wean myself off of the baclofen for awhile to see if this is what is causing it, before I tell the doctor and make a big fuss, seeing how much I hate to go to the doctors and so forth, etc. If I still have these memory episiodes after being off of the baclofen, short-term memory-loss episodes which I've had regularly now since Jan '08, 10 months after starting on the baclofen, then I will have to tell the doctor. If anyone else has had anything similar, please let me know.Thanks

I had many unpleasant side effects back then. Doctors settled on the use of diazepam which I used I thought successfully for almost 30 years. Then when I started with my current primary care doctor and we discussed the fact I was tired almost all the time I discovered that valium has a very long half life.I could probably have stopped taking it that day and had a blood level months later. I was reluctant to take baclofen again but it was better than the violent spasms. I take many other meds but have noted no unpleasant side effects from this medication. Works well.

Other	alltheworldsastage, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	6/2/2009 11:08:11 AM	I have just had surgery for a torn rotator cuff. This medication was prescribed for muscle spasms due to this procedure and the following lengthy and painful rehabilitation of the shoulder joint. After the procedure, narcotic pain medication was restricted due to an addiction to these medications. Firstly, the Baclofen eliminated the muscle spasms and allowed me to sleep with a substantial anti-inflammatory effect on the healing joint. Secondly I found that, strangely, my usual addictive behaviour when exposed to the narcotic pain meds disappeared. I used them as directed, for pain not recreation as I unfortunately usually would, leaving myself short and in pain. I found the Baclofen accomplished these remedies without presenting an abuse potential of it's own. I will ask my doctor about continued therapy to address my addictive tendencies. Cheers.

No, not perfect fix, but the spasicity in my legs and feet was severe, now it is tollerable. Yes there are ocasional headaches, but not too bad. Yes a hangover feeling in the morning, and need a nap after lunch. Taking 15mg - 3 times a day, for 6 weeks now. Still more testing to get done, but I am now having my big toes be numb feeling. Doc says more test to narrow myopathy or MS... so far CT scan and MRI all say myopathy but not MS, but symptoms point at MS.  44 years young, so it is possible MS is the answer but too early to be showing in my labs and other test.  Muscle biopsy scheduled for next month.

After refilling and taking this medication for only a day or two, my acid problems went away. I also like it because I can take it at work &amp; it doesn't make me too sleepy. I'm clear-headed and can function with no problem. I've read the reviews that say people are experiencing hallucinations. In the 10 yrs I've taken them, I've never had one hallucination...maybe a weird dream on occasion, but I attribute that to the combination of pain meds prescribed to me for my degenerative disc disease, arthritis, bursitis and sciatica.

I also take Keppra for nerve pain.  It took about a month before things started to settle down.  The baclofen makes me sleepy, but I still get more work done because I can concentrate better while not in major pain.  I have had an increased appetite as well.

Muscle Spasms caused by a Spinal Disease	55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	55-64	4/3/2009 1:07:01 PM	I was using Skelaxin for my spasms for eight years.  I had to stop working and lost my health insurance.  I started going to the VA for my health care.  The Primary Care Doc originally prescribed Methocarbamol fot my spasms.  It worked fine for a few weeks and then the spasms came back with a vengeance.  The pain doc put me on Baclofen. (with all my other pain meds) I have only been using it for a few weeks  with a good deal of drowsiness but the spasms seem to have eased.  I have learned over the years that most side effects (if tolerable) will either go away or you just learn to live with them.

I have noticed that my left foot is swelling and hurts tremendously when I walk on it. Also, I have been experiencing continuous muscle spasms in my right eye and sharp one-sided headaches that come and go on occasion. I'm starting to think that my doctor might have put me on a medication that is too strong for me. Any suggestions or explanations? 
Other	Over It, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	3/13/2009 2:55:02 AM	I have been on Baclofen 20mg 3 times a day for approx a month. I was on this drug before about 3 years ago with no side effects. This time I experienced severe swollen feet and ankles predominently the left side. And also my left eye has been swelling up to where it is almost closed shut, and I have also gained weight without changing my diet at all. According to my regular internist he says it is the Baclofen that is causing this. I also take many other meds for pain that I have been on for a number of years, and I have tolerated them with no problem. The hard part is that the Baclofen was helping me with my legs and now I have been taken off of it. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? My neurologist put me on the Baclofen, I have MS and Fibroymyalgia and degenerative disc disease. So for the pain I see a pain doctor. My internest does not like me seeing the pain doctor and wants to blame the pain meds for all of these problems. I am just beyond all of this.

Baclofen was added to his list of meds before he was 1 yr old. Before baclofen, moving him &amp; dressing him was a nightmare!  He was stiff as a board &amp; even the simplest of tasks were nearly impossible. The last 3 1/2 yrs with baclofen have been much easier.  Now we can perform his physical therapy without him screaming &amp; stiffening up. He is MUCH more comfortable now &amp; that means a lot to us.

She was not started on a lower dose and titrated up, as recommended.I myself, was not informed that this med was started...my mother was told &quot;it is a muscle relaxer that might help&quot;. She has severe degenerative changes in her spinal area, as well as neuropathy in her legs.She was on Baclofen at 20 mg 2x day for less than 2 weeks. She had extreme auditory/ visual hallucinations and confusion;I thought she had experienced a stroke or cerebral bleed from what she was exhibiting, and from the onset of symptoms. This resulted in a fall where she had fractured both legs and had multiple contusions. She has been hospitalized, was in ICU for 1 week,and is currently STILL in rehab unable to stand or bear weight.She looks to be at least 3 weeks away from d/c and then ongoing home PT to regain mobility.PLEASE use caution in starting ANY new drug, especially in the elderly. This was prescribed by a pain management MD, and I feel that too little caution was taken in judging my mother's tolerance/ ability to use this med in addition to the other med's she was on. Also, too little education re : side effects to look out for...now her and our ability to care for her is very uncertain because of a lack of caution on the guesswork of one patient's tolerance/ reaction to a &quot;starting&quot; dose over another's....I've read the other reviews where hallucinations/ confusion have been experienced, and would be interested in knowing what dosages they were on/ started on, or any other instances of similar reactions.

I was on Soma before, but my doc said &quot;that stuff will kill you&quot; so we switched meds. Right now I'm wating to try something else. I'm having WIERD dreams, when I can sleep, and I get weakness in my arms &amp; legs, and I get SUPER spasms, where it feels like someone kicks me in the chest, and moves my whole body.I don't know yet if it's this med, or a combo of them, but it seems to be making my life crazier than usual..seeing and hearing things too. I don't want MY experience with this drug to deter anyone from trying it, it CAN help, but watch out for the unusual when you're on it. There are always going to be people that have a problem with a med, but then, there are a lot of people that don't. Don't knock it before you try it. Screen's getting blurry...GOOD LUCK..whatever med you end up on..if one don't work, try another 'till you get the right one.  It also tends to mess with my DID..so this one isn't a really good match for me..once again, good luck in getting a med match quickly

My doctor said this would relax the muscles and let it heal up better.  It worked great.  I took it before bedtime and always woke up refreshed.  It relaxed my body so I could get a good nights rest.  I didn't think it would help me in that way but it did!  I adore this drug for that reason.
Other	lostindiapers, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	9/29/2008 1:22:47 AM	I am taking Baclofen 10mg 3x a day for Pudendal Neuralgia. It worked a little bit at first to relieve the pain but it doesn't help now. I woke up about 2 hours after taking it along with a Hydrocodone/APAP 10/325mg, a Tegretol 200mg, a Nortriptyline 75mg and a Hyomax-SL .125mg in terrible pain. I was crying and unable to move. I do not recommend this for Nerve pain.

Also, peripheral neuropathy causes muscle spasms and muscle cramping that could be helped by this medication. It is hard to pinpoint which &quot;disease/syndrome&quot; is helped when one individual has them all, but I feel if I was no longer taking this (10 mg 3x day)I would notice a difference

It's programmed for each hour. I don't get any ups and downs, side affects and don't have to remember to take it.  Every 3 months it is emptied and refilled in the Dr' office.  Aport is just under the skin.  It has to be surgically removed every 7 years.

Pretty much the people that are complaining about only are taking them 3 days at a time. Read what the drug treats. PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THIS SITE LOOKING FOR &quot;BUZZ&quot; PILLS SHOULD BE SHOT. One person said they almost died. I hate to assume but chances are they didn't take the drug correctly or sometimes people just reject the drug. This drug has been around a long time the late sixties early seventies and the exact pharmancology of the drug is unknown. People are raiding mom and dads medicine cabinets and thinking they get the same buzz as other drugs are putting themselves in peril. This is a maintainence drug and it takes a while before it works. One guy even compared it to oxycontin and valium.Is it me or is it completly assinine to compare Baclofen with opiates and benzos. I'm no doctor but at least research what it is and does before saying anything. Not to be rude but sometimes I can understand why lions eat their young.
Other	GThornburg, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	3/30/2008 6:22:48 PM	I have an incomplete spinal cord contusion from a vehicle rollover 3 years ago. Injury level c2-c4. I was instantly made a quadrapalegic. We tried just about every drug in the book. Mixing and matching the drugs. Baclofen is simply a maintenence drug, so you have to stay on top of it for maximum effectiveness. If you only take it when you feel the sensations you have waited to long. After 3 years taking the drug @ 80mg a day my body tells me about half an hour before it's time. Also xanax or kolonopin will actually aggitate(help) the baclofen in some sci cases. I can walk again and have total use of my right side and now all the tone(spasms and stiffness) are all contained in my left arm and hand. Sometimes it doesn't work as well as I wish but given the circumstances I'd say it does it's job and I'm consulting my dr. about starting to reduce the dosage. I'm considering the new pump. Any feedback or questions please feel free to contact me.

Recommended a spinal fusion (rejected on basis that it would only offer positive effects for 1 to maybe 2 years before I would end up as bad or worse than I am now) I was given Baclofen to try...I take Soma and use the Baclofen for the extreme spasm days..it helps more than Soma when I get into a really severe episode, but it makes me really short of breath, so I don't use it much due to that fact - doc said it's a reaction to the med, but I seem to do okay when I use it sparingly.

I want to try something else for the spasm's and I tried Baclofen. I took 1 pill in the pm, and another one the following afternoon. I sleeped until 1-2a.m., I woke up to get some water and I was in my kitchen and lost vision, balance, and fell landing hard on the floor breaking 6 bones between both feet, 2 cracked ribs, and chipped 3 teeth. I am a 34 yr old male with no history of falling or broken bones. Adding Baclofen was the only change, so I had to have had an allergic reaction to it. I can only say when starting this med, get up slowly and always brace yourself for a possible fall until you know how the drug will effect you.

Tried over a dozen different drugs to help, but none did.  Baclofen is the only drug that has stopped all of this.  They tried generic, but that has no effect, so only the baclofen made by Watson has been effective.  It has literally given me my life back.  I can eat again(food was my enemy), very little nausea, no belching or hiccups.  Unfortunately, my HMO won't carry the brand name and prefers the generic which has no effect on me, but it  has restored my life, so it is worth every penny.

Milagram showed a herniated L4, L5, narrowing between my L4 and S1 and inflamation of the nerve roots.  I had treatment with flexeril and 2 spinal injections.  Orthopedic Spinal Surgeon proposed a Lemenectomy(I rejected), NeuroSurgeon proposed a Spinal Fusion(Orthopedic spinal surgeon upon further review of the scans indicated that a spinal fusion would be the appropriate course of action).  Pain specialist proposed a pain implant device to deal with Pain(rejected because it would preclude future use of MRI as diagnostic tool for me) &amp; proposed Aqua Therapy which I followed up with.  There was some benefit to the Aqua Therapy.NEUROLOGIST PROPOSED BACLOFEN WHICH WAS A GRAND SLAM.  IN ABOUT 2 MONTHS ALL PAIN WAS ELIMINATED, MY SLEEP WAS BETTER THAN NORMAL AND GASTRO INTESTINAL (BOWEL FUNCTIONS) WORK ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE.  THIS DRUG GAVE ME MORE NOTICEABLE RELIEF THAN ANY OTHER DRUG THAT I HAD TAKEN IN MY LIFETIME.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT ANY HESITATION OR RESERVATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I got some headaches when starting, but those have diminshed.  It does help a lot with the tightness and spasms I had, which makes me more comfortable.  Sometimes though, with the lessened spasticity, it seems the nerve pain comes through more intense.  Hopefully that can be addressed with my other pain meds adjusted.  So far, so good.

Muscle Spasms caused by a Spinal Disease	Had2change, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/21/2007 3:37:15 PM	I used to be given Bextra for my condition but once it was taken off the market my Dr replaced with Baclofen and I could not be happier works just as good or better actually as the effects last longer. Helps release muscles and headache relief is great after that.
