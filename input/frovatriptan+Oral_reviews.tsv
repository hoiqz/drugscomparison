I was skeptical with this, but it worked fast, with minimal side effects. I am extremely happy with it. Wish there was a generic. Pricey, but fantastic.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/13/2010 9:27:31 PM	Frova is the only drug that has ever been able to control my migraines. I got my life back because of Frova, I know it sounds dramatic, but without Frova, I really suffered with awful migraines for too many years! I'm very grateful that my dr allowed me to try Frova!

I was taking two Fiorinol every 4-6 hours day and night without relief. On the third day, I was given a sample of Frovatriptan. Within two hours after taking the medication, I was painfree. It was wonderful to be free of the unrelenting pain. One pill...twelve hours later and I'm still pain free. I would definitely recommend this to others that suffer with migraines.

Frova takes 2 hours to act so I take at very first hint and it lasts.
Migraine Headache	Jenny, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/21/2009 2:46:48 PM	I have suffered from menstrual migraines for over 30 years.  I've been taking Frova for approx. 4 years now.  It's the only thing that I have found that works for me.  Will usually make the headache go away within 2-3 hours.  Although I pay $188 for 9 tablets (with my insurance) I find it to be very well worth it.  But sure am hoping for a generic to come out.  Over $20/pill is alot, but if it works....

Like so many, I initially balked at paying $40 for 6 pills, and actually switched to Excedrin (OTC) migraine medicine for awhile.  But recently, after having a major (2-day) migraine, I switched back to the Frova, and it has worked wonders!.  It relieved my migraine in less than 2 hours (if you take it at the first 'twinge'), and in the past, I only had to take 1 pill per day of my menstrual cycle.  I will continue to use it, as the alternative (being cheap!) is not worth it!

Migraine Headache	spookegal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	2/25/2009 7:17:56 AM	I've had mixed results.  I have taken two doses each time, some with no effect.  I'm pretty sensitive to medication so I did not take a third dose.  I have tried similar medications with the same results.  
Migraine Headache	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	2/18/2009 10:12:38 AM	Absolutely no relief after 3 hours. This is our first time using Frova.  Altered breathing and heart rate; too nervous to take another dose.

Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/23/2008 2:57:21 PM	I have been a migraine sufferer since the 3rd grade.  I have tried every medicine out there and this is the first to work without having horrible side effects.  I no longer cry myself to sleep.  My only hope now is that a generic is made because I pay $25 for 9 pills.  But dont get me wrong, its worth every penny!
Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/8/2007 8:38:44 AM	I have severe migraines during my menstrual cycle.  This medication elimanates the pain usually in less than tow hours, while I am still going on with regular activities.  Other medications I have tried in the past, I would take the med and then have to rest before it would even start to work, if at all.  Frova has given my life back that one week a month instead of dreading it.

I have had no side effects and it works fast. I wish I found this earlier in my life.
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/28/2007 11:24:52 AM	Exceptional helpful when Migraines come on.  I can get back to life instead of being out suffering in a dark room.  
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/25/2007 4:58:52 PM	I have used many types of migraine medications. I was weary to try thi one thinking its just another one thats not going to work, but to my surprise- not only did it work it has very few side effects.  I didnt have to make that choice of having my chest close up and not breathing, but my headaches are gone kinda of choice.
