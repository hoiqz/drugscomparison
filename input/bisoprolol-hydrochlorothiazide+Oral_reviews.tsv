Not great for me for water retention.  Had to have another medication added.  But, blood pressure is much better.  No real side effects.  Just the first week getting used to the medication.  Happy with it.

Began whezzing and had dry cough within two days. I had dizziness,confusion,muscle cramps and twitches also,all of which became worse the longer I took it. Stop taking it a week ago and all went away except wheezing and dry cough which is still getting better.

Lowers my pressure without any bothersome side effects. For these reasons I have been able to take it faithfully everyday, and continue to enjoy my life without the worry of my high blood pressure causing me irreversible damage to my health.

High Blood Pressure	Ken, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	45-54	4/26/2010 3:01:25 PM	I have been taking a small (5mg) dosage for moderate hbp. At first I was on 10mg, but my heart rate was dropping into the low 40 range and I was extremely fatigued. Fatigued to the point I laid in bed for 4 days too tired to go to work.  I called the doc and he lowered the dosage to 5mg and I feel a lot better. I still do not have the same energy level as I had before taking this drug, but after a few months now I am feeling like I am starting to adjust to it. I have had none of the side effects other than some fatigue so far and it has dropped my blood pressure down well into the proper range..

High Blood Pressure	Mrs. B, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	3	5	2	Female	45-54	1/6/2009 1:40:09 PM	I too experienced the dizziness, fog feeling, and forgetfulness. I also believe it is causing me to lose my hair. It has been shedding like crazy for about 9 months. My hair texture has also changed. I hate this medicine and have been begging my dr. to change my &quot;cocktail&quot; again. He refuses. I'm getting a second opinion.
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	55-64	9/24/2008 9:23:12 PM	When I first started taking this drug I felt ok but the longer I took it the more side effects I had.  I was always feeling dizzy, severe leg cramps and I had no energy and was forgetful and fuzzy headed.  My Dr took me off it for 7 days and all the effects went away but especially after 5 days I couldn't believe how good I felt.  My head seemed to clear up and felt much better, I felt like I had been in a &quot;fog&quot; for months.  Now he wants me to take something else I am very skeptical.  I think BP drugs are all bad for you but they control the BP readings.  This is the 4th one I've been on.

I took Toprol XL for a while, but it did not lower my systolic pressure. My doc switched me to Bisoprolol and my bp loved it. It's effective, easy to use but unfortunately, caused me to break out in white spots all over my dark colored legs and arms. I was recently diagnosed with a medication eruption from the Hydrochlorothiazide component of the medicine. My meds have now been switched back to Toprol.
