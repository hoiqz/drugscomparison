Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/30/2012 1:04:31 PM	I was not told by my doctor of the possible side effects or I would not have used this method of colon cleansing before my colonoscopy. I am four weeks post the procedure and hopefully no kidney damage will occur. Am I out of danger at four weeks post using the product?

Twelve hours later he underwent surgery that removed his entire colon and all but 160 cm of his small intestine, which were entirely dead. He nearly died. We have been eight weeks now in the ICU and he still has a long way to go toward any kind of recovery that will allow us to leave the hospital.

Emptying of the Bowel	Peggy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	55-64	10/4/2011 1:50:11 PM	I took pills as directed.  No upset stomach, headaches or anything else.  It worked without a lot of stomach pain.  A little worried that the effects would not be finished before my exam.

(gastric bypass and my stomach is so small)  My first day was clear liquids and a bottle of a VERY SOUR LEMON and salty stuff - but it was about the size of an old fashioned Coke bottle so I got it down in about 5 takes. Day 2 I took 20 pills at 15 minute intervals starting at 8AM. They worked FAST!  I was clear by late PM.  Took the remaining 12 pills at 6PM and it took about 90 to run clear again.  I'm really hungry from no food for 2 days but this sure beats that horrible stuff my husband had to drink in March. I, too, wish they were smaller.  I have a hard time swallowing large pills.  This was for a colonoscopy. 
Emptying of the Bowel	Roger Alexander, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	9/17/2011 5:08:39 PM	I am 50 and had never been to a hospital except to visit someone. I say that because I am a relatively healthy guy. I've had virtually no health problems. I am 5'11'' and weigh 185 pounds. I decided that since I was 50 that I would get a colonoscopy for pre-cautionary reasons only. The prep went very smoothly. I don't have a problem taking pills and downed them with no problems. I drank Gatorade, approximately 64 ounces when taking the pills. My kidneys starting hurting the night of the prep. It has been 4 days now since I took the prep and my kidneys are still hurting. The pain hasn't subsided either. I called the doctor that did the colonoscopy, he didn't have the time honestly to talk to me and told me that the pain probably wasn't my kidneys and muscular instead. He also told me that if I was concerned about it to contact the general medical doctor that recommended him. I did call the general medical doctor and went in the day after the colonoscopy. The doctor had blood drawn and I provided a urine sample. I am waiting for the blood test results. I will never take the Osmo-prep again and will tell everyone that I know about me experience. I have confirmed that other people have had kidney problems/pain with the Osmo-prep. Some patients have actually had kidney failure. A Pharmacist that I talked to recently knew about the risks of using this prep, he was very familiar with the problems with the prep but yet the doctor that did the colonscopy frankly just put me off. I suspect that the doctor knew that there was the possibility that I really did have kidney pain. I would think twice before taking this prep.
Emptying of the Bowel	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	9/9/2011 8:00:16 AM	I am 38 and 135 pounds.  I found this site looking to see if anybody else had the same side effects as I did.  My side effects were a runny nose, itching fingers, hands and feet, that did not seem to last that long.  This is my 4th colonoscopy, and my first time trying the osmoprep.  I was a little concerned because I was not going to the bathroom clear when I went to bed last night like my previous preps.  I slept all night and finished the pills at 6:45AM, this time just my fingers itched and my nose ran a little, and by 7:30 I am going clear and my symptoms are gone.  My procedure is at 11:00 today.  The only discomfort I am feeling right now is from wiping so much and the inconvenient trips to the bathroom.  Also the more pills I took the harder they seemed to go down.  I think that was due to my feeling of fullness from drinking so much water with them.  Any type of colonoscopy prep is unpleasant but osmoprep in my opinion is by far the easiest to manage.  I will definitely use osmo for my 5th colonoscopy.  Be sure to talk to your physician and do your research before deciding to use it because for some there are health risks involved.  Good Luck!
Emptying of the Bowel	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	6/3/2011 6:10:29 PM	I was very happy to have the osmoprep option for my most recent colonoscopy. I would want to vomit eveytime I took a sip of golytley with my past colonoscopies. I read the reviews for osmoprep and was a little worried. The day before my prep I ate easily digestible foods such as chicken and pasta and a whole wheat skinny bagel with butter and a bananna. The day the prep I had coffee in the morning and then had chicken broth for lunch and a orange Popsicle and drank lots of water. At 5pm I started taking the osmoprep 4 pills every 15 minutes. The pills taste so gross. To mask the taste I used the advise of a review I read and put the pill between my teeth and waited till the 7up touched my tounge to put the pill in my mouth. I also used coca cola too. At 7pm I was so nauseous that I did vomit. All water but I felt great after and at 7 I was able to resume taking the pills and took my last set at 730pm. It took a good 3 hours to start working. I kept drinking liquids until about 1130 and then I went to bed. I woke up at 315am with horrible cramps and I was up until 5am. Other than the cramps and the vomiting I had no other side effects. I was able to eat right after the proceedure and I feel fine! I would defiantly take osmoprep over golytley or nulytley ANYDAY!

I got very nautious and a major migraine!  The &quot;salty&quot; taste was so gross! Why can't they have a pleasant tasting coating for these pills??? I had to cancel my colonoscopy.  I later rescheduled using a different prep.
Emptying of the Bowel	lessonlearned, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	3/22/2011 10:37:32 AM	My mother used this drug and the pills were large and harger for her to swallow. She was really sick from the drug and has had many, if not all of the side effects from it as well.  She ended up going to the doctor and has had many internal problems from using OsmoPrep. Please use caution if thinking of using and read all reviews as well as all the lawsuits that are out there. Oh, and Texas doesn't like to sue drug companies...just an FYI...so better just not to even take this if you live in TX because if you do and you get kidney failure due to this, you are out of luck! 
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/20/2011 9:23:29 PM	I'm scheduled for a colonoscopy tomorrow. Which is firstfor me. I will say that the first round of pills didn't do anything until i took the remaining 12 pills about 6 hours later.  I've also hated taking pills but it was much better. 
Emptying of the Bowel	bennett, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	45-54	1/2/2011 3:47:28 PM	I started this on a monday, it's now sunday. I have never been this sick! I will never do this again. I had to check in for procedure at 7a.m. &amp; I could hardly make it I had such a terrible MIGRAINE. I have had colonoscopies before! I have not once ever had a reaction like this ongoing one I am still currently dealing with! I &amp; my husbund have called the Dr., 2 times(Fri.&amp;Sat.) I was told to eat eggs,oatmeal,tea&amp; use the spice ginger! I am vomiting, belly pain, piercing headaches,extremly fatiqued, and I don't dare eat anthing solid! I am drinking water as much as I can. Have loose light stools but I can't keep anything down so it's it's getting quite watery. 1 egg or a 1/2 cup oatmeal no more! I can't take the effects of it. The thing is my tests, stomach and colon came out absolutly perfect as the Dr, told us! So it's the 32 pill prep! It's like the energizer bunny, it just keeps(me) going &amp; going. My family(2 kids &amp; husbund)can't make food at home because it makes me so sick to smell it! when I do have urine it's not alot! So I guess I will now get a UTI, which I haven't had for a long while. Happy New Year to US!! But as I always say it could be worse! At least the I looked okay inside! but BELEIVE me I will NEVER,EVER take this again! We had to cancell our sons birthday on the 31st,and no family for my children. I will try to make an appt. with my primary Dr. tomorrow. Hope he's in! EVEN better! I HOPE THAT I AM FEELING BETTER!  DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU CAN HELP IT! TAKE ANYTHING BUT THIS. HAD I ONLY BEEN WARNED I WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN THIS! NO ONE ELSE SHOULD EVER GO THROUGH THIS! By the way YES, I DID DRINK PLENTY OF FLUIDS! 3 btls. of clear gatorade-2btls.(2LTR.) of flat gingerale &amp; lots of water! Just like the Dr.s instuctions said too! Sorry to everyone whom doesn't read this ahead of time. xoxoxoxo
Emptying of the Bowel	stlman, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	25-34	12/29/2010 6:19:03 PM	My expectations were mixed for this drug after reading all the online comments about patients becoming sick and/or other reactions.  This is the first time Ive gone for a colonoscopy, I am a 34 year old male that weighs around 195 lbs.  My doctor wanted one done due to family history.  I have no known health issues.  I took the first 20 pills with very little reaction, my stomach started to rumble a little and make noises almost like I was hungry.  I made sure that I had lots to drink (Gatorade &amp; water) before, during and after the pill sequence.  I dont think I ever put down my jug of water while taking the first 20 sequence.  About 70 minutes after the first set of pills I had to use the bathroom 3 times in 20 minutes but it was not too bad.  Again my stomach kept making noises but no real pain.  I think all the water I drank was making me feel a little bloated but that was it, no other side effects.  After taking the second set of 12 the bathroom visits really started in.   I probably had to go every 5-10 minutes for an hour straight.  I kept drinking water but it seemed to go straight through on the trips to the bathroom. Again at this time I felt none of the symptoms described by others, mostly just kind of a &quot;blah&quot; feeling if that makes sense.  For all I know it could have been the fasting that made me feel this way.  My appointment was for 1:30 the next afternoon so I took my pills at 5 and 9pm, I was able to sleep from midnight until 6:30am with no trips to the bathroom.  I had to make 2 trips the next morning but that was it.  So compared to others I thought the pills were great, again its a little hard to tell whats worse the fasting or overall prepping.  After the procedure I experienced no adverse effects from the pills and felt 100% back to normal the following day.  I did not give 5 stars on the last two categories simply because this was my first colonoscopy and I have no other baseline to compare against.  
Emptying of the Bowel	Holla, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	65-74	10/3/2010 11:59:48 AM	First, I am asthmatic so when prescribed this prep, I was concerned about the &quot;drying&quot; affect of the sodium contained in this product. When I mentioned this to my Gastro doc, I was told, &quot;No problem.&quot;Welll, problem!!! I could only take 28 of the 32 pills prescribed bcause they were sooo strong and made be sick; they did work, but continued to work for 12 hours AFTER  the colonsoscopy.The worst part, my lungs and body were so dried out that I ended up in  the hospital with an acute asthma attack and was in there for 2 1/2 days. I am just now getting back on my feet, physically. Even tho I drank more than enough liquids, I got very sick, and won't ever take this prep, again. It was scary! Be very diligent when thinking of using this prep.
Emptying of the Bowel	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/28/2010 9:27:04 PM	After having much trouble choking down the liquid prep with my first colonoscopy, I requested the osmoprep pills this time around. The pills were not any larger than a multivitamin and while they had a salty taste it was not that bad. My doctor had me take 2 dulcolax tabs at 1pm and 2 more at 3pm. I started the osmoprep at 4:30 (4 tabs every 15 minutes). I drank gatorade with each dose. They started having an effect at 7:30. I took the last 3 doses starting at 8:30. Other than the expected diarrhea, there were no other side effects. I slept from 12:30 until 7am. There were a couple of loose stools in the AM but this resolved before I had to leave for my appt. Absolutely no problems during or after the prep - other than the cost I highly recommend osmoprep!
Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/30/2010 11:02:38 PM	Pills were easy to swallow and I had no side effects.  I drank Gatorade before during and after the total prep.  The pills started to take effect one hour after the first round of 20 pills.  I would highly recommend this prep, but be sure to drink Gatorade and have salty soup.
Emptying of the Bowel	MES, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	8/4/2010 9:57:56 PM	For my second colonoscopy, I opted to try OsmoPrep vs. the mag citrate and Fleet's enema prep I'd done previously. What a mistake. Although I found taking the product very easy and had minimal cramping the night before the procedure, it did not clear my bowel sufficiently to allow a thorough visualization of the bowel (the thing you *don't* want to hear, besides &quot;there's something wrong,&quot; when you awaken. Be aware that if you take any medications that slow the bowel or any problems with constipation, etc., this prep is *not* for you. Now I have to repeat the colonoscopy in 6-12 months. Additionally, my blood pressure soared overnight (prior to taking the second dose), and I'm now experiencing bloating and cramping that I have not had after previous prep. I am 50 years old, 122 lbs., and took 32 tablets (split 20/12) in addition to mag citrate before the pills. For your own peace of mind and for a successful procedure, question your doctor carefully about the approriateness of this prep before you use this method.
Emptying of the Bowel	honeybee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	7/30/2010 10:15:40 PM	I was very nervous about using this prep after reading the warnings and these reviews.  But my experience was good overall.  The pills worked just like they were supposed to with minimal side effects.  They are large and hard to swallow, but this may help force you to drink plenty of fluids, as I had to try 3 or 4 times to get each one down.  Started the first round of pills at 2 PM, with the second round at 6 PM.  Had about 10 bowel movements total with the last one about 10 PM so that I could have gotten a good night's sleep.  However, I couldn't sleep hardly at all - felt very light-headed, queasy, disoriented, and alternated between too hot and too cold.  I think these effects could have been from not eating and my menopause as much as from the pills.  Had a couple more bowel movements the next morning and the colonoscopy went fine.  No after-effects.  I think the keys to making this successful are:  follow directions, drink more than they recommend, and read the contraindications and don't take it if you have any underlying health problems with kidneys, liver, or heart.  It also helps to do activities during the prep to take your mind off what is happening, as anxiety can make it worse.  I played the piano and watched funny movies to relax.

Emptying of the Bowel	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	2	1	Female	55-64	3/15/2010 10:44:28 AM	At first this treatment seemed easier, but did result in nausea at the end and difficulty finishing.  The day after my procedure I exprienced severe nausea and diarrhea.  When I called my Dr. I was told I had the flu.  Shame on her for not being familiar with possible prolonged side effects.  I would not use this product again,and hope there is an alternative product, better than anything currently available, soon.
Emptying of the Bowel	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	2/11/2010 10:23:36 AM	I was given 32 pills to take as preparation for laparoscopy. I have had 2 colonoscopies before and was excited that I didn't have to drink the nasty liquid this time. I would totally recommend the pills over the liquid any day! I had to take 16 pills between 2 and 3 pm and then the other 16 pills between 8 and 9 pm. It was so easy. They don't taste horrible but I would recommend taking them with something flavored. They do have a little odd taste to them. I took them with white grapefruit juice and did fine. The pills started working for me within 10 minutes. It completely cleaned me out. I did continue going to the bathroom an hour before surgery the next morning, but overall it worked well. This is so much better than the liquid junk!

Other	alicek, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	12/2/2009 12:35:06 PM	This was my first colonoscopy and my last. The pills were easy to take. The first 20 didn't start working for two and a half hours. I didn't want to take the last 12 but I did. I was running to the toilet all night. In the morning I felt sick to my stomach. Had a headache. I was hyperventilating and I think I was dehydrated. I felt so bad but went through with the procedure. The rest of the day I was still running to the toilet and the next day I still felt bad. Everything was normal...thank g-d...but you can be sure I will never do this again. 
Emptying of the Bowel	jangels, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	10/5/2009 7:11:11 PM	This medicine made me extremely dizzy, nauseous, fighting to not vomit, horrible feeling with headache.  I drank the golitely at my last procedure and it was by far worse than these pills, but I don't think they have this process down as user friendly yet.  When they remedy the nasty side effects and not having to drink until you vomit, then maybe they have a wonder drug on their hands.  They fell short in my opinion
Emptying of the Bowel	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	19-24	9/17/2009 3:58:22 PM	I was quite scared going into this entire process. I'd never done this before and all the stories I've heard of how bad the prep can be freaked me out. Honestly, It wasn't that bad at all. It worked extremely quickly for me and I didn't even need to take all the pills before I was... cleaned out. It was relatively painless and while not entirely pleasent I would say it was worth the cost for the result.Just as a note, I'm 22, 145 lbs.
Emptying of the Bowel	waabb, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	55-64	9/3/2009 5:58:55 PM	I decided to take the pills as an alternative to drinking the large,horrible drink preceding a colonoscopy. Although I would agree that the pills were highly effective and easy to use, I found the side effects not worth using it. I have been nauseous, have very little appetite and severe stomach pains after several days of taking the pills. I would NEVER take them again. I would opt for a combination of pills &amp; liquid in the future, if I ever decide to have the test done again. It's unfortunate that the test isn't the problem-it's the prep that makes it so unpleasant. It's no wonder people dread having colonoscopies done!
Emptying of the Bowel	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	35-44	7/7/2009 12:28:13 AM	Although the use of the osmoprep was simple, the side effects quickly took away any of the positive points.  I immediately started vomiting after the first course of pills and developed a rash on both sides of my face as well as inflammation of the facial area.  The worse part was that even five days later I was still experiencing very painful stomach cramps and still having very fluid diarrhea.  I haven't been able to fully rest after my procedure due to constantly having to go to the bathroom after I've eaten or because of the pain. As much as I hate the liquid alternative, I refuse to use osmoprep again.

I have experience with the all the other vile tasting prescription cleansing products and By far, Osmoprep Oral is the easiest, most effective, and least unpleasant of them all.  It is a tablet so there is no taste at all. I had no side effects with it. It makes the prep process a nonevent.  It's wonderful.

This made what used to be an unpleasant experience into a minor inconvenience. I will demand these pills again, and I won't delay or dread it again.

Need a lot of fluid.  Very effective and verified by the doctor.  No doubt this was much easier than the usual methods used for test preparation.  Those being the &quot;drinking&quot; cleansers that are used most frequently.Would use it again if needed.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	1/21/2009 9:43:57 PM	Tomorrow will be my 3rd colonoscopy and I was very happy not to have to drink that foul tasting liquid.  After taking 20 of the pills tonight, I felt very nausous and started vomitting  and my face looks to be swollen.  The directions for use from the doctor's office were 20 pills starting @ 5p.m. and the other 12 starting @ 9 p.m. tonight.  Took the next 4 tablets and started vomitting within 10 minutes and am now feeling somewhat lightheaded. I'm going to call the gastroenterologist's office in the morning to see if we should go ahead with the test. I am not planning on taking the remaining 8 tablets.  Although I did not receive any information as to possible side effects from the doctor, I also did not read the pamphlet given with the prescription.  I STRONGLY SUGGEST DISCUSSING THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE TAKING THIS MEDICATION!!
Emptying of the Bowel	MaryJane, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	55-64	12/5/2008 2:18:03 PM	The Osmoprep medication is expensive. The actual price was $75 dollars. And because of my insurance I paid 25 dollars. The price is outrageous!The recommended dossage: 20 Osmoprep tablets(4 tablets every 15 minutes for an hour) and then 6 hours later taking another 12 tablets in 15-minute increments for 45 minutes. This whole process seemed excessive. Started the process on the day before the procedure at 3 pm and ended around 12 midnight.. halfway through the process, I experienced an extremely painful burning sensation every time I went to the bathroom, which I attribute to the osmoprep medication. In contrast, the last time I used a Fleet product at a cost of about 5 dollars. All I had to do was mix the appropropriate amount of Fleet with a glass of water.. and then repeat about 5 hours later... done. In both cases, I did drink about 1.5 gallons of ice tea to stay hydrated, starting in the morning of the day before the procedure. This is very important .. and ice tea tastes better than water or any other prep concoction.I did speak with my physician about the Osmopre experience and I will not use this product again for the above mentioned reasons.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	12/1/2008 12:56:02 AM	I took Osmoprep as directed. Tonight my hands and feet are numb as is the right side of my face. I am very dizzy,have dry mouth and throat,bloated,and have a headache. If this is what is involved with the prep I will never have another proceedure done!

Emptying of the Bowel	tommi, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	11/7/2008 12:21:04 AM	I have had several colonoscopies over the course of 16 years. I have tried most of the preps offered. My most recent procedure I used OsmoPrep, only because I read about it online. I had to ask my doctor for it and he didn't want to give it to me. I insisted and he finally agreed.Compared to drinking all the really gross stuff, this was a breeze. I will be using it again for my next colonoscopy.Make sure to drink alot more than the directions tell you.

Emptying of the Bowel	Jan, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	10/18/2008 1:25:24 PM	I had undiagnosed hypthyroidism at the time I was perscribed OsmoPrep for a colonoscopy.  I had a very bad reaction after the first dose of pills and ended up in Intensive Care for 2 days, which is when I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.  If you have any kind of medical condition or if a particular condition runs in your family (my dad has hypothroidism), read up on this medication before you take it.  (People with hypothroidism should not take this medication.)  It's been almost a year and I can't put off doing the test much longer.  I'm going with the liquid only so hopefully all will go well.  
Emptying of the Bowel	jerseygirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	10/8/2008 7:54:50 PM	I was prescribed this medication for my first colonoscopy. Had no idea what to expect but felt lucky I didn't have to drink the liquid after hearing about it from others. Instructions were to consume 32 pills; 20 within one hour (4 pills every 15 minutes)the night before the procedure and 12 pills 5 hours prior to the procedure. Started the pills at 7:00 p.m. the night before. Had no problem getting them down with a cold 8oz glass of water using a straw each time. Got a horrible headache almost immediately and felt nauseous but did not get sick. Had a few bouts of diarrhea about 45 minutes after the first dose but was able to sleep from 9:00 - 11:30 p.m. After that, I didn't sleep all night, running to the bathroom almost constantly. Consumed the last 12 pills starting at 3:00 a.m. Had to be at the SurgiCenter at 7:30 a.m. and was still running to the bathroom once I got there. Lots of intense cramping all the way through the process. Not a pleasant experience at all. Received an &quot;Excellent&quot; rating from the Dr. on my prep work so the pills definitely did the job. I am still cramping the day after the procedure and have had a few loose BM's. I am only able to eat very small amounts; my stomach isn't quite back to normal.

Emptying of the Bowel	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	65-74	8/1/2008 9:55:47 AM	For my 3rd colonoscopy, I chose Osmoprep so I could just drink water or tea instead of that great quantity of one, rather sweet liquid.  After the firt round of 5 doses, I was naseous, headachy, and miserable.  The fact the I vomited just before time to start the final round was the only thing that enabled me to finish. Felt OK in the morning and test was uneventful.  Another round of nausea hit last night after walking from bedroom to kitchen.  OK on waking the morning after, but still am a little off-balance.  Won't repeat this one. FYI: weight 130, age 67.
Emptying of the Bowel	MaggieP, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	6/2/2008 10:19:02 PM	Even though I had a hard time taking all the pills, I would still choose this method over the liquid drink. The pills are large and I had to throw up after taking 20 of them; my body just rejected them. I read that vomitting was one of the side effects, so I decided to continue and take the remaining 12 pills.  Bottom line: they worked with very little discomfort and I was happy with the process. I was able to get a good night's sleep.
Emptying of the Bowel	Vicki L, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	55-64	5/5/2008 7:56:09 PM	The drug definitely did its job and was far better than drinking excessive amounts of disgusting liquid.  However, it is now 5 days since my colonoscopy and my mouth still tastes like I am sucking on salt.  I did not read this in any of the listed side effects and may call the Dr to see if there is something to be done.
Emptying of the Bowel	drug rep, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	4/27/2008 11:36:54 AM	This was my 4th colonoscopy. Swallowing 32 large OsmoPrep pills is far better than drinking the seemingly never ending amount of nauseating, enormously offensive tasting liquid. 5 Stars for Ease of Use.It was a more gentle emptying of the bowel than the liquid. Although it took 3 1/2 hours to begin when it was supposed to begin in 1 hour. The colonoscopy successfully took place but I think the liquid did a more through job. Effectiveness 4 Stars.While I am overwhemingly satisified not to have to drink the liquid, it has been 2 days since the procedure and I am still experiencing cramping after eating. That has not ever happened with the liquid. If this side effect had not happened (I am not sure when it will end) I would be vastly satisfied with this drug. Satistaction 3 stars.

This drug came with NO Warnings to indicate that I should not take it.  I read all information supplied to me prior to taking it.  After I was admitted to the hospital (for a 2 week stay),  it only took 5 minutes of research to find a report from the Mayo Clinic that urges doctors NOT TO ADMINISTER TO LIVER PATIENTS.The result??????   ACUTE KIDNEY FAILURE.That was May 24, 2007.  As of today, Feb. 22, 2008, I have tremors,  volitale blood pressure, suicidal itch, weight loss, Numerous diet restrictions.  My MELD score was a 6 before OSMOPREP.  Today, 9 months later it is 19.I had used Go-Lytely previously with no adverse effects.  This drug has changed my life forever.
Emptying of the Bowel	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	45-54	2/11/2008 5:54:09 AM	Osmo Prep is suppose to be a kinder and gentler prep than sodium citrate and enemas.  For me it was not.  Four pills every 15 minutes times 5 was not easy.  The following &quot;emptying of the bowels&quot; the night before was anything but gentle.  Then to repeat it the morning of the procedure was horrible.  I had headaches, light headiness, and ready to throw up the pills during the second round.  Osmo Prep must be better for the drs., it was not gentler on the patient.
Emptying of the Bowel	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	25-34	2/1/2008 8:48:25 AM	I weigh 125lbs, and I got away with taking only 16 out of the 32 pills. I think the pills were horrible and it was really tough to have to sit there ant take them every 15 minutes. It is great to be nauseous, starving, tired and weak, and have to chuck down pills every 15 minutes...JUNK!!
