Uric Acid Kidney Stones	Newmoon, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	55-64	9/10/2011 10:40:54 AM	Previously I was passing kidney stones weekly with increasing difficulty &amp; ER visits. I've taken PC for 5 months now and stones completely subsided since the second month.  I do experience some stomach upset and loose bowel symptoms which respond reasonably well to adjustments in diet. However, I've also experienced a sudden unexplained weight gain during this same time period which I suspect may be related to the PC. It's been highly effective for me in preventing the recurrence of kidney stones.

Uric Acid Kidney Stones	PeterPeterPE, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		5/10/2009 10:27:35 PM	I could NOT swallow these huge pills,so I broke them into pieces, even tho the pharmacist said it wasn't a good idea. Why don't they make smaller pills!  I wasn't warned of possible weakness and irregular heartbeat. After two weeks my cardiologist discovered, via lab tests, that I had a very high potassium level...the kidneys were not getting rid of it, and I had to go to the ER and take an antidote.  For 2 weeks I had felt so weak.  Two days after taking the antidote, and stopping the pills, I felt MUCH better, and my pulse settled down to normal.

Uric Acid Kidney Stones	martee, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	6/7/2008 6:01:25 PM	I started taking (3) 10mEq a day, 10 days after taking I noticed numbness and tingling in my toes and fingers along with rapid heart beat. Went to ER and tests were normal and ER Dr. said it was probably my caffeine intake!! Sorry do not drink coffee, haven't drinken soda since June 2007 when I 1st passed a kidney stone. Had my Dr. lower my dosage to (2) a day, seemed to be going well for 4 months now and I just noticed swelling in my fingers, only because my rings were so tight my ring finger was actually red and not getting circulation! Had more blood tests, showing everything is fine, which isn't ok with me, took myself off the Pot. Citrate and noticed after 1 week my rings can fit again. Not at all happy with taking this med, and will now see what other alternatives I have from my kidney stone doctor.
