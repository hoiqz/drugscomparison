Overweight	MsJoose330, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	4	Female	25-34	7/26/2012 11:40:44 PM	I am a 31 year old mother of three. My youngest is 5 and I have struggled with being chubby, lol not fat just a little extra thick in some places all my life. I have really been struggling to get back to my pre- motherhood weight of about 175.I have really been  down in the dumps with my weight for the last 5 years. 200+ I don't exercise much because I want fast results and I get easily discouraged. Last year I lost 13 lbs in 1 month while taking Adipex.But I blew it after just 3 weeks. I shared my Rx with all my friends who, couldn't find doctors to prescribe them any.... I know this is bad but hey, they wanted to try. Morale being I ran out fast and eventually regained the weight. I have never been a small girl always average 12 or 14. 16 when I'm really fat. This past January 2012 I started Adipex again, I used it off and on when I remembered to take it and went from 218 to about 204. After 2 months the Pharmacy seemed to have thought I had used my three months, which is all you can have then you have to be off for three months. But I still managed to maintain a weight from 203 to 198. So July 8, 2012 I filled my first Rx. I used them for 6 and dropped down to 187. Last week my friend asked me to try some samples of Hydroxy Cut and another I cant remember, so I didnt take my Adipex for about 5 or 6 days:-( My weight as of this past monday was 195. Yea WOW!! So I have been taking Adipex again since monday I am down to 190:-) today is day 4!!! I am not going to stop until my full thirty day supply is finshed  I have 21 left my goal is to be at 179 by the time they are gone. I will still have two more Rx's.My goal by them end of the 3 month supply is 160. wish me luck I will update. 
Overweight	finallyasize4, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	7/21/2012 2:00:23 PM	I began taking this medication on March 22, 2012.  I have been weening myself off of it for the last 3.5 weeks and am now taking only 1/2 pill once a week.  My goal was 30lbs - I lost 40!  I started at 169/Size 12, and I am now at 129/size 4.  This medication works, but remember it is up to you to continue an exercise program and healthy diet...otherwise, you will gain it back. Just please eat!!!  It will be tempting to not eat the first couple of weeks, but you must eat at least 1200 calories a day or you will feel sick and weak.  Along with 5 days a week of 45 minutes of exercise, and you should have no problems losing weight and feeling awesome!  Good luck!

I am now at 247 (29) pounds down! The dry mouth and insomnia are the only side effects. This month I haven't had time to do my work outs but I am starting them today. So I am hopeful that I will get to my goal of 160 by years end.

Overweight	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female		7/9/2012 6:47:25 PM	First and Foremost--apipex DOES help decrease appetite and suppress cravings. However, if you are one to become easily tolerant to medications, taking it a second round may not work. The ONLY thing that has made me abandon this medication after a hiatus, is the fact that, in my case, it caused SEVERE acne breakouts. I am not sure if it is because it acted as an accelerator metabolic wise, or if it is something that just affected me. Either way, when I began taking this medication again, the acne returned full force. I can say that in certain people, maybe this is rare, it DOES cause acne. In my case it began with skin peeling and increased sebum (thicker and heavier than normal). From this I have deduced that adipex does cause acne for some people; unfortunately I am one of them. This time, I stopped taking the medication and 3 days later my skin was clear again. I began taking it after my face was clear, and the exact same thing happened, beginning with the peeling. So, if you can tolerate the acne and the medicine is working for you, that's wonderful. Unfortunately, not only did it cause acne, but my tolerance to this medication kicked in immediately i.e. no weight loss at all. I've stopped the medication and have just used will power. The weight loss is slow, but hopefully, I can rid myself of the pregnancy weight without medication... Personally, the acne was too much for me.

Just started back on 1/2 a pill once a day in the morning 3 days ago have lost 3 lbs but initially experienced some slight dizziness, which has gone away and now am experiencing mild to moderate stomach cramps and loose stools which I did not experience the first time I took the drug last year.

Overweight	65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	65-74	6/28/2012 1:21:55 PM	This medication caused nausea, profuse sweating, insomnia, decrease in urination and the feeling that I was going to pass out.  I certainly lost weight while on the drug.  I was to ill too eat! I stopped taking the medication after 4 days and will never take it again.
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/27/2012 5:43:26 AM	I took adipex  (1/2 a pill) for 4weeks. I started at 178lbs after 6days I wad 166! Sadly, in the following 3 weeks I only lost 3more lbs. At the 4week check up I weighed 163lbs. The pill totally worked but it potency..or rather your body adjusts to it quickly. Ask you don't lose that first week you probably won't lose.

I have been on Adipex for 2 months now, and I am down 12 lbs, but I am not losing any more currently. Also, I find that it is nolonger supressing my appetite like before. I am hungry more often.

Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/14/2012 10:08:50 PM	My fiance and I have been tryin to have a baby for a little while now. Both of us are fine. So my doctor and I decided that maybe it was because I was a little over weight? Well the first time I took it I got the jitters. Since then no jitters can't even tell I took it. Have to make my self eat cause I don't really have the feeling of wanting food. Currently I just began my second month. The first month I lost about 17 lbs =) I started at 262 I believe. I would like to get to at least 200 if not lower. Side affects would just be dry mouth and if I don't make myself eat I get sick to my stomach.

As of today,  I have lost 33lbs- down to 136!  This has been a great boost, but it is up to you after you complete the medication to change your lifestyle- otherwise, all the weight will come back.  You can do it- just be prepared to change your eating habits for GOOD!

I stopped taking it and got severely depressed. I would not suggest abruptly stopping this med, allow your Dr. to gradually take you off. I'm going to try it again, have been on it for 5 days now and already feel better. It causes dry mouth, drink plenty of water, it also curbs your appetite, I have to remind myself with my cell phone alarm every 3 hrs to eat a small healthy snack or I'd forget to eat. It caused diarrhea the 1st few days but it's better now and I sweat a lot. I take it very early in the am 6:30 because it makes it difficult to go to sleep at bedtime.

It helps curb cravings really well- I have not had any chocolate or sodas since I began.  It is important to remember to eat though- if you do not eat at least 1000 calories a day, you will feel weak.  I worked before, so exercise hasn't changed....got 15 lbs left to lose!Hope to only have to take 2 1/2 months...

It has been almost 4 full months since the last time i took adipex i now weigh 240lbs down from 330lbs.  The pill works but you have to make some changes as well.  Dont expect it to do everything.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	3/1/2012 1:02:45 PM	I have been taking Adipex on and off since October.  The first month I lost 18 pounds.  In November I lost 7 pounds.  They took me off of it in December.  When I went back in January I had not lost, but I had maintained my weight.  They gave me a new Rx.  I went back in February and had only lost 3 Pounds.  I have lost a total of 28 pounds and cannot seem to lose anymore.  I do not understand.  I want to lose at least another 28 pounds, but now it only seems to help me maintain my weight instead of get rid of it.  Has anyone else had this problem?
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/24/2012 12:11:42 AM	I started Adipex P in June 2011. I weighed 283lbs. I am now at 235. From a size 22/24/3X, now in XL/1X, 14/16-18/20 depending on the clothes.I have had excellent results, but I also have tried to watch my calories and exercise.The only side effect I have experienced is constipation. You may lose some weight at first without changing your lifestyle much. If you think you can continue bad habits and the pill will magically help you lose weight, think again. It amazes me when ppl say once they stopped the pill they gained all their weight back.Stopping the pill does not make you gain weight, reverting to bad habits and eating to many calories and not being active makes you gain the weight back.As with most &quot;diets&quot;/weight loss, things have slowed down for me. I lost 16.3 lbs the first month, 10 lbs the 2nd, 8 lbs the 3rd, 5 lbs the 4th, 5 lbs the 5th which was in November. Since November I've only lost 8 lbs, but I have not gained. I have noticed that the last month or so it does not suppress my appetite as much as it used to, so perhaps the body does build a tolerance to it with long term use.

I am a 5'5&quot; female, age 35.  I have lost only 4 lbs in two weeks.  I still feel hungry ALL THE TIME.  When I do eat, however, I cannot eat a whole lot.  By evening, I am STARVING, and that is when my bad decisions are usually made!  I do hard core boot camps twice a week, but unfortunately not much more than that excercise-wise.  I go to my first follow up appt. tomorrow and will see what the doctor says.  I do have dry mouth, so consequently have been drinking more water.  No other side effects.  
Overweight	AdamHo, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	2/9/2012 2:01:41 PM	I started taking adipex-p jan 9, 2012, At that point I was 309 lbs. First 3 or 4 days I felt I was on straight speed but it was not a bad feeling but it definately changed my sleep habits but that subsided after a week. I was not hungry but I stay on a diet of 1500 calories or less which for a man my size, 6'4, 309 and a verymuscular build that did not seem like alot of calories but i was not hungry, I was satisfied after every meal. Today is exactly 1 month after I started taking Adipex-P. I am 28 lbs lighter, my blood pressure is normal, I feel great so far. I go ack to the Dr. Monday and am going to get 1 more month supply and I am going to get off of it and maintain on my own. I am going for another 25 or 30 lb decrease then I will have achieved my goal. At 240lbs I am actually in great shape. Would I recommend this medication? You bet I would. It is a life saver. I did experience dry mouth as well. Almost every day but that was no problem. Best advice when taking this is to drink alot of water daily, take adipex on an empty stomach since it is an appetite supressant then eat a half hour later. Dont go without eating even though you are not hungtry. You can cause alot of other problems. If you are drug tested it does come up as an amphetimine but the values are so low the MRO will ask you about it so just have the prescription bottle handy and that should clear it up unless you are abusing it then you will fail the drug screen.

Overweight	increased energy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/5/2012 8:38:45 AM	I have been on adipex for three weeks and lost 14 lbs.  I experienced dry mouth - but like to drink water and need to increase my intake, so I do not mind.  I have a ton of energy and no other side effects.  I have always eaten healthy, for the most part, my biggest problem was portion control and snacking between meals.  Even healthy food and snacks can make you gain weight if you are taking in too many calories per day.  My craving for snacks has gone away.  I eat less of a portion per meal and do not think about food the way I used to.  I do have a fear of how it's going to be when I stop this medication.  I hope my appetite stays the way it is and I am not hungry constantly again.  After I complete this 1st month, I am going to try taking it every other day (Dr. said that is OK) to see how I do.

Overweight	mnv, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/17/2012 11:30:09 PM	I took this about 2 years ago weighting 187 and got down to 142 pounds. After I stopped taking this, I gained all of my weight back. I just started taking it again and went from 187 to 168 since November 2011. I think that this pill really does work but you also have to set your mind to wanting to lose weight, and also know that if you stop taking it, you still have to eat right or you will definitely gain all of your weight back like I did the first time. Also, the side effects that I've had are dry mouth and I used to be really sleepy all the time when I first starting taking them with no energy but that wore off. All in all, I would definitely recommend to someone wanting to lose weight!
Overweight	SlowNEasy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/15/2012 8:25:55 AM	I am a 35 year old African-American female and I have been on Adipex consistently since Oct 2010. I have not seen anyone who has been on it as long as I have to date. I started at over 330lbs and I am now at 266lbs. I tried everything and nothing seemed to work for me until I started using Adipex. I take 1/2 pill (of the 37.5 dosage) every morning before breakfast. This has been the best weight loss solution I have used to date. I don't exercise as regularly as I should however, I maintain an average caloric intake (1500 calories) and I take vitamins/supplements. My weight loss has been slow but that's mostly my fault. I believe that Adipex has the potential to help many people if taken in moderation and under a doctor's supervision. Be smart, don't kill yourself to lose a few pounds. I know of people who used Adipex (full strength) even though it kept them up all night and gave them jitters. I experienced these symptoms when I took the pill full strength (that lasted two days and I was over it-I immediately had my doctor change the dose to 1/2 pill). Just break the pill in half and the difference is amazing. If you lose the weight slowly and consistently, you will be more likely to keep it off. I am satisfied with my progress even though I know I could be further along if I were more disciplined. However, for the first time in my life, I haven't put weight back on. I can actually throw out my &quot;really big girl&quot; clothes for good. I started at a size 26 and now I'm a 18/20. Make sure your doctor monitors your blood pressure, and does your EKG and blood work regularly as required with the use of this medicine. I'm living proof that this medicine works. I think that is why my doctor has allowed me to be on it so long. I also recommend you have an allergy test done to see if you are eating foods you are actually sensitive/allergic to. I did and learned that I am sensitive to pears! This really helped improve my body's function. Hang in there, you can do this!
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	1/6/2012 9:43:26 AM	My starting weight was 312 at 5'5.  I lost 30 lbs in 3 months.  I am almost done with th 4 months my Dr prescribed.  The only side effect I experience is constipation which was never a problem for me before. I would certainly reccomend Adipex-P but only when prescribed by your Dr.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/5/2012 2:52:14 PM	Started at 205, 5'4&quot; age 30 female. Experienced the traditional side effects of initial dry mouth, jitters, and sweating but also lost the interest of eating. All thoughts of eating (especially when bored) went away, found that most often when others were eating or even the smell of food no longer turned my hunger on and in some cases made me queasy. Next, my mental focus and energy sky rocketed and I was able to complete projects with more quality and determination than ever before. The pounds melted away with virtually little exercise. Lost 30 lbs. in the first three months and I cannot wait to lose the next 30 and am now including a workout regimen I'm doing at home with the Wii....
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	4	Female	35-44	12/28/2011 4:22:52 PM	I have been taking adipex since may, and I lost 30 pounds so far, the first 20 I lost the first month, after acouple of months I stopped loosing and was stuck at 30. I have been working out at the gym approx 3-4 times a week and I feel so much healthier, How ever I do still need to loose a lot more weight. I started at 260 lbs and really want to see the scale below the 200 mark. I took about 1 1/2 months off from taking this med and have just started it again about 3 weeks ago, I made it through Christmas with out gaining any weight and I didn't really watch what I was eating, so now I will start the gym again and try to loose another 30 lbs. The only real side effects I had was the excessive dry mouth, which made me drink lots of water. I do think this medication works but I also think you have to change your way of eating to maintain and keep loosing. good luck!!!

So far i have lost 12 pounds. It always gives me the energy i need &amp; it stops the hunger pains, some days i i dont even eat. But i was curious if anyone out there has experienced heartburn with it or women if you have been late on your period, i know im not pregnant as i have not had sex, and i go to the doctor monday for to see how iv been doing on it, if its causing side effects my doctor doesnt like then i will not remain on it, but i WANT to stay on it it is the only thing that has worked for me.

Overweight	Gail, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	11/22/2011 8:38:18 AM	I have been taking Adipex since 10/14/11 and have lost 18 pounds.  I did not get the burst of energy that most people get and I am still hungry.  It does not curb my appetite much at all.  I guess the reason I have lost as much as I have is that when I would look in the mirror I was disgusted at what I was seeing and had been told i was on the verge of being full blown diabetic.  I also live on a farm and have worked hard it all my life and it was becoming harder and harder to walk up and down the hills looking for the livestock without becoming so out of breath I would have to stop and rest.  When I want something to eat that I know I shouldnt eat I have been telling myself NO! I AM NOT EATING THAT! It did help, but is now getting harder to say no.  when i went back to the doctor for my monthly weigh in I tried to tell him about my appetite, but he thought it was funny since I had lost 15 pounds.  I tried to tell him I wasnt joking but he wouldnt listen.  Maybe when I go back on 12/7 he will listen since I really havent lost that much more so far.  But anyway, so far I have done pretty good with a little will power that im afraid im losing.
Overweight	ArmyMedic, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	11/21/2011 11:57:53 AM	I am a 23 year old female. I am in the army so I have to stay within strict weight guidelines. I never had a weight problem until after I had my daughter, then went to Iraq for 15 months. I got the Mirena IUD before I deployed so I wouldn't have to worry about periods and birth control pills. (That was the last thing I needed to worry about.) During my 15 months in Iraq I gained 30 lbs. I deployed at 58&quot; (height) and 115 lbs. I returned from Iraq 145 lbs. for someone my height in the army that is considered overweight. I do PT (exercise consisting of running, pushups and sit-ups) everyday and eat a healthy diet, but I wasn't losing weight. Everywhere I went in civilian attire people asked me if I was pregnant, and how far along I was. It really affecting my self esteem and my concentration at work. My supervisor was harassing me everyday at work about getting back within the weight standards, and even went so far as to call me fat and suggest chaptering me out of the military. I got tired of the harassment so I decided to take matters into my own hands and request Adipex from one of my providers, since I've heard so many positive results from it. I've been taking 37.5mg every morning at 8:00 for a week and have lost 5 lbs. I have constant dry mouth and a fluttery feeling in my chest. I have never had hypertension before or any other health problems besides asthma. I have no desire to eat anything all day, and when I force myself to eat, my food has an awful taste. So far I haven't experienced the burst of energy other patients have described. I have had insomnia at night though, and been late to formation twice. I'm looking forward to getting down to my ideal weight of 115lbs. 
Overweight	Bill, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	11/13/2011 7:12:48 PM	I began by breaking a 37.5 MG tab in half and took at 10 A.M. and 3:00 P.M. I had none of the possible side effects mentioned in class, but I still had to deal with being hungry in the evening hours. After my follow-up visit I was told to take a half tablet at 10 A.M. and a whole 37.5 MG tab around 3 P.M. This has worked wonderfully. I can actually work all day and faithfully keep to the 1500 calorie diet as prescribed by the maker of this drug. My firt month I lost 8 lbs and on track to do the same again this month.  My only concern I have is something I will discuss with my doctor on my next follow-up visit. I have what I call &quot;urinary hesitation.&quot; It takes me forever to get started and one night took 6 minutes to complete a trip to the bathroom. I understand being a 66 year old male it takes longer because of enlarged prostate, but I think this is something the doctor should know.
Overweight	JennifernAla, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/13/2011 3:27:55 PM	I have been on Adipex since April 1 and I have lost 56 pounds.  I have not taken it the whole time, I took the months of July and August off to see how I would do without it.  I started back in September to give me an edge because since I stopped taking it, I started crashing earlier.  I am now weaning myself off of it, only taking it 2 or 3 times a week to keep my body guessing.  I have been reading the reviews and I think that everyone thinks that it is supposed to be a miracle drug but it's NOT.  You have to change the way you live FOREVER not temporarily.  I have used the MyFitnessPal app and tracked my calories.  I have been walking 3 miles a day and now I am on Week 2 of Couch to 5k.  It is a lifestyle change.  If you want to lose weight, you need to clean out your cabinets first thing and get rid of all the junk.  Start eating fruits and vegetables.  If you stop buying the junk and bringing it in your house, you will be less tempted to stray. Another piece of advice is to plan our day's meals ahead of time.  It makes it easier to keep on course.  Good luck to you all.  Remember that you didn't gain the weight in just a month or so, so don't feel like you failed by not losing it all in a month. 
Overweight	SwytDiva, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/13/2011 1:19:08 PM	I started taking Adipex on 10/11/11, I work our every week day (zumba, taebo and the firm). I started at 268lbs and am currently 252lbs as of today.  The first week I was still hungry, but the 2nd week I had 2 force myself 2 eat the 1200cals required per day.  To work with my afternoon hunger I always have a protein snack eg. Greek yoghurt.  I have to relearn how to eat the highest value of food to stay within the calories that I have allocated for the day. I follow the webmd weightloss program and it is godsend.  I started at a size 22 and I am currently fitting into size 18 in about 5 weeks...love it. I am trying to change my diet completely so that when I have to stop taking the med I am prepared.

It did not give me that burst of energy that I was expecting and i still feel hungry often.  I had to go off of it for a week because I had an illness and had to take prednisone for 6 days.  They did not want want me to take them together due to blood pressure concerns.  I went back to the doctor to weigh in yesterday, 11/9/2011 and had lost 16 pounds, so something is working. 
Overweight	jessica8980, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/7/2011 5:35:27 PM	I am a 28 year old female, and I started taking this on September 30, 2011. My starting weight was 307 lbs, and in the almost 6 weeks I've been on it, I've lost right around 20 lbs, and can definitely tell a difference in how my clothes fit. I have been walking 30 minutes a day, except recently, a sinus infection/URI has me down. My doctor told me to make sure I still eat, because it speeds your metabolism and needs the food to fuel it. I don't have the curbed appetite, but I do eat less per meal, snacking on fruits and veggies between my meals. I don't have the bursts of energy either, but I am motivated after seeing results to keep at it. I'm going to be getting an elliptical trainer in a couple weeks to maximize the pill/diet/exercise combo to get the most out of it while I can. I'm not sure how long my doctor will keep me on this, I'm sure I've got 2-3 months left, and hopefully by then my eating and exercise habits will be in full swing to continue the road to a healthier me. I drink a lot of water anyway, but when I don't this reminds me to drink more. If I don't get much sleep, I have a very disoriented feeling all day. I will post an update after my course of treatment is finished, but do far I will say I'm very pleased with my results!

However, the second week I didnt have the same energy but it still supressed my appetite, then i had bad side effects. I got really bad headaches, and while i was working out i felt like i couldnt breath and then almost passed out. i stoped taking it after that and as soon as i stopped i was starving... I was also using sparkpeople.com so i was eating right but i was way more hungry when i stoped taking them...
Overweight	LorieD, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	3	Female	45-54	11/3/2011 4:28:42 PM	I first began Adipex because being on anti-depressants, I was gaining weight (which only made me more derpressed!) and was already too close to obese. My sister had recommended it. Her first month on it she lost 20 lbs. My first week I lost almost 18 inches overall (I don't own a scale) I thoroughly enjoyed the energy... my house has NEVER been this clean! ;D I was also surprised to find out (through WEBMD) just how many calories are burned in just 30 minutes of serious house cleaning - 292.32 - that beats Bowflex! However, the next week, the energy wasn't there... it was also that TOM and I got a cold... and the inches came back. Now I'm in week three and I'm back where I started. I'm VERY unhappy about that, but I'm not giving up... I started Atkins and I'm still deep cleaning my house, so we'll see!

I have gained back 15 of the 50 lbs I originally lost, which does what?? Makes me depressed, that's what!  I kept increasing my intake of the drug to get the energy it USED to give me when I started. I do not have hypertension, thankfully, but will continue monitoring. I just want to be healthy. Get off your butt and do it on your own, being addicted to this pill is NO answer.  I might as well be out doing meth for goodness sakes.  I get headaches, have horrendous hip and back pain and I have read in some reviews that others have experienced this as well.  I hate the fact that I once again fell for the old &quot;miracle in a pill&quot; scam...the saddest thing is that a doctor gave me this prescription and I paid a LOT of money for my &quot;treatment&quot;.  If you want to try it, go ahead, but PLEASE do NOT use it for more than the recommended period of time!

I took my second pill this morning at 6am and it has not curbed my appetite at all.  I was so happy to get this medicine and thought it would be atremendouse help by curbing my appetite since I have very little will power to say no to food.  I am hoping it is just taking a few days to kick in.  Also, I have not had the burst of energy I heard other people say they had.  Has anyone else had this problem?

And so far, no side effects. I am really hoping that I have the same success as some of you! I am 5'8 and 182 pounds. My goal is to reach 160 but would ultimately LOVE to be at 150. I haven't really changed my eating habits because they were pretty good to begin with. I started getting the shot as my birth control and gained 12 pounds in 5 month's. I have since stopped getting the shot, have started Adipex and am working out 4 days a week doing cardio. I really, really hope this works!!!

Overweight	Debradog, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	9/9/2011 9:25:10 PM	I started taking Adipex on Sept. 1st and one week later I've gained 2 lbs.  I also started Robert Ferguson's Food for Life program at the same time, thinking this would really kick start my weight loss.  I'm still in shock.  I've written down every thing i've put in my mouth this last week and keeping my intake at 1,000 cal a day, with mild excersize like walking and stationary bike riding.  I just don't get it, is this in any way normal?

Overweight	soldierminutes, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	9/9/2011 1:57:49 AM	I am one of those people who really enjoy working out. Prior to my daughter being born &amp; straight thru my pregnancy I worked out (yogo, swimming, cardio classes etc) Then, once I nestled down into motherhood &amp; my husband being so supprtive, I began packing on the pounds. I went from a size 6 to 12! Then, the day I went into GAP and comfortablly slide into a size 14, I knew for ME, that was enough! This year my daughter turned 6 years old &amp; I begged my doctor for something to give me a jump start back into working out again. After a series of tests, she prescribed this miracle working adipex to me &amp; after almost 3 months, I was back in my size 6s again and I have regained my joy of working out 5 days a week.  My side affects (yet staying in close contact with my doctor!) have been occasional tingling fingers, once or twice I felt the tip of my tongue feel numb. I usually sleep with earplugs so I hear my heart beating irregularly sometimes, and the worse part is sometimes I get really dizzy. So because this is my final month of taking it, I've started to only take it 3 days a week to ween myself off it. Because I realize one important factor in this entire quest of losing weight; I ONLY OVER eat because of stress/nerves and my stress/nerves are diminished with prayer, working out and making it priority to carve out alittle bit of the day for ME.     
Overweight	Kristen18, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/3/2011 8:06:06 PM	I took adipex for 6 months 2 years ago and lost over 40 pounds.  As of 3 days ago, I've gained back all but 7 pounds of what I lost.  I took it for granted.  I begged my doctor to let me go back on the pill for 3 months to jump start another weight loss.  Hopefully, this time for good!  He agreed to a month by month prescription.  To help my overall success, I have also rejoined Weight Watchers.  I have had success with it before.  I hope that the combination of the 2 together, will make it both easier to lose, and easier to maintain.Goos luck to everyone on their weight loss journey!

I lost my first 20 in the first month, and then I stopped loosing, I was not eating hardly anything, I work out 5 days a week, and I was very frustrated. I have now increased my calorie intake and I have started drinking a protein shake for breakfast and lunch because I do not eat at those times anymore. I then started to loose again and have lost another 10 pounds, I have gone from a size 22 to a 18, I have not seen a size 18 in about 9 years so this is very exciting, and I feel wonderful!!!
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	8/21/2011 11:11:18 AM	I've been using it for 3wks now. At first it worked great. Then recently it started making me very irritable in the evenings. I've lost 9lbs in the 3wks with eating good &amp; alot of cardio. I'm going to stop taking it and continue working out and eating healthy and see if that makes a difference in my moods. I also got very emotional &amp; depressed. Its nice to lose weight but I still want to be happy so its not for me.
Overweight	Anonymous, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	4	4	Female	35-44	8/15/2011 11:34:27 AM	I have been taking Adipex for 2 weeks now.  I have managed to lose 7 lbs which is amazing for me since it took me 9 mos of eating right and exercising to lose about 5 lbs prior to Adipex.  I was actually afraid to try a diet pill thinking that I would be spastic, have heart palpitations, insomnia, etc but I have only experienced the dry mouth and constipation...both are conditions that I can live with and manage.  I only take a half pill in the morning and a half pill in the afternoon.  I took a whole pill one time and felt way too jittery and my heart started racing. For those of you who have not appeared to lose weight, take the &quot;water&quot; pill/diuretic that your doctor prescribed.  Last week, I was disappointed that it appeared that I had only lost 0.2 lbs but I took my &quot;water&quot; pill and the next day I was down 2 lbs!  Women tend to retain lots of water especially during that TOM.  I have never posted a review before but I only gave this a shot because I read other people's reviews and it gave me the courage to try Adipex...this pill is literally changing my life for the better.  Like another poster said...&quot;what do you have to lose by giving it a try...except for weight&quot;.  
Overweight	mandapb27, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	8/14/2011 6:57:41 PM	I have been on adipex now for a week and I am doing a lowcarb diet with absolutely no fat meats, cheese, or eggs. I also exercise quite a bit and I work in construction where I am constantly keeping my heart rate high for atleast a few hours a day. I also drink 8 glasses of water a day. Needless to say I went in for a check up today and I LITERALLY have not lost a pound not even a few ounces! Maybe im doing something wrong because my step mom has lost 3 on adipex without diet or exercise. I wish I knew what to do but im lost.

Overweight	southern_belle, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	7/6/2011 2:15:16 PM	I was prescribed Adipex about 8 days ago. So far I have lost 10 pounds. My house has never been so clean and I feel great during the day. I have also found that jumping rope burns sooo many calories. I am 5'2&quot; and 173 pounds, my goal is 145-150. I hope I can continue the good work and keep losing. The major side effect for me is dry mouth! It is terrible, but it keeps me focused on drinking water because drinking cokes kinda makes it worse. Other than that I am fine! Don't be scared to try something you think will make your life better. I never imagined exercising 30 minutes a day but I have been and I feel great doing it.

I have 35 pills and am going to begin again tomorrow. plan to drink plenty of water a d walk  miles a day 5 time a week. when I started I was 209 went down to 198 in just 3 weeks. So i know it works, Motivating myself and I will hopefully soon be motivating you reading this;o)
Overweight	maredip, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/27/2011 1:06:17 PM	This medication had worked, but is not for everyone. Use it as directed, only for the time directed, and do not stop it suddenly. I am currently weaning myself off of it, and have cut my remaining pills in half,and when I have a few left I will quarter those. I constantly had hbp while on these pills. yes, I lost about 35 lbs in the 3 months on them and relearned how to properly eat, but the time to use them is over. I would not recommend this drug for most people out there, and I would strongly recommend very close montitoring of anyone who uses it. 
Overweight	happycustomer, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/25/2011 10:35:22 PM	I have been on Adipex-P for 3 days and I have lost 6 pounds already. I have a total of 91 more pounds to loose. The good thing about this pill, for me, is that it makes me pay attention to what and how much I am eating. I do get hungry but after I eat very little of the meal I am full and will have a bad stomach ache if I continue to eat. I will be on this until the end of September 2011 and I will put a final review. So far so good!

I have been doing aerobic exercise as well as weight training. I'm told the reason the number on the scale isn't falling as fast as I had hoped is because I am also building muscle (5 lb. of muscle takes up MUCH less space than 5 lb. of fat). I have lost almost 2&quot; from my waist and hips though! :-) My doctor says I can only take Adipex for 3 months so I plan to stick with it because it is helping me eat less and I like the energy it gives me. So far I have only experienced dry mouth, an occasional slight headache and dizziness, but that happens rarely.
Overweight	Big Daddy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	6/22/2011 3:19:21 PM	I was prescribed Adipex-P in order to lose weight.  I'm also diabetic and have high blood pressure.  I'm a male, 5'8&quot;, and my starting weight was 268lbs.  In the 4 months I've taken this pill, I've dropped 40lbs, 4 inches on my waist, and I feel better than ever!    I was skeptical, but when I lost 15 lbs in the first month, it was such a great motivator.  Not only did my weight go down, so did my blood sugar and blood pressure numbers.  Ive now added exercise, I used to have no time, but since I wasnt hungry for lunch, I started walking instead and now have progressed to running to help bring the weight down faster.  Now I want to try to run my first 5K before the end of the summer!  As I see my doctor monthly, the visits have more been about measurement and tweaking my regimen.  Primary goal is to get below 200.  Ultimate goal is to get to 180.  Weight loss is a struggle, but this drug is great at getting you jump started.  Remember though, it's all about you and your motivation.  You CAN gain weight on this drug so work with it and it will work for you.  Some cotton mouth and occasional head aches as side effect, but they're manageable.  Rest and lot of water will take care of that and you need it anyway!  I have to say that Adipex-P is a life saver, literally!  It jump started me, but now that change is in lifestyle, not diet.  I've even got my wife and son walking with me in the evenings!  Good luck on your journey and if you're on this pill, work with it, keep at it, stay motivated and use people like me as inspiration to get yourself to your goal.
Overweight	Evangelist , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/2/2011 4:59:09 PM	Start to take adipex May 15 2011 start weight 295lb. When first start side effects light headed, dry mouth, dizzness, etc. Some slowly went away. This drug does give you energy and make you less hungry. But with any drug is an temporary relief meaning its not a lifetime fix. You are the lifetime fix you have to combine excerise and eat right. I have a gym at home where I do some excerising. I have completing change my eating habits with Ms. Hsu cleaning plan. you can purchase book at Health store I love it because it give you recipes with meal plans you can follow. Stay bless and encourage in yourself any if you dont loss weight right away. Determination and force will take you there. Shalom

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	5/27/2011 11:54:01 AM	I started on 37.5 back on Feb. 27. I have lost over 30lbs but have worked physically hard exercising 5x a week. I have been just slightly jittery and have had dry mouth most of the time. A bit of insomnia also has happened. I am now at my healthy BMI and having to purchase new clothes to fit.I was very happy with the medication benefits. Lost my appetite at the beginning but seems to lose its punch later on. Seem to give me more energy too. You must learn to also control your eating behavior also, since you cannot use the drug indefinitely. In the end I am very happy with my results and am determined to keep my results now that my prescription has ended.

In December, I started eating a little better and working out.  I had weighed in at 234, now down to 208.  Have been at a standstill with my weight for about a month.

Overweight	hoosiergirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/19/2011 1:08:36 PM	I started taking Adipex on Feb. 4, 2011 and as of May 18, 2011 I have lost 26 lbs.  It's easy to take and I have no appetite.  I used to eat whenever I was bored, which happened often at night - right before bed.  Now, when I do decide to eat (several small snacks and one larger meal a day), I am satisfied with a very small portion.  I have lots of energy too.  The only side effect for me is not being able to wind down till almost 11pm every night.  And cotton mouth is a side effect, but hey, I needed to drink more water as part of my lifestyle change anyway.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking for that &quot;jump start&quot; to losing weight!

Overweight	Jill, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/18/2011 12:41:19 PM	I started Adipex Sunday May 7, 2011.  I started with just half a pill. I now take 3/4 of the pill, eventually I may take the whole pill.  I have lost 6 pounds as of today.  I have had some minor side effects.  I find I am a little jittery, but nothing major.  It has drastically cut my appetite especially for sweets, I can pass up any dessert put in front of me.  I find it hard to eat sometimes and when I do, I can't eat alot.  I hope to find a balance with food, I am only taking the meds for 2 months then I will get off.  I know if I don't start eating normal that the weight will just come back on.  My mom is also taking it and she has lost 5 pounds her first week too.

Overweight	sickofbeingafatty, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	5/15/2011 3:22:43 AM	I started taking this drug 3 weeks ago &amp; I'm down 19lbs already.  Started out at 261 &amp; I am 5'9&quot;.  I no longer crave or want sweets anymore.  No desire to eat them even when offered &amp; I could never turn them down before.  No longer have a diet soda addiction and even stopped drinking coffee.  Didn't even intend to stop drinking them but the taste changed for me (diet soda tastes chemically &amp; uber sweet) and now all I want to drink is lots &amp; lots of water.  My appetite is non-existent &amp; I actually have to force myself to eat something when I feel my blood sugar drop.  I haven't even started to work out yet.  I wake up early feeling refreshed, which I have never felt before being a grouchy morning person, but sometimes I do have trouble falling asleep.  I am having a problem with alternating constipation for 2 days then a day of diarrhea for 1 day after but that may be because I'm not eating nearly as much as I used to &amp; my body is probably getting used to it.  Would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the gastric problems.  I notice I have a ton more energy daily.  I actively seek out cleaning around the house.  I am just shocked that I no longer crave junk food &amp; the only things I will eat are healthy whole foods because everything else sounds &amp; tastes gross.  I used to LOVE fast food, carbs &amp; sweets.  Overall very pleased so far.
Overweight	Olga, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/6/2011 4:34:23 PM	I started 3 days ago, it feels very strange for me, I'm not hungry at all. I'm forcing myself to eat vegetables and lean meat, but become full really quick. I have absolutly no desire for sweets. It is such new feeling for me. Two month ago I bought 10 day weight loss package of prepaked low calories food from my gym: and I was always hungry, very weak and almost passed out in gym. I lost 3 lbs after 10 days and immediately got them back after was done. This time with the help of Adipex I hope I will have more success. So far it works great!

It has been one week today and I have lost 7lbs.  I'm so excited to see the weight loss.  I was already exercising and watching what I ate, but wasn't seeing any weight loss.  The first couple of days I did feel a bit on edge, but that has gone.  I do get dry mouth really bad at certain times.  That in itself makes you drink plenty of water and sugarfree gum or mints work well.  I feel like apidex does suppress my apetite well and I really have no cravings for breads sugars etc.  Hoping week two brings the same weight loss or better.  I will update next week.

I had energy to burn.  After a while, the effects wore off.  It did curb my appetite tremendously, but after a few days, it just quit working.  I was told by my doctor that I just build up an tolerance to them.  If you want to try them, good.  Not all people build tolerance to diet pills, prescription at that.  Good luck to you all.

Have been taking a little over two months now those symptons are gone. Sometime have trouble sleeping at night. But for the better part it works good. curves your appetite. When I do eat I get full fast. Cant eat as much as I used too.I also experience the dry mouth. If you need to lose weight I recommend these pills. You still need to make healthy food choices, and exercise to get the full benefits.

Overweight	AlmostThere, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/5/2011 3:05:43 PM	I am finshing my 3rd month on Adipex.  It has done wonders for my weight, my health, my shape and my self esteem.  I initially had a full physicial from my dr. and after my blood results came back fine we proceeded.  I also want to mention that first month prior to starting this I lost 10 lbs on my own my cutting out white flour and sugar.  Once I started the medication the first week I was wired and was constantly moving.  I had dry mouth as well, but outside of that no other symptoms or problems.  I started working out and monitoring my caloric intake as well and the first month I lost 15 lbs for a total of 25 lbs in 2 months.  The 2nd month I lost another 15 lbs for a total of 40 lbs in 3 months.  This is my final month and according to my scale I have lost another 11, but my weigh in with my dr. isn't till Friday the 8th, so we'll see.  I'm hoping to have broken the 50 lb. mark!  I agree Adipex is great, but it's more of a great took to help you loose weight and create a new lifestyle.  I've read/learned more about food and how it makes me feel over the past 3 months and also have learned to love going to the gym.  The energy from Adipex is NOTHING compared to the energy and personal accomplishment of having a good workout at the gym.  I truly feel that Adpiex has been a tool to learn how to eat and excerise properly and give me a jump start to a new life style.  I have another 25 lbs to loose before hitting my goal and I am confident with the new tools/skills I will be able to do that in the next 3 months without the help of Adipex.  Good luck to all and remember it's a tool to help, not a pill to fix!
Overweight	cheryl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	4/4/2011 8:16:23 PM	This medication has been very effective for me.  I feel less hungry the majority of the time, and if I do eat more than I should for some reason, I feel very sick to my stomach.  I have lost 17 lbs in 2 months, and am almost at my goal.  I was not obese, but after considerable research and talking with my doctor, we both decided that this would be a good &quot;jump start&quot; for me to start losing those extra lbs.  I do take a rather high dosage of a common SSRI, which is definitely something that needs to be considered and watched closely while on this medication.

I lost 9 pounds! I stopped taking them because mentally I wasn't ready to give up my unhealthy eating habits! I just had to have my cookies, candy bars, chips, etc. I know that they work but mentally you have be ready and just do what it takes to make them work for you! The pills gave me so much energy and I really was never hungry but I WANTED those unhealthy snacks. Tomorrow, I am going to start over! I have 3 weeks of pills left to take. I am tired of eating all the crap that I eat &amp; I'm tired of being obese! I will post my weight loss in 3 weeks!

That was over a year ago and I have kept the weight off with just the meal plan alone. This is a very productive diet and I truly suggest it to anyone, man or woman ,who has had trouble getting the weight off and KEEPING IT OFF!

I'm down to 160 in 11 days.  I haven't found many side effects except for a little bit of dry mouth.  It's been easy to not eat as much as I had been.  I found another odd side effect (wondering if anyone else has had this?) is that my compulsions to drink alcohol and shop also seem diminished to gone. Could this drug somehow work on the part of the brain controlling compulsive behavior?

I can no longer afford the medication as my insurer has raised their rates. I usually pay $28.50 for #30. I was fooled by an online company into buying another drug where the name was misspelled. Then they refused to refund my inflated price paid.

I am very happy with the results so, far. I have been dizzy, light headed, and have had a few headaches. I have learned it is important to eat protein to keep from having these side effects. I am hoping to only be on this medication for two months.
Overweight	icats73, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	1/27/2011 1:42:45 AM	I have been on this med since November 2010. I weighed in at about 248. By my last doc appt. on Jan 22, 2011 I weighed in at 214. Losing 34 pounds sounds good to me. However, this has been without any exercise routine. My doctor has recommended that I incorporate exercise while taking this. I am a stay at home Mom for now (looking for a job), and I have two boys - one in school and one still home with me. My days stay busy so I am constantly doing something. But I guess I need to go for some 1 hour walks with my little one. He's 5 so he should be able to handle it. I need to work quick though, my doc said he's probably going to take me off of this med for about 3-4 months and see how I do not being on it, which makes me a little nervous. I really feel better physically. I LOVE the way my jeans are looking on me and I really don't want to gain the weight that I have lost, back. So, I guess wish me luck. I've got 30 more days of this and they will probably take me off - eek. Good luck to everyone else who's on it.

Overweight	BCGLAM, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	1/21/2011 10:38:57 PM	I took this drug about a year ago and decided that taking the pill and eating whatever I wanted and no working out would be the answer - wrong. So, I started taking this pill again one week ago and I joined Weight Watchers .. I had my first weigh-in and with out any exercise but following the Weight Watcher's diet, I lost 5.2lbs in one week. I am going to incorporate exercise into my daily routine and I am confident that with a little push from this medication, a fairly strict [Weight Watchers is EXTREMELY flexible] diet and 30 minutes of exercise a day, I will drop more. I have experienced some insomnia, dry mouth and hot flashes .. But it is completely worth it.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	1/14/2011 2:43:24 AM	I started this medicine the first week September the doctor started me on half a 37.5mg pill in the morning and another half eight hours later. My starting weight was 290lbs. I have never been this big and I was truly disgusted with myself. I had so much energy for the first month I was constantly cleaning my house and offering to clean my neighbors house's I had so much energy. The first month I lost 14 pounds. I was so excited. THe second month i was still talking half a pill twice a day. I went through the month watching what I eat and walking and I lost another 9lbs. In November I went up to one whole pill twice a day. My next weigh in I was down another 10lbs. My latest weigh in was today abd this was the weigh in after CHristmas when they say most people fail and I lost another 6lbs. I also take a water pill every three days that the doctor gave me that seem to help. I am trying to lose 100lbs and I am almost halfway there I am so excited. This last baby was not kind on my body and I am glad I found a way to make it work. I sleep good but I was on ambien before I started the adipex. Big side effect is the dry mouth I suck water down all the time. I have had a slight increase in hair loss but I have thick hair so it really isn't bother me. Good luck to everyone out there that are just starting hope you have as good of experience as I have had.

Believe me it is so nice to look in the mirror and not see fat rolls in your back and really great to hear the compliments you get and knowing that your hard work is paying off.

I also am over weight and went to my doctor asking for this pill. They would not give it to me because I have heart problems. This year I have a new doctor, and asked to be put on the pill. My new doctor agreed but told me if I felt ANY kind of chest pain or anything out of the normal with my chest to stop taking it. I have been taking the pill for 6 days now. I started it on 12/16/10 and today is 12/21/10. I weighed myself today and I've already lost 10 lbs. I started at 245lbs and I'm now 235. I experienced not being able to use the bathroom (#2) for the first couple of days. After a couple days, everything is coming out just fine. I actually find myself using the bathroom #2 more often now then I have before I started taking the pill. I get dry mouth a lot. I drink a lot of water now. I sometimes crave it. I dont find myself hungry anymore really, but make myself eat a boul of cereal in the morning before I take the pill.  It is working just great for me for far. My goal is 190. Wish me lots of luck!
Overweight	jruiz9801, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/21/2010 8:51:24 AM	I am 28 5'6 and weighed about 213 when I started taking this drug.  Ihave been taking this drug for a few months(3) now.  The first month I lost 10 lbs.  My clothes are falling off of me and I have bought pants in a smaller size.  I am only taking 1/2 a pill a day.  It does decrease your appetite and encourages you to drink water because your mouth is dry.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars for satisfaction is because I worry about side effects-such as high blood pressure, heart conditions, kidney problems, etc.  My blood pressure has always been normal, around 110/60.  Since taking this medicine my blood pressure has increased, around 125/85.  Although not high, if I started out with high BP it would probably be high right now.  Overall I like the drug and hope I can keep the weight off when I stop taking the med.
Overweight	pat, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/15/2010 3:01:37 PM	I have lost 10LBS within a week of taking it. It gives me lots of energy, feel of excitement or alertness(guess it makes me high. But need everyone to know that the drug can be dangerous if used inappropriately e.g doubling your dose. Also it raises your blood pressure so all the users need to keep their BP in check. it not recommended for long term use.

I have been a little hungry but when I start to eat I really dont want it. I am so happy my doctor gave this to me. I have not started excercising yet and he also gave me a blood pressure pill so I am sure some of my weight loss was fluid, but I am pleased with the result of the pill and I will start walking as soon as I get a little more energy.

Overweight	done with plateau, 19-24 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	12/2/2010 10:51:20 AM	HELP! I'm 21, 5'3, 142lbs and my goal is 120. I started taking adipex about 3 weeks ago. I've been on the 1000-1500 calorie diet that the company provides and my doctor suggested. I rarely eat more than 1000 a day. in the first week and a half i lost 10 lbs, but since then, NOTHING! i know its been the holidays, but i tried very hard to stick to the diet and never went over about 1400 cals in one day. About 2 days ago i started increasing the amount of fiber and water im taking in. i walk my dog for an hour or so each day(i'm afraid to do any more because of how few calories i'm taking in)and i cant get off this plateau. here is what i'm eating each daybreakfast- 1 fruit, 1 starch, 1 milklunch- 1 fruit, 1 starch, 2 meatssnack- 1 fruit or 100 cal packdinner- 1 veg, 1 starch, 2 meatssnack- 1 starch, 1 milkI also recently started taking birth control about a week before starting adipex. i heard that this might make you gain weight but only because it makes you hungry so you eat more (which is cancelled out by adipex) or bc your bust gets bigger (nope, theyve gotten smaller since on the diet).Does anyone have any suggestions to get me off this plateau? I would suggest this drug as the effects work amazingly. i'm never hungry and i always have energy. the weird side effects werent that bad for me and went away after the first week.

Everyone is different. You do have to get moving and exercise! I have been walking and doing weight training/aerobics (FIRM).Just keep at it, give it some time! This has been a blessing for me, I have learned how to eat so much more healthier, if I do crave salt/sweets every once in a while, I don't eat as much of it as I would have before and actually tend to loose my appetite eating the junk now! : )

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	11/13/2010 10:27:56 PM	Works well with maintaining the weight that I lost through the HCG diet, but other than than, I have not lost anymore weight.  I went from 172 lbs to 155 lbs on HCG and when I went off of that diet I gained 5 lbs.  I am on the generic form of Adipex and it really helps control my appetite, but after taking it a while you get immune to it.  My weight goal is 130 lbs so I will probably just have to do it the old fashioned way and exercise along with portion control.

Overweight	Nursecindy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	11/7/2010 7:27:46 PM	I have been on this medication for a week. I have lost 10 pounds. I recently had a baby and experienced pre eclampsia, hypertension, and postpartum pulmonary edema. My doctor felt that it was a good idea to try this medication but I am terrible given my past medical history. Also I am experiencing mild chest pain. I am not going to take this medication anymore until I get a 2nd opinion. I would rather be over weight and alive with my baby that dead due to a heart attack. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this?

In response to the comment below regarding experiencing PRE-HYPERTENSION/HOT EASILY&amp;SWEAT EASILY......I started using this in early August and my blood pressure was evelvated slightly the first two months and tapered off. Also, yes feeling hot easily and sweaty is normal! I feel the same way, especially after getting out of the shower. : ) Overall I am satisfied with this, however I am only losing 5 pounds a month, so that part is a little frustrating. : (
Overweight	bettyb323, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/5/2010 2:24:27 AM	I started taking adipex in early May of this year. My doctor gave me the 37.5 mg dose that I take every morning before I eat breakfast. When I first started taking it I felt my heart rate increase, had more energy, dry mouth(made me drink more water), headaches, and low appetite. I started out at 197 lbs and as of today 11/5/10 I weigh 154 lbs. I am on my last script refill &amp; will have been on the med for 6 mths. I am very pleased with the results. This med gave me the boost that I needed to get even more motivated to change my eating habits &amp; to be more phsically active to remain in better health for me &amp; my family. I have 2 amazing boys that need me &amp; I want to be around for the rest of their major milestones in their lives. I have decreased my portions, drink alot of water, cut out soda completely, reduced sodium intake, reduced carbs, added more fruits &amp; veggies, and exercise at the gym anywhere from 3-6 days a week from 1-2 hours each visit. I hope to reach my goal of 130-135 lbs by my birthday at the end of February 2011.

My doctor said that was great.  The only side effect I have is dry mouth.  For me it totally cuts out my appetite, I don't crave any sweets ( my weakness )  I cut out sugar and salt all together, and I used Slim Fast for the times I didn't have time to make something.  I ate more fruits and veggies.  I also completely stayed away from soda.  I don't have any problems sleeping.  When your on Adipex you have to be seen by your doctor each month, the maximum time aloud on Adipex is 3 months.  Because of the risk of becoming addicted and other health risk that could develop.  After a few months you can get back on them, if so desired.   Because your only can be on Apidex 3 months at a time, the challenge will be keeping the weight off after.  I know for me it's like it puts a block on all my bad snacking and cuts out all my cravings.  I don't have any hunger pains for so ever, at times I have to force myself to eat something, even just drink a Slim Fast.

She put me back on the medicine in March 2010 and was on it again for four months and I am glad to say that i am down to 247. The problem is, my doctor took me off it AGAIN, little over three weeks ago and just put me back on it, and I am not seeing any change. Matter of fact, I'm gaining weight now. I don't understand and hate to go back to 303lbs, because I looked huge at that size. So if anyone has at this problem, please let me know what you did.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/26/2010 10:45:00 PM	I started taking the generic adipex on 9-17.  As of today I have lost 7 pouds.   I have been exercising daily and have to force myself to eat as I have no feeling of being hungry.  The first day I was extremely hyper and couldn't sleep the first 2 nights.  My body has adjusted.  The extra energy during the day is very nice.   I hope this weight loss keeps up.  I have gained 120 pounds in 10 years from broken bones, surgeries and being on steroids.  Hopefully this will get it off and I can get back to being someone more active.

Overweight	luckigemini, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/23/2010 3:13:22 PM	I had great fear of this drug because I'd heard many stories regarding it both good and bad. However I had been on Alli for 7 months and it just wasn't working. I went to a consult for weight loss and it was recommended. After researching I decided to give it a try. I am so pleased with my results and it has only been a week. I was jittery for the first 2 days, my body wasn't used to being so energized. I followed the instructions given by the doctor. I drink plenty of water and I walk at least two miles daily. Although I'm not always hungry I never miss a meal. Again I am pleased In only 7 DAYS I AM 8LBS LIGHTER. Now as with all medication what works for one may not have the same impact on the next individual.  
Overweight	Not fat enough???, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	35-44	9/19/2010 10:18:23 AM	I started a &quot;program&quot; with a doc (whom I respect) b/c seeing a dietitian was part of the program.  I am 100% disappointed in the dietitians; one has serious emotional problems and the other complains that she is too busy, she misses appointments, and my next appointment got changed without me being notified. Regarding the pill: it made me feel bad all over.  I had terrible back of the head and neck aches and a body rash.  I lost about 20 some pounds the first month. I am glad I started this program b/c I believe I have control now vs. b4 the pill.
Overweight	LLanning, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/18/2010 11:52:20 PM	I started taking Phentermine in Mid August 2010. I started at 185 and would like to see 130. I only lost 5 pounds my first month, however it was a stressful month, car problems, lost my job. My doctor seemed to think that may have stalled it a bit. (makes sense) The first week or so I was jittery, more anxious and had no interest in eating! Those symptoms have tapered off and now the only side affects that I have are slight increased sweating during exercise &amp; getting out of shower. Overall, It is working great, I really have to remind myself to eat. I did start feeling cravings/hunger around 3ish at the end of my first month, my Doctor then told me to try taking just a half of one at that time, so far so good. You really do have to change your eating habits and get moving, its no magic pill, but it does help significantly for emotional eaters and those whom just have major cravings! If you are feeling discouraged in the first week ot two, allow your body to adjust, as it will. I do have concerns about the risks in the future, heart/thyroid/glucose issues...however it was put to me this way &quot;being overweight is just as, if not more risky&quot;. This should only be short term (no more than 6 months) Do only take this under the care of your doctor and listen to your body/symptoms, check your blood pressure a couple of times even in between appointments also. I monitor mine and log it each time. Be smart and be careful! Good Luck to each of you out there on your weight loss journey! Remember, this pill is just a boost to get you started! God Bless!! : )
Overweight	Sweatpea, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/10/2010 5:40:18 PM	I am on a healthy eating plan, since starting this medication I am down 40 pounds. I am one of those people that can eat a meal, then turn around and WANT more, and yes I am stuffed, not heatlhy! Since starting this medication, I eat 6 small meals a day, I am not hungry during random parts of the day. I am thristy, I do drink a lot of water and my Dr is monitoring my BP, I have to see her monthly and we pretty much do a physical each month, I am OK with that. I feel better, the clothes are getting bigger and I on the other hand am NOT, not a bad trade off! I'd rather buy clothes than a king size candy bar any day!ALWAYS talk to your Doctor, ALWAYS check your BP while on this medication. I am not only LEARNING to eat, I am training my brain to know when and what I NEED to eat... Saddly those are things I have forgotten over the years! Exercise is so much easier, I have started to run short distances, I was NOT able to do that 4 months ago! Baby steps lead to large leaps that lead to massive bounds... OVER ALL ... I AM DOWN, 40 POUNDS ... 95 TO GO, SLOW AND STEADY! GOD BLESS!

Overweight	Teamforce1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	9/3/2010 6:03:02 PM	Update, I have now lost 32 pounds while taking this medicine. I have been on it for 4 months. I am now fitting into clothes that I haven't worn in a few years. I have gone from a size 16 to a size 12. I still want to lose another 30 pounds, so I'm half way there! I have put alot of hard work into this as well. I do LOTS of walking, it is great for your heart and body and it is a great stress reliever and mood lifter. I just grab my mp3 and just go. I try to eat right and watch what I put in my mouth, of course, I give myself a treat once in a while. It is very important to exercise, I have read some reviews, where some have said they have done little or no exercise. My advice would be to incorporate exercise in as you go, after a while it will be like second nature and you will WANT to do it all the time! For those that just take the meds, it does help, but what are you going to do when you have to go off it? This is a lifestyle change, we all want to keep off the weight we lose ,right? I'm very proud of myself, and it feels good to know that all my hard work is starting to show. My friends and coworkers have complemented on my weight loss. Good Luck to all, will keep you posted.

You know when you go out to eat and your stomach says to order the 90 ounce steak and 12 pound potatoe with our head of lettuce?  This gives you a literal moment to....pause.  It lets you THINK about what you are doing BEFORE diving in.  4 months = 44 pounds for me, with regular excercise and better diet.  If you have an Iphone - get &quot;Lose It!&quot; app - it's free.  That app, and this medcication has helped me to change my LIFESTYLE of excercise and eating.  I KNOW what I can eat everywhere I go - and eventually, it just becomes normal - you don't think about it. Get a competent health evaluation including an EKG before starting this med.  If you are a go by the Doc - do it.  EVERY meal - start with a half glass of water - make it a habit.  I now eat about 1300 calories, after my earned workout calories, a day and most days I cannot even eat that!

I have lost 11 lbs in 2.5 weeks!  I am follwoing a diet plan in addition to the medicine.  I know people for whom this medicine did nothing and others that it worked wonders for.  I am in the latter category.  The first few days on it I had cotton mouth really bad, felt jittery, and had a splitting headache but now I don't feel that way. I still have cotton mouth but it is tolerable.  I actually have to force myself to eat something many times or I would be way too short on calories.  The extra energy is nice too.  I started out at 186 and I am now down to 175.  I want to loose 30 lbs total with the adipex and continue my eating plan afterwards.  :)

Overweight	Brighton,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	4	Female		8/21/2010 6:51:39 PM	I am a nurse and current user of adipex p. I wanted to comment after reading several posts here...adipex is prescribed for only three months for a reason - the risk for serious side effects (heart issues) increases with use. This is a controlled drug and any responsible doctor would monitor your BP and other medical conditions closely. I work with some Dr's who will simply not presribe this med because they are very concerned over possible effects on their patients. I wish for all who take it to really do your research, and not to take a rapid pulse, dizziness,and a noted higher BP lightly. Wishing you healthy results.

I took adipex for 3 months went down to 225 and large shirt 36 waist.  I last 2 weeks I stayed at 225.  I was off for 3 months.  Went up to 235.  I am now on adipex again for 3 month trial to loose I hope 50 pounds.  Would like to be down to 160 but would be happy at 175.  The second time around loose of weight VERY slow.  Side effects are dry mouth, lots of energy (co workers love it I do alot of the little jobs).  My Blood pressure was always in 120 to 128 over 70 / 80 now its in the 135 140 over 90. And I think my fuse is shorter.  Seem to have arguements more easily.  I wish the adipex will work as fast as it did first month.  But I am happy and recommend it to all.  
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/6/2010 2:51:16 PM	I had lost about 65 pounds starting 4 yrs ago. I got down to 165 (starting at 230) i lost this weight by working out and eating right. Over the past yr I had managed to gain 25 of it back. I had never stopped working out but did begin to eat a little more (and im talking maybe 1300 calories a day). I was very frustrated with the fact that i couldnt keep the weight off even though i was eating healthy and working out. I have come to the conclusion that I basically have the body type where i have to starve to lose. I went to my Dr and told her about adipex (a friend from work had been succesful on this pill) she had never prescribed it before me. I started it July 9th 2010- i weighed 191 and had my one month appt on 8/4. I lost 11.2 pounds. This made me very happy. Today i am 178. My goal is to get back to my original 165. i just hope that this will help me keep the weight off. again, i know that, for me,  I have to take in about 1000 calories a day in order to lose, and most Drs would not suggest this, but taking in more literally made me gain. My side effects were dry mouth (which didnt bother me at all, i just drink lots of water), insomnia (not every night, but i have had some trouble sleeping) and a crash and burn feeling by about 4pm (where i feel super energized early in the day and by late afternoon i feel tired). none of these symptoms have been bad enough to make me want to stop taking the med. Overall, i am very pleased and do feel like these work. Definitley an appetite suppresant!
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/3/2010 8:37:23 PM	I've tried just about everything to lose weight. I've done weightwatchers three times and only lost weight during one 13wk session and that was 12pds. I tried nutrisystem, slim fast, right side smoothie, the ab belt, the gym twice wk, workout dvds, etc. You name it, I probably tried it. My next step was to do surgery, but a co-worker of mine had it done and was taking alot of meds, which I'm not a fan of. My friend told me about a doctor who could help me and I went to see her. Since I have a hard time taking pills I asked about the size first and then got more info. I started on 7/9/10 weighing 248, with a half of pill and only did that for two days. The first day, I had to force myself to eat breakfast, cause I wasn't hungry. I went to my app. 3wks later (8/2/10)and weighed 238. It's hard not eating any carbs. I cheated a little and still lost 10pds. Hope to do better before next app on 8/30.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/30/2010 2:04:04 AM	This medicine is working great for me!!  I have lost 40lbs.  Started March 31st, 2010, today it is July 30th, 2010.  I am 5'5 1/2&quot; and started at 223, now I am 183 and only need to lose about 30-35 more pounds.  It has really giving me the boost I needed to lose the weight and I am thankful it is working.  My friend is now on it and she seems to be so much happier when I talk to her since starting it.  Hopefully it does for her what it did for me.  I was really struggling after my second pregnancy to lose the weight and was desperate for help.  I tried counting calories, points, whatever I could and I would get so weak I would cave in.  This medicine helped give me my boost.  Now I am waiting to see if my sister-in-law will be able to do it as well.

The medicine worked great I lost 20lbs in 3 weeks, but also started sleeping 3 hours a night, was pretty crackhead like and ended up having an emotional break down, slightly delusional and over all a mess. I quit taking medicine for a week and resumed but was a lot more careful and don't take it every day and I have more of a tolerence now, but I still see some slight personality changes and I'm spacey, but not bad enough to quit taking now, just be careful!
Overweight	Harlow, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/20/2010 4:21:05 AM	I've only been taking this medication for a short period of time and was told it would boost my overall weight loss/lifestyle change program and that the reason doctors are reluctant to prescribe it for short periods of time is to discourage patients relying too heavily on the medication and not committing to a change in eating habits and exercise. Anyway, I live in a large city in Alabama and have been told that many of the &quot;Medi-Spas&quot; who have Board Certified Physicians on staff are not quite as strict because they can help patients develop a weight loss plan and monitor them more closely than a regular GP can.  If I'm pleased with the results, I might explore one of these spas instead. I look forward to the one-on-one care for which these spas have become known. I've noticed several posts in which reviewers are worried about being &quot;cut off&quot; by their regular doctor. My advice is to check out one of these spas. I would just make sure they have a practicing physician on staff just to be safe.  
Overweight	CP, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/18/2010 4:01:32 PM	I started taking this medication on July 4th weighing 238 lbs, as of today July 18th I weigh 223 lbs.That is 15 lbs in a two week period. I eat small portions three times a day and have become a way more active person. I have gone to not having any energy because of a hypoactive thyroid to doing the P90X work outs. Absolutley Amazing!

It has helped my anxiety tons. I am in a better mood and I do not worry as much as I used to about little things. I have just noticed that my hair is getting thin. hopefully vitamins will help this.
Overweight	Tigger-n-Tx, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	7/15/2010 3:49:35 AM	Been on generic for 5 yrs. Have lost 75 lbs. Causes jitters, constipation, &amp; insomnia, but not bad enough to stop taking. Take Myralax as needed for constipation. Adipex very effective in beginning, but repeatedly hit a wall that I can't seem to overcome. Have weighed abt 180 with 10-lb variance for past 2 yrs. I'm female, 5'6&quot;, 34 yrs old.  I am a smoker &amp; find that I smoke more while taking this med. Have stopped taking med periodically to let body &quot;rest&quot; &amp; to reduce tolerance - every time I go off, I sleep for 14 hrs a day &amp; still feel exhausted &amp; then start eating like a pig - typically gain 15 lbs in first month.  I've never exceeded dosage, but I'm scared to know what will happen when my doc retires &amp; I won't be able to get scrip anymore b/c most docs are just worried abt liability... Each time I stop, I wait for 1-3 mths before starting again &amp; that helps to jump-start the weight loss again.  I've never suffered from HBP, &amp; even after 5 yrs on this med, I still average 113/78.  Type II &amp; HBP run in family, but have avoided so far. For the person asking abt the pharmacy, try a different one altogether (not just a different location of same company).  This drug helps to control impulsive eating - food doesn't seem as important &amp; you think abt what you eat before you eat it instead of submitting to the impulse. Because of the &quot;speed&quot; effect, the motivation to exercise is a bit easier. Also, b/c of the cotton-mouth, you tend to drink more water which also helps you feel fuller faster. I feel like a &quot;normal&quot; adult while on this med b/c I actually have energy &amp; a normal life - not just b/c of weight loss.  Before, I was too tired to make it thru the day w/o taking a nap &amp; now I don't nap unless I'm taking a break from the med. I wish more docs would work with this med - I may have to start going across the border when my doc retires!

I started March 1st at 271 lbs today 7/14 i am 217 lbs. It helped with my hunger and craving greatly. But i have put in a lot of work. i eat much healthier and smaller portions as well as work out 4-6 times a week. Its not a magic pill but it def. helps you get over that begining hump. Only side effect i have delt with is the dry mouth

Overweight	TeamForce1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/11/2010 8:23:54 PM	My doctor prescribed me the generic form of Adipex to help me control my appetite and to lose weight. I was on the 37.5mg pill, but only took a half a pill a day for 2 months to get used to it. I lost 20 pounds in 2 months and now I take a whole pill a day. It controls my appetite and gives me more energy. Watch your caffine intake with this though. I have only experienced having a dry mouth with this, so I chew gum and drink alot of water. I do alot of walking as often as I can. You have to be willing to make lifestyle changes with this. Taking this while eating more healthier foods in conjunction with exercise will give you great results, but YOU have to eat right AND exercise to form lasting results. The reason some gain the weight back after going off the medicine is because they go back to their old habits again. That is why it is still important to eat right and exercise after stopping the medicine.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/7/2010 9:53:15 PM	Two weeks after starting this medication I had lost 8 lbs. Two months in now, I have lost a total of 20 pounds and will continue for 2 more months. My doctor prescribed it to me to speed up my metabolism as a kick start, for they caught that I was insulin resistant and had been on the wrong medications for about 10 years, leaving my body to suffer the consequences. My body is responding well to it (along with light exercise and sensible diet). However, do not just stop taking it abruptly. I forgot to fill over a holiday weekend and spent the weekend in withdrawal in bed. Best to slowly stop taking it.
Other	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/7/2010 10:39:36 AM	I started taking Adipex on May 27th,2010. To date I have lost 15lbs. My doctor gave me a 3mos supply, and said that after the 3 months I would need to take a break. I was exercising prior to taking this, and found that once I noticed I was losing, I have really slacked off. I feel if I would start back the exercise, the weight would go quicker. As some others have said, be sure to take a stool softener,I found that out the hard way!!!

I started 11 months ago on Adipex and simply watched what I ate through the day and watched my portions and never deprived myself of anything I wanted or craved. I counted calories and bought 100 cal. snacks and did basic yard work and no extra working out to often and dropped the weight at a steady pace. I dropped from a XXL-XXXL shirt to an XL and from a 46-48 waist to a 38 inch waist. If I can do it anyone can. The medicine does not have any side-effects just the &quot;Jitters&quot; as everyone calls them from a low calorie diet. I would and have recommended this to anyone. My Wife joined my diet 5 months ago and has lost 52lbs so far. Good luck and happy weight loss!

I also excercise almost everyday and eat a reduced calorie diet. It does work but you still have to work at it.. Just sitting around isnt going to make you loose weight this isnt a miracle drug.

Try switching the time you take it. I found I have to take it between 9:30 and 9:45 - and later or earlier, and I still get the munchies... I don't know why, but it turned out a specific window of time really made a difference.Good luck!
Overweight	amber, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/26/2010 12:02:41 PM	I took this medication about 3 years ago. I was 19 stood at 5'3 and weighed in at 200 size 14 (snug fit) in March of 07'. Once I saw the 200 mark on the scale, a switch clicked. I took this drug, ate very healthy, and worked out 5-6 days a week. By July I weighed in at 135 size 6. I have kept most of the weight off. I am now around 143 after 3 years.I am a college student and I found I could focus soooo much better after taking this. My cons would be: shaking if you forget to you because of the appetite curve, occational moodiness, and minor headaches during the first few weeks. I took this on and off for about 6 months.

Overweight	DEB001, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/21/2010 6:16:21 PM	I have been on Apidex for one week now and have already lost 11 lbs. The first day I had tons of energy and could not sleep at night, I woke up at least 5-6 times during the night then finally gave up trying to sleep and got out of bed at 5:30 AM wide awake and was not tired all day. I have dry mouth all the time now so I drank a LOT of water. I don't feel hungry at all anymore and I was able to finally stop drinking soda too. I do feel jittery sometimes, minor headaches and clinching my teeth but the side effects come and go and could be because I forget to eat sometimes. I don't have as much energy as I had the first day but its still more than I am used to. I try to only eat healthy food now and stay under my calorie limit, I workout or walk at least 3 times a week. I usually have a bananna for lunch (which I have to force myself to eat bc I am not hungry) and then a regular (usually healthy)dinner. Over all I love the effectiveness, I have tried several other store bought pills and nothing as ever come close to working as well as Adipex has and it was cheaper than most of the other pills I have tried.

I weighed myself again today May 20, and was so HAPPY to see that my NEW WEIGHT is now at 269 I LOST 11 POUNDS in six days... PLS dont be fool in thinking that all you have to do is take the pills, and the weight will come off, IT WON'T!!!... Before I even started taking Adipex I lost 15 pounds on my own with plenty of excrise, and doing the 50 million pound challenge. It seemed like no matter how hard I tried to excrise or how healthy I ate my weight would not move from being 280. My doctor prescibed adipex for me, and it has been working great... I walk everyday except Sunday for 60mins, and I count my calorie intake, prepare my meals a week before, and eat 6 meals a day. The only thing is that I have dry mouth, other then that no other side effects. I take it really early in the morning so I will be able to sleep at night. I have lost 26 pounds in total from my intial weight of 295 pounds.  
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	5/20/2010 7:06:51 AM	This medication will help most people lose weight.  I have a low metabolism and I have been taking it for 4 months now and have lost close to 30 lbs.  However, I had to discontiue using it because I could not do anything physical (housework, walking etc.) without immediately breaking out into a massive sweat.  I was also very dizzy as well.  Basically it was causing heating exhaustion in me.  I was on 37.5 mg in the morning and then half of that in the afternoon.  I have gone down to 15 mg in the morning and 15 mg in the afernoon and it has been better, but the weight loss has slowed down.  Its going to take a while to get the extra 30 off.

I did experiance a itchy, red rash on my face and neck in the beginning and have had dry mouth the whole time i have taken it.  I will no longer be taking it after this week, as I feel that I can really go no lower than the 119lbs I have seemed to plateued at. But I am worried about the possible side effects of stopping the medicine.  Althought I have seen no complaints of withdrawal symtom on this site I have heard that there could be.  I am hoping by weening myself off, by halfing the pills I can avoid any withdrawal symtoms.

I actually think I'm more hungry now that I'm taking it.  On the plus side, the only side effect I have is a slight dry mouth...no palpitations, headache or insomnia, just a slight burst of energy that keeps me from thinking about my bed all day.  Since Monday I have lost 2lbs which is ok I guess.  I will give it a little more time before I quit.  Whats the point of being on it if it doesn't suppress my appetite?

The only downside to the drug is i did notice i became more emotionally upset easier. other than that it's great for losing weight!
Overweight	Shereta, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/6/2010 2:13:55 AM	I started taking Adipex on 3/3/10, I have lost 30lbs, The pill gives me that boost to excersise &amp; eat less; but the cost of the office vist &amp; the pill motivates me to keep it up so that the money I spent does not go to waste. You may hear stories about people gaining the weight back, It's most likely the result of going back to the same bad habits. So if you are thinking about taking Adipex, use the three months your on it, to get in the habit of eating right &amp; excercising on a regular bases.

Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/1/2010 2:24:23 PM	I weighed 214 pounds when i started taking adipex. I did have trouble sleeping for the first several days but that went away and is no longer a problem. I cut back on meal portions and started counting calories. I tried to exercise every day but definitely every other day for 30 minutes or more. Its been 3 weeks since ive started and i have already lost 27 pounds.

I'm very skeptical about this. I hope it works. I am cutting out all junk food. I will cut down on my portion size. And definitely will try to get exercise to fit into my schedule somewhere. Gosh I hope this medicine works I'm tired of being FAT and being looked at all the time...Hopeful in Ohio
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/24/2010 10:23:47 AM	I was able to overcome my food addiction in just 12 days and learned to eat and savor healthy foods. Before I ate for energy and ate and ate.  I would always choose a high fat food like fried chicken for a snack instead of an apple.  Now after only one month, I can't stand the thought of cramming my mouth like I did before.  I can't eat chips or other junk food anymore.  It is a wonderful feeling to be free of this addiction I have been fighting for so long.  I would take the pill early in the day so I would not have trouble sleeping and after 4 weeks I didn't need to take the pills anymore. I regained control of my life and am losing weight every week by changing my intake to 1600 calories a day-before I was easily eating 4000. Oh and pay attention to your bowel movements-I had to take a stool softener to regulate mine.

I did have some sleeplessness and lots of dry mouth but other than that no side affects.

I have tried just about everything else over the past 7 years to lose weight and nothing worked.  It is expensive, but I was tired of being overweight.  This pill has helped my reach my initial weight loss goal that my doctor and I set.  As of 3/31/10 I only had another 8 lbs to lose for my new goal.  I go to the doctor today to see if I reached that goal.  Adipex did really suppress my appetite and I used that time to learn how to eat right and eat smaller portions.  It has to be a lifestyle change to have long term results because you can't be on Adipex forever.

I most recently began taking it at the end of January and as of March 30, I have lost around 30 lbs.  However, I believe that the Adipex is the cause of a seizure-like epidode that effects my head, neck, and face.  In the past few years, I have had spells where I get in a bad mood, followed by a sudden sharp pain in the right side of my neck and back of my head.  After the pain, my face then begins to draw toward the right side.  It looks as if I've had a stroke when this occurs.  I've been to several neurologists, including Vanderbilt University, with no medical explanations being found.  I went from July of last year til this past week without having an episode.  I've had 3 in the past 4 days.  After recounting every time I have took Adipex, it seems as if I only have these problems when I am taking the Adipex.  Therefore, I am going to stop taking them.  I love the weight loss, but nothing is worth the symptoms I experience when this occurs.  Sometimes it only lasts a few hours, other times it may last for a few days.  At some points, it makes me feel so ill that I have to go to bed, almost like I have the flu.  If anyone else has experinced symptoms like this, I would love to hear about them.

I have experienced some side effects, i.e my heart does race and I have experienced lower back pain as well as chest pains which go away and come back throughout the day.Tingling sensation in my limbs and cold hands and feet. but the worst side effect of all is the headache I  get about an hour and a half after I take it every day, I take Alleve to counter it and I am able to tolerate it. I take a whole pill 37.5 mg a day, @ 8:15 am. It is the brand name ADIPEX. I have changed my diet significantly.I eat about 1600 to 1700cal/day. My target weight is 150lbs.I started out at 220lbs. and I do not have any health problems, I had a complete physical, blood work and urinalysis to make sure I was OK to take this drug. I would  not call it a GOD sent yet but I will agree that it takes a way your cravings and gives you energy.Which is a start I will keep you posted.

I have tried everything out there for the last five years to help me lose this weight, as soon as I heard about this drug I came right to webmd.com to try to see what type of side effects there was and how people rated this drug to find out how safe and how effective it really was. After reading up on this drug my dr. and I had agreed that this drug would be a good choice to help me jump start my weight loss. On fri. March the 12th of 2010 I weight in at 250lbs and started this medication, and as of a week latter on fri. March the 19th of 2010 I weight in and to my surprize I was 239 I had lossed 11 lbs.I could not belive it. All I can say is that it really works as long as you eat several small low cal meals a day and work out.On this drug. I can say that the only side effects that I have had from this medication is cold hand and feet along with dry mouth, and energy to burn!! I can also say that my cravings that I had had before are gone and that I have even wanted to work out and eat health with this wonder pill. Well I hope that has helped some of you out there and I will keep you all updated on my weight!
Overweight	Amanda, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/20/2010 6:58:29 PM	Within the past 2 years I've been to my doctor for phentermine to get a &quot;jump start&quot; on my weight loss.  I'm going back at the beginning of next week to get a new prescription.  Phentermine is the best weight-loss drug I've ever taken.  I think of it as my &quot;happy pill&quot; because it puts me in the greatest mood, it gives me tons of energy (which I need with my kindergarten students), and helps me get the weight off.  It does make you have cotton mouth, but that's fine because you drink more water.  I've noticed when taking it that I tend to be a little moody, so beware.  I also have a hard time going to sleep...but in my opinon, I'm willing to give up some sleep to be happy and healthy again!!

I have been having like night terrors since starting it. I recently stopped taking the medication for the past 3-4 days and my night terrors have gotten severely worse, I've had anxiety attacks. I just realized today that it is more than likely directly related to these pills. I drink plenty of water because they do keep me thirsty. I take them at 6am and usually fall asleep around 1am. Not getting alot of rest. I like Ionamin tons better. I took that over 5 years ago and went from 213lbs to 142lbs in a little over 6 months. I'm going to just try working out at this point.

As of March 2010 I have lost 62 pounds. The most serious side effects I have noticed are dry mouth and constipation. The medication is still quite effective for me at the standard dose of 37.5mg twice a day. I am now over halfway to my goal weight. I have used this opportunity to completely change the way I eat. I knew when I started that I wanted to focus on eating more of a vegetarian diet. Adipex has helped me to do that. I have found healthier alternatives for the foods I used to crave and new foods that I would never have even considered trying prior to starting adipex. I think this change in my diet is very important to successfully maintaining my weightloss after I stop taking the medication.

Overweight	Maxomom, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/13/2010 7:26:04 AM	This drug tends to work very well in most people as an appetite suppressant. However, you MUST eat regular small meals while attempting to lose weight even if you do not feel hungry. If the medication is not working for you, speak to your doctor. There are other options. It's effect will lessen over time and you will build up a tolerance to it. I lost 28 lbs in 6 months using this drug off and on. I have been off this drug for some time and will now take it again to lose my last 25 lbs. You must change your eating and exercise habits for life in order to lose and maintain a healthy weight. This drug makes me very thirsty and the extra water intake also helps with weight loss.

I have been told that your body has to get used to the higher metabolism rate. Also I found that taking the pill everday at the same time helped with my problem. (Had different hrs for different days that I worked and my body couldn't adjust to the different schedule.) As for the pills in general, I have found that after about 2 months this doesn't seem to help. I have taken a break and am going to start back this week. I have lost a total of 15 lbs. since Dec. Currently I have been doing the Last Chance Workout DVD so I am hoping when I start back on the pills they will be the added boost that I need again.

Overweight	Dedra, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/5/2010 2:27:10 PM	I was on Adipex-P from Dec. 07' until Feb. 07' and lost 30lbs--I had to make myself eat.  I have since had a baby and having trouble getting the weight off. I started taking it again on March 3, 2010--two days ago--I have endless energy, but my body is still trying to adapt.  After about two hours of non-stop cleaning, running around etc.....I get a little nauseas and run down feeling.  I lay down for about 30 mins and that seems to help.  Of course, I can't sleep.  It does cause severe insomnia the first week or so, but that should subside.  I take it at 6am, but still have trouble going to sleep until about 3-4am.  I have severe dry mouth, BUT, that is a good thing because I am craving water like crazy!!!  I hate water and drink Diet Coke constantly, so this has also helped flush my body out and is super good.  The only other thing that seems to bother me is my eyes get extremely dry and they ache.  If you really want to lose the weight, you just need to get past the first week or so of the negative side effects, then its easy street.  You made need to up your dose after a month or so, with you dr.'s permission of course.  Your body will get used to this and stop working as well.  Hope this helped someone!!  :-) Oh, I've already lost 4lbs in just two days.....im sure all the water consumption has something to do with that also.....

Dry mouth can be a bit irritating -- especially since you have a &quot;full&quot; sensation, therefore you don't want to eat or drink.  Will weigh-in in a few days to check first week results.

Didn't sleep the first night, but fine after that.  Eat much much less.  Don't have any cravings.  Jittery in the begining, it subsided about a week later.  Very dry mouth.

Overweight	Kristen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	2/16/2010 9:58:36 PM	I started taking Adipex in September 2009 weighing in at 233 pounds.  I had my 5 month weigh in yesterday and weighed 198.  35 pounds in 5 months is fantastic for me!  I have polycystic ovarian syndrome and it makes it very hard for me to lose weight.  I've lost more weight in the past 5 months than I could have in a year or more!  This is also the first time I have weighed less than 200 pounds in more than a decade!  I am thrilled with the way this medicine has worked for me.  I'm half way to where I want to be.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	2/9/2010 11:09:31 PM	The medication works great at first. I lost about 30lbs in 4 months, most of it in the first month.  The meds do stop working at a certain point.  I became addicted to it and relied on the extra energy to get through my day.  It came to a point where I was abusing laxitives &amp; diuretics just to lose enough weight for my doc to renew the prescription.  Once I stopped taking Adipex I became extremely tired, depressed, I had nightmares, cold sweats, etc.  I basically went through drug withdrawl.  If it isn't working for you try drinking more water and increase your fiber intake.  Good medication just be careful.
Overweight	Determined, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/9/2010 7:07:59 PM	I started taking Adipex on Dec. 30 and at my one month check-up had lost 17 pounds.  It definitely curbs my appetite, but the energy rush is not as great as it was in the first couple of weeks.  I am exercising 5 days a week for 30 min. to 1hr. 30 min.  I could not sleep well the first week.  I do get cold hands.  I take half a pill at 10:00 am and the other half at 4:00 pm.  I hope to lose 40 more pounds by June.

The first week I got very constipated, lost 4 lbs. Second week I started Activia in the morning with the pill and have lost 11 lbs total in just two weeks and no more constipation. So I highly recommend Activa for those of you that suffer from the constipation side effect. Overall this pill is working great!

Not only is it helping with my weight, I have more energy - sometimes too much! This is my second time around with it (you can only take it for three months and then you have to be off for six months) and I am experiencing some side affects, i.e., headache, nausea. But I know that will go away with time!
Overweight	Happy in Ohio, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/5/2010 10:22:41 AM	Started in August/09, as of January/10 have lost 25lbs.Great, slow and steady that will make sure I keep it off.  Stuck at 200 lbs for 8 years (Thyroid condition and poor metabolization of the food I eat) I am 54 and 5'5&quot; Now I am down to 175lb and went from a 18 to a 14 pant. Because of my health history, I see my doctor once a month. Side affects vary month to month, dry mouth at first, now insomnia, sometime several &quot;hot flashes&quot; though the day (although it could just be my age.)  I take it at 6am before work. Can't wait for the weather to warm up I actcually want to walk. Not really hungry but I eat about 1/2 of what I ate before.  Some months only lost a pound but lost inches on waist. Won $75.00 at work for new healthly lifesyle.  The main key is what you eat and how much.  This great little pill just helps me metabolize my food better. Always recomend it. Plan on losing another twenty five. I haven't felt this great in years! I'm enjoying life instead of just passing though it. Have felt sluggish for years.
Overweight	bcglam1987, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	19-24	2/4/2010 9:59:57 AM	i have been reading review, after review about people losing between 5-10 pounds in one week on the drug? how is that even possible? i have changed my eating habits, work out five times a week for 45 minutes .. haven't seen any weight loss my *first* week. i can't do the whole starving myself thing, so any suggestions as to what i am doing wrong? i also was wondering - is it because i take this pill once a day vs three times? was prescribed once a day, so i won't take more than what advised by my doctor to do. would LOVE help/answers.

I have lost 12 lbs.!  I am very pleased. Adipex has helped my cravings for bad food!  It's great! My dr. was very pleased, she also said the next month won't be as great a weight loss, but i still should lose 5-8 lbs and that's still good.  I am very excited and happy this is working.  I don't really have any side effects anymore, except dry throat, and my hands &amp; feet get very cold.  Other then that, it's worth it.

I also have been working out and trying to eat healhy alot with this drug. The only cons about this medicine is that your heart rate speeds up and makes you jittery and during the summer I did some excess sweating, just doing housework. If you do decide to take this medicine, I would say to take it during the morning because if you take it later on in the evening, it may keep you up at night.
Overweight	Jooles58, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/26/2010 5:28:27 PM	Adipex is a good way to start losing weight.  But this isn't a quick fix.  Yes you do lose weight with these meds but if you don't change your eating habits you will gain all of your weight back.  This medicine can't be taken for the rest of your life.  Also everyone is talking about how bad the dry mouth is.  I chew sugar free gum and it helps out a lot.

I think it is FANTASTIC! I wish I knew about this a long time ago. The first week i did have tachycardia, severe dry mouth, diziness, and wired but as time has gone on side effects have mellowed out. I do not crave sweets, soda, or snacks that used to consume my diet. I found that I have to force myself to eat even if only a 4oz yogurt. I did have more energy in begining then now, but never had a problem sleeping. The constipation side effect has gotten worse over the last 2 weeks. But overall I am very impressed at the results. I know taht I could have done a little better if I was stricter about exersice but it is still great.

Compared to other losses I have seen, it does not seem like much, but for me- it's very good!  That an average of almost 7 pounds a month!  On Weight Watchers, the best I ever did was 25 pounds IN A YEAR!!!  I will gladly take the slow and steady if it helps me win the race.

I begin taking  drug at 5am so that I could actually go to sleep by 10pm.  My intent is to take drug for 3 months. I will update then. good luck!!!
Overweight	cjl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	1/8/2010 9:29:38 AM	I have been on this for just 3 days.  It seems to be working, not as hungry and I don't feel the urge to eat much.  I do have minor headaches, insomnia the first night.  I have been experiencing being &quot;cold&quot; when I'm usually not. Has anyone else being cold?  Dry mouth, but I've been drinking lots of water.  I have discovered that I can take Vistaril at night to help me sleep.  Vistaril is for lots of things, like anxiety, allergies, itching due to allerigies and various other things.  It will not interfere or cause problems w/adipex.  So far, so good! :)
Overweight	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/7/2010 9:25:27 PM	I used this previously without any instruction: the results were nothing compared to the results I have received with constant exercise and a low carb high protein diet.  If i take after 2pm i usually experience insomnia otherwise it is a normal nights sleep. My energy level is &quot;level&quot; all day, after working fulltime and running 3 kids it is a wonderful add to my life.

Using it along with a 1200 calorie diet taught me the lifestyle change I needed to continue with my diet and exercise plan. I am 5'6&quot; and weighed 232 lbs. at the beginning of treatment. Today I am weighing in at 145 lbs.! I run on a regular basis and have been devoted to regular exercise 3 days a week. Adipex gave me the boost I needed to achieve the healthy lifestyle change I was in desperate need of. Now I can out run my 12 yr. old. son!

No weight loss yet of course, I got a way to go from 270 lb.  I love the energy it give's me, and I have low blood sugar, so the dizzieness remind's me to eat.  Since just smelling food makes me sick. I'll check back in a couple weeks to let you know how it's going.

Overweight	evitashane, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	12/19/2009 10:12:42 AM	I began taking Adipex on 12/03/09. It was prescribed by my doctor. I was seeking assistance in losing a little weight. The first day that I took the pill, I was up all day. I put out all of my Christmas decorations in one day. Sweet. I feel that I get a little more energy when I take this pill. Now as far as my eating habits, I have done what one would do to lose weight without the pill. I changed my habits-no fast food. I have also tempered my eating at real restaurants. I make sure that I am consuming fiber daily, as the pill can constipate you. I exercise at least 4 times a week, walking on the treadmill or doing a dvd. I drink a ton of water. I also monitor my blood pressure, as this pill can raise your bp.  My mouth is constantly dry. So far after 15 days, I have lost 6 lbs.  I am pleased. In order to prepare for taking this pill, I read as many reviews as possible. I researched it. The one thing that continually comes up is that you must exercise. I know this seems like a &quot;given&quot; but I thought I would reinforce was others have said.  I also found a meal plan for this drug on the internet-I hope this helps.

The doc took me off of it for a week, she wanted to recheck my blood pressure in a week...I will let you know what happens.  Overall very pleased with my weight loss...I look and feel great.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/11/2009 10:44:42 PM	I began taking the pill in mid-July, it's been 5five mths and I have lost 65lbs. I'm totally excited about the weight loss, but also, because now I feel like I have some control over my weight. I exercise between 5-6 days a week for35 min -1 1/2hrs depending on my schedule. My diet is 1200 calories or less sometimes I have to force myself to eat. Love my new body, still working on it hope to lose additional 35 lbs, so hope you consider and speak to your dr. about this pill it'll work for you if you let it!
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/10/2009 5:48:45 AM	I started adipex in Aug. and lost over 50 lbs.  Wonderful feeling not having to go to the plus section now.  Strange but wonderful.  It is a must that you change your lifestyle.  Diet, exercise, and habits everything.  My thought is if you dont want to change you should not waste your time in taking the pills.  
Overweight	good2go,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		12/9/2009 11:36:30 PM	I have used this drug for 6 weeks. If you take this, and dnt watch what you consume, nor exercise you will continue to loose weight, but ur not getting what you can...i have a family member who has taken it for 6 mths shes lost 40lb, me in 6 weeks, have lost 20 so in 6mths i have the ability to loose, about, 100lb's when she only lost 40lb...why? because my family mbr might go to gym 3-4 times a week MAYBE workout an hr including her weigt train...ME on the other hand, I work out at least 5 times a week, some times 7...sometimes 2 times a day...[not often tho lol] and 2 hrs a day, i mix up my routine from boxing kicks and stretching to weights to cardio...i started at 251lb and am currently 231...in SIX WEEKS....no joke...if ur going to do it, you minds well do it right...

It will work for you how you want it to work in the sense that, it is what you make it, if like me you exercise a min. of 5 days a week, a min of 1-2 hrs. you will melt off the weight in 6weeks i have lost 22lb...now my mother is also on it, and she on the other hand doesnt exercise as hard or often as i and in 3 1/2 4 mths, she has only lost about 35-38lbs she says, at my rate i will loose dbl that...this medication, helps people get results fast, because when u are severly overweight the long haul is depression but you cant rely on just the meds because u can eat badly, and still loose with this, but in the long run, it wont help you, and a dr will see that ur not loosing up to what you can, and remove you from it, it is a blessing, but can be a curse, you wouldnt want to dbl your weight once off the meds so try it, yes, but, use it with knowledge...(+ enjoy 
Overweight	nikkisan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/5/2009 9:25:42 PM	I have to say that I am very happy so far with this medication. for once in my life I have control. I have no cravings, tons of energy and for once I am seeing the scale move. I have had a hard time in the past losing weight found out it was because of the P.C.O.S when you try so hard and lose nothing it is a real downer, since I have been on this medication ( the generic version anyways)I have lost 6 pounds and it has only been 4 days. I will say that you have to be careful because with me I have no appetite so I have to make sure I eat properly the side effects I have experienced was dry mouth and constipation probably from not drinking enough water

Overweight	kygirl09, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	19-24	12/3/2009 10:22:49 AM	I began Adipex after giving birth to my daughter in late 2008. I took Adipex for two months and lost a total of 16lbs. My start weight was 162 and end was 146. The side effects were mild at first, dry mouth some constipation. After about a month i began expirencing depression, high blood pressure, insomnia, and irregular heart beat. I am only 24 with no underlying helath problems and this drug was very hard on my organs. I know many of us will do whatever it takes to loose weight just be careful and listen to your body. This is seriously legal speed. You will devlope an addiction.

I don't think about sweets at all and it makes me able to make the right decisions about food. The only side effect i've noticed is that if i don't drink enough water i don't have as many bowel movements.
Other	mitchfam, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	11/26/2009 6:38:53 AM	I listed my reason for using this medication as 'other' because my main complaint to my doctor was that my compulsion to eating was controlling my every waking moment.  I needed to lose about 40 lbs, but self control was out of the question.  From the first dose I felt the compulsion completely disappear.  I was able to make better decisions about what I ate; and NEVER was tempted to binge on every food I saw.  I also complained about anxiety, I have never been this calm.  After three weeks have lost about 12 lbs, which is just an added benefit; the most important factor is the absence of my compulsion that I have had for nearly 40 years.  My weight has fluctuated from 118 to 182; up and down with only temporary results having tried every bizarre diet out there.  I only hope the effects of this pill continue; and that the doctor continues to prescribe them for me.  He was reluctant to prescribe anything for the anxiety but said that this medication might help, I didn't even realize that it was for weight control (until I went to have the prescription filled and my insurance company stated that they cover no weight loss medication, however, the cost of the pill was only $28 for 30 days, I have spent far more than that on other useless meds).  Having tried every diet pill on the market I have never experienced anything like this one.  The first week I did experience high energy and jitters, during the second week this began to wear off, in the third week I have become more in tune with my bodies needs and try eating a little something every 2-3 hours, but again, I have to remind myself to eat.  Good luck to each and everyone suffering from this type of compulsion.
Overweight	Nurse, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3		35-44	11/25/2009 3:10:07 PM	Very satisfied with my weight loss, however I had an episode of tacycardia and hypotesion that lasted about 20-30 minutes. It scared the heck out of me and I wish I never took this drug. I lost 50lbs and felt fine for over 4 months, went to the doctor every month. Now I'm hoping I don't have cardiovascular damage. Be careful!

I lost 19 lbs in the first month. Don't like the pain and dry mouth but it started me out in the right direction.  FYI...I gained four pounds since last Thursday. Today is Monday...Let me know if anyone else has had any back pain with this drug.
Overweight	TaraYoung, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/23/2009 4:26:53 PM	I was perscribed the 37.5 mg dosage but broke them in half. I loved taking them and had been for about 3 weeks but then just in this last week I began having severe dry mouth and back pain. I believe it is my kidney's that hurt. When I started I weighed 159 and got down to 148. Not bad but looking at some of these reviews I was hoping for more. Needless to say I liked my time on them...didnt care for the pain and dry mouth but it started me out in the right direction and helped me curb my taste for sweets and excess eating. Let me know if you have had any back pain with this drug.
Overweight	GirlyGirl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/22/2009 7:01:33 PM	I just started this medicine and am quite happy with it.  It really does curb your appetite and I see a little increase in energy.  The first day I was wired, but by mid-day I had calmed down and the second day it didn't have quite the same effect.  It does give you a dry mouth especially the first few hours after taking it and when you aren't drinking consistently.  When I'm hungry I can usually eat a little bit and then I almost start to feel a little nauseous after eating. Nothing too bad though, just enough to not be interested in food.  I sometimes compulsively eat and was afraid this wouldn't work for me because sometimes I eat even when I'm not hungry.  But so far that hasn't been a problem.  I just have not been thinking about food like I usually do.  I hope these effects stick around and don't wear off like they have for some.  I might try and take a few days off a week just to keep my body from getting too reliant on them.  Also as a side note.  This medicine isn't available without a prescription. TO my knowledge every place online that is selling it w/o one is not selling Adipex.  Look closely at the spelling: Phentermine vs. Phentramine.  Also, my doc said that brand name Adipex is preferred 2 out of 3 times, even though I know that they are supposed to be chemically identical. So get the brand instead of generic when you get your script filled. I will update a little later and let you know about my weight loss.  I just wanted to give advice to anyone thinking about taking it.  Like many others have said, you need to be ready to lose weight and commit to it.  The medicine won't stop you from eating food, or get you on a treadmill but it does give you a push in the right direction.  Good luck!

I did notice however that after I stopped taking the medicine that I am extremly tired. I wasn't aware that I should stop the medicine gradually. This is the first time I took something that actually worked.
Overweight	Kristen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	11/19/2009 12:38:55 PM	I went for my 2 month weigh in last week and had lost 18 pounds at that point.  Not as much as I have seen others do in that amount of time, but for me- FANTASTIC results.  If I keep up my 2 pound a week average, I will be below 200 pounds by Christmas.  I have not weighed less than 200 pounds in over 10 years!!!  My family doctor has given it to my husband as well.  This week will be his first weigh in- I'm sure it will be huge.  I'll check in again at my 3 month weigh in.  Good luck to all!

Now I am 40 and over 10 years I have gained that 20lbs and another 10 on top of that.  Adipex is the only weight loss medication that has worked for me.  I have been taking it again and after 2 weeks I have lost 10 lbs.  I never think about food but eat because I know I should.  NO cravings for sweets at all. I can't give enough praise for this medication.  Adipex is amazing.  Only side effect is dry mouth. :)

I am very pleased with the results so far, but still a long way to go.  It has helped me to control my portion sizes and make better choices.  I have lost some of the cravings I use to have for my favorite chocolate chip cookies, so I substitute it with sugar free hot chocolate which actually works for me, so I don't really miss the cookies like I thought I would.  Overall I am very pleased with the product and will continue to use under my doctors supervision.  The plus for me is my blood pressure has significantly dropped which my doctor is really pleased with along with the success I am having with the Adipex.  Hopefully this time next year I will have accomplished my goal, I take it one pound at a time!
Overweight	me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/10/2009 12:55:03 PM	Visible results are not overnight, they are gradual, however, this product completely does away with cravings. The first few days, the thought of food almost made me sick, but now, I can eat a few bites of each item on my plate, and gladly push it away. The key to avoiding the &quot;dizzy&quot; side effect is to make sure to eat something. Even if just a banana or packet of instant oatmeal, power bar, the body needs fuel. The only minor side effect I experienced was for the first 4 days, it was hard to sleep. Now, not an issue.30 days in, and my clothes fit better! As this can cause constipation, I recommend getting some liquid soluble fiber and mixing it in morning coffee or juice.

Since starting Adipex, I have lost over 40 lbs in less than 3 months. My back pain is gone and I feel great. I'm able to walk and jog everyday now. This medication is not considered a &quot;miracle drug&quot;. It does take work and obedience. You have to follow a reduced calorie diet, exercise daily and drink plenty of water. This medication does give me energy and seems to suppress my appetite. I eat about 1/2 of what I used to.  But, if someone is wanting to lose weight, improve their health, they have to change their lifestyle. I only have about 20 pounds to go before I hit my ideal weight of 135 lbs. 
Overweight	Deputy Snead, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	11/9/2009 10:26:35 AM	I started taking Adipex about 5 weeks ago. I have lost 28 pounds. I have watched what I eat during this time and I drink plenty of water daily. Im not able to do a hard core work out plan at this time due to a knee problem which is requiring surgery but I can only imagine what this medication will do for me when I can get out of the pool and start back running again. I would by far recommend this to anyone. The only side effect that I had and still get sometimes is dry mouth and thats no problem because I drink so much water daily.

I feel a little tired, have headaches, and dry mouth. Already i have lost 8 lbs. I highly suggest talking to your doctor before taking this medication.

I am very happy with the results so far.  It is not coming off as quickly as I thought it would based on previous reviews, but it would take me 5-6 months to lose 12 pounds on my own.  Only side effect has been dry mouth.

I eat healthier, less, and exercise everyday.Two months ago I was wearing a women's 16W pants. Today, I am very proud to say I can fit comfortably in a 14A.

Overweight	Cinci Gal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/13/2009 1:48:27 PM	I have had great success with this medication. It can make you jittery but subsides in time. I was not obese but had about 15 - 20 lbs to lose to be in the healthy range according to the doc. I just couldn't get it off. I struggled with wanting to snack. I haven't snacked at all and when I eat my meals I don't overeat, and it is easier to eat healthier options when your not really hungry to begin with. I highly recommend this. I have had some jitters but when I break the pill in half, take one in the morning and then the other 8 hours later, it works best. Depends on the person. The doc recommended this until you know how you react to it. I have been successful in doing it this way. I started the med Sept 18th and have lost 16 lbs. as of Oct. 13th. Again, the only side effect I have experienced is jitters but it is very much worth it.

I did not have any side effects others have listed. Actually I felt nothing at all and would not have known it was working except for the scales showed a weight loss. So far I am very pleased. I have not exercised or changed my regular routine. I do however feel full quicker when eating.
Overweight	Undecided, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	35-44	10/8/2009 8:23:19 AM	The first 10 days of taking a half dose of Adipex, the side effects were insomnia, dry-mouth and slight dizziness.  After a few days, my body adjusted and I had no problem sleeping. After after that, I started taking a full dosage and have lost 5 lbs but started having severe headaches so I have stopped taking this medication for a few days and may re-start on the half dose again.  Side effects have been bad in my case but this drug is very effective as an appetite suppressant.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	4	4	Female	25-34	10/5/2009 10:25:00 PM	I have been on Adipex now for a little over 2 weeks and have lost close to 10 pounds! I am curious to know if using generic or regular makes a difference. Also I feel as if I have to force myself to eat at times because I know my body needs the fuel. Is there anyone who has taken this, gone off of it and noticed a crazy difference in their appetite? I'm sure eating less now it is shrinking your stomach, I guess I'm just nervous about when I do go off of it(after three months) will it be easy to live the same lifestyle? Any support, comments, suggestions would be great! I'm also looking for others to e-mail and keep in contact with(kind of like a support group!) My e-mail is: canalsitter09@yahoo.com

Overweight	LillyRo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/2/2009 11:37:45 AM	I started taking Adipex weighting 168 pounds and Im only 52!  After taking in for 3 months I lost 30 pounds.  I have to admit I did not take them as I should have I would take them only 5 days a week, Saturdays and Sundays I would try on my own.  This worked for me because ones I stopped taking them I did not gain any of the weight back.  My doctor advised me to take them for 3 months straight and then give my body some rest from the pill for 1-2 months and then begin the treatment again.Im currently back on the pill to loose the remaining weight!  I truly recommend Adipex as long as its consumed with control.  One of my girlfriends has become addictive to it she has been taking them for 3 years now and that is highly dangerous.

That may not sound like a lot to mst of you- but it used o take me 2-3 months to lose 8 pounds!  I'm starting to incorporate exercise into my plan.  I had foot surgery in December and am still slowly healing, so my cardio is restricted.  I'm very happy right now with my rate of lose.  Lose too much too quickly and you'll get sagging skin.  Lose slower, and ou have a better chance of firming that skin as you lose.  I'll update again next week.Good luck to all.

After that i didnt lose a pound, i kept taking it hoping i would lose more.Then I went to my gyno who did some blood work, i wasnt losing because i developed &quot;HYPOTHYROIDISM&quot; yes people this drug stopped my thyroid from working properly, its been 2 years since ive taken it... ive put on another 30lbs and i now weigh 200lbs.. I quess im want to say be careful just because it works doesnt mean itll make you perfect there are long term effects.Plus when you lose weight fast youll have saggy skin.
Overweight	RJC79, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	9/27/2009 9:48:14 PM	Wow, I have never, let me repeat, NEVER! had any type of will power. When the doctor was giving me the life style and habit change chat and was thinking, wow this is going to be hard. I started taking the pill when I woke up and had 1 cup of Special K cereal with a half cup milk and that was it. I do get the &quot;jitters&quot; that everyone was reporting but that is not from the pill it is from a low calorie diet. During the next 8-9 hours I have as much water as it takes to satisfy the dry mouth and a Wal-Mart branded Granola bar (90 calories) and no lunch. At home I eat a moderate dinner, mostly grilled meat and any side we choose to go with it. I found with this pill the hunger pains are gone 95% of the time. How wonderful! I have done no real exercise, just yard work. I've been on this pill for 7 weeks and have lost 40lbs. Holy crap is this that a great number. Still want to lose 40-50lbs more. Wish me luck! All in all if you have read this whole raving, this pill is worth it. Good luck!

I just wanted to share my story with you all. I took this drug about two years ago. My starting weight was 180 and by the end of 3 months I weighed 139. A total of 41 lbs in 3 months.. holy cow! I loved it. At this time in my life I was a college student and drank alot. I knew that the dr's had warned me about drinking while taking this medication.. but I didn't listen. After taking this for awhile.. and drinking alot, the next night would be horrible. I would wake up in the middle of the night and my whole body would be numb, I couldnt speak to tell anyone what was wrong, I couldnt walk to get help,I would have a cold sweat, and I had a very very fast heart rate. When this started happeneing I started having panic attacks during the day. And if anyone knows what a panic attack feels like... its horrible. Finally I hit rock bottom.. one night I have a seizure/tremors. Finally looked up the side effects and decided to stop the med. I COULD HAVE DIED BC OF MY STUPID DECISION!!!Please please take mine and the dr's advice when taking this med!Now a year later.. Sober! Went back to the dr because I wanted to try it again. Got it 2 days ago and already lost 6 lbs. I don't exercise, with the exception of being on my feet all day at a hospital. I do eat very healthy. I incorporate weight watchers  into my routine.Anyways, this drug is great for losing weight. But please please take my advice and DO NOT DRINK. No one would want those side effects.Peace and Love to All!!!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/24/2009 12:00:14 PM	I started adipex back in 2008 and lost overall 50lbs but lots of inches. I was a size 16 and now im down to 7/8. No side effects except for constipation. Adipex gave me the energy and allow me to drink lots of water. I done little to no exercise and very pleased with my weight lost. I recommed this to any one over weight to try adipex before considering weight lost surgery. Through my insurance, the rx cost me 5.00. Within the first mo, Ive lost 10 lbs and it continue to drop from there. I had to follow up with my dr every mos just to make sure everything was ok.
Overweight	Kristen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	9/24/2009 11:37:17 AM	I started on the generic adipex on 9/9/09 and last weighed in on 9/20.  In a week and a half, I lost 5.5 pounds.  I started on the full pill and then cut it back to a half and still do not feel hungry.  On the full pill, I could go all day without eating.  With only half of the pill, I occasionally feel slight hunger.  The only side effect that I have is extreme thirst.  My throat gets so dehydrated that I constantly feel like I have a hair in the back of my throat, and no amount of drinking seems to cure it.  It's why I switched to half a pill.  So far, I am very pleased with my progress.  It would take me two months to lose what I lost in a week and a half!  Now, I look forward to weighing in Sunday morning.  I'll post my resluts then.

I feel great.  But I have turned down alot of food. Brownies, cookies, onion rings and all the food that got me where I was.  I dont even want them anymore.  That is just cheating myself of of life.  You have to make smart choices.  I dont even buy any junk food for the rest of the family.  We all now eat fruit and veggies as snacks now.  My only problem is what kind of meat can I fix and eat?  I have been eating mostly chicken and fish because that is the only thing i know is lean.  If anyone knows how to help me or knows any recipes please email me @ barbie13233@yahoo.com

And with exercise and watching what I ate I lost 26lbs. I still have about 15 or 20 more lbs. to go. I am no longer losing but have not regained any either. I am hoping to restart the pills with approval from my Dr. this week. I believe the pill also gave me the needed energy. I did start myself on .5 the pill for 7 days to see if there were going to be any side effects, to which there were none. I believe they are jsut the thing needed to help me rid my  extra weight.

It is September now and I am back to 180 and just feel so fat and bloated! Should I get back on it? Does anyone have any advice on what i should change up in my diet and workout to not make it so boring? I'm kind of being a junkfood junkie again and not working out so much.

I have adopted new eating habits to prevent weight gain after I reach my goal weight. I eat lots of fruits and vegetables. I am addressing reasons behind emotional eating and finding other ways to cope. This medication will not work on it's own. You must decide that life is important and take charge of your future.

I started taking the pill after talking with my doctor about my health. It has worked wonders for me with the only side affect being that sometimes I am wired at night and unable to fall asleep. I have lost a total of 71 lbs in less than 8 months. The pill really helps but I also had to add alot of exercise and healthy meals for the times when I did eat.

I was off my blood pressure meds at the time so im guessing the adipex may have had something to do with it. But I have gained some of my weight back and want it gone! So Im thinking of giving it another go. The other thing that bothered me was the back ache. I had lower back pain like in the kidney area. Im hopeing that wont happen again. Wish me luck! I should start it again next week.

I tried Adipex a few months ago and i was loosing 3lbs a wk. I got back down to my normal weight of about 167 loved it. The Adipex was wonderful as far as appetite suppresant and energy to exercise. To make a long story short I stopped taking them and after doing so Ia m exteremely hungry all the tome and I've gained back twice the weight just as fast as I lost it.I have gained 12Lbs every month for 3 mos straight!! I would advise anyone taking this medication to eat healthy and exercise or you'll regret it. I couldn't eat for 2 days sometimes which is not healthy. It's great for people who want to loose weight fast but it has to be used correctly.
Overweight	amjhall, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	8/26/2009 1:52:05 PM	I am 31 and weigh 200 lbs.  I have tried this pill before but was getting horrible headaches, jitters and dry mouth.  I couldn't take the headaches so I stopped the medicine.  I decided to give it another try and day one, horrible headache again!  So, day two I broke the pill in half.  Much better!  Today is day three and so far so good with half of a pill.  Hearing all of these success stories and similar stories of side effects gives me hope.  I hope to lose about 25 lbs. Got back in the gym last night and really able to watch my calories because while on this medicine I look at food as fuel, not as my crutch for dealing with everything!   I'll keep you posted. Good luck to all.  If you want to reach out to me, amjhall@sbcglobal.net.  Many blessings!  
Overweight	radian, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/25/2009 6:52:57 PM	I began this medication on June 2, 2009. I am ending my 3 month cycle with a total weight loss of just under 20lbs. That's what I needed; it was a plateau. I have learned to leave food on my plate, eat proper food at proper times and make overall lasting changes. I have always known &quot;what to do&quot; but overwhelming urges to eat (I LOVE FOODS!) and snack combined with an erratic schedule, early change of life issues and such led to my adding over 30lbs in a short time. This med cleared my brain (as antidepressants helped depressed people get their tools in order) so I could utilize my dietary and exercise to the fullest. I am so happy to have has this chance.

I control my cravings cutting vegetables in small pieces with low fat dips, 100 calorie snacks and lots of water at least 8 glasses.  Im not good at drinking water but I use crystal light its delicious.  Ive incorporated jumping jacks and other low impact drills to my routine.  Walkin also helps to increase your metabolism instead.  My email is alyssaweightloss@gmail.com and my msn messenger is mujerdepasion@live.com
Overweight	gayle, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/21/2009 2:40:32 PM	I started on Adipex on July 5, 2009. I weighed in at 279. Now, on August 21, 2009 I am at 267.5. Not bad, but I need to exercise more. I have trouble with cravings in the late evening. I did not have this problem the first 2 weeks, then started to get cravings. I also started to plateau. I am surprised that I have plateaued so soon, as I still have over 100 lbs. to go. I am just going to try harder to overcome my cravings. Maybe by drinking more crystal light? Reading evryones experience has helped me to stay on track. Overall the pills have helped me as I could barely make it without them - and believe me I have tried. I live in a house full of thin men (husband &amp; sons)who have never had to diet in their entire lives. I will check in in about a week to let you know how the 2nd round of the prescription is doing.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/20/2009 10:37:25 AM	I was 194 lbs. I lost 20 on my own and plateued. My doctor prescribed adipex. I lost a pound per day in the first week and lost 20 total. It lost is effectiveness towards the end of the Rx. I lost another 10 on my own and called my doctor for a refill. It is much less effective the second time, but has helped me through this 2nd plateau and I've lost 5 more lbs. The only side effect I had was dry mouth. I didn't need to sleep much and never had any food cravings. I only ate when I felt weak or jittery. I had lots of engery to exercise everyday. I highly recommend Adipex.

Overweight	subsailorslady29, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	5	Female	25-34	8/16/2009 8:17:09 AM	I just started taking the generic version of Adipex 37.5 mg on 08/15/09 to help me continue the losing weight. Insurance doesn't cover it, but it wasn't expensive. I only paid $21.95 for it from my regular pharmacy. I have never really had any trouble maintaining my weight or losing but, after I got really sick in Sept of 2008 and was in ICU for a week and was given all kinds of Steroids and pumped full of fluids and gained 40lbs I was unable to take that extra weight off. I have had some adverse health side effect because of it such as High Blood Pressure, Edema, and countless others. In the last two months I have lost 20lbs on my own and my doctor asked me if I would like something to help control my appetite. He prescribed the Adipex and said I can only take it for three months because after that it would no longer be effective and that I could become pyschologically dependent on this medication. I take it once a day after breakfast and so far haven't really had any side effects other than feeling jittery, and lots of nausea. I take Chloral Hydrate at bedtime for insomina that I have had for years, so I would be unable to tell if the medication is causing more insominia or not. I started out 2 months ago at 220, currently I am at 200. My goal over the next three months is to reach my ideal body weight of 135-145. Would like to really be at 125lbs. I am 5'7&quot; with an average body frame. I eat fairly healthy and get exercise regularly. I have always been very self-conscience about my weight and I am hoping that with a little extra boost from this medication I can obtain what has seemed so far out of reach for so long. I am not expecting miracles, no pill can provide that, but I do hope this helps shove me in the right direction. Good luck to all of you that are on this medication. Will update y'all on my progress in one month and let y'all know how I am doing. I am glad that my doctor suggested this medication. Any advice please e-mail me at lisakay_0219@yahoo.com

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/12/2009 11:19:14 AM	I have been on adipex since friday and I have lost 11 lbs and it hasn't even been a week yet.  I still have the cravings for what ever the rest of the family has, but i seem to not eat it.  I dont have the burst of energy that everyone says they have, I dont have to have a nap everyday or just feel like sitting on the couch all day long.  Before I started using this I had to drink energy drinks to get me through the day.  I dont feel like I have to eat all day either.  Some days I even feel like not eating at all.  And the sex drive is in overdrive.  Crazy

Im drinking a lot of water and walking my dogs every night for only 20 minutes! My hunger has decerased A LOT and this is definitly inspiring and giving me back hope! Get a Rx from your M.D, dont buy the phony online stuff! Believe me, I'm the diet pill queen. 
Overweight	Skeetle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/7/2009 11:20:03 PM	I started taking prescription Adipex 3 days ago. I absolutely LOVE this medicine. Ive tried everything to lose weight and this seems to be working. Like most, I have serious dry mouth and cant get enough water; but I get dehydrated easily (Ive even had to be hospitilized for severe dehydration before) so I consider the increase in water a great benefit. I know it sounds bad but I am not hungry at all! I feel like I can concentrate better and am able to get a lot done. I think this is because I am no longer worried or stressed out because of my weight. It seems like it has worked wonders for mostly everyone and Im excited to see the results that lie ahead! Im wondering if the people who havent had success are people who didnt get a prescription from their doctor. When I told my doctor that I tried it before after buying it online, he said &quot;You cant get this online, what youre getting is basically a placebo.&quot; Which is completely true. In comparing the one I bought online with the one from an actual doctor, the pills looked TOTALLY different. I can feel the prescription strength Adipex working and felt it from the first day. 
Overweight	notorious, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/6/2009 4:03:43 PM	I started taking half of this pill from 28th July and then switched to one tablet daily from 4th August. So fat I have lost only 3 pounds but I am sure it is going to be better in coming days. I have strictly controlled my calorie intake because I can't exercise on a daily basis. I started at 157 pounds and today i weighed at 153 Pounds, not sure if it is the usual fluctuation or the effect of Adipex...Will have to continue and see...
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/6/2009 3:07:39 PM	FIrst off - this is not a magic pill, if you are not willing to count your calories and exercise more you won't get teh results you want. I've been on this pill for 6 weeks, I just got back from my doctor's appt and I have lost a total of 18 pounds since starting. The drug helps curb your cravings and does give you extra energy to become more active. I felt a little off the first few days, mainly a kind of dissiness and restlessness, but it went away after 48 hours. Other than that no other side effects. My blood pressure has gone down and I know exercise about 3 hours a week.I can't imagine anyone taking this pill without their doctor's supervision. There are very real side effects and by no means should it be taken recreationally.That said, I have a lot more work to do and more weight to lose. This pill just makes getting through the day easier.

I can say since I have taken this medication I have lost 40+ lbs. It did take an adjustment to get used to, I had a dry mouth &amp; shaking, but it has proven to be the best thing for me. I was at 256 lbs in January and now in August I am down to 212. It is almost ubelievable but I am truly greatly. I have been able to maintain the weight when I go off the meds every other month and this is my last month. My life is much better I have more energy I eat several times a day and I drink plenty of water. Good Luck to anyone who may be thinking of taking this for weight loss it is worth it, and i am glad i did.

I had my metabolism tested and I have a very fast metabolism which could explain why I'm dropping the weight fast.  I curently wear a 14 looking forward to an 8

My email is : jamiekwatson@yahoo.com, as well as anyone who would like to share.  I have been on adipex since June 16th and so far I feel inches lost, clothes fit looser; however I have not weighed myself as I do not want to get disgusted.  I know that weight loss doesnt happen over night and it takes time, so thats why weighing myself is not important.  I do not take them everyday and I have found that my stomach has shriken because I eat less.  I have to be very careful because after taking the pill I never feel hungry until late at night and thats not good!!!! I have not been excersing , I know I should.  I may weigh in next month I will post then.  *Good Luck* Jamie
Overweight	blessedmomof3, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Female	25-34	7/30/2009 9:54:09 AM	I started taking adipex on 7/22/09, I have lost about 5 lbs with less then moderate exercise.  I have changed my diet a great deal which in my opinion has help with the loose of the intial weight, if I excercised even more, im sure I would have lost a lot more.  The only side effects I have really had is the dry mouth, which is wonderful becuase all I want to do now is drink water and this is coming from someone who barely drank water.  THe first 2-3 days I had the jitters (could be due to the cup of coffee)  had one dizzy spell, I guess becuase I got up too fast and the fourth day I had a killer headache all day. (not sure if the meds were an attribute)  I haven't had the burst of energy as I have read in others reviews but I did wake up once in the middle of the night unable to go back to sleep for several hours. But over the last few days I have had no side effects so in my opinion this medication is wonderful. I was apprehensive at first to take it becuase of the side effects, but the good out weighed the bad and what medicine is available out here without the possibility of side effects, so here I am and looking forward to the next 3 weeks to see how much more I can loose.  i am excited b/c I have been struggling to get past the plateau which I have now I just need to shake of like 20 more lbs :)

Many Dr's I went to refused to give me a diet pill and I know I needed it for a suppressent.  I have been on it for 3 months and the weight is coming off VERY SLOW... ive lost 12 pounds so far... skin is starting to sag so I dont want to lose it tooo fast.  Since I dont have medical coverage, it was pricey at a grocery store. I just went to get another refill at arget and I paid $14 for it.. so now I think Ill go full blast and take it eceryday.  I need to drop this weight as I have other medical problems.

I feel great and have NEVER been able to loose weight any other way before.  I was considering surgery, when my Dr. suggested this.  I am SO grateful I did this instead.

Doctor recommended diet and exercise along with half a pill before breakfast.  I have had the runs from time to time and it definately encourages me to drink more water because it gives me cotton mouth.  I have not had any other side effects.  My diet is only consisting of certain foods and a 1200 calorie diet under doctors care.  I have lost 10.5 in 14 days.  I don't know if it is the medication or the diet.  I plan to not take it this week and see.

I don't take it every day, mainly because I get the jitters! (Obviously because of the ingredients) I took it about everyday-every other day for 2 weeks, and lost 10 pounds by the next month's check up. I didn't really work out, but I have a 2 year old that keeps me busy!My only concern, is that when I don't take the medicine, my head throbs. I get severe headaches, almost to the point of just wanting to crawl in bed and sleep it off! I don't know if this is normal, or if any one else has had this problem, but over all, Adipex works for me.

Overweight	ldfr4250, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	7/20/2009 6:00:55 PM	I'm an 18 year old newly wed, whose husband just deployed. Before he was leaving, I talked with my doctor about trying to lose the excess weight I have packed on since my active days of highschool. (I graduated early and have been in college for two years now.) She suggested the adipex and I agreed it was worth a shot. I filled my prescription on a Wed. and from that day, til the following monday, I had lost 11 pounds! I was so excited, but granted I was exercising regularly and already watching my diet. After that monday, I had to quit taking it for a few days due to a blood pressure problem. I have since started taking it again, but have yet to get on a scale. I was so pleased with the results, but I do have some side effects. I find that the drug makes me slugish, and I often feel as though I don't have the energy for long days like I did before. I do however, have energy in the things I do, just not for long 18 hour days like I'm used to working. I do stay very nauseated and do most oftenly have diarreha. I only plan on taking the adipex until December, as my husband should return in march and we would like to concieve. Wish us luck!

Worst side-effect for me, however,is the increased irritability/temper. Best part is that midday naps are reduced, so I use that time lifting @ the gym instead, which in turn has given me more definition/muscle mass. Another plus(which I have not seen posted here) is that my sex drive has SKYROCKETED(can't get enough)...was wondering if anyone elde has noticed the same

I am about 5'2 and weighed almost 220 lbs. I now weigh 158. So its been a life changing experience for me. I started taking the medicine and eating healthy, which is simple, because i have no appetite. The only thing i struggle with is getting really irritated throughout the day. I've went off the medication for a months at a time and gained a few pounds back but no more than ten, and i was eating like crazy. The important thing is, when you stop taking it to maintain your diet which is easy to do, i just got depressed and stressed and let myself go, so now im back on it. My goal weight is 140 so i hope to reach that if not less in the next 2 months. This is a great diet pill and there is no reason you shouldnt eat right, it suppresses any cravings.

Overweight	jmgirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/8/2009 11:56:03 AM	I started taking the generic Adipex almost 2 months ago. I am 5'8&quot;, and started at 197 lbs. I now go in for my 2 month weigh in tomorrow and my home scale says 179. Doesn't seem to give me the energy it did in the beginning, but still supresses the appetite. Not sure it meshes well with my Celexa or if it is just the drug. Not sure how long doc will let me stay on, but goal is 140-145.
Overweight	bookofwisdom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/6/2009 8:33:56 PM	My doctor could not believe how quickly the weight came off with this drug. He did not believe me when I told him I was eating healthy meals. It was the first time in my life I could actually feel full and stop eating.
Overweight	mamaceb, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	7/6/2009 12:23:51 AM	So far it's been 1 week and I have noticed a lot more energy, no cravings of food so I have to remind myself to eat  and I never eat big. I take a multi-vitamin as suggeste by my doctor.  However I feel like crashing if I take it in the early mornings before breakfast as I am told to so I take it around 10am  and by 8pm im ready for bed.  Only thing that I dislike it the dry mouth but I just have a stock of gum to help with that and I drink tons of water. I'm 220 now and haven't weighed myself because I don't want to just yet but I do fit more comfortable in my clothes already.
Overweight	tiggergal_8, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/5/2009 11:57:36 AM	I have now been taking Adipex for 19 days and have lost 15lbs so far. I am 5'11 and weighed 210lbs when I started this medication. The insomnia and headaches are gone now. The only side effect that doesn't seem to go away is constipation. Taking OTC stool softener seems to help. I've been keeping a food journal and tracking what I eat and how I feel along with an improved diet and exercise. I'm still very impressed with this medication and how it's helping me. My target weight is 140lbs and I think I'm well on my way to achieving that goal.

I have since stopped and went back into my old bad habits and would love to get back on the adipex. However getting to the doctor every 2 weeks was just not fitting into my schedule so if anyone has a 'legal' way of obtaining this thru the internet please let me know.

I take the generic brand for adipex-p and I have lost 38 pounds since I began taking them on March 17!  Before then I had been stuck at exactly 167 pounds for 3 years after having my second child.  Honestly I have done nothing else besides take one pill every morning about 10 am, no excercising (yet), and I eat the same foods I always have.  Took about 3 days to get totally used o the pills 1st night had trouble sleeping felt a little nauseous, but after those first few days I've been feeling great.  My doctor also gives me a b12 shot every 2 weeks.

Overweight	snoop2009, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/1/2009 9:00:23 PM	Adipex has been the help I needed to see some results with weight loss that will encourage me to make long lasting changes.  I gained 30 lbs from taking Lexapro and could not take it off with dieting and exercise.  2 weeks of Adipex and I have lost 8 lbs and I am weaning myself off the Lexapro and feel great. I have to watch my BP - but I am restricting salt and eating heart healthy so it has stayed under 140/82.Most women who have taken Lexapro experience a weight gain and even if they have always been able to lose weight through regular diet - Lexapro prevents weight loss.  I found a Dr. who was willing to let me go on Adipex short term so that I could finally turn the corner on weight loss and make the necessary changes to my life to be healthier and happier without anti-depressants.

The only thing I do not like is the insomnia, which I hope soon passes.  Please wish me luck and I will send my luck out to all of you.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/28/2009 9:20:40 PM	I started taking this medication on June 10th, 2009, so far I have lost 19lbs. I started a low carb diet and purchased a Wii. I am contributing all of this to my weight loss. I started taking 1 pill a day for a week and then decreased to 1/2 pill in the morning and 1/2 midday. Sometimes I skip the midday dose or take 1/2 late in the day. Taking 1/2 a pill helps with the dry mouth!! I think this drug is a great boost but I definately know that I will have to make a lifetime change in order to maintain the weight loss!! Good luck to everyone!!

I take 1/2 pill @ 6am each day. I am not sure it is enough as I am still very tired and no energy. My appetite has not changed and I don't eat differently, except I was told not to eat after 6:30pm.  I am starved when I go to bed at approximately midnight! I definitely do not loose sleep at night.  I am a little disappointed in the amount of lbs. lost. It is still more that I normally lose without Adipex.

I have been on Adipex for six days and have lost six pounds. I take my dose a half hour before breakfast. The only side effects I've noticed were insomnia the first night and frequent dull headaches. I've completely changed my eating habits and think this is helping contribute to the weight loss. I have more than enough energy to keep me motivated all day long. I feel great and am happy with the results so far.

I lost 41 pounds in 3 months. After stop taking pill, first 2 days I was sluggish. Got my butt up and continued my day as if I was still taking pill. You have to eat properly on this med and drink plenty of water, same when you stop. I am not wanting to lose anymore weight, I am concentrating on toning now. If you have only been weighing yourself, you are cheating yourself! Measure your waist,arms, hips,etc. Fruit and vegetables are great. Get smart with what your eating. Breakfast is SO important. Work out in your living room if you cant go to the gym, I bought a large medicine ball and wow did it make working out easier and was so effective! Good luck to all, be blessed  you have been giving the opportunity to get this med!

Overweight	cancerqueen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	6/14/2009 7:36:06 PM	****Update*** Its been 6 weeks so far, I have lost 13lbs on generic 37.5 1/2 pill 2 hours apart. started 189lbs. I workout 5 days a week(cardio, weighlifting/toning. I am happy with the progress. I have gone down 3 sizes, so I am well on my way towards my goal of 145-1501b. Though I was concern,I was losing the weight slower than others,  My doctor said this is normal to lose at least 1 to 2lbs a week, because drastic weight loss, u will gain it right back and then some and also the first few lbs are mostly water. So I am right on track. ***Advice for those who are working out, (weight lifting/toning etc)like myself u are building musclesas well, so don't get all worked up about the lbs. I am not planning on being on this med for more than 3 months, so I have about 1 1/2 month to get to my goal. Good luck all!!!

It is now 6/5/09 and I has lost 11 lbs. I am age 25, 5'0, and started out at 163. This pill really works. I take one pill at 7am, and go to the gym 5 time a week and do cardio for 30-50 mintues. I have not had any bad side effects other then a little dry mouth, which causes me to drink alot of water so, i guess that's a good thing. I do not eat as much as I use and if I'm not hungry. When I know it's time to eat a meal and I'm feeling hungry I drink a meal suppliment drink and I'm ok. I have tried alot of pill in the past, but this one actually got me the results I was looking for. I will follow up in 30 days with my next wiegh in results.

Overweight	On My Own, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	25-34	6/3/2009 7:44:35 PM	Let me start by saying that over the course of 3 years I lost 118lbs on my own, just changing what I ate and working out. But for the last 2 years I have been stuck, mainly because of my eating. I'm an emotional eater. I returned to old habits as far as that goes. Don't really believe in taking &quot;diet pills&quot; but my dr said this is only an appeitite suppressant and thats all I needed. Was hesitant to take, but I did. First week went really well, love the fact that I don't think about food constantly and don't crave sweets! Second week has been rough! I started getting severe headaches that intefere with my life, severe dizziness, chest pains, shortness of breath, nausea. I was taking the whole 37.5 mg generic pill. I didn't take it for 2 days then took 1/2 pill and noticed the same effects just lighter. Not sure what to do. I like the effect it has on me as far as not wanting to eat all the time, but not sure it's worth it. I know I can lose it on my own as I did before, just stuck and needed a boost to help with my appietite being messed up. Haven't decided what to do yet. Has anyone else experienced this and if so what did you do for it?

I've on adipex about a week &amp; I can't say its helping. I took it upon myself to increase to 2 pills a day. This dose works much better.  Lost 3 lbs in 3 days. I'll talk to my dr. this week to ask her to increase dosage to 2 a day. Crossing my fingers.

I have been on it for 2 months and have lost 18lbs. I walk for 45min 5 days a week and have changed my eating. I do treat myself to a small ice cream cone every once in awhile. I feel so much better. I have had no side effects I have more energy and I am more motivated to keep loosing now that I have started loosing. I do notice the longer you take it the less it works but it sure does help.

Overweight	dt, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	5/29/2009 4:53:37 AM	I have been taking Adipex since April 22nd and it has really helped me lose weight. I have lost 32lbs as of today. The first two weeks you lose weight quickly and the it slows down a little but you still gradually lose.  I have followed the doctors eating plan and drink plenty of water. I do exercise 3-4 times a week but nothing major (treadmill, lifting weights). As far as eating, I eat(usually) a wheat bagel for breakfast, some fruit, maybe an egg or two....for lunch I have a sandwich with usually turkey/ham/cheese, or chicken w/some fruit and dinner I rarely eat usually pick on fruit.  All I know is that is working for me. There has been a few (very few) days I ate pizza or something good....but I don't over endulge.  Early common side effects diminished for me within two days and I still have the energy from the medication to this day.  I go every two weeks for a check w/the doctor....so far so good....good luck.

I have lost 10 pounds in 6 days. I lost almost 3 pounds just the first day of taking it. i can say so far i am very happy with this drug. Although I am not overweight so to say. I started at 158. But I just had a child not even 2 months ago. I was 125 pre pregnancy so my DR prescribed this to me to help me get back to my pre prego size. But so far so good. No side effects or trouble sleeping. I don't even exercise but yet the pounds are coming off although i'm sure i should exercise!! i will update in a few weeks

Overweight	JessicaM, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	5/26/2009 8:15:30 AM	This diet pill worked so well for me for a long time but after 2 years of taking it 3 months on and 1 month off if doesn't affect me anymore. The first month I took it I lost about 20 pounds and that was with little diet and hardly any exercise. You wonder why they don't just sell them over the counter. My doctor recently put me on Tenuate(sp?) and I am going to take this for a little while then switch back to Adipex.
Overweight	Dlasonja, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/23/2009 5:49:48 PM	I went to a weightloss clinic and was prescribed Adipex. I have been on it for 3 days, and so far I have to force myself to eat. When I do eat I do get full really quick. As far as side effects, the first night I could not sleep, but I bought some herbal sleep tablets from Wal-Mart, and have been sleeping like a baby every since. Today was the first day I worked out. I will post more as the days go on. I weigh 308lbs!! so I was desperate! I gained a lot of weight in less than  a year from taking anti-depressants. I was considering Gastric Bypass, but I thought I would give this a try first. I will post in a week to or two to update my weight. This really works for me. I take 37.5mg a day. I take mine an hour before lunch (11am or 12pm) and it lasts for 12 hoursI'm a night owl, so I needed soemthing to last until midnight.
Overweight	autumnsky11, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/23/2009 12:17:18 PM	I began using Phentermine for a short duration of time, it worked to my satisfaction with a diet change of no carbs, and excercise for the duration that I will be on the meds till I reach my desired goal, and then collaborate with a nutritionist to change my eating habits and live a healthier life. My initial doc. retired and I have found another, however, this time I will be using Adipex. I read some of the reviews and noted that some lost 5-8 pounds without excercise and some lost 3 in the first week and none after.  It is quite important that you begin a regimen of excercises with your diet and overcall change of eating habits if you want this to work properly. Secondly, someone inquired about being taken off the meds after 6 months; for one month. In my own experience, that occurs when the doctor feels you are close to your goal weight or it is just time to get you off for one reason or another. For myself, and 3 other family members, it was done to determine our eating habits at that point and to see if we can sustain our weight without gaining or continue to lose without the dependentcy of Adipex or Phentermine. Also to see how one feels off the meds. While under this substance I strongly suggest you do not only take the meds and cut down on foods, sweets, but condition yourselves and educate yourselves on eating healthier,  working out, and just having a change of lifestyle for those that are obese or have problems remaining at their goal weight. You work too hard to gain it all back after you are done. Whether you are taking Adipex or Phetemine - this med is only taken for a period of time and cannot be taken for long durations at a time. For instance you reached your goal in 6 months, gain a good amount in a month because you returned to old habits, and then decide you want to get back on the meds. Not recommended nor healthy - I speak of my own experiences, my own research, and my collaboration with my doctors - on the why, if's, buts and so on. Goodluck

I was able to eat only when I needed to and not when my brain was always telling me to. I never knew that feeling existed.  I've since lost sixty pounds that took me 4 years to gain and 6 months to lose.  Being able to think about other things(like exercise) instead of whats for breakfast then lunch then dinner.  I love it.

Not too bad.  Could go quicker but 11 is better than none. Two more months and they say I have to go off of it for 6 months. Anybody else told this?
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	5/21/2009 11:51:03 AM	I am loving this med.  I have had some side effects with trouble sleeping, however my doctor assures me this will wear off when my body gets adjusted to it.  I also have the dry mouth but have accepted it as a good thing actually because all I want is water when before all I wanted was cokes.  I have only been on it for a week and half lost 9.7 lbs and am full of energy and hope.  I started out at 188.7 and weighed in yesterday at 179.0.  I decided to opt for the weight loss shot also, to help with the inches.  I am sure it will not be this rapid all the way through, but definately gets me pumped about sticking with it.  I will fill you in on next week's weigh in.  If anyone else wants to email me and talk about results  mmw812000@sbcglobal.net

It really helps curb your appetite, practically leaving you without one, and I lost 5lbs  that week, I thought this could finally be IT, however, about half way into my second week I started having severe dizziness (felt I could pass out), ringing in my ears, and even worse, shortness of breath. It felt like someone was sitting on my chest and I just couldn't get a full breath!! And the headaches, oh my!! Needless to say I had to stop, I'm  disappointed but know it's totally NOT worth it! 
Overweight	cancerqueen, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/17/2009 1:58:32 PM	UPDATE*** Its been two weeks on the generic brand and I have lost a total of 8lbs so far... When I started taking the med I was taking the whole pill in the morning, the first few days where okay, I only had the dry mouth... and after 4 days I was getting alot of chest pain and gas and tension headache, it was unbearable and I had no appetite whatsoever, so I have to make  myself to eat at least 4 small healthy meals a day. I like this med cause it does make u change your eating habits, to eat more healthy food... So now I take 1/2 pill about 7:30 am and other 1/2 at 10:30 am...  and its been working wonderful, i only have the dry mouth, easily solved by drinking water or chewing gum... I skipped one day, cause I think my body has gotten used to it, so I will start taking it tom.  I also changed up my exercise routine 4 to 5 days week cardio and weights. I believe I am losing inches more than the lbs. will update after 1 month when I visit my dr.

I go next week for my 1 month weigh-in at the doctors office. I guess 9 pounds isn't too bad for 3 weeks, but I do wish it was coming off faster. I feel that I am doing all the right things and Adipex definitely takes away any cravings I used to have. I skipped 1 day of taking the pill and that seemed to jumpstart the weightloss again. Hopefully it will start coming off quicker! I would love to be thin or at least thinner this summer!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/12/2009 1:18:26 PM	I started to take adipex on 05/05/09. Exactly a week later I have lost 7 lbs. I did weigh myself on 2 different scales so that may make a differene. I do not have any side affects anymore. At first it was just dry mouth but that is now gone. I have walked 35 mins 4 times. Which is actually the only excersize the doctor has told me to do. The plan is a 1200 calorie a day diet (which is alot easier since I am not craving food ALL the time) walking 5 days a week for 35 mins and a half a pill twice a day. Thats it! I am not a skinny person tryin to ger skinnier.. im fat trying to be healthy and look good so MY goal is 80 lbs in 8 months. We will see if I can do it! If you set goals it makes life much better. Oh yeah.. and since ive started the diet.. knowing ima get my sexy back just makes me happier. Things dont effect me nearly as much and if they do I have the energy to walk it out! haha

Weight yourself daily so you can keep an accurate up to date info on how you are doing, if you go up from a day look at what you ate or workout and go from there

It definitely helps with my appetite. I eat fewer calories, do not crave anything, have lots more energy and exercise 5 mornings a week, so I do not understand why I am not losing more. Any suggestions I would like to hear them. I have approx. 65 pounds to lose.
Overweight	45 pounds, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/10/2009 5:49:19 PM	It has been 1 week. I am now only having dry mouth as a side effect. I take it in the morning. I am not hungry and love that! I drink water all the time. I have lost 9 pounds in 1 week!!! I could have never done it without this. I eat less and have energy but not crazy energy like the first few days.I can sleep now since I started taking it earlier. I love the new me. I can wear smaller clothes and they look good. 36 more pounds to go. I want to be my normal size by my sons graduation on June 9th. Lexapro had turned me into someone I did not even recognize. I want to have myself back. Adipex-P is giving me that. I was a size 3/4 last August. When I went shopping the week before I started taking Adipex-P, I had to buy a size 14. That is crazy. It was rough for a couple of days without sleep but it is well worth it. Keep taking it. Try gum and water for the dry mouth. Remember to make yourself eat something because you have to eat. Good luck.

Im not going to weigh myself until I go back to the doctors in 4 weeks. I have a ??..Does the adipex actually help you loose the weight? I know it curves your appitite and gives you energy BUT if I was to just not eat as much, get over being hungry all of the time and got my lazy butt up to walk.. would it have the same effects?? My goal is to loose 80 lbs in 8 months so we shall see what happens. ALSO I am taking a half pill two times a day I do notice I still get hungry. Again this is only my 2 day counting so I dont know whats normal yet. The dr said you will be able to tell after 3 days if you should start taking a whole pill 2x's a day. What are you taking??  THANKS! You can email me at michelleooo513@yahoo.com or answer here.

It has really curbed my hunger, I am barely finishing my meals, when I used to go back for seconds and thirds. The side effects for me were sleepless the first few nights, but I sleep ok now, extreme dry mouth, and pressure headaches that come and go and are sometimes pretty bad ones, but Advil takes care of them. Overall I am happy with the results so far, and will continue taking it because none of the side effects have been serious enough to stop. 
Overweight	cuba, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/6/2009 10:48:31 AM	I've taking Adipex on and off for a couple of years. I keep a spare stash for those monthly days or parties. :) The first round I lost 17lbs in 2 weeks, a total of 63lbs. From size 12 to a 4/6-lowest I've been since i was a teenager! I started working out 2-3 days and eventually became addicted to it doing it 6 days, 1-1.5 hr tops. Loved the changes my body was making. The trick is drinks lots of water and excerise. Water activates the pill ingrediant and allows you to flush out your system. First few days I barely eat until my body adjusts. For those of you that see no weight loss after 4 weeks...the 1st month you lose the most in lbs, 2nd month less lbs but more inches, 3rd month you're body is adjusted and retaught to eat healthier &amp; lbs/inches are slower pace. Not sure if any of you noticed but your body doesn't enjoy fatty or sugary foods anymore. It's a good weight loss pill and it teaches you to eat healthy. As for those asking about constipation, I asked my dr and his response was &quot;if you're not eating, what do you expect to let out&quot;? I suppose it makes sense. Well, wish everyone luck and lots of lbs lost. 
Overweight	Tatiana, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/6/2009 2:41:29 AM	To Zeeva: I'm older also, had weight gain of 35 lbs after hysterectomy. Tried dieting, exercising; nothing worked for me until Adipex. In 45 days I've lost 31 lbs. Because it's an amazing hunger suppressant, Ihave plenty of time to make healthy food choices. I've kept a food journal, documenting my meals, calories and weight on a daily basis. Doing this has given me the opportunity to see what works and what does not. I also report how I'm feeling physically because of the side effects.  I tend to have palpitations, however when I eat properly and don't restrict calories too much it doesn't occur.  After 2 1/2 wks. I plateaued. Having everything written down gave me the opportunity to see what worked and what did not. For anyone who is not losing weight as quickly as they would like, you may want to try it. I'm planning my menus in the am and making weekly goals.... Only 5 lbs away from my target weight and that's it for me.  The big clothes are already out of the closet.  I won't ever let the weight creep up again!  Good Luck to Everyone!!  From all the posts I read it sounds like you're all doing so great!  p.s. Zeeva - your medication may be partially counteracting the effect of the pill. I noticed that it happened to me as well. We just have to try a little harder:)  I just love getting old:)

These past five weeks I have only lost 5-7 lbs.  It has been up and down.  BUT I did go down 2 pant sizes in the last 5 weeks so I guess that is the benefit.

I felt like I had lost my mind. I could not concentrate. I had nausea, confussion and a headache. I tried to just go to bed but I could not sleep and my eyes felt like they would pop out of my head. I woke up at 5am feeling like a could run a marathon. I stepped on the scales to find I had lost 3 pounds. Of course, I took it again today. I take mine at 5:30 or 6:00 pm. I was told not to take it after 6. I want to loose the 45 pounds I have gained on Lexapro for migraine headaches. The headaches went away but the weight is unbelievable. Wish me luck! Good luck to all of you.

Compare to others, Its too soon to really rate it the way I want to, but it seems to be working. the only cons for me,I would say is the dry mouth and pressure headache, so advil is my new bestfriend...wish me luck and good luck to everyone on their success...will keep you guys posted...

Overweight	Lynn165, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/1/2009 7:06:50 PM	I have been on adipex for 6 weeks, I have lost 20lbs so far. I take a birth control pill so I dont know if i would lose more if I was off of the b/c pill.  But I am satisfied with my results so far. I walk at least 2 miles per day, &amp; do strength training 3-4 days per week. I have noticed if I dont take adipex for about 3 days I am very irritable. Started at 233 now at 213.
Overweight	Works4Me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/30/2009 2:59:12 PM	I started taking Adipex on 4/24 and have lost 5lbs. My starting weight is 200.  I like it in the sense that I only eat during breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner and my meals are usually 250 or below.  I just don't care to eat, but do because I HAVE TO.  Side effects so far were extreme cotton mouth the first two days, night sweats &amp; waking up, restlessness, mood-swings when I am coming off of it.  Pros are instant energy ALL DAY LONG, slim or no appetite, quick results.  Not sure if I want to make this a habit, but I definitely want to lose 50lbs before I quit.  Overall, I like it.  I hate to constantly feel tired and hungry, and that's the way I USE to be.
Overweight	nene, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/30/2009 2:10:51 PM	I am only on day 4 of the generic for adipex. I have read many reviews and said that I wasn't going to review until at least 1 week of taking it but.... I am a type 2 IDDM and about 290lbs. My doctor prescribed this and I am really hoping that it works. I don't get the energy like everyone seems to get. I must admit that I feel better and maybe increased energy but not marathon running energy. About 2 hrs after taking the pill, I get severe cotton mouth. It does go away but lasts for a few hours. I am also getting horrible headaches. Advil has now become my best friend. As of now, those are the only 2 side effects that I have experienced with taking this med. I can only hope that I am as lucky as the many on here in the weight loss aspect.

Basically a pound a day which is great! I haven't had any problems sleeping, I have tons of energy through the day and gives me the motivation to exercise. It definitely curbs my appetite and I have no desire to snack and only get hungry around normal meal times then I am unable to finish my plate where I used to have seconds.  I am starting to experience slight headaches but that is easily taken care of.

Overweight	girlieLA, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	4/23/2009 11:43:20 AM	Just started this week so I'm sure I haven't lost anything.  It does make me tired though.  I had to laugh at the energy stories.  If you have ADHD (for real, not just symptoms of ADD) you will probably be calm and a little sleepy on this med.  I'm sure that's the reason I respond in this way.  Espresso helps me sleep!  I have 25 lbs to lose to get to my doctors goal weight for me, so I hope it's not more than a couple months with the help of the Phen.  I also take a fat blocker, 200 mcg Cr-Picolinate, in combination.

I recommend getting the Benfiber packets that you put in your water bottle and drinking two a week.  Much healthier!

As of 4/23 I weighed in at 220lbs 16 pound weight loss I dont take the pill on sundays and sometimes I for get so I have about 5 pills left and then will go for check up I did lose 2 inches off waist area yeah!!!. I never experianced the dry mouth. I have found that I have to take an exlax or something to go, anyone know how to cure that side effect ?  and it does make me bad tempered if I'm not sounding crazy. I never snapped at people before which I seem to do all the time now ( they probably need it :) -But over all its all good for me the weight loss has boosted my self esteem and I'm looking good -

The first month I lost a lot faster but the doctor did indicate it is not about the speed of loosing but the effective ways to manage the loss after the pill.  I get hungry later in the evening so I started drinking tea to curb my late night appetitie.  I am at 198 and would like to be at 190 by week 10 when I go in for my weigh in. :)
Overweight	coachowens, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	4/22/2009 12:06:23 PM	I started taking the pill on 4/10 and have lost 6 lbs.  The pill was very effective the first week.  I don't think the suppressant is as strong this week.  I feel that I have to work harder to stay on my course of dieting and I'm struggling a little to keep from straying!  However, the 6 lb. loss has given me incentive to stay focused.  Dry mouth is the only drawback.

I just wanted to report current weightloss, for anyone else who had experienced the plateau or wasn't serious about exercising.  As of about four weeks, I'd lost 11 pounds.  I go for my eight week check up next week (so it's been two weeks since I last posted).  I'm serious about the racquetball (unfortunately, because I suck at it), I vary my calories (Easter candy), I watch my salt, and I consume vast quantities of water.  As of today, I've lost twenty pounds.

I can really feel and see the diifrence I can fit into smaller clothes and my stomach is getting smaller. I am happy, my goal weight is about 160 so I have a ways to go, but I am not looking back I am looking ahead, I drink a lot of water and I am not beginning to work out because I did notice that I was slowing down a bit. It is important to eat healthly though so that you do not get sick and have adverse side effects. To everyone who is trying keep up with what you are doing, don't give up it is well worth the benefits.

WELL NOW PEPSI OR ANY KIND OF DRINK TASTE LIKE ITS SWEETENED WITH ARTIFICAL SWEETENER. ITS NASTY BUT I HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING BECAUSE I WAS HAVING HEADACHES FROM THE WITHDRAWALS. NOW I CANT QUIT DRINKING WATER. AND I MEAN IT FEELS LIKE GALLONS A DAY. I ALSO GOT MY VISITOR THIS MONTH AND A MASSIVE ASS SINUS INFECTION. SO AFTER ANTIBIOTICS AND STEROIDS I GAINED 4 POUNDS. HAHA. I HOPE TO SEE REAL RESULTS ONCE THIS CRAP IS OVER WITH. I DONT EXPECT TO SEE MASSIVE AMOUNTS LIKE MAYBE 3 POUNDS THE FIRST MONTH. ANYONE INTERESTED IN KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH ME EMAIL ME AT KRAZZYLUV01@AOL.COM. WE CAN LAUGH AND FUSS TOGETHER. I ALSO NOTICED I LOVE TO EAT HEALTHY STUFF NOW. ITS GREAT AND IM CALMER AND HAPPIER.  
Overweight	Bloom0915, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/7/2009 8:03:56 PM	i have been taking the generic of adipex for 1 month 2 weeks and 3 days. i feel great. i don't exercise everyday, but a couple times a week, and i just started doing that. i lost 12 lbs. on just the pill alone, but i needed to start doing something to help tone up. i exercise for 30 min. a couple times a week. i walk and run for about 15 min. or so on my treadmill and some cardio. i noticed after i started taking the medicine that i was eating less and throwing away alot more food. so i changed my plate size to a &quot;little&quot; plate. and that really helps, i don't put more than what i can eat on the plate, and if i'm still feeling hungry, i wait for a couple minutes, and if i still feel that way, i will get a little more to eat and that usually helps. i try to have small snacks through out the day so that doesn't happen, but i'm not always able to. i recomend this pill for anyone who is overweight and looking for a solution. i've told just about everyone i know about adipex.

We are working on our house so I haven't started the exercise yet (doing physical work now) but overall it's great in most ways.   I almost forget about eating!  I gained about 60 lbs after quitting smoking and medication changes 2 yrs ago so I needed some help to get a &quot;real&quot; start on weight loss. I have always had dry mouth because of other meds but I have noticed an increase.  I have also noticed a problem with my sleep - I sleep about 2 hrs then wake up..2hrs more.. wake up.  I am a little jittery and have a headache behind my eyes that I hope goes away soon.  Even with these problems I feel they are minor compared to being this overweight.  I do have more energy and feel better overall. I have lost about 3lbs since I started but it hasn't been a week yet.  So far so good.. i'll update

I don't think the meds caused weight gain-I think I just felt so good &amp; started eating anything I wanted. Started Adipex 37.5 2/09 and have only lost approx. 5 lbs.  I definitely have changed my eating habits drastically &amp; have more energy;dry mouth side effect and bad constipation. I'm wondering if the adipex &amp; lexapro are competing against each other for weight loss. Is anyone in the same boat with me?  I realize age has a lot to do with weight loss. Any words of encouragement would be appreciated.
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	4/2/2009 11:22:34 AM	I started the generica adipex-P in January and had wonderful results. I have lost 20 lbs. Started at 198 and am down to 178.  I was wearing size 16, now wearing 12, looking to be a size 8 in few months.  I found new energy and since I have always exercised, that was never a problem, but when the weight comes off, you can exercise more and longer.  I started weight training 3 times a week along with regular cardio 6 days a week.  I have extremely toned arms and legs now, and my belly is the main concern.  I mostly watch my diet and portion control, but I don't deprive myself of any food. I have hit the plateau like everyone is talking about, so I quit taking the pills for a week and have started them up again, and seems to work for me so far.  I have maintained my weight loss so far and looking to lose at least another 10 lbs.  My Doc said I could take the pills for six months, I am unsure whether I will need them that long.

He also stated that if you loose too fast your body will stop because it goes into survival mode.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/1/2009 11:37:54 AM	This is my one month update. I started adipex beginning of may 09. It's now April and I have lost 11 lbs so far. Was hoping for more but I am not complaining. The first 2 weeks were great. I lost most of the weight during that time. The 3rd week was not good. I didn't lose anything and I felt stuck at that weight. Weigh in was today (4th week) and I lost another 1.5 lbs. I enjoyed the review about &quot;shocking&quot; your body when you seem to be stuck. I think I am going to try that and see how it works. My goal for this month is to lose an additional 12lbs. This will put me at 235. A weight I haven't seen in awhile. Good luck to everyone and don't give up...

I took half a pill at 815 and already feel lots of energy. I find myself getting up and moving around the office and wanting to do more . I sit in front of a computer all day and can't imagine being on the whole pill not being able to use all this energy. I have the yawns- anyone else experience this?i am not wanting such  a dramatic result as these other posters. i would love to lose 30 pounds in 2 months but i don't think i could handle all the jitters. The doctor prescribed Adipex but CVS filled the generic &quot;phentramine&quot;.I am not sure i want to take 1/2 everyday. maybe every other day.i will report again in two weeks.
Overweight	KDP, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/31/2009 1:48:19 PM	I've been taking the generic for 5 days and I have lost 4 pounds.  I do have a headache, but I can't tell if it is caffine withdrawls or the meds. I like it because it cuts my cravings, which allows me to eat more healthy and eat a lot less.
Overweight	Needhac,  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female		3/30/2009 9:59:34 PM	I have been off and on the generic version of Adipex since June last year, totally regulated by my doctor.  I have lost 65 pounds.  The med works great, but over time the effectiveness wares off some, but it still works. Headaches and some jittery feelings are normal and will go away after awhile.  I have 6 pounds more to lose.  It is a little harder now, but I guess that gets me more ready to learn to keep my weight off without taking meds.  I am very glad that I was given the opportunity to lose weight this way.  New users, hang in there.

Overweight	usmc1195, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/28/2009 12:20:40 AM	Today was my second weigh in after being on med since 2/27. My first review on this med was 3/12. In 28 days I have lost 17 pounds.My current weight is now at 168. My dr advised me to NOT fill it for the generic. I went to Meijer and as it is going to cost me an extra $30.00. I dont mind that at all, I am wondering if anyone else has tried the generic and the name brand? What did you notice the difference between the two?  Blood Pressure was great. My dr wants me to go and have blood work ran 2 days prior to my next 2 week follow up to ensure all is good chemistry wise. I have been following the same routine as I last posted. Great Energy! I have definitely drank ALOT of water! My goal is 145. I will post again after I start the brand name pills. Good luck to all!!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	3/27/2009 3:59:53 PM	I started this medication five weeks ago.  In the first ten days, I lost a pound a day.  At my recheck a week ago, I'd lost a total of 11 pounds for the month.  My PA gave recommendations for the plateau that everyone seems to be experiencing:  she said to watch the sodium intact (the salt is making us retain the vast amounts of water we're drinking to counteract the dry-mouth), fluctuate the calorie intake once a week, and do one completely abnormal physical activity per week.  So I'm an avid horseback rider.  In stead of doing that one day, I'm going to play racquetball until I'm drenched in sweat and sore.  It's supposed to shock the body.As far as reactions:  dry mouth (of course), diarrhea, headaches, two nights of insomnia and my period came a week early.

Overweight	apple1441, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/27/2009 10:59:28 AM	I ran into a wall after week 2, lost 15 the first week and a half and then no movement for the last couple of week.  I started to eat carbs which I had eliminated and sugar as in desserts and now I am pushing past the wall.  I am wondering when I go in for my weigh in they will say to do half pill in the morning then half in afternoon.  205 used to be a number I really wanted to see, now I am sick of it.  I am ready for 199! :)
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	3/27/2009 9:31:03 AM	Today is day 1 for me.  Took pill at 7:30 this morning, feeling some gitters and excitability.  Hoping that as the day goes on I will start to even out. Going to give it a few more days and if I don't feel that my body is adjusting then I will probably consider cutting back to half a pill. I will keep you posted.

I have had severe dry mouth and a bad taste. I have also had trouble sleeping. I take one pill in the morning and one in the early afternoon. I am going to cut down to 1/2 in the morning and 1/2 in the early afternoon to see if that helps.

I am sleeping much better know than I did the first few days.  I still have a dry mouth, but not as bad.  I really watch what I eat and try to exercise at least every other day.  I started at 209.2 and now weigh 198.  I am hoping to get down to 160.
Overweight	Determined, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/25/2009 3:27:34 PM	I reported on 3/4 that I began taking this medication. I started out at 210 and now I am down to 196. The weight is coming off slower than I expected. I plateaued out for a few days with no weight change at all. The biggest side effect that I have experienced is cotton mouth with severe chapped lips. I have no problem sleeping at all. I feel like I am hungry and sleepy all of the time. Were's the energy that everyone keeps taking about? I need some! 
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/25/2009 7:59:15 AM	I had posted something back in January when I began this medication. I am 31yrs old and have never been even a little overweight even after having both of my children. Last March I had a total hysterectomy and within 8mths had gained about 40pounds. I was very nervous about taking this drug. I had been very depressed and fatigued and after talking with my doctor a couple of times we decided to give this a shot. I have always been a runner so we agreed together that before I started I would lose just 3-5 pounds on my own then give it a shot. I started running again back in December and went back to the doctor and I had lost 3 pounds so we gave it a  shot and WOW I had the energy I needed to get back to the way I used to feel. I am now off the medication and still running 5 miles a day and also still watch what I eat. This is NOT a magic pill because if so we all would be thin! I am a nurse and feel that sometimes people just need that little bit of help. If anyone is reading this and is overweight and feeling depressed, you can so totally lose your weight. It is not easy but if you truly put your whole heart and mind to it YOU WILL DO IT!!! I feel so much better and back to my normal me now. Well I wish everyone luck on getting yourself on a new lifestyle changing path! Tracie

Somebody have some answers please email me at adelrios69@hotmail.com
Overweight	morning star, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/24/2009 9:12:10 PM	I have tried everything to lose weight.  I started taking Adipex in Dec. '08 and as of Mar. '09, I am down 28 pounds.  I feel great and don't even feel hungry.  I haven't change much about my diet other than eating less of it!  I have 85 pounds to go and now, I can truly say that I believe I can do it!  I'll report back in 6 months!  Try it - you will NOT regret it!
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	3/24/2009 2:32:57 PM	I read over 100 reviews before taking this drug and was scared I'd be one of those people that has a terrible reaction to it. But I wasn't. Adipex is very helpful. It has given me energy and reduced my appetite. I haven't had insomnia. It has given me the dry mouth everyone talks about. All the water I've been drinking as a result has improved my skin. It's not a magic pill. (If there were a magic weight loss pill, everyone would be skinny.) If I weren't already very motivated and in tune with my body's hunger cues, it would be pretty easy to ignore the effects of the drug and eat whatever I wanted or &quot;because it's time to eat.&quot; Exercise and paying attention to your body's hunger cues are key. I lost 25 lbs last summer and got stuck at around 170 and stayed there for 5 months despite reducing my calories to 1300 and exercising 5 days a week (with intense cardio, not just walking). I've been on Adipex for 4 days and have lost 4 lbs. I'll update at the end of my two month supply. My target weight is 130.

Overweight	m1davis, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	3/22/2009 10:41:08 PM	I started taking this about a month ago. My boss at work has been on it for about 2 months now and is seeing AWESOME results! I could see a change in the way my pants were fitting. I love this stuff! The cotton mouth was horrific and couldn't wait for it to be over, but I did drink more water, so it wasn't a bad thing. I probably would lose more weight if I did more exercise than I do, I've started walking now the weather is getting better, and when I do I walk about 2 miles. I can't wait to lose more weight and be able to wear shorts this summer! I told my friend about it and she went to the doctor and got a perscription for it too... I think there is an epidemic of it going around at work now!
Overweight	Major Muscle Roper, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/22/2009 7:13:25 PM	Response to: annanfussell2YES!! My back was hurting so bad I thought  I had a kidney infection. Negative.  They did a CT scan and a bone disity test. Negative. It feels like the muscles are very tight on both sides of my spine. Just an achey feeling.  I take Motrin 800 for it and do a lot of stretching. I have about the same weight situation that you do though I was 140 just two years ago. As far as I know I have only read one or two others with the low back issue. Just started my second month, lost about 10 pounds so far...

Overweight	ruthr63, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/20/2009 12:45:34 PM	I have previously been on Adipex and did well. I start my 2nd round this week. I personally liked the side effects - dry mouth made me drink lots of water. And the extra energy was great! I lost 40 lbs and getting to start round two with the generic. Is it still true that the dr. can only give it to you for 3 months at a time? I need to loose about 75 lbs. before wedding.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/20/2009 9:11:10 AM	I started this pill on 3/3/09, and I have lost 9 lbs so far. I have awesome energy, not much of an appetite, and overall I feel better. For the previous reviewer, 2 weeks into it my chest hurt and my throat felt like it was going to close up. I hated the feeling but I also seen a pattern with it. I started with taking half a pill 2x a day and then switched to a full pill once a day. As soon as those symptoms came on, I went back to the half a pill 2x a day. I feel better. However, I take the pills close together because if I take the 2nd one too late, I can't sleep. My first one I take at 7AM and then the 2nd one I take at 11:30AM so I'm ready for lunch at noon. I'm proud for the little bit of weight I've lost but I'm working my butt off to lose lots more. My goal is 20lbs and 1 size by the end of April. I think I can do it. Good luck to everyone.

Curbed my appetite and my energy level was great!  I took it again on Monday morning like I do every morning and started experience extreme dizziness, and shortness of breath!  It was horrible and very scary!!!! I have no idea why it started to affect me that way after I'd be so successful with it since 3/3/09 and had never experienced anything like that with it!  I need a remedy for this immediately because I still have over half my prescription left and would like to continue for the 30 days prescribed!  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I take in the morning around 9:00 a.m. as I've done over the last couple of weeks!  HELP!

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	35-44	3/19/2009 10:21:32 AM	I started adipex 3wks ago starting a 1/4 pill then 1/2 to a whole one. At first it was great then 2wks 2days into it I felt like I kept having to take deep breaths to get my lungs full of oxygen.  I didn't really feel deprived of oxygen it was like they were missing the full sensation. I came to WEBMD to read up on it and called my dr. They said to go back to the 1/2 or 1/4 dose, but that it was just a side effect from it that is fine. Still on the low dose I keep taking deep breaths. Even though my doc says it is fine has anyone else experienced this side effect?

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/17/2009 11:55:37 PM	I am a diabetic with high blood pressure that weighed 195 lbs. My dr told me that I needed to lose about 30 lbs and that would help my high blood pressure and my diabetes. I tried watching what I ate, exercised and drank alot of water but obly ended up losing 2 lbs in 2 months. I am on a 1200 calorie diet due to my diabetes. My dr put me on adipex 37.5 (generic one) on Jan. 4 I took a half in the morning at 6am and then the other half at 9:30 am. I did not have a appetite all day and I had tons of energy which I really liked and did not have any problems sleeping at night. By the end of my first week, I lost 10 lbs, man was i excited and shocked, i did not expect to lose that much. I continued taking it that whole month of Jan and when I went back to the dr in Feb I weighted in at 169, I lost 26lbs in one month and I didnt even exercised. I was so pleased, my blood pressure was normal and my sugar had been good, which also pleased my dr. I continued taking it the month of Feb b/c I still needed to lose a few more pounds. By the next month I weighted in at 150. I lost another 19lbs and went from a size 18 to a size 12. I lost 45 lbs in two months and I was surprised that now that I dont take it I am still losing 1 or 2 lbs in a week and I am not gaining the weight back. I fell much better about myself and my health has approved alot. I would recommend adipex to anyone who wants to lose weight.

Called the doc and he said, &quot;15 lbs in three weeks, you must be going to strict on yourself&quot; so i took a few days ate some cookies and carbs, cont. to work out and now am at 203.5.  I still have 2 weeks until my full month weigh in! Just had to trick my body I guess.  :)

I lost 11 lbs.  I wasn't hungry, lot of energy too.  My problem was that I didn't excersise and didn't do any changes to my diet.  I do tend to eat to much even if I'm not hungry.  My Doc then put me on Bontril, been taking it for 25 days.  I'm hungry all the time and have NO energy.  Gained 2 lbs and just don't feel good.  I'm walking 2 miles 3x a week now yesterday I started going to the Y.  I'm going back to see my Doc today, I need to get back on the Adipex and give it another try.  This time I'm going to be a lot more active and I'm trying to eat a lot less carbs.  I don't know if she will give them to me again since they are habbit forming.  I have seen online where you can buy Phentermine 37.5, but are they the real thing ?  Anyone here buy them online without a prescription ?And is there a differance between Adipex and Adipex-P ?Please if anyone has any info, let me know on here or by e-mail..  alexandalex@mchsi.comThanks!

I started taking it one hour before lunch and still was hungry, didn't have no jitters and still was able to sleep at night. I changed up and start taking it first thing in the morning, by breakfast I was hungry. I told the MD that I had a high pill tolerance and that 37.5mg was not going to do anything for me, but he still gave it to me. Any suggestion on what I should do next.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/13/2009 12:37:30 PM	I am 25yrs old and at my last dr. apt on feb 17, I weighed in at 258 lbs. I cried. I have never been that heavy my entire life. I began going to the Y a few times a week for a 1/2 hr each time. In three weeks I lost 3 lbs. On 3/3/09 I began taking adipex. Now I excersice 5 days a week 45mins to an hour. I weighed in on the 3/11 and had lost another 3.5 lbs. It's definitely working and I feel very energized. For those of you who take the whole pill and get hungry later at night, try cutting it in half and taking one in the early morning and the other around noon. It really helps. Lately I have tried taking a whole pill in the morning because I was having a hard time sleeping at night, I sleep better but I also feel drained by 7pm. I like doing half a pill 2x a day. Good Luck to everyone trying to lose weight. It's really hard. I have found it easier when you have friends or family working out and/or dieting with you.

I have also been taking one whole tablet at 9:00 a.m.  I have noticed my appetite seems to increase around 7:00 p.m.  Love the energy, and the suppressing of appetite!  I have never in my life dranked so much water (dry mouth) guess that's a great perk!
Overweight	nurseling, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/12/2009 4:33:55 PM	Well, as promised I am posting exactly one month after starting the Adipex. I have lost 18 lbs (but that is with 45 min of cardio/ 30 min of strength training 3-4 days a week). I have been very pleased with this medication. I had the &quot;jitters&quot; and &quot;pounding heartbeat&quot; at first but that has since worn off. I still don't feel the need to snack and have maintained very good portion control. I have a lot of energy and no problem sleeping at night. Hope this helps! Good luck to all!

Overweight	usmc1195, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/12/2009 3:42:42 PM	I am 34, I started adipex 13 days ago. My weight was 185, today 174. Blood pressure was normal. I have included exercise at least 3 days a week, as my body is sore. I have really watched what I have ate as well as when. Eating every two hours and watching portions. Love the increase energy. The first 3 days I was wired, cleaned my house from baseboards to ceilings! Initially I did lack sleep, however I take my pill at 6 am and at 10 I am ready to lay down. Water is so important!!! I have had absolutely no pop. I have a large stability ball that I use for my exercises as well as 2 lb weights and 5 lb. I could go all day without eating but starving yourself is plain stupid. I am excited, 11 pounds in 13 days! I did go to the store after my Doctors appointment to get a Tape measure. That was my mistake, I didnt know how much weight I had lost until today but I knew I had lost inches. I will measure myself today and not do it again for two weeks until I go for my next weigh in. Good luck to all and thanks for your reviews..

I've changed my eating habits and I workout when my schedule allows (everyday this week). Someone inquired about purchasing Phentremine; take a look at  liposomexlabs.com.

Overweight	jayeburney, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	3/12/2009 7:45:00 AM	Update:Yesterday was my one month weigh in. I have lost 9 pounds. Started at 175 and weighed in at 166.  I'm happy with that since I was down with a sinus infection for a week and didn't take the med. It takes lots of water and you have to get some exercise, even walking, especially if you are post menopause like myself. Don't forget too, that if you are working out you will gain some muscle mass which weighs more than the fat you are losing. Use measurements and not the scale to really judge your progress. Email me at :MajorMuscleRoper@aol.com if you would like for more info/support.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	3/11/2009 7:10:34 PM	I just started this drug on 3/8 and so far so good. Today was my weigh in date since last Thursday and I lost 3.5 lbs. This is good for me since before  I took it, I was excercising everyday for 45 mins and lost 3 lbs in 3 weeks.. huge difference. The only thing that really bothers me is the lack of sleep. I go to bed at 10 but am awake again at 1am. However, I'm not tired in the morning from the lack of sleep. It's an awesome energy pill. I am still constantly feeling hungry but I think it's from all the calories I'm burning working out. Does cause horrible cotton mouth though. But I would definitely recommend this.
Overweight	apple1441, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/10/2009 1:51:05 PM	Did anyone get stuck on the same weight for more than a few days?  I can't seem to get past 205 and I have been 205 for the last week!
Overweight	Starvin Marvin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/10/2009 8:31:53 AM	I reported on 3/4 that I began taking this medication and weighed 210. I am on week 2 and I have lost down to 197. 13 pounds in one week is amazing. It does not curb my appetite, or cause me to have sleeping problems. I am hungry and sleepy all of the time. I have 23 more pills to go. I am hoping that I will continue to loose until I go back to the doctor. My goal is 160 lbs.

Overweight	pb9906, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/5/2009 11:16:37 PM	I started taking this med 01/14/09 and have only taken a half for maybe 30 days total. I don't even have to use the med every day and I've still lost 16 pounds in about 7 weeks without excersize! I was worried my body may get accustomed to the drug and that I would gain the weight back. At first I couldn't fall asleep, but then I got back into my routine. I have dry mouth so bad, I bet I drink about 12 bottles of water a day! When I don't take it, I get very depressed and aggitated!! I hate it, but it goes away after a couple of days. But I still hardly eat anything, so I know my stomach has shrank a lot. I would recommend for anyone trying to lose weight! 
Overweight	jth504, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/5/2009 11:05:43 PM	Not really sure if it is fair to rate my experience with this new medication already, since I only began taking it today. I had gastric bypass surgery in May of 2004 and lost from 303 down to 163.  I have slowly gained back up to 227 pounds, and my health is worse than ever. I'm anemic, have hypothyroidism, take topamax for migraines and frequent headaches, Xanax for stress management, Provigil so that I don't fall asleep at the wheel again, and now I am starting this new medicine. My dosage is 37.5 (the generic form), and my insurance doesn't pay for it (of course!!!). They'll pay for you to have heart surgery and all kinds of other surgeries due to waiting too long to take care of your health, but being PROACTIVE--NO, BCBS of Alabama says no, thanks! Doesn't make sense, does it? Like with birth control--they won't pay for birth control, but they don't mind paying for my cousin to have her 4th out-of-wedlock, who-knows-who-the-father-is, child, which will cost the health insurance company a fortune, and will be living off of our tax dollars because of all the programs out there for the people that live in &quot;extreme poverty&quot;. ( I say keep your legs closed, and the nation wouldn't have so many issues to deal with.)Back to the original subject-- My doctor also started me on a new medicine today that my night-shift nurse friend told me they give their patients at night to help them sleep. I took it for the first time this morning along with my Adipex---20 minutes later, I was bumping into walls and feeling like I had had a few drinks. 2 hours later, I turned into a zombie, never actually fell asleep, (b/c my children were with me) but I was extremely tired! I now know to take it at night. I can't wait to take my Adipex tomorrow and see how it makes me feel. I had absolutely NO appetite today. I ate 1 chicken sandwich for lunch and a few bites of boiled broccoli for dinner. I'm not &quot;full&quot;, I just don't feel &quot;the need&quot; to eat/snack. It's a good feeling. Wish me luck!!

When I weighed 1st thing this morning I was 210 lbs. At 2p.m. I weighed again and to my surprise....I weighed 207. I am sure that it was all fluid loss. I noticed that I was a ball of energy about an hour after taking this it. I don't think that I will have a problem sleeping tonight because I am ready to crash right now. I will be taking this medication for one month to see what happens. I am going to cross my fingers and hope to get down to 160 lbs.

Overweight	wanna be slim diva, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	3/2/2009 11:31:39 PM	UPDATE**** I wrote back in February when I first started taking this medication. My initial start weigh was 242 lbs and when I weighed in at the doctor on Friday, I had lost 2 inches off my waist and I am now 228. I have lost 18 lbs!! and I am so happy. I have struggled to lose this weight for a long time and I am glad that I have finally found something that curbs my desire for sweets, and I have practically taken soft drinks out of my diet only a can a week. Although it was weird in the beginning I can say that it is well worth and I can visiably see my pop bottle shape coming back. I think I may be at my goal weight by August. Good luck to everyone and if you can take it is truly well worth it.

With exercise (cardio and strength training) and the proper diet, adipex with help you lose weight too. I needed to lose 35 lbs, and am well on my way to my goal. I only have 1 more month on adipex, so I am really working out hard and watching what I eat. Remember this is not a magic pill, you must change your eating habits and exercise if you expect to lose weight and keep it off. Adipex will jump start your weight loss, but the rest is up to you. One drawback, the thirst! But I look at that as a positive, I am forced to drink water. And what better way to clear your skin and flush unnecessary chemicals from your body, i.e., sodium. Good luck everyone with your weight loss efforts. And remember stick to the size that makes you happy!

I never drank or pee'd so much in my life. I havent been working out..so busy right now. I am determined not to weigh myself till docs. Afraid of dissapointment. I definately feel different though.

It also caused me to have a great deal of trouble with constipation; which resolved itself when I discontinued the medication.

I has helped me with my appetite. I'm only 23 yrs. old and I already weigh 250 lbs. I'm hoping this medicine will be able to help me get back to where I used to be weight wise. In the course of the past 5 yrs. I have gained just over 100 lbs. After I took the medicine I felt a little jittery but that went away shortly after. After reading all the feedback on this medicine, it has given me hope that I will be able to lose weight along with excercising and the proper foods.

I think you just have to be patient to see the weight loss and you also should do some form of exercise.  I have lost just a couple of pounds 178 to 175 in 7 days. Just stick to  your healthy diet and at least walk a bit daily.  Don't give up!!! And drinks lots of water!!

Overweight	nurseling, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/13/2009 12:00:04 PM	Well, after gaining 40 lbs after nursing school and working nights..I finally broke down to my doctor. I had tried the low carb thing but it just seemed to make me cranky and the 18 lbs I lost bounced right back with an additional 10 lbs to boot. The calorie counting was hard and I still felt deprived the majority of the time. I started Adipex yesterday and was very surprised at how fast it takes effect. The side effects were a little scary. I have had panic attacks before and it feels almost the same. The heart pounding, dizziness, tingling, dry mouth but after a few hours the side effects decrease. I do believe I will need to lower my dose and take one half per day. It has greatly reduced my cravings and snacking binges. I have much more energy and feel like this will do well for me. Do beware the side effects and the dose.  I definitely recommend taking half the dose to begin with. Will post results in a month :-)

After having her a had post pardum depression and was put on Paxil, A year later I had discovered I had gained over 20lbs cause of the paxil. So when personal trainers still could not get the weight off I was put on this. I started on New Year's day and went 3 days ago for my first weigh in..I lost 18lbs!!! and somewhere during the month I stopped with the exercise(no matter what couldn't find the time) But for me this is great, I had tried any and every diet pill on the shelves and nothing worked as well and as long as this!!I do still have 52lbs more to go but have no doubt what so ever that I'll have any problems while taking Adipex.Dry mouth is the only side effect besides a little constipation in the beginning which I now take  Fiber Choice for and it helped!!!Can't wait to see how much I lose next Month......keep ya informed!!
Overweight	Major Muscle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	2/12/2009 1:17:44 PM	Today is day one for me.  I am 5'3 and weighed in at  #172 when I got my prescription yesterday. I have always weighed heavy from my days of weight training but it was muscle mass.  I found out my 25lb weight gain(all fat)in the last 12 months is from menopause. I am hoping to shed the pounds with Adipex. Walking 2 miles a day and dieting didn't work on my own so I asked for Adipex. HAP pays all but my $5 copay lucklily. Too soon to tell, we'll see!
Overweight	helenbishop, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/10/2009 8:16:53 AM	I have been on this drug now for a month and have lost 17 lbs.  I take half of a pill each day and I feel pretty good.  I don't have the shakes like some people have described, but do have a little trouble sleeping at night still.  I can't tell exactly how many inches I've lost, but I have about 15 lbs more to lose.  I am very excited because this drug has helped to kick the cravings that I had and if I do cheat and have chocolate, its very limited.  I am eating a very healthy diet and get lots of exercise, so basically the only thing that I have changed in my normal routine is the different foods and lot less of the chocolate, candy and cakes.  Can't wait to see if I can  maintain this lifestyle once I stop the drug.

Overweight	wanna be slim diva, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/6/2009 6:58:11 PM	I have been struggling with my weight as long as I can remember. I started taking Adipex on 2/3/09. At first I was skeptical and I figured what do I have to lose, the first day I did have the gitters and a very dry mouth, but.... I was determined. When I weighed myself at home the scale tipped at 242 and when I weighed my self on Friday the 6th I had lost 4.6 pounds, the scale read 237.4. I could not believe it!! I was a skeptic but I am grateful to know that it is possible and I hope I lose the other 87.4 lbs so that I can look trim and slim by next year this time. I have read the previous comments, don't give up it is possible, drink plenty of water and make sure you follow the doctors orders by taking in the correct amount of calories for the day. Be encouraged and lose weight to be healthy!!!

With my 5th I was told I had GD, I was sent to a nutrionist.  I lost 6 pds in one week on the diet they told me to follow.  It was and is not hard to follow watch your carbs.  Breakfast 45 carbs (anything you like as long as it's 45 and under, snack 30 carbs a slice of bread has 15 carbs, a small fry from McD's 30 carbs, moving on lunch 45 carbs, snack 30 carbs, dinner 45 carbs--Try to stay AWAY from red meats and fried foods of course.  But you may eat small portions of red meat if  necassary.  Okay back to dinner chicken, fish, pork, (baked, grilled)Half of a  Baked Potatoe with one tsp of (try Promise butter) salt and pepper...corn is the fattiest veggie there is so when eating corn have a cup and no other veggie, with broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, green beans etc.. you may have a cup of each.  I drink tons of water or substitute with generic brand of crystal light yummmmm.. snacks I eat fresh peach half with a cup of fat free cottage cheese, Kiwi on a wrap with fat free cream cheese and fat free strawberry jam another goody.  Just some Ideas to follow if you need more let me know... after I had my baby I stopped when I knew it was so healthy HUGE mistake!  I know am trying adipex along with my healthy diet, and excersise--Tae-bo, Tredmill, ab lounger...about 30-45 mins a day..I feel so energetic and WOW I can get things done without feeling Blahhhhh...Although I do feel hungry still I am now on my diet and it keeps you full.  So good luck to all!

However, I have been having severe PANIC ATTACKS and depression caused by the medication.  I was ok for the first 2 weeks.  I had dry mouth and constipation but could live with it as long as I was losing weight.  Then after the 3rd week things went really badly.  I had to stop taking the pills.  It has been over a week since I last took a pill and I am still suffering with depression and anxiety.  Be careful!  
Overweight	Jilly Jill, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/30/2009 6:31:09 PM	Hey there!  I am a 29yr old single mom and full-time college student. On New Years Day, I stepped on the scale and almost threw the dang thing out the window!!!  It said 200 lbs. I had gained almost 40lbs in 5 months.   :o( well...I have been taking Phentermine 37.5MG (Generic for Adipex-P 37.5mg) for 4 days now. &gt;I have lost 5 lbs&lt;  I am just getting back into the exercise thing again (YUCK)...making time is a freakin challenge but so is buttoning my pants lately - therefore... I CHOOSE to LOSE! My goal is to reach 150 lbs.  I used to be on the name brand version (Adipex-p) about 1 1/2 yrs ago and I lost a ton of weight.  I got down to around 155 and was EXTREMELY happy.  HOWEVER, after I stopped taking the pills, I slowly gained the weight back.  I did get REALLY sick and depressed, but my old doc didn't wean me off of it properly. It was MY FAULT for gaining the weight back due to poor eating habits!  I got really comfortable in my relationship and apparently just started shoving food in my face!  LOL!  Anywho, I am excited to lose weight again and FOLLOW THROUGH with a life style change this time. Sorry this is so long but I BLAME THE ADIPEX (Euphoria)...j/k.  My side effects have been pretty extreme.  I can't sleep at all, I don't want to eat (whoo-hoo), My mouth feels like a desert, and my moods are up and down.  My hands are so shaky that I'm writing like a doctor with arthritis! This happened last time and the effects subsided after about a week.  EVERY medication has side effects and losing weight is worth it to me!!  Gum helps with the dry mouth...so does Crystal Light (energy) YUM!Just wanted to share my (incredibly long) story and put in my 2cents.  I wish you all GREAT success with your weight loss journey and appreciate all the info my fellow &quot;adipex-ers&quot; have shared!  ~Many Blessings~ *here is a link to a website I found very informative about Adipex...just in case you are interested*  http://www.rxlist.com/adipex-p-

Currently, the pill is doing the job with boosting my energy and curving my appetite. I do feel jittery but Im going to start just taking &#189; a pill. Before taking the pill I was always tired, lacking energy, and unable to lose weight.Im debating if I should continue to take the pill... my concerns are the after affects, weight gain and health problems down the line. Has anyone had a successful experience after getting off the pill without having gained back the weight or having to deal with health issues after taking the pill? If you could please email me at buttafly1230@yahoo.com and on the subject line put Adipex
Overweight	Nikki Please, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/26/2009 10:54:49 PM	I have been on this pill for 29 days and am going on my first check up tomorrow... According to my scale I have lost 14lbs during the 29 days... I started at 217 and now weigh 202 I am trying to get to my healthy weight of 169 :) I have always been active... I am continuing my same workout schedule that I had before I started taking the pills... Roller derby practice 3 times a week for 1-2 wach time... Since I have lost the 14lbs I have alerady notice my skating speed increase which I believe is helping me to burn even more calories then I was before. I also have to force myself to eat. I eat 1200 calories on the days I dont have practice and 1600 on the days that I practice... You need to make sure that you don't starve yourself when you take these pills other wise you are setting yourself up for failure since your metabolism is going to be out of whack... Also it is important to make sure you are forming healthy habits while you have the extra assistance...

Overweight	babygirl2000, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/24/2009 12:36:31 AM	I am a 40 yearold female, and I have been taking ADIPEX-P 37.5mg. since Aug, 2008.  I never thought I would ever do another diet pill after the Fastin and Phinin back in the early 90's.  Then in December, the Dr. made me stop taking it, as I was going in for surgry, but then a week later I noticed that the pill wasn't working as well.  I would go in once a month for a bp and weight check, at no cost. I would get my RX at Wal Mart, and thanks to our Insurance, it cost me only $7.00 a month.  So if you have insurance, have your Dr. call and tell them it is Medically needed, and they usually pay a big chunk of the cost.  I wish you all the best of luck on you adventure to a NEW YOU.

I had my son in May of 2008 - I gained almost 80 lbs with him.  I am currently 215 and going to the Dr. today to get back on Adipex.  I was just wondering if anyone else has used this med before and after having a baby?  And if so, was it as effective after the baby?

My idiot of a doctor put me on Adipex and Wellbutrine.After a week of taking both medication I started to feel dizzy and nauseous. I threw up one day and have still been feeling dizzy so I went to the doctor today and saw someone other than my normal doctor and she said that the medications were fighting each other. Wellbutrine is for anxiety which calms you while Adipex jump starts your energy. WARNING do NOT take both of these medications together. I have to wait a few days for the wellbutrine to get out of my system before I can start taking my Adipex again.

When I began this drug, I was medically obese. I started taking Adipex on October 16, 2008. I have lost 52 lbs. in those 3 months. Yes- 52 lbs.. Adipex is AWESOME.  I did change my eating habits and do some exercising, but this would never have happened witout adipex. I had no side effects. I feel great all the time with tons of energy. And now I have the motivation and the jump start to continue losing weight. I have another 50 lbs to go. I would recommend adipex to anyone!! Oh, and I get mine at Meijer for 29.00. It is way more expensive at other stores so its best to call around.

I was biking and running for an hour everyday. Wellll...I took a 3 day break from exercise (partly because of rest, partly because of tests I had to study for) and I weighed in today, and I lost 10 pounds! I'm at 175! 20 lbs in 3 weeks! I eat 800 calories a day and work out an hour, burning 600 calories a day. And, I think the first 10 were water weight due to my menstrual cycle. However, my jeans still aren't fitting in the thighs very good..they won't stay up above my belly button though! So, I was being impatient..Only 30 more pounds to go!

I have never ordered off the internet, but my DOC writes a month supply and I only pay $21.00 at Sam's warehouse or $28.00 at Walmart. Going to the DOC everyweek is crazy. I hope you don't have to pay a copay for every visit! I have lost 44 pounds sense June 28, 2008. I love it. And good luck everyone with your weight loss!

I go to my dr every week and pay quite a bit to get a one week supply.  I have only lost 3 pounds, not having much sucess.  I am wondering if perhaps any of you are getting yours online as opposed to seeing a doctor.  I see a few websites offering it and thought that i'd try that route as it isn't overly effective for me and would rather pay less if i'm going to keep trying.  thanks everyone!

The first week I lost those stubborn 5lbs, then the lbs just started melting off with no exercise. Then after I started exercising, I started losing faster. The only thing that i hate about it is: My hair started thinning, so I had to start taking Vitamin E pills.
Overweight	Michigan Girl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/17/2009 10:21:12 AM	I will be 20 in March, and I started taking Adipex-P 37.5 MG yesterday. I also took this medicine during the summer of 2007 for 2 months. I found myself losing 20 lbs. the first two weeks, and a steady 5-7 lbs. per week after that, for a total of 55 lbs.  The only excercise I had was my summer job at a local museum (lots of walking). Since then I had a son and gained back 35 lbs. I am hoping for equal success this time. I have never had bad side effects using Adipex, I only notice that I am thirsty a lot, which helps with getting 8 glasses of water a day! While using Adipex, I find that it is extremely easy to plan a healty meal because hunger is not on your mind, and you NEVER over-eat. Best of luck to anyone who is just starting this medication, I hope it also works wonders for you!

If weightloss continues at the current rate, it's definitely worth it but you feel funny.

I have not weighed myself yet but I am experiencing the effects. I eat a small breakfast and it fills me up for almost the entire day. I feel excessively full though, like an overstuffed feeling? I do notice that I am less hungry and it doesn't take much to fill me up.
Overweight	leslie_land, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	1/13/2009 10:42:07 PM	Ive been on adipex for 4 days. I lost 2 pounds, then gained 3! the dr has me on 1200 calories, while i DO get hungry, im not starving and havent ate my calorie limit yet. I dont crave foods, but still feel hungry at times. I assume its cause im not hitting my calorie limit yet. I do notice it doesnt take much food to fill me up. Any ideas if this is a normal start? any suggestions? i drink tons of water, i cut out all my regular soft drinks, im trying not to eat nothing toooo bad for me, and if i eat something not so lean, its a very very small portion with a small number of calories. That hasnt been much of a problem, but im just really curious if the hunger issue is normal!
Overweight	austinbe12, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	1/13/2009 6:49:08 PM	I'm 20 yrs. old, 5'10&quot; and started off at 195 when I got on Adipex on December 30, 2008. I immediately lost 10 pounds in a week, then another 2. Then I started my period in my 2nd week of use...I had the worst cramps and headaches!! And I'm on medication for that! I haven't been hungry at all, and I have exercised everyday the past month, I get on a stationary bike for 30 minutes with a 6 resistance then a 'running machine' for 30 min. I typically burn 600 calories, then I sauna/steam. I only eat 800 calories a day. However, last weekend, I took a day off, didn't exercise and ate what i wanted. I got on the scale today and have GAINED 2 pounds! My jeans are actually getting tighter around my ass and thighs...I don't know what I'm doing wrong here..My face isn't near as puffy, but I'm literally freaking out over this! I walk 2 miles to my college campus and back everyday on top of the gym workouts. I don't understand why my ass and thighs are so swollen and my pants are tighter, when my 6 pack is already showing again and when I suck in, my ribcage is poking through.I've lost 50 lbs in the past, but stopped at 170 (from 220) and I have fluctuated between 170-190 the past 2 years. So, I never gained it all back, but I'm ready to get past 170. Any advice on what I should do? Or what's going on? It just makes me very upset because my boyfriend lost 100 lbs. on this med and my sister lost 50...I'm a size 10/12 with 42-32-42 measurements at 185 NOW, I was at 183 3 days ago! I just want to be a 6/8 at 145lbs. so bad..what should I change in my behavior? Am I just freaking out for no reason and being impatient?

Overweight	ladyt, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	1/10/2009 5:25:27 PM	First let me say I started in oct 2004 at 283lbs. WITHOUT any meds with JUST diet and exercise and going throug a divorce I lost 110lbs reaching 174lbs in 10 months. I am a 5ft 8in female so this was a good weight and got to keep my &quot;Betty Boop figure. I kept the weight off for about three years. In  the last year I put on 30lbs going to 207 I have been on adipex on and off for about6 weeks. The first 2 weeks I lost 15 lbs with diet and exersice going to 189lbs and platued i had to stop for a week because i had major constipation.  I gained 2 lbs back (prob in poop) When I started back with also eating 4 prunes nightly, i have lost another 4lbs. I think the week break helped to get the weight loss started again.My doctor only allows 12 weeks on this med every 6 months so my goal is more than half way done. i do take 1/2 twice daily because it did make me jittery.  I am happy with this.  I plan to wean down the last 2 week under my dr advice to get my body used to being without it and to prevent gaining the weight back. i wiil say it is  a lifestyle change to lose and keep it off from previous experience.  I became comfortable in a new relationship and cooking more and going out ot eat and not working out AT ALL. I now work out 5 days a week 30 miutes a day and eat well even before taking the adipex.  It was a last resort.  I tried for 6 months on my own and couldnt lose a pound.  This has jumpstarted my metabolism again. Im very happy with it so far.

Overweight	Mudslick, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/8/2009 11:55:17 AM	I took it for 3 months and lost 30lbs. My  doctor reviewed my progress every 30 days. My blood pressure went down. I felt great. More energy. But!! I had to loose 5lbs per month. The 4th month I lost 4lbs and she took it away. I didn't have any problems with the drug. Why make it so restrictive for those who get along with it so good? I went from 305 to 272lbs.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/7/2009 10:57:20 PM	I started taking it on 12/19 and as of today I have lost 15 pounds.  I started at 225.4 and today weighed in at 210.4!!!!  My goal is 155, so I have a long way to go, but I feel like adipex has gotten me off to a good start.
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/7/2009 10:52:04 AM	I have taken the Adipex for since 12/31/08 starting weight 289 one week later 281. I have lost 8 pounds in a week! It is really working for me. I've had a few side effects light headaches, a little dizziness, and dry mouth but I have not experienced any side effects that when intolerable. I would recommend Adipex to anyone willing to change their eating habits and willing to exercise. I did not starting taking Adipex with the expectation medication was going to do all the work!
Overweight	losingforlife, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	1/6/2009 8:35:46 AM	Today is my first day taking the adipex-p.  I feel a little bit different than I usually do, but I am typically very sluggish in the morning.  I am goig to track this drug and how well it works for me, as I am very skeptical.  I can't wait for the first two weeks to go by so that I can say for sure how I feel, what I feel, etc.  I typically eat pretty healthy foods, I just have cravings for sweet stuff all the time, which is why I cannot lose the weight.  I am almost 6' tall and weight 197.  I am hoping to drop 40 pounds to get to my ideal weight according to my BMI.  I exercise regularly, so that has never been an inhibitor of not losing weight, it truly is the cravings for the sweet stuff and the carbs that I love.  In addition to this treatment, I am exercising, planning a good diet balanced with proteins, fruits and vegetables at every meal and healthy snacks.  I also purchased online a cd from a hypnosis therapist who claims that you can lose the weight like that by training your sub-conscious mind to think healthier and eat healthier.  So far, I really thought it was working, but I think putting this all together will/should help.  I will post again when I start to see results of endeavors..

In my first post i had been using this drug for eleven days i think... well i am now in my third month and have lost SIXTY pounds!!! 60! I feel so amazing. I have not had this kind of confidence ever. I have been overweight my whole life and while i am still not a string bean(which i do not want to be anyway) I am enjoying my new slimmer, sexier, more daring self. The medicine has helped but, you still have cravings especially around the holidays, who wants to pass up all that good grub, right! my advice_treat yourself but do not overindulge because, if the stuffed about to pop feeling doesnt kill ya ....the guilt will! I am very happy tho! hope everyone who tries it has great results!!! good luck!

My doctor told me to do exercises that make your heart beat fast. He also told me that you dont want to lose weight too fast bcz when you get off it, you will gain it all back.

I recommend this to anyone who needs to lose weight. just remember to eat a good breakfast before due to you will not want to eat for a long time after, and you will get very weak. other than that you actually feel really good and energetic.

I have no side effects except i as, hot, but I was before too, so no big deaql. I started out in the &quot;big girl&quot; sizes and for the first time in too many years too count i can wear a size 12. My. dr. said I should lose another 35-40 lbs, &amp; then he'll talk about taking me off. I don't do everyday now and I started eating much better and joined a gym If I gain a few back becuase of sloppy habits it's my fault, not the pils. Here's to losing another 35!

And you DO feel tired and depressed if you just &quot;stop&quot; it..my dr went out of town and I couldn't get a refill, so I just quit taking it..I was &quot;weaning&quot; myself anyway, but the sudden stop made me feel really bad for about a week. Suggestion: Stick w/ appropriate eating habits and exercise..it's healthier than a drug!

My last post stated I lost 7 pounds. Now I am more than happy to report that I have lsot nearly 25! I am fitting in jeans and clothes I havent worn in years and absolutely loving it! The confidence and pride I have in myself has returned! I am glad I had the opportunity to try it and it work for me. I would and have recommended this to everyone I know. The New Orleans lifestyle has affected many of my friends and family, and I have been pointing to this drug. I no longer have any side effects and succesfully stick to my smart eating. I really cant say enough good no great things about it. I am happy again. 
Overweight	Chevon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	12/4/2008 1:12:08 PM	a few of my friends that aren't overweight started taking the pills first. they lost a lot of weight quickly. however i was 303lbs at the time and know from experience that diet pills r just a short substitute and u will gain the weight back quickly and maybe even more. anyway after a cpl of months and them looking great i decided to try. i have been taking the pills for 2 months now maybe less but u can see an amazing difference. i love taking pics so if u want to see face shots my email is diamonddejior@yahoo.com. people at work told me i look like a different person. i hope this doesn't come back to haunt me and bring back the weight. i have stepped on a scale because i fear that maybe i will b around the same weight and its all in my head. well where ever it is i feel better look better and i can walk more than 2 blocks without stopping. the negative is... the pills taste horrible. and ur mouth gets extremely dry... drink plenty of fluids or chew gum if u cant. trident tropical flavor has become adipex's partner in my life.

I was lucky  I had a very easy time on this medication, my first week I lost 13lbs. I have stopped the pill now because I was starting to have chest pains. I acually stopped the pill about 2 months ago and THANK GOD havent gained any weight. Once your on the pill for about 6 months you basically train your body to eat in porportion. I have to say once you start losing the first couple pounds it feels GREAT. I went from a size 42x32 to a 36x32 and a size xxl in shirts to a size medium or large. I had to get in to shape i am 20 years old and I want to make it to my 100th birthday lol. Good luck to everyone and god bless. Jeff

I gained about 60 pounds when I was pregnant and 1 1/2 yrs later I am still having a hard time losing the last 40lbs. I had plataued for 18 months trying diet after diet and stopping after I get discouraged from not losing anything. I have I have been on this medication for 3 weeks and I am really happy with the results so far. within the first 2 weeks i've lost 6.5lbs, and my next weigh in is Friday! Even though I haven't lost a huge amount like some here, I feel that i'm losing a healthy amount per week and for someone who has been so discouraged about trying and just not being able to lose, this is a huge esteem boost. I'll post more as I ocntinue and hope to lose that total 40 in time!!! I did experience trouble sleeping the first few nights, I took an otc sleep aid, non-habit forming, that helped a lot... other than that I get dry mouth, but it makes me drink the water I should be!! I still get hungry during the day, but I don't feel the need to eat, eat, eat... it's helping quite a bit!

I started at 155 and today I am 136 with a goal of 125. I work out 3-5 times a week. The first few days I had some palpatations and insomnia, so I only told half for about 5 days and then started a whole one and no problems at all.  I will say though dry mouth and constipation has been an issue but I suggest drinking lots of water. Good luck to everyone on their weight loss goals

The problem that I had is when it was time to come off of it for a week I had pretty bad withdrawals to the point that I couldn't work.  I discovered that you can't just quit taking them but you must wean yourself off.  I have decided that I need to do this on a weekend.  Other than that I love all the energy.

I am an active person but I always hovered about 20 pounds over the weight I should be at. My doctor had me start Adipex in June and I have lost over 20 pounds. I take it consistently for about 3 weeks and then I take 4 or 5 days off and then I start again. The only issue I have with it is that I have to take it before 9am or I can't sleep at night. I am so pleased with the results and I would definitely recommend it.
Overweight	latinfairy26, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	11/10/2008 6:05:21 PM	this is the 3rd time on 2 years that i take this medication, this time it really had a negative reaction on me. i took it only for 4 days. i was always tired, in a bad mood and super stressed. i did give me energy, but not like it usually would. now 3 days after i've stopped, i am miserable. i never knew what depression was, i have zero tolerance for everything even my 16 mo. old twin boys, which really upsets me. i am screaming at them and being very impatient, something that i used to not have trouble with. i hope this withdrawal effects go away soooon, b/c i am being a horrible person. i cry for half of the morning after i fuss with someone, b/c i feel so guilty, i dont like this at all.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Overweight	healthierme, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/7/2008 3:44:01 AM	Well,I started taking this medication on 9/6/08 at a weight of 238 pounds. By 10/6/08, I had gotten down to 213 for a loss of 25 pounds. I took a month off from it and now have another prescription for it to start on Saturday.The first 2 weeks, the only side effects I suffered was the insomnia and dry mouth. The dry mouth was easily took care of with drinking water and the insomnia went away on its own. I hardly exercised the first time I used it. This time I plan to exercise a lot more regularly. It has done a lot for me. I had a total of 60 pounds to lose. If it helps any, I was given the generic brand, which worked just as good for me.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/2/2008 11:16:46 AM	I have had great results with Adipex.  Started at 213lbs and I am now at 160.  I can only take it for 12 weeks and then the pharmacy says I have to be off it for 6 months before beginning another 12 weeks.  Has anyone else has this issue?  I havent gained any back but would like to continue without the breaks to reach my goal sooner. I am now working out 3-5 times a week and feeling great.
Overweight	smartblonde_9, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	11/2/2008 1:27:24 AM	I am 20 yrs old and weighed my all-time high of 201 lbs when I started Adipex a little over 4 months ago. My last weigh in was 1 month ago and I had lost 30 lbs but I measure success by inches rather than pounds. I have lost 3 inches in my waist and 2.5 inches in my hips. I work out as often as I can in between classes and other activities. The side effects have been very mild, mostly dry mouth and a some restless nights, but I already had trouble sleeping thru the night before I started Adipex. I love how much I dont crave the foods that were so hard to resist before I started taking it. I live off of campus cafeteria food so it is hard to eat healthy but with the extra energy my will power and desire to reach my goal make it so easy to avoid the really unhealthy things. I do treat myself now and then to prevent any cravings from getting too overbearing though. And I drink about 80 oz of water a day. I can go without thinking about food for a whole day, but you have to make sure you eat at least 2 well-balanced meals a day or your energy level will go down. My next weigh in is this weekend, I hope it goes well!!

Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/28/2008 2:03:19 PM	in january of 2007 i weighted 170lbs, i decided to do something about. i joined a women's gym and started working out everyday in 2 months time i had only lost 3lbs i stopped going to the gym and reached my all time high of 180lbs. i am only 5'3&quot; so it looked like i was whale.everyone would tell me you dont look that big you hold the weight good. so in september of 2007 i decided to see a weight dr because i had heard about adipex-p and how good it works. in the first month i lost 10 lbs. i was a little cautious about taking it but it gave me energy to lose the weight. now it's october 2008 and i weight 140lbs. i went from a size 16 to a size 10. i lost exactly 40lbs. i work out at least 5 times a week and eat right i have completly stopped drinking sodas. crystal lite and water have become my best friends. i love veggies more than ever. i have stopped taking the pill and i am just maintaining. i want to at least lose 10 more lbs and i will be done. i would recommend this to anyone who has tried to lose the weight and could not.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	10/27/2008 6:42:52 PM	I started adipex 3 weeks ago and I have lost 18 lbs! It gave me alot of energy, especially the first week. I was shocked and happy with my results. It did make me sick to my stomach but not enough that I needed to stop taking the med. I am now on my week off and will be starting another 3 weeks after that. I would say if you really need to lose weight this is a great medication to try! I'm keeping my fingers crossed for continued weight lose for myself and everyone else. Good luck :)

Overweight	jus4me, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/25/2008 2:06:15 AM	I was a little overweight in my early years but it was easy for me to lose once I decided to.  However, as I grew older, I noticed I was adding pounds on each year...middle age spread, depression and then menopause.  I was not able to lose any noticeable weight until trying Adipex-P.  I had tried other appetite suppressants such as Tenuate, Fastin, Pondimin and Redux in years past but either they did not help with controlling my appetite and/or I had &quot;jitters&quot;, restlessness and insomnia.  Side effects were not worth it nor could I function effectively at work.  Several years had gone by...often thought I would like to lose weight but...no self motivation.  I then heard about Adipex-P.  I have lost about 20 lbs over the past nine months...but I'm sure I could have lost more if I had put more effort in it.  But now that &quot;I&quot; can tell that I have lost some weight, I do desire to try even harder.  With Adipex-P, I do not have restlessness, heart racing, jitters, insomnia, etc.  For me, Adipex-P increases &quot;my&quot; willpower not to have this or that but also makes me feel like I did twenty or more years ago....I make not look younger but I feel younger and that is a good feeling.

While taking Adipex you will find yourself eating less and loosing the weight however, and i can not stress this enough, make sure you take some sort of vitamin. I deprived my body of essential vitamins resulting in a loss of 60lbs and A LOT of hair.  It has became hard to enjoy wearing the smaller clothes because now im worried about how noticable my hairloss is to others, and it is!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/10/2008 9:46:42 AM	I have been taking this med since september 15th 2008 and when I went to my doctors appointment I had only lost two pounds. I was expecting more. But I do have PCOS which makes it very hard to lose weight. So two pounds lost is better then two pounds gained. But I was still a little disappointmented with it only being two pounds. Any suggestions? I am watching what I eat and walking a few days a week. The doc said to take a break on the weekends from this med. What do you all do? I am thinking about taking it every other day? Maybe that would help and walking more. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to lose a lot of weight. If it works for me it should work for everybody!
Overweight	LeahG, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/8/2008 12:28:40 PM	I am a 24 yr old Female who had a baby 6 months ago, I've tried walking, watching what I eat, exercising, and its just not coming off. I was 212 lbs the day I had my daughter, and currently 181 lbs without the pills... I am excited to start them, because three years ago when I hads my 2nd child I was 193, after delivery I was 179, and started taking Adipex and within 4 months I was down to 132 which was smaller than I was in high school. I did experience dry mouth, but it made me crave water, which I needed, and it gave me energy to play with my children, and not dread work. Before I just wanted to sleep, eat, and be lazy, it gave me the push I needed. Oh and fiting in a size 7 jean after being in size 13 and maternity clothes. It was so rewarding. I am anxious to start taking them again, because I have some &quot;HOT MAMA!&quot; clothes I want to drag outta my closet. I will keep in touch, and post my updates...

I take one 37.5 a day.  It's been two weeks as of today, and I've lost 15 pounds.  I have so much energy with this medication that I actually WANT to work out.  It's done wonders for my energy and attitude.  I have experienced a few side affects though.  Approximately 45 minutes after taking the pill, I do get a little shakey for about an hour but that's when I will exercise and work it all out.  And the other one is cotton mouth.  I have 7 more lbs for my goal weight and then I'll go off the cycle for 2 weeks.  After that, I'll go back on it but not as strong, just enough to curb my appetite so that I don't gain it all back.

I have lost around 12 pounds without changing my eating habits. I have PCOS so it makes it really hard for me to lose weight.As for the energy I had a lot of it for the first week. It is like it worked really really good for one week then it wasn't as good. I am currently taking 37.5 in tablet form. I would definitely recommend this for anyone needing to lose weight! I go to see my doctor on monday so I will see what she says. Maybe I just need more of it, I do not know.

I 5&quot;2&quot; tall and at one point wieghed in at 208lbs.  I started taking Adipex in March and have since lost 45lbs. My energy level is higher than I can remember in recent years and the weight came off in no time without minimal exercise. Defintiely would recommend it.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/22/2008 4:39:28 PM	I am 32 and weigh 284lbs! I needed help. I have a condition called PCOS (Polycyctic Ovarian Syndrome) which caused me to gain 125lbs. I have tried almost all the diet pills on the market and have had no good outcome. I have only been takind adipex for three days but I do feel so much better. I have more energy for my 3 year old son who used to run circles around me. I feel more awake and energetic now more that I have since I was a teenager. I will keep you posted as the time passes and I have been on this pill for a longer time.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/20/2008 12:31:27 AM	I have been taking adipex for two months now and have lost 27lbs by limiting carbs and sugar.  My doc told me upfront that the generic wasn't as strong as the name brand.  I started with the generic blue pill and had great results but toward the end of month two the drug wasn't as effective in curving the appetite or the energy burst.  I have since switched to the name brand white pill and am back on track.  I highly recommend using generic first and as it begins to lose effectiveness switch to name brand.  The only negitive side effect was EXTREME dry mouth. Sugarfree gum is now my best friend.  It's a small price to pay to go from 198 to 171lbs.  I am 5'6&quot; and big framed so my doc says goal weight is 150lbs.  Only 21 more pounds to go!  Good Luck everyone.

I lost 5 lbs the first week &amp; on my 2nd week and only lost 3.  I weighed a pound more this am!  Is that normal to go up and down during the week.  i have cut my calories in 1/2.  I guess I am wanting the pounds to drop off really fast.  What should I expect the first month??  Please advise!

Overweight	Bella, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/12/2008 8:16:42 PM	I was over 200 lbs. My doctor told me to use this as a tool. I was doubtful at first but couldn't believe how well it worked. I lost 11 lbs in two weeks and I wasn't exercising at that point. I was so encouraged with the weight loss at that point that I immediately made lifestyle changes. Eating lean and grilled meats, lots and lots of veggies. I cut out all junk food and started walking around my street 3-4 x a week. I started in May and I've lost 52 lbs. I feel so fantastic, I don't want the junk food anymore, It's a MIND OVER MATTER thing now. That old lifestyle is dead to me. I look forward to that walk now, I love the way I feel afterwards.

I have lost 17 total, which my doctor said 10 lbs. a month was average. Also, different pharmacies have different generic, so I've tried two different kinds, the first kept me nausieated and dizzy (white pill), the second one (blue pill) - no side effects at all but weight loss isn't as high. I was told I could only have them for 3 months. Best of luck!

I weighed in at 261.5 when I started and am down to 244.5 in just 14 days, I actually feel like my goal is attainable now! The only side effect I've had is dry mouth but is easily taken care of by drinking water or chewing gum.

Having a hard time getting it.  I'm in perfect health other than being considered obese.  I'm only 5'1&quot; and weigh 204lbs.  I asked my doctor for it but she's old fashioned and suggested Weight Watchers....I've tried it four times...never lost a pound.  Someone please help....thanks.

Overweight	Trish S., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/3/2008 10:03:18 AM	I started taking this drug and lost 7 pounds the first week.  I then lost 5 pounds the next.  So far, in the 2 1/2 months I've been taking it, I've lost 35 pounds.  I am very satisfied.  My daughter and my mother have done very well on it.  My daughter has lost 25 obs. and my mom 40 lbs.  I have only 2 weeks left on the plan.  I worry about the &quot;keeping it off&quot; without the pill.  I hope there is something that I can take to keep me on track since I can only take it for 3 months.  Anyone have any ideas?
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/1/2008 10:47:51 PM	Started off at 170# and by the 7th week of taking the pills was at 150#. Weight remained the same by week 8. Think I may have hit a plateu-guess we will see. Very happy with the results so far. Hope to maintain without the pills.
Overweight	giveGodglory1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	8/30/2008 4:51:22 AM	I took this medication for a month without diet plan.  I lost four pounds and gained it back.  Now I am taking it (about a week and 1/2) in conjuction with B-12 and B complex shots weekly, 1000 calorie diet and mandatory 10,000 steps on pedometer daily.  I lost 7 pounds the first week. But haven't seemed to drop during the last few days.  I am planning to add more exercise.  Hopefully it will help.  My goal is to get to the low end of a healthy BMI.  My physician told me to plan to be there in 8 weeks.  Thats 31 more pounds in 6 1/2 weeks.
Overweight		5	5	5			8/29/2008 12:49:15 PM	In regards to the comment, &quot;The dr prescribed me Adipex, but when I get my prescription filled it is phentermine, I know this is the other form of it, but I keep hearing different stories on how each one works different. Does anyone know anything about this? Where do you go to get it filled as Adipex?&quot;Adipex is a brand name of Phentermeen. You were probably given a generic by the pharmacy but I'm pretty sure they're the same thing just different prices. 
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	8/29/2008 5:15:41 AM	This is in reply to the person who said that thier nose gets cold while taking this medication. I have been on this medication now for 4 days and I could not for the life of me figure out why my nose was freezing!! It is the wierdest thing, I am fine but my nose will be so cold (even to the touch). I love this medication and have seen no side effects except my nose. I don&quot;t know what it is but if I find out I will reply again. Good luck to all!!
Overweight		4	3	2			8/28/2008 1:18:35 PM	I have been on this medication for about 3 weeks now and at first it gave me alot of energy and it has appeared to be working. But lately I have been experiencing severe dizziness and nausea and I don't feel hungry to actually eat food to maybe make the symptoms go away. I was wondering if anyone knows if you can just stop this medication? Because I really dont want to have these side effects anymore, its really effecting my everyday activities. Thank you
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	8/25/2008 11:46:46 AM	I am a 23 year old female who is overweight and was searching for answers. Before taking Adipex, I weighed in at 305 lbs. I  have been taking Adipex for about 2 months now, and I have gotten down to 280. That's a 25 lb loss in months. I am so proud of myself. Adipex gives me energy, (especially when taken earyl in the morning). But it also has some down sides like cotton mouth, constipation, and deprevation of sleep. For the cotton mouth, I drink plenty of cold water. This also helps with the constipation, in which I add Miralax to my water. For sleep deprevation I take 1 Tylenol PM and I am out like a light. I am portioning my foods better, and making better food choices for a healthier me. Thanks Adipex.
Overweight	wannabehealthy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/20/2008 11:22:50 PM	I've been taking this med for almost 8 weeks. I went from 170# to today's weight at 152#.  This has all been with cardio 5x/1 hr per week and weights 3x per week along with watching what I eat and eating much less. I have had a few small splurges but nothing horribly bad. The appetite suppression and diminishedideas of thinking about food definitely does not work as well as it used to. The literature states that the effects will start to wear off after prolonged use. I didn't expect it to happen so quick but I am very pleased with the results. The best part about this is that it has helped me see results a little faster than I normally would have w/just diet and exercise. I feel that this helped me return to the healthy eating and exercise mindset that I &quot;used to&quot; have before kids,family,and a demanding job distracted me from making my health a priority in my life like everything else. I hope to maintain the weight with just the behavior and diet modification. If I lose another 2 lbs I will be at an acceptable BMI for the MD and they will no longer write the rx. Best of luck to everyone out there! Keep posting and encouraging each other.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/20/2008 2:36:46 PM	I have been on Adipex for 1 month now and have lost 20 pounds. Aside from have the normal weird side affects the first few days, the only other issue I have had is falling asleep. I may take 1 tylenol PM every now and then to help me out. I go tomorrow for my 2nd month checkup and hope that they dont take me off of this at 3 months. I am hoping for 4-5 months and then wean myself off the last month. I have struggled with my weight for years and have had 2 kids and now that I am over 30 my metabolism is very slow. I am also doing weight watchers with this pill and count my points and journal every day. I work out on the elliptical 3-4 days a week as well. I have completely turned my eating habits around and feel great. I have about 45 lbs left to go, just hope and pray they dont take me off of this pill before I lose the weight!

I started off at 295 and in a size 28 and now I'm 235 pound and in an 18. I considered many options to loss weight even surgery but when my doctor talked to me about this medicine I started it right away. I had the dry mouth at first but after some time it went away. So glad I found this medication, I really do believe it saved my life! 
Overweight	momgrowl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/28/2008 10:50:41 AM	I started Adipex on June 30th and I was 154 lbs, now 28 days later I have lost 9lbs(can't seem to get motivated to exercise). I feel really great about taking this medication. I have noticed a BIG change in my appetite and I do sometimes have to force myself to eat beacuse I don't feel like it. THe best part about this is that I used to be a soda junkie. I would have at least 4 cans of coke a day and now I only drink 1 (sometimes 2 if I'm stressed out), which I think is the best part of this medication. I do have the dry mouth, I just make sure that I have water nearby, I have also had the occasional chest pain as well. I also noticed that I have alot of aches and pains, mostly when I walk up a flight of stairs, does thi happen to anyone else? Overall I think this is the best thing that I have ever dsone for myself, I have tried many diets and failed, but this is by far the best. I will be getting a refill soon along with the weigh-in and bp check. Although I feel that I'm doing great looking at some of the weight losses mentioned here I feel as the I could be doing better. Anyone else feel that way or is it just me with weight loss envy? I will check in again to let you know more about the weight loss saga. Bye for now.
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	7/25/2008 6:22:06 PM	I have been taking Adipex for 1 month. So far,with dieting and regular weight/cardio exercise, I have lost 12 lbs. This doesn't really seem like much compared to some of the other people on this site. I lost the greatest amount of weight (8lbs) the first week. 2nd week fluctuated back and forth 1-2 lbs with a total weekly loss of 2 lbs. 3rd week fluctuated 1-2 lbs with a total loss of 1 lb. This week ended with another 1 lb. weight loss. Although I didn't have a lot of weight to initially lose it is still slightly discouraging that I have not lost more w/diet and exercise. I refilled the 2nd month's rx today and was told by the nurse that once I lose an additional 8 lbs. I will not be able to get another rx. My ideal goal weight is 140-145#. If I am lucky enough to lose another 12 lbs within the next month I will still fall short of my goal. Some things I have figured out along the way: if you don't stay hydrated constantly and particularly while working outthis med can bring on headaches. Also, after about the second week I began getting hungry late at night. A few times it actually woke me up because I felt like I was starving. If I drank a cup of oj or ate a couple of nuts it would go away until the next day. I think that when the med was wearing off my body was trying to get me to eat more to meet the natural calorie setting that it has had for the past few years. All in all- I am pleased with my weight loss , the energy, and change in eating &quot;mindset&quot; that this rx has given me. Will report back in another month to see if I've met my goal.

While that may not sound like a lot compared to some who have posted here, what's amazing is that this is all WITHOUT exercise. If I could find time in the day to work out, I would be dropping more weight, faster. I started a blog to document my progress.

The pains are like little pressure pains that come and go...usually in my right chest area.  They have gotten much better because I'm now taking 1/2 a pill per day AND I'm taking the generic of adipex called phentermine.  My doc says the generic isn't as strong and has fewer side effects.  This medication does make me feel fuzzy-headed at times and I may decide to take it every other day.  So far have lost 3 lbs after 1 week.  Not sure how long I'll take this medication.  It does take my hunger away.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	7/17/2008 1:51:45 PM	i have been on this pill off and on for about 3 years. i do get the extremely dry mouth. i also tend to get &quot;white outs&quot;. i do not take it everyday, i take it every other day. the one bad thing about this pill is that once you go off of it, you will gain all that weight back, maybe even more. 
Overweight	mhightchew84,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		7/16/2008 9:27:34 PM	Ok I have been using Adipex for a week now and I have lost 12 pounds so far.  I couldn't believe it when I saw my weight on the scale.  This is a really great pill to help curve your hunger cravings.  I do get the dry mouth badly but thats it no other symptoms.  I still have 3 weeks to go on this pill before I have to go back to the doctor, so I'll keep ya posted. 
Overweight	slimdiva, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	3	3	Female	25-34	7/14/2008 10:46:27 AM	I started taking Adipex last week and am surprised at how quickly the cravings went away. There are times that I feel medicated, but eating or drinking water helps alot. I don't know if this is a side effect or not of the medication. But I am having back aches and chest aches on my left side. It doesn't seem to be heart related because the pain moves around. Does anyone else have this same issue so I can be sure?
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/13/2008 2:00:36 PM	I started the generic Adipex (37.5pm) June 14th and I go back to my doctor on July 15th for a weigh-in/bp check.  I don't know how much I've lost because I've always been more concerned about how I look that the numbers.  However, I can put on my 'skinny jeans' that I haven't been able to wear since before I got pregnant -- 2 and 1/2 years ago!  Yay!

I immediately noticed my jeans didnt bite anymore!!! I am having the side effects of the dry mouth, but I am also experiencing my gums aching and almost throbbing. Is anyone else experiencing this? It was so bad I bought orajel to numb it. Otherwise, im happy with it.

I've always been a healthy eater and have never had problems losing weight until I had my daughter. I have always been smaller, and when I had my daughter I gained 44 pounds which shows.  I want to lose about 50 pounds to be at my goal.  So I'll keep everybody posted on how much I've lost an the side effects.
Overweight	corona, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	35-44	7/7/2008 8:17:24 AM	I just started this on July 4th. I have read in here for Adipex and the generic phentermine. If you go to pill.com you can see the differnt types and strengths. Also there is a list of all drugs that it is known to interact with. I too, have dry mouth and a nagging headache. I was told to take half a pill at breakfast and half at lunch. I see here it says to take whole pill  1 hour before or two hours later. Just makes me wonder. I have noticed I do not munch or need to munch all the time. I am doing 1200 cal a day with this. Not sure if it is the pill or my will power but it hasn't been hard to stick toit so far. Any ideas about the dosage, please reply.
Overweight	shalove7175, 25-34 Female 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	7/6/2008 8:16:57 AM	I have a question.  I am thinking about starting the medication and wanted to know if anyone knows of a MD in or near Santa Clara/San Jose that will prescribe it?  Thanks

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/5/2008 11:52:32 AM	I'm 5'5&quot;. I started this med at 170# according to the doctor's scale. One week later I'm down to #162. I've been exercising w/weights 3x per week w/cardio and 1 hr of cardio on the alternating days. This medication is GREAT. Definitely gives me more energy and a better work out. Initially I could tell that I was &quot;on&quot; something but I guess my body is adjusting to it more now. I have the dry mouth symptoms like everyone else-especially after taking it in the am. I drink more water to compensate-which is better for me anyway.I don't sleep as much as I used to and sometimes have trouble falling asleep. I have tried restricting caffeine  to earlier in the day-before dinner-and this seems to help quite a bit. My goal weight is 145 #. I will post again at the end of the month to how close I am to reaching it. One thing I have noticed-I have always enjoyed/loved eating but since I have been on this I do not feel the same motivation to eat. Far fewer cravings and I eat much less than I normally would-WHEN I do actually eat. Hope this helps those of you just starting or thinking about starting this.
Overweight	Typ0queen6, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/3/2008 8:47:39 PM	My doctor only lets me take the apidex for 3 months then I have to be off for 9months(grr). I have a weird side effect and wanted to know if anyone else has had it. My nose gets COLD!. I mean so cold that it makes my teeth hurt. I have friend that also takes adipex and she as experienced this from time to time also. I also have the dry mouth. Does anyone know of anything that can be taken for the 9 months that I can not have the adipex? I have tried meridian. I eat through  that, it didnt work. And Im not trying ALI. I dont want those side effects.

I have heart racing, stomach pains, dry mouth, and diahheria. I have been taken off my antidepressiant medication (doc says cant take both). I have lost 7 lbs in 1 wk. but the way i feel, is it worth it? I really need to loose weight but I am also concerned about my health. Should your heart race? My stomach hurt so bad, I was in bed for 2 days. Nothing in the mouth but a lot comming out.  I am still taking it, but I take it with 2 slices of bread to help with the stomach pains. I will keep you posted on what happens. from 267 to 260.

The only thing I don't care for is the restricted amount of time that you can stay on the medication.
Overweight	MNGeorge1020, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/27/2008 2:06:28 PM	I am on day three today, the first two days I didn't feel much of a difference, so today I took my pill an hour before I ate breakfast.  I was taking it two hours after breakfast.  But today I have much more energy and can definitely say that I do not feel hungry today.  It felt great.  It doesn't make me jittery at all, it feels like I just have a ton of energy.  As for the person who just asked about a drug interaction, I would go to www.drugs.com and they have a drug interaction check, you enter all of the medicines you are currently taking and it will let you know of any possible issues that could arise.  I hope this helps!!!
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	6/27/2008 11:04:36 AM	I have been on this for two weeks and lost 11 pounds.  Is anyone else taking this with prozac?  My doc said it is called Phen-Pro.  Does anyone heard of serotonin syndrome?  The pharmacist mentioned it when I picked up the meds, but the doctor did not say anything about mixing two drugs that alter serotonin levels.  Any comments would be helpful!
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/26/2008 7:48:16 AM	I just started this medication yesterday, I've seen it work wonderfully for a friend of mine.  So, I talked to my doctor about it and he recommended it.  I saw on here that there is a message board somewhere for people taking Adipex.  Does anyone know where I could find this?  I would like to be able to talk to other people using the same medication.  By the way, my best friend has been taking this for a little over two months and has lost over 30 pounds!!  I've joined Weight Watchers, and I work out at least 3 days a week.  I felt this could be a good addition to what I am already doing.

How long should I stop, and how long should I take it?
Overweight	brattlc, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	6/24/2008 1:56:05 PM	I've only been on Adipex for 5 days and I've lost 10 pounds.  I know it is mostly water weight, but I have been working out a good bit (walking and tennis)so I'm hoping a little of my loss is actual fat:)  The first pill I took gave me tons of energy.  I was talking 90 miles and hour and could stay in my chair at work.  After about 4 hours those effects wore off, but it was still curbing my appetite.  Now I take half a pill around 8 am and the other half around noon and that's working really well.  I have 60 pounds to loose and I hope they all can come off as easily as the first 10...50 more to go!!!

I go to the Dr. for my refill tomorrow. No bad side effects other than I feel the need to smoke so much! I have lots of energy and I feel great. I haven't exercised other than yard work and trying to get out and about more. It really curbs my appetite. I know when I need to eat b/c I will get a sick feeling in my stomach. Don't even think about food anymore.

One thing to consider is that you have to eat right and exercise for it to be truly beneficial, like any diet, but Adipex is a great apetite suppressant and give you alot of non-jittery energy. The only thing I have had a problem with is sleeplessness sometimes. It seems to have gone away since I bought this spray called Sleep Now (or something. It's an all-natural sleep inducer, and it seems to have taken care of the sleep problems.

The only side effects that I've had are dry mouth, and trouble sleeping(the first few days). The first couple of days taking this med, I didn't feel hungry, and I have yet to feel shakey or anything.I work out on an eliptical machine for 10-30 minutes 4-5 times a week, as I am a full time worker and college student, and have little to no time to relax, let alone work out! :)I am 22 years old and gained around 80 pounds since graduating highschool(193 lbs then) in 2004. I am very happy with my results so far and go back to the Dr the 28th of June to see how I am doing, and refill my perscription!If anyone has any questions,advice, or just wants to talk about their experience on the medication please e-mail me--I'd love to chat :)randi106865@yahoo.com

I have lost 38 lbs.  I am eating mainly protien with veggies. I have noticed constipation, but a multivitamin helped with that. My periods are lighter and shorter which is great!!!  I love this med.  It has cut way down on my emotional eating because if I snack I get a stomache ache.  Now instead of eating, I walk or do yoga.  It has really been great because it gave me the &quot;instant gratification&quot; of losing weight that excerise alone doesn't.  I will be definatly getting my refill!!!

I do agree with one of the other people, it is not a miracle drug, you do have to change your lifestyle.  I have not exercised yet at all.  I have changed my eating habits and this has helped me do that.  Makes you very thirsty and curbs your hunger.  I love it and have suggested to many others.  I'm now the weight I want to be FINALLY!!!!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/31/2008 11:26:24 PM	Adipex has been the ONLY thing that has worked for me.  I am currently down 44 pounds.  However, be aware, it is NOT a miracle drug--you do need to make lifestyle changes to ensure that the weight stays off.  But for someone like me who has a history of obesity in the family (read: crummy genes), and little to no success with any other program, it's been a lifesaver.  It didn't affect me with any real negative side effects, but I did notice when I stopped the medication, I was more tired than usual.

The first time, I hit my goal weight of losing 20 lbs., stopped taking it, and gained it all back:( This time, I am trying to use all the tools available to me. I'm exercising, attempting to eat better and reason with myself before I eat junk food. In the 5 days I have been on it, I've lost 4 lbs. I'm going to get involved in the adipex blog, also. I have noticed that I'll eat anything when I'm bored. I'm trying to work on that. Any and all support or advice is welcome.
Overweight	adipexbeliever4life, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/20/2008 5:46:37 PM	I have been taking the generic form of Adipex for 1 week today and have already lost 12 lbs! I am amazed! I have not been excersizing, although I should be. I, like many others on this site, am a full time college student who works part time and is a single mother, so that isn't always easy. For the first two days I had no appetite what so ever, and it has slowly come back. But I can eat something very small like a salad or an apple and be full. I really recommend this to anyone who has been discouraged with other weight loss drugs. This one is definately a keeper!
Overweight	Kay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/20/2008 9:31:52 AM	I have an under active thyroid and have put on a ton of weight since having my little girl 3 three years ago ..Along with that I had depression and anxeity issues as well. The doctors put me on different appetite suppressants and they did not work that well at all.. With adipex I was put on the drug back in September of 07' and I have really been watching what I eat and honestly not even thinking about munching between meals like I used to ,and as of April 22nd I have dropped over 65 lbs. !!! I see the doctor every 5 to 6 weeks and she checks my heart and blood pressure and I have never felt more like myself... This medication is great but its really for people that are obese or have a substantial amount of weight to lose and it REALLY works very well ecspecially with watching what you eat  and calorie intake...  I am so glad that my doctor finally put me on something that gets the unwanted weight off..I don't have heart palpitations but it does give me energy and with an under active thyroid energy is really good..
Overweight	Jessica100, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/15/2008 12:41:21 PM	I have used it in the past and had great results I lost about 30 lbs now Im back on it after I had my son and hope to get the same results. I know people have mentioned that they are loosing without exercise and that is great but if you exercise and eat healthier u will see a drastic change especially in about 6 weeks but you have to continuously use it along with exercise and diet you will notice a difference. Read more about my weight loss diary at http://jessica-weightlossdiary.com its been a long journey but im determined to keep the weight off for good.......
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	5/15/2008 11:44:45 AM	Ladies just to let you know what happened to me while taking the generic form of Adipex. If you are on ANY type of birth control, USE ALTERNATE FORMS OF CONTRACEPTIVES!! While on this Rx it made my birth control less effective. Not really sure what happend but I started 2 weeks earlier than what I was supposed to and I am very regular even before the pill. Not sure if there was a possible pregnancy or not but please what and be careful!
Overweight	Jerzey, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/13/2008 6:15:23 PM	This is my 3rd or 4th time being on adipex since 2002. Each time I took it it worked for me. The first time I took it in 2002, I lost 40 ponds in 3 months. At that time I was on a 1300/day calorie diet and I excersized regularly. Then I got pregnant! Go figure,LOL, So the following year I used it again but it was much more sporadic and I didn't excersize as often and I still lost about 10 pounds in a 3 month period. Last year I got married, and I wanted to lose some weight I had gained before the wedding so I tried it again and I was able to lose 20 pounds just with taking the pill and minimum-moderate excersize. So it does work. It's an appetite suppresent and a metobolic booster. Definitly take it as early in the day as possible because I found if I take it late, it keeps me up. If you are just starting would also take it every other day for the first week, so your body slowly builds up to tolerating it. If you have the tabs, I would also consider cutting the tabs in half to start out. Great drug, but it does not work alone, You have to try and work with it, Minimum you should be drinking a ton of water daily and try and at least do some sort of excersize, wether it's daily walks or a treadmill 3x per week. Oh sidenote...whenever I was on this pill and tried to eat junkfood &quot;Mcdonalds&quot; I got instantly sick. (diarhea) I would stay away from fast food. Hope this review helps! Good Luck!

It will take care of your overeating and energy level, but it mad me very jittery and I would crash in the evenings.  I am now on fastin and this really works for me.
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	4	3	Female	19-24	5/12/2008 8:13:55 PM	I have started adipex-P over a month and a half ago. The first three weeks were great lost 12 pounds. when i got my refill they were time release ones and didn't seem to work as well. I had to stop taking them for a week so they would work again. the only question i have is for those taking them do you eat and if so how much or what. I am never hungy til late at night then I get starving pains and eat whatever but in small portions. Im not losing anymore weight and getting scared. Please email me with any info. krlsap730@hotmail.com

Trust me, being overweight is terrible for your self-esteem and all, but it's not worth risking your life! This drug has been proved to cause heart damage and will more than likely be taken off the market in the very near future. My doctor recommended a drug called Meridia instead. It's also an appetite suppressant but doesn't contain phentermine so it's safer. Please, please, please be careful on this. I feel like we are all connected in some way and entitled to warn each othr about the dangers out there. So please, ask your doc to prescribe a different kind of suppressant.

Overweight	carebear77, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/7/2008 7:02:00 AM	I was nervous to take these pills at first because everything else I have tried never worked. Imagine my surprise to see the numbers shrinking on the scale after the very first week! I started taking them on April 1, 2008 &amp; on May 1, 2008 I went back to my OBGYN and found that I had lost 18 1/2 pounds (with no excercise)!! I just started month 2 and have lost another 5 pounds. I began walking 2 1/2 - 3 miles on our high school track every night using my mp3 player to keep me going. I was diagnosed a year ago with PCOS (poly-cystic ovary syndrome)which has made it extremely hard to lose weight &amp; has caused me to have ovulation/menstrual problems, but Adipex holds no grudges, lol. I can take Adipex in addition to taking Metformin (to help reduce the cysts) &amp; prenatal vitamins with no side effects what so ever! I have lots of energy and can't wait to get my body back into shape &amp; into my beloved jeans that have collected dust over the years. I have recommended this drug to several friends and family members &amp; I will post another update soon.

I just started taking Adipex-P 37.5 mg this morning (7:39 a.m. to be exact). After 1 hour I was definitely feeling the effects (all-in-all, not too bad). I can't comment yet on how it works, but I wanted to offer my new weight loss blog as support to anyone interested. The URL is http://www.web-betty.blogspot.com. Please visit, comment, or send me an email. I'd live to hear from other Adipex-P users.I'll also update my ratings, as time goes by.

With exercise and a change in diet it really does work. The first couple of days I took it, it caused me to loose a little sleep after I got adjusted to it, I was back to my normal routine of sleep, and it had no effects on my mood.

Yes I have dry mouth, and #2 problems but it really is a small price. I do not eat till the eve, because I take it at 6:30 - 7:00 am. Taking it that early helps me with the lack of hunger. It allows me to eat a simi-regular size meal. Try it it may work for you. I have lost 20 LBs!!! My Dr prescribed it for me because I have a bone disorder, I get steroid shots every month. I gained 20 Lbs in less than 2 months. Since I started Adipex I have not gained anything but self- love with out any exercise. I tell everyone about Adipex.

Overweight	Margretgrace, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	4/22/2008 9:32:06 PM	Hi, I have been on this medication since Saturday, I found that I was not able to take a full dose at one time because I was jumping out of my skin with nerves, I have taken half in the morning then a quarter in the afternoon, has anyone else had to do this?? Also I have lost 4 pounds, I do not really feel hungry and have to tell myself its time to eat, but other times I feel hungry, does this happen to anyone else??  Thanks, any input would be great.  I am hoping to get myself up to the full dose by the end of the week, my doctor only wants me to take 1 pill a day, I am on 37.5, does anyone else only take 1 per day?? If so how are your results going?? Thanks
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	4/22/2008 5:20:07 PM	I thought I would give an update.  Today is day 6 of my medication.  I have lost all appetite and have dropped 14 lbs.  I have been eating very little.  Last night I noticed an extreme change in urine color.  I called my doctor first thing this morning and she had me come in.  Just a heads up to you other users- the first few days or week you are on the medication, you drastically drop weight.  Your body is not hungry, you are not eatting, so your body is using fluids.  The first several pounds are just water loss.  If you do not eat SOMETHING....you will get dehydrated.  If your urine takes a drastic change in color--consumer water.  That was my problem.  I did not ever feel weak, but I was dehydrated.  She encouraged drinking at least 80 ozs of water a day &amp; a little hint-if you feel like you may get hungry, drink water, it should give you a feeling of fullness.  Hope this helps!

However everyone that I have talked to or read comments about have stated that they have no appetite. Me on the other hand, I am still hungry. Anyone else having this problem? I didn't know if it was just because it was my first day? Any ideas would be great!

Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	4/21/2008 11:54:44 AM	I started on this medication on Thursday morning (5 days now).  The first 2 days I did not eat anything.  I have not had an appetite at all.  By Saturday I began to get dehydrated from not eating so I began to eat very small amounts like 1/2 an apple, so I am still getting some nutrients.  As of this morning, I have lost 12 lbs.  I have a ton of energy, don't feel druggy during the day, and have not had any sleeping problems.  I have been experiencing the dry mouth problem... but drinking alot of water will help that!  And water is good for us.  Due to being a full time college student, I have not started an exercise routine yet.  I hope that ya'll have successful weight loss with this medication!

This is coming from a person who used to eat compulsively until now. This is only my 3rd day on the medication and I have already lost 9 pounds!!!!!! I don't know truly how this is even possible, but when I started I was 270, and this morning I weighed 261. I can believe it though, I'm definetely more active and I barely eat at all, I just feel full all day.

My goal is to lose 50lbs, and so far I have lost 5 in just one week! With this drug, you can lose weight, but if you exercise 3-4 times a week, you will drop it fast! You have to drink lots of water, and avoid sugar and caffiene.  I hope I reach my goal and will review after one month! I am excited already!

I stopped taking it for 3 days, tho. So, in all I have been on it 1.5 wks. I ABSOLUTELY love it! It puts me in the best of mood. I am always so happy! I do have the dry mouth and I swear I have doubled my smoking habits. For the first few days it did suppress my appetite tremendously but, now after taking 7 days straight I seem to get hungry. I have read all the reviews and wonderful results. I am hoping I get the same from this pill. I weighed 203 lbs and now I weigh 198 lbs.

Overweight		4	5	5			4/15/2008 10:03:48 AM	I started taking Adipex 5 days ago. I have Anxiety/Stress issues so its naturally hard for me to loose weight. I have gained almost 20lbs in the last 2 years. I am only 22, and im 5'3. I weighed 154lbs when i was prescribed this, and im not going to weigh myself until i go back for my check up. Im also on Zoloft for my Anxiety, and the Adipex does not bother me or increase my anxeity symptoms at all. I dont really have any side effects other than i dont sleep long at all. Im lucky to get 4-6 hours a night. I literally have to make myself eat, so its easy to eat healthy. I dont have dry mouth, but i am thirsty alot. You could set anything in front of me, and i really dont want to eat. Theres no temptation. Iv been working out doing cadrio at least 3-4 times a week, for 25-45 minutes. Iv noticed a little difference in my jeans already. So far im satisfied, i just hope the weight comes off fast, and helps me continue eating small portions even after im off of this medication.

I was off of it for a year and gained back 5 lbs. 2nd time on it I lost 45 lbs not working out at all. I have been off for 5 months and have gained back 10lbs.

I went from 309 to 267.  I workout on an elliptical everyday, even if just for 10 minutes.  Also, since I feel like I have to force myself to eat, when I do eat I keep it pretty healthy.  This is life changing for me.  My energy level is through the roof.  I have also lowered my cholestrol from 236 to 204.  It is effective and affordable.

I hope it gets better. No jitterness, no palpatations, no insomnia, But lots of dry mouth, so I eat tic-tacs all day. I dont get a lot of exercise, other than yard work, and house work. Had some very low blood pressure in the first few weeks, but it has returned to normal.The Doctor says I will only get one more month  of this medicine, which is bad, considering that I am 90 lbs overweight. If anyone has suggestions please tell me !!!

I work full time and have busy teenagers so my time to exercise is limited so 3x week is it for me. The only side effect I've noticed is the dry mouth. Caffiene is a big no-no with this med. I see a weight loss physician and he was wonderful about explaining any drug and/or food interactions.

I do feel a bit of heart palpatation.  Obviously 2 days is not enough time to evaluate this drug.  My doc only would prescribe for 3 months.  I have not noticed a decreased appetite yet.  I am intentionally eating less but can not give the drug the credit yet.  I am on 37.5.  My doc said to take it very first thing in the morning so that I could sleep at nite.

Overweight	Trouble, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/17/2008 12:03:26 AM	Well I have been taking adipex for a month and 2 weeks. I have lost 15.6 lbs.  I have wayyy more energy.  My only side effect is dry mouth.  Which is awesome because it makes me drink so much water.  I dont drink the sweet tea, which has sugar in it.  I do have a personal trainer, so do cardio and weight training.  I dont have much of an urge to eat.  I have to remind myself or make myself eat.  If i didnt, I wouldnt think of it until supper.  But I am very excited and very happy with the results!

We both weighed between 235-240 lbs,she is now 195 lbs and I am 193. Yes it gives you dry mouth and the jitters but to me its worth it. I feel better, very energetic, I'm smiling more. I recommend it. Do what we did start with a friend its more fun. We stay competing and comparing and we go to the doctor on the same day to hear eachothers results. But we haven't did any shopping yet cause we are on a roll. See you at the beach this summer. I'll be the one in the 2 piece bikini. Good Luck

There is an option to buy it online and I was wondering if it's the same medication and the same dosage?!  Any input!?

I have to make myself eat, and the only side effect I have is dry mouth, which makes me drink more water. I can handle that. I'm taking it because after losing 70 lbs, between May 07 and Nov.07, I stopped losing at all. I went to the gym for 2 months, 4 days a week, and gained 5 lbs. I had made it down to 184 lbs. A friend of mine recommended this drug, so finally I gave it a try. I have lost almost 10 lbs in 5 days. I am walking a couple miles a day, and eating healthy stuff. And best of all it's affordable, though I can only get 30 days supply in the state that I live because of regulations. And I have to go back to the nurse and get weighed and checked every month. But it is worth it. I'll leave more feedback in a few weeks once I have really tried it better.
Overweight	Janice, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/9/2008 12:09:36 PM	After 6 weeks on the med it seems to be loosing its effectiveness. I have lost 11 lbs. so far. I have been off of it for a week and plan to go back on in a few days to see if it works again. The dry mouth never went away while taking the med. I slept better after a week. I am still going to weight watchers and planning on continuing that. I am amazed this pill works so long for some people. Has the doctor increased your dose over time?

Over half of that was in my waist!!!!My appetite is way smaller. I ride a bike at work but that's my only exercise.Some days i feel fine and others I am light headed and feel spaced out.I figured that would pass by now but guess not. I like my results so far and have inspired many friends and co workers to see the doc and begin taking adipex as well

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/1/2008 8:50:08 PM	I am a 27 year old female and this is my 3rd month on this drug. So far I've lost about 29 lbs. After my 2nd child I was having major trouble with cravings (mainly sweets) Now I don't think about them at all (except maybe when P.M.S.ing)  When I do eat I get fuller faster and never finish a meal.  That never happened before!  My doc perscribed 37.5 mg once daily.  The 1st week was terrible!  I didn't think I could stay on it.  I felt like I was on speed.  I could not turn my brain off.  I only got about 2 hrs of sleep a night that 1st week.  It's much better now, I can usually get at least 4 hrs.  I was a nap person, but can't do that with this.  I also have problems with constipation, however I have always had problems with that.  The dry mouth is terrible, but not always consistant.  I have found that no amount of water helps, but chewing gum does.  There is also a lack of interest for sex, but again another area that I have had problems with.  I have about 10-15 more lbs to lose.  I hope to do that this month because the doc only perscribed 3 mos worth.  Overall I think the med is great.  After my 1st child I lost 30 lbs on weight watchers, however this time was different.  The cravings were terrible.  I can deal with being hungry but not the cravings!

I lost 10 lbs.(that did not make me happy)I heard all these great things about this pill and that was my result. Sure the energy level was great and I was always doing something and on the go but now.......I have been off of this pill for 2 weeks now and I don't know if its just me but I have had a constant migrane for the past week. Like a constant hangover headache. I heard it alters your mind to a not wanting to eat &quot;state&quot; but if I had any idea the &quot;AFTER&quot; side effects would be this bad I NEVER would have taken the first pill.Questions or comments for me (especially if you are off this pill)....please e-mail at coca20colakimmy@yahoo.com    putting apipex in the subject line.

I heard about the side effects and got nervous, but I have given it a try. I have been doing weight watchers and I am in the gym 3-4 nights a week. The weight was coming off slow.. Then I plateud. I went to my md and he told me to try adipex. I have been on it for 10 days and lost 6.4 lbs. I do have jitterness at times and I find I am a bit restless at night. I drink a lot of water to begin with so dry mouth I am not sure of. Constipation? Yeah I have it, So i just drink some warm water and lemon and that helps me. I have a f/u appt in a few days.. I am worried about after I stop this med.. Does the weight come back? Well I will keep everyone updated.. Good Luck!

I have been very encouraged by the weight loss. I am very thirsty and have to make myself drink water instead of soda or sweet tea.   Caffeine does not go well with this drug.  Noone told me not to drink caffeine with this pill.  I learned this the hard way.  Heart racing and  nervousness. I have not been sleeping well, will talk to doc when I go back at the end of the month.  Hope this helps someone

I am very excited about that.  I started at 188 and finally down to 180.2.  I found out a year and a half ago that my thyroid was low and I gained about 50-55 lbs.Now as far as side effects, I only have the dry mouth, which actually works in my favor.  I never drank water, I hated it. I always drank sweet tea or soda. Now, I drink a ton of water, so it works for me instead of against me.  I dont have any other side effects. I go to the dr next Friday for my monthly visit.  I am excited to see a change and Im sure my dr will be too.  We have worked hard for so long to get things right with my body.  My goal is 140 lbs. So I only have 40 more to go! WooHooo!!!!

Ive always been overweight. I gain slowly but lose even slower,until i tried this. I take it 1xdaily  abt 1-2hrs alftr my 1st meal, which could be 9am or 2pm. I drive a trk so my excerise consist of, walking in the mall,taking the stairs when possible and dancing to my fav. cd (avg 15-20mins nonstop). The 1wk im home im always on the go running errons or visiting. I was loseing wait B4 useing this but avg had been about 10 lbs a yr,same routine LESS moderate though. I eat what i want (nvr liked diet,lowcal,fat or sugar free anything)just less often and less of it.(i.e. happy meals vs.#5 @whataburger, 1 brkfast sandwich w/jelly vs. 2eggs/4bacon/2toast, 45ozs water daily vs. 45wkly+avg of 14cans of 7up,kickn the daily 5stx of juicy fruit gum, 1bag of chips wkly vs.3 and lastly 7 hotwings im full vs. 10+med fry) Because i was already kickn some of my unneccesary eatn and snackn, im motivated to do even better. I dont smoke,abuse drugs,avg 6 margaritas a yr and i dont go to bed w/in 2hrs of eatn however i do eat as much ice cream as i like(avg 3xwkly-cones or bars only) So having said all of that im 5'4/265, goal is 150-160 w/in nxt 2yrs. Im not gonna depend on this drug but while i have it, ive decided to step up changes that i feel would be easist to maintain. I would recommend this medication and intend to keep useing it for @ least the rest of '08. I hope these details will help anyone considering or useing adipex..(feel free to email)..Good Luck!

I had a medical condition that casue serious weight gain and I have been trying to get it off for over 18 months. The best I could do before adipex was 2 lbs per month, so 10 pounds this month is great for me, even though alot of others say they have lost more. I have always watched what I ate, healthy foods only. No soda's, desserts, sugars, fried foods, etc. I have had some slight side effects, dry mouth, a little hard to sleep at first, but not so much as to cause me to stop taking it. I am thrilled and hope to keep going at this pace or better for at least 4-6 months. If I can lose 10 lbs for 6 months I will be at my target weight.

I've lost in the range of 15 pounds, I think.  I return to the MD later this week to know for sure.  Here's the thing:  the constipation is awful!  If anyone has any helpful advise about this, I'd appreciate it.  I have increased water, fiber, exercise, etc.  I plan to discuss this with my MD, as well.  Thanks in advance for your insight!

I have tried many ways to lose the pounds which include diet and exercise, but I guess I have carried the stubbon weight too long.  I have lost 15 pounds in 3 week which averages out to 5 pounds per week and that is the most I have ever done.  I am excited and pleased and I also feel very good.

I am going to Weight Watchers and have to make sure I eat all the healthy foods I am required to. I know not eating is not the answer to weight loss.This helps me with my portions and snacking. I have dry mouth and the first few days trouble sleeping. I hope to have the same success as others. I am also exercising.

I have been on every diet and lost/gained the weight back every time.  I have been taking this drug off and on for about 8 months.  I have lost 75 pounds, 25 more to go.  I have more energy, excersise regularly, eat healthy, and feel better than ever.  I would reccomend this drug for those who have a significant amount of weight to lose and are ready to make life style changes.  The only side effect I have had is dry mouth, annoying but manageable.

Overweight	LarryZ, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/18/2008 2:43:46 AM	I've lost 15lbs within the first month, I'm definately happy so far! The crazy thing is that I still continue to go about eating all of the food that I shouldn't, mainly grease related. But my appetite has reduced tremendusly so I don't each as much. It has also given me the much needed motivation and boost of energy that is a definate must in the construction business. Other than some mild side effects i've experienced, there is concern of mine that i'm really curious to know for sure about. I've turned some buddies of mine with weight problems, like myself, with some of these pills and we're all curious if there is anyway chance that these things my show up on an UA(pee test) as an amphedimine of any kind? Obviously I would be okay because of the script, but it's them that i'm concerned about. Can anyone provide me with any closure on this topic?

I lost 20 lbs. my first month (and that was during Thanksgiving).  I've been on it 10 weeks &amp; have lost 32 lbs.  20 more to go!   I have had some side effects like dry mouth, trouble sleeping and a little heart palputations....I didn't take during Christmas week and still lost.  Wouldn't use it long term and may go to 1/2 pill when I return to doc.  This was a great way to jump start the weight loss but respect the fact that you can't abuse it!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/6/2008 6:35:55 AM	Honestly, I got about 15 pills from a friend.  I am not over weight at all but could not loose the extra 5-10 I wanted to before vacation.  I dropped 7 pounds in NO TIME.  It gave me extra energy and basically wiped away any desire for food.  I had to make myself eat something everyday.  I felt great.  Don't know if it actually works that well for people over weight.  It took my friend about 3 weeks to notice results, but she had a hard time sleeping at night and decided the drug wasn't right for her.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/4/2008 10:15:52 AM	I have been taking this medication since 10/22/07 and I have lost 34lbs, I have a MVP and it does not effect my heart in anyway, no jetters,sweats,diarrhea,racing-heart.  I total recommend it.  The only side effect for me is dry mouth, but I have always drank lots of liquids so not a biggie.  I am active, but I don't do any kind of stict exercise routine.  It does give me energy, but I am not all over the place.  And I really just feel great.  I don't usually take it everyday and I even went a whole week during Christmas without it, so I no I am not addicted to it cause I didn't go through any withdrawl.  Hope this helps...Good Luck!!!

In the beginning I was not hungry and actually though I lost a pound or two.  My doctor just increased by dose and I am hoping it helps.  I weigh 170 so need to look about 15-20 pounds.  I'm not sure if it is for those who need to lose small amounts of weight.  I am hoping it kicks in now that I have increased the dose.

Although I had excessive sweating, urinated more often, face and nose stayed flush and very dry mouth that would lead to my tongue drying out so bad it would burn and itch. Has anyone else had these symptoms?  Also, my Dr. would not let me take them no more than 3 months because the very high risk of damaging your heart. Why are so many other Dr's letting their patients stay on them longer if there's such a high risk?
Overweight	Good2BAngie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/17/2007 4:09:30 PM	I started out at a 258 lbs in June, at about 37 BMI, and have lost 50 lbs to date (so 50 lbs in 6.5 mos).  You don't even think about food.. I have to remind myself to get nutrition.  I keep cals within 1200/day and exercise at least 3x/wk (usually walk on treadmill 2.5-3mph for 45 mts).  Does not make me wired, cause insomnia, etc whatsoever. Amazing stuff.  I think I'll be able to sustain my weight after I'm off of adipex, because it's helped me to change my eating habits by making calorie-management sustainable for the long-term by keeping me on my diet... cause I keep losing weight and it is inspiring.  It gives you a reason to &quot;keep at it&quot; if you're losing, and the longer you keep on your diet plan and keep losing and keep exercising and keep watching what you eat (with an occasional splurge) ... it becomes a new routine.  A GOOD new habit... eating for sustenance and health, not entertainment or fulfillment.
Overweight	Tim, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	12/17/2007 9:48:29 AM	I took this drug for one month in August of 2007.  The first week I never thought about eating.  After that, it took a little effort on my part, but very little.  My appetite was much smaller the entire month on the drug.  I lost 15 pounds that month.  I just started taking it again, 3 days ago.  Again, I do not even think about eating.  I expect the effectiveness to slowly decrease throughout the month as before.  I am not taking it again due to a return of the lost weight, but because I have stopped losing weight on my own and have been stagnant for two months.  I highly recommend this medicine as a &quot;booster&quot; for people who are putting forth a good effort to lose weight on their own.  I have lost 40 pounds in nine months.  15 pounds of it was during one month on the medication.  The rest was at a rate of about 4 pounds a month without it.

I am so excited.  I still have at least 80 pounds to go, but I am on my way.  In the beginning, I had trouble sleeping, but that went away after the first week.  No jitters at all...

I am also in a doctor supervised weight loss program. It has completely supressed my appetite and I have to remember to eat. I have no cravings and a lot more energy.  I also have trouble falling asleep at night. But so far so good!
Overweight	Sandi, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	12/1/2007 8:50:38 PM	I am currently taking adipex perscribed by my doctor. I am an active, healthy 25 year old woman and have never had a lot of success losing weight by diet and excersize alone. After talking to my doctor at a regualr check up, she suggested I try adipex to see if it helped at all. I was 225 lbs. at the time. Four months later I am now 185 and still going. I am constantly getting coments about my weight loss which is a new experience for me. It has been a very positive experience. I plan on taking it for another five months and hope to be at 150 lbs. by then. I have more energy and less of an appetite. I actually stop eating before my plate is empty. I can't wait to see my final results. I am very excited.
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	11/19/2007 4:14:00 PM	I've been taking Adipex off and on for 9 months now.  My fiance lost over 80lbs while taking this drug.  His sister-in-law-45lbs, his brother 60lbs, and his sister-30lbs!  My goal was 50lbs...needless to say, I still haven't reached it.  After taking the pill for more than a month consecutively, it stops working.  Wait 2 weeks, take it again, and it works again. I stopped taking it for almost 2 months after losing 20lbs, and gained every ounce back, while maintaining the same diet.  Exercise is key to this drug.  It isn't a miracle drug, but it definitely assists in the fight to be healthier!  I would recommend it to anyone who has tried everything else to no avail.

I went to the gym 4 days a week with 2 hour sessions for 3 years and never lost a pound, I lost over 30 pounds with adipex in just 2 months! But now I'm addicted too. My skin stays broke out and I cant sleep. Just be sure you only take what is directed and not keep getting other doc.s to prescribe more to you and end up like me.

I am a very sedentary individual because of a back injury and I knew that losing weight would help aleviate the strain.  Exercise was painful, sometimes just getting out of bed was an ordeal.  I lost weight with this medication without ANY exercise.  Although, I do feel that if I was able to exersice my weight loss would have skyrocketed.  I lost 41 pounds in 8 months. This medication is a Godsend!

I lost 50 lbs in 4 months with calorie counting and exercise 5 times a week. I have kept it off for 2 years. I still have to work out and watch my eating habits. I have struggled with being overweight for my whole life. It some crazy side effects sometimes but it is worth it.
