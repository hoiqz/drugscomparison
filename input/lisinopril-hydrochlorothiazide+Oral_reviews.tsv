This is effecting my work and co-workers are talking...not to mention lost sleep due to it. I asked my Doc for an alturnative med and start it next week.

My doctor insisted it was time to try this medication. I'm amazed, after taking this for 4 days, my BP is normal now! My only serious side effect has been excruciatingly painful muscle cramps/spasms in various places which have no other explanation. They were like charlie horses in my toes, under my rib cage, my left torso, right torso, under my chin. It was weird! I may pause to see if this medication was the cause, but it also seems to be decreasing. I would give this medication 5 stars if it weren't the apparent side effect.

It worked great to reduce blood pressure but the side effects were not good.  I rarely have negative side effects from drugs but this was subtle but not good.  I felt tired, often light headed and had poor concentration.  My eyes and skin became excessively dry. I also developed Raynauds symptoms.  I gave my body enough time to adjust but it didn't.As soon as I stopped taking it symptoms dissappeared.  (My mom takes this drug and it works well for her)

Biggest mistake ever.  Within a month I was coughing non stop at night.  I was then &quot;diagnosed&quot; with GERD and given rx antacids.  Luckily  a friend told me about the coughing side effects he experienced with this medication.  Went back to the doc and he put me back on hyzaar.  Behold, coughing disappeared.  so much for the GERD diagnosis.  This is not a good medicine.   
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	4/18/2011 1:27:38 PM	Took this same prescription for 8 years, no problem, then changed insurance and had to change to another manufacurer and now I have coughing all the time especially at night and when I eat or drink. Though different manufacturers were the same drug as prescribed. Previously was taking a small white pill now a larger blue pill. 
High Blood Pressure	Lastkiss05, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/2/2011 5:24:38 PM	Cramps do happen from time to time with it, tho its due to lack of potassium caused by the pills.So I try to eat a banana a day. A dry cough, rather a tickle in the back of the throat (drinking something helps),and lastly being a bit more sensitive to the sun, which sucks because I already burn like crazy. Being a wife and mother of 5 and taking care of my Mother, I chose pills and the few discomforts myself. These are things I can live with vs. having high blood pressure that can cause a heart attack and other more nasty things. My Dad was on it and didn't take it the way he should have. He died at the age of 48 from a heart attack.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	2/8/2011 11:28:14 AM	Starting taking this when my insurance changed and couldn't avoid the brand name I was taking for over 6 years. Within 3 months my legs swelled and formed ulcers. After visiting my family Dr. and a dermatologist -3 times- I was finally told it was due to lack of blood flow in my legs, only thing different in my life was the new drug, stopped taking lisinopril and asked my family Dr. for samples of the brand name and it went away w/in 2 weeks. Unfortunately the brand name is now in manufacturers recall so now taking something else but would never take lisinopril again. Didn't see this as a side effect.
High Blood Pressure	dlh44, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	65-74	2/4/2011 2:29:30 PM	Started taking about 2 months ago, the first month was fine (except for an occasional leg muscle cramp) Into the 2nd month, I developed a dry-cough that got continually worse, finally to the point of creating other problems (hernia from couching so hard!)  I only take 2 other meds so have narrowed the problem down to this one pill! Finally stopped taking it 4-5 days ago, and am slowly starting to feel better each day - what a nightmare.  FYI: For leg cramps (charlie-horses, etc.) a friend told me to get a bar of Ivory soap (!?) just for the heck of it a put a bar on my nightstand (where I get a slight whiff of it), and....amazingly, I haven't had a single muscle cramp since!!  I know, sounds like 'smoke &amp; mirrors voodoo', and maybe it's all physiological, but it works for me!!!

Wanted to send me to another hospital in another city in case I needed a tracheotomy.  I refused and went home and was fine in a couple of days.Doc said this is common with Lisinopril.  Scary having your Thyroid try to strangel you.I'll never touch it again................

It did lower my pressure but the side effects made it where I needed to try something else.

I have headaches, nausea, and a bad cough. I did not even think that the medicine is what is causing my cough, and just like others it is at night and will wake me up it is so bad. I take the meds in the morning but I also have to wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and it seems like I urinate forever. I will be seeing my Dr and telling her about the side effects that I have been having but all in all it does control my BP. I am also tired and sleepy all the time I just feel like I do not get enough sleep, even after I have slept for 8 hours. No energy at all.

High Blood Pressure	JoeorKathy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	55-64	9/27/2010 12:43:04 AM	I was taking Lisinopril for 10 yrs at least then suddenly at 3am I woke up with my mouth feeling strange. My lower lip was swelling up like a bad botox job. I had my husband take me to the hospital ER right away. Of course they had no clue what was going on. I called my Dr that was in AL, I moved to MS, and told the on call Dr my meds and soon as I told him Lisinopril he said that was causing it. Even though on it for years. No my husband is having same prob with his lower lip, so calling Dr tomorrow to report this. He was on this less than a yaer so he had reaction long before me, just glad it was during the day this happened. but he was saying swollowing was sort of a problem so have been watching and asking questions. But I was feeling it was the med...guess it was.
High Blood Pressure	High BP, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	45-54	9/25/2010 7:53:43 AM	The side effects chronic dry cough, headache,sweat, runny nose are unbearable. i used it for 6 weeks and went to Dr for the above symptoms 3 times and he didn't know that the drug caused it. He gave me cough syrup, inhaler ventolin and of course Steroids and no cure at all. I fired the doctor and never will see him again (was 3 years with him). He has caused me so much pain, I can write a book about it. The 20% of this drug users suffer all the above side effect.Be aware of this drug!!!!
High Blood Pressure	anita, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/24/2010 1:52:51 PM	My doctor prescribed this medication to me because my BP was 209/119 with heart rate of 108.  My BP had been really bad for 2  4years steadily going higher and higher with heart palpitations and with my eyes sight becoming extremely blurred it was clear I needed some help.  I have now been taking this medication for 10 days with daily monitoring. My BP this morning is 122/69 and heart rate at 77.  Slight dizziness after I take it in the morning.  There is a slight urge to cough (not often thou) during the day, but am a water drinker so continuing with the water certainly seems to help.  Of course, urination but through the prior years I was retaining my water and felt extremely terrible.  I am now not retaining water weight and am so good with all of that.  Begin an exercise class of Zumba 5 weeks ago, and enjoy it immensely one hour a day  3 days a week.  So far, I think this medication is great!  I would not want to live with such high BP that would bring side effects of stroke, heart attack and etc.  We will see what the future brings, but so far - so good. My doctor rocks and hes the best.

I've been taking this medication since July 2010. Stopped taking it last week and am laready feeling better. Since day one of taking it I have had a chronic dry caugh both day and night. Wakes me up every 15 to 20 minutes caughing so hard I almost vomit. Have to pee every 10 to 20 minutes. Eyes runny, sore throat, heart palpitations, feels like my heart is going to beat out of my chest. Very dizzy and exhausted. Was in the sun for maybe 10 minutes an just about passed out. Can not focus. Will forget what i'm saying in mid sentance. Legs hurt terribly. BP has has dropped to an average of 87/43. Just not myself anymore. Would rather have high BP than all the side effects of this medication. My DR. insists that these are not side effects of this medication. Going to see a different doctor today.

High Blood Pressure	flushed 'em, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	45-54	8/31/2010 11:12:03 PM	I only took this medication for four days before flushing them all down the toilet and will never take it again! The negative side affects were immediate and constant. I was dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, had a constant low-grade headache, felt depressed, and had the memory and concentration abilities of a goldfish! I missed work, could not sleep well, coughed a lot, and basically felt &quot;disconnected&quot; from myself. I spoke with several relatives who had been prescribed this medication, and everyone of them ended up in the ER after a time because of this drug. I would rather live with the high BP (145/90) than continue to feel the way this drug makes me feel. I'm angry that my doctor would prescribe this medication; surely he must be aware of it's negative side-effects. If your doctor prescribes this for you, don't walk away; RUN!

Took me two weeks after I stopped taking the medicine to get over the side effects.  If you start coughing, try something else.

I am very happy with this drug. I have had legs that ache sometimes but it was far worse not taking the meds. My eyes are a lil brownish at times but eye drops can take care of that. I did find out though that you have to be careful to stay cool and in not too much sunlight. To me these are small sacrifices to wake up feeling healthy. I have experienced a little dizziness but otherwise I am happy and would recommend this drug.

I stopped taking this med. and went back to taking Ziac and feel fine now.  I thought I was going to die before I could get over the side effects.

BETA blockers were making me exhausted, so now trying this.  Not tired, but have a constant headache that no amount of water seems to help.  BP from 165/92 to 113/71 so it is doing its job.  I cough most in the evening, but drinking water helps.  I have been taking for a week, so I hope the headache issue resolves itself.  Have had similar symptoms when changing medications that improved with time. So hoping for the best.  As for sun sensitivity, it was listed as a possible side effect so I just upped the UV protection factor of my sunscreen.

Overall it worked but I ended up in the ER Sunday night with severe tongue swelling, due to a rare side effect of this medicine and of course, I am uninsured due to pre-existing conditions.  The doctor told me that you can take any meds that have severe side effects for extended periods of time without any problems and then out of nowhere, a serious side effect.  Fortunately, an IV of Benadryl and steroids and four hours later I was able to return home. My doctor switched my meds Monday morning, I will be on steroids for two more days.  Just a warning to anyone taking this, if you notice your tongue swelling out of nowhere, get to the hospital.

Now I am experiencing fatigue, and an excellerated heart pace when doing activies such as climbing the stairs in my home. I feel very weak and almost nervous as a result. I think this lowers the blood pressures but the side effects are difficult to say the least.

High Blood Pressure	dissapointed, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	45-54	3/5/2010 9:59:58 PM	Nasty Side effects - Lisinopril immediately lowered my blood pressure from 145/95 to 110/75 but after ten days caused me to constantly cough until my throat started to bleed. I was coughing so much people thought I had some highly contagious deadly disease. The severity of the coughing decrease drastically within 48 hours of halting the regieme but it took two weeks before the coughing stopped completely. When I tried to resume the Lisinopril/HCZ regime the dry coughing sideeffect started within hours not days - so my body is now hyper allergic to Lisinopril. The only good thing about this drug was that as a generic drug it was it only cost $15 for 90 days compared to the name brand ACE II inhibitor drug which costed around $60 for 30 days. 
High Blood Pressure	delrocks, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Male		3/5/2010 6:56:29 PM	My husband always got a slight rash from this med, but last June really started bad. So he went off it, but when dr said it wasn't from the drug he started it again. same thing. Several wks ago he went off it again, but his bp went up so last night he took 1/4 pill. Today he's itching terrible again. It always has controlled his bp, even w/only 1/4 pill (10-12.5 mg). So it looks like it's the med for sure. I haven't read anyone else having this side effect. It might be that he's allergic to a filler or something?! He had no other side effects, except a slight cough sometimes.

I was on this drug for about ten months before I really started having terrible side effects. I had only slightly high blood pressure, and it did bring that down.  But after the severe side effects developed: headaches, sinus problems, some swollen lips, numbness in arms and hands; but worst of all is the quick onset of terrible blurry vision.  I've quit feeling I would rather die of a heart attack than live with these symptoms.  I wish someone would write to say how long it takes for the side effects to go away.  I have no diabetes, no high cholesterol, no weight problem.  I am always avoiding doctors because it seems their prescriptions cause me to be worse off than I was before.  I just went in for a check up.

I developed swollen lips and cheeks.  A condition diagnosed in a hospital emergency room as angioedema.  I was given steroids pills/injection, Benadryl and Zantac to counteract/alleviate the allergic reaction and was told by ER physicians and Family doctor that I was allergic to Ace Inhibitors to never ingest them again. My family doctor prescribed another hypertension medication trial -- Bystolic.  I'm going to take this for 2 weeks under close supervision of my doctor until he comes up with another hypertensive medication.

I am being treated for anxiety and haven't had an issue with it until I started taking this med. Other symptoms include stomach cramping for the first few days, persistent dry cough that wakes me up numerous times during the night, I am tired with no energy, and I have had more headaches than normal. I am on the 20/25mg dosage and started to cut it in half over the weekend since the spike in amxiety level...seems to be working. I go to the doctor today to have my BP checked for the first time since starting this med. I will tell him all of what I have mentioned above and see what he thinks. 
High Blood Pressure	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/30/2009 7:44:31 PM	my blood pressure was incredibly high even after being on the DASH/low salt diet and increased exercise. I have always tried to heal naturally and I have always been healthy. The blood pressure increase was shocking. After taking this medication my blood pressure went down each day and by day three it was VERY good. No cough, no rash or side effects besides a little dizziness at first. I went from 168/118 (even higher before the DASH diet) to 120/74 and feel so much calmer and relaxed. I can't believe the change- this medicine works great for me...

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	1	Female	55-64	5/16/2009 11:04:16 PM	The medicine is very effective in accomplishing its objective of lowering the blood pressure and swelling of ankles and feet. However, the side effects, for me, are not tolerable. I thought the side effects would go away, but I found that the occurrences increased with usage.  Side effects: Tickling,burning sensation in the throat with subsequent coughing,runny nose and watery eyes. 3 months into usage I had to stop using the drug due to the excessive coughing.

Worked well for me but I was ALWAYS extremely tired.  A friend who is a PA advised me to take an ACE inhibitor instead.  I spoke to my Doctor about it and he agreed to give it a try.  I've been on it for a month now and my BP and heart rate are normal/stable and I have a lot more energy now.  Didn't feel well the first week after switching from one to the other, but feel great now.  No noticable side effects, or cough.  Works well for me.

My Doctor put me on this med. for my symtoms. And it is working very well. Now it is up to me to eat the right foods because some foods don't work well with some meds., and get just the right amount of excercise. And stay kind of cool. I find out the hard way about needing to take care of myself. Now it seems I am 30 again. I need to say that it is very important to take this med. exactly the way the doctor ordered it to you. Don't try to cheat.

I have the cough, the burning itching rash on my arms, the tingling and numb fingers, the leg cramps and the spasaming abdominlal cramps. Symtoms that I've had for years and didn't dawn on me that could be from taking this drug. Am going to my Dr. and find something else.
High Blood Pressure	judhul, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/18/2009 9:08:33 AM	I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about four months ago and was first treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone and my blood pressure would be down one week and back up the next.  My doctor then switched me to lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide and I have had good pressures ever since. My blood sugars were just at the border of being on the high side and my weight has always been a problem since I was a child, so I am trying to stick to a 1200 to 1400 low carb low fat diet also.  This has been a challege for me on top of stop smoking.  I have always been a pretty healthy and active person.  I love to bake and cook for my family and its hard not to taste those goodies I send home with the grandkids. On the same token I know I must do this in order to be around to see the grandchildren grow up.

High Blood Pressure	Matt, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Male	35-44	4/7/2009 9:20:03 AM	This drug delivers on lowering blood pressure quickly.  I went from 150s/90+s to 120s/70s within days.  The cough/dry throat side effect is bothersome, but goes away after a few months.  Having cough drops on hand took care of it until my body could adjust.  I also highly recommend Ayr saline nasal gel to stop the dry sinus side effect.  It works great at bedtime when cough drops aren't practical.  Dealing with a dry throat is uncomfortable, but I'll take that over a stroke, heart attack or kidney failure any day.
High Blood Pressure	55-64 Male  (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	55-64	4/4/2009 8:35:12 PM	After reading so many negative comments here about this drug, I think I will do what I usually do and not take drugs if there is any choice. My dr only mentioned a cough as side effect, none of the multitude of the others listed here. I now plan to lose about 20 lbs and walk more and try to eat better. I would advise it for others. Thanks for the information here.

This became constant thruout the two month period.  He immediately took me off the drug.  Drug not worth the cough that you get.
High Blood Pressure	navy2, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	65-74	3/23/2009 12:49:05 PM	My husband was on 10mg once a day simvastatin 20mg once a day. He developed a dry persistent cough, dark urine and an one time brief tremor in his left hand along with fatigue. I read the web med reviews and took him off linsinopril but the cough is persistent and the dark uring. Are any others still suffering from persistent cough and dark urine after stopping the use of linsinopril and for how long? Hei 68 and in good shape before he took the meds with occasional high blood pressure and triglycerides of 171 borderline high and cholesterol of 191.
High Blood Pressure	65-74 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3		65-74	3/16/2009 2:01:49 AM	I HAVE NOT BEEN ON THIS MEDICATION BUT APPROX 2 MONTHS AND NOT SURE IF THE DRY COUGH I HAVE IS FROM THE MEDICATION OR OTHER SOURCE.  MY SWELLING IN MY FEET AND ANKLES ARE MUCH BETTER, MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS PRETTY STABLE AT 123/70. I NOTICE THE DRY COUGH MOSTLY AT NIGHT WHEN I LIE DOWN, I KEEP WATER BY MY BED, AND WHEN I TAKE A SIP, THE COUGH USUALLY GET BETTER. I COUGH SOME IN THE DAYTIME, BUT I DON'T NOTICE IT AS MUCH.  MY CARDIOLOGIST WAS THE DR. THATPRESCRIBED THIS MEDICATION, AND THIS IS THEFIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I HAVE TAKEN BP MEDS.I HAD A MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT APPROX 22YEARS AGO AND HAVE BEEN ON COUMADIN EVER SINCE.  I AM PLAGUED WITH SINUS PROBLEMS AND INNER EAR, AND THE COUGH COULD BE FROM THAT. I ALSO TAKE MEDICINE FOR OSTEOPORSIS,FIBROMYALGIA/INNER EAR, SINUS DRAINAGE ANDINDIGESTION/HEART BURN.  I ASSUME THE LISINOPRIL/HCT IS MIXING O.K. WITH THE OTHER MEDICATION. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE MEDICATION, JUST WONDERED ABOUT THE DRY COUGH?????

This medicaine took away all of those feelings and it gave me a bit of energy. Maybe it was time to increase my medication, because I feel like I was given a new perspective of hypertension.Withthte old medicane it seemed as if I was going to feel bad, indefinately.

Unfortunatley, 2 months into taking the medication I started having very bad side effects. Dry mouth, sweating, diarrhea, leg cramps, severe dizziness, cold clamy feet, cough that is very bad at night. A month ago my doctor thought I was having panic/anxiety attacks and treated me with medication for that. I was not satisfied with this remedy so I had researched Lisinopril and found that most people had the same reactions as I did and were too treated for anxiety. I went to my doctor today and was switched from this horrible medication. The daily and nightly side effects are not worth it, there are so many meds to choose from, why suffer?!?
High Blood Pressure		4	2	1			8/16/2008 10:32:14 AM	The first day I took it, it dropped my bp.  Bottom number went from 90's to low 70's.  I felt nauseated especially if I had a drink with alcolhol in it. - woke up the next day feeling like I had partied all night.  I also started feeling like I could not get a full breath in and my heart rate went up - at rest at one time it was 119.  I am going to call my doctor on Monday and get off it.

I have a persistent dry hacking, gaging, cough. Been to doctors to get help. Nobody has picked up on this medication as being the culprit, duh! I have also had allergy tests with recommendation to start allergy shots for dust mite allergy (because of the cough). I should have gone to this web site long time ago. I will address this med with doctor immediately, if not sooner, (joke)! Thanks to the cough I am now taking many meds for allergy related to coughing, some really not affordable (copay).

High Blood Pressure	W.S., 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	55-64	7/2/2008 3:28:37 AM	Frequent irritating deep long dry cough, too a dry long heaving cough,condition worse at night.I am a non-smoker. Unhealthy feelings, nausea.Cough causes sleeping difficulties.Feelings of fatique,slight dizziness/groggyness.Frequent urination. Body action rejection symptoms. This product may work but side effects I have experienced not worth the benefit. Concerns of self poisoning with product by body side effects response to it. I question whether risk is worth reward on this combo product. Blood pressure and heart beat out control last few years but at least felt healthy without product. It is no fun feeling sickly taking it. HDC did not work alone with me. Combo of two might be, to soon to tell, however both drugs combined are doing little or nothing with racing heartbeat situation. Taking this two-drug combo concerns me as much as having high blood pressure and not being able to do anything about it. An aging problem I guess we all must deal with somewhere down the line.Summation: To many negitive side effects between the two drugs. Will seek other options from doctor. The smoker's cough/dry heaves and nausea alone will make you want to discontinue this blood pressure treatment. Still on treatment and not a happy camper. What to do?

High Blood Pressure	magpiemaggie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	2	1	Female	55-64	6/16/2008 9:23:33 AM	Has dropped BP, but so did enalapril-hctz for many years. Cough started right away and frequent urination. 1 week on meds passed out (seizure/foaming at mouth) and spent 3 days in hospital. On cardiac monitor and tests...heart OK.  Severe pain across chest and back, is difficult to take breath or move. Must take 2 hydrocordone every 4hours for any relief of pain. The day I passed out I had been in yard mostly in shade for several hours then had first massage(gentle) in over a year.  Was standing in shade visiting with neighbor when I passed out. Discharged on same new BP meds Lisinopril-HCTZ 20/12.5mg 1 in am and Amlodipine Besylate 5mg -1 in pm. Both are new for me (starting 2nd wk).  I questioned whether 'seizure' was caused by the new meds. Internist who changed my meds and cardiologists said no.  In meantime &quot;no cause&quot; found and now I am forbidden to drive for 3 months by law and I am afraid to be alone! See internist in 2 days...going to insist I go back on Enalapril in AM and Toprol XL in evening.

I have a nagging little cough 24 hours a day, but cough drops help. Being in the heat is scary, though. I went to a festival yesterday, for less than an hour, and had to go home, due to severe dizzyness and stomach cramps. I checked my blood pressure when I got home and it was 89/57!! So, I recommend staying out of the sun when taking this medication!

I'll give it a month to sort itsself out and then we'll see.
High Blood Pressure	tennis babe, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	5/20/2008 1:47:50 AM	This drug DID lower my BP, and also made me dizzy. The WORST reaction however came on the 3rd day of taking it. I began to HICCUP. The HICCUPS were CONSTANT! I couldn't sleep. I couldn't work, as I talk to clients all day &amp; I really couldn't do that while hiccupping. The Dr. told me hiccups were not caused by this medicine so I continued to take it. After 10 days of suffering this &amp; being totally exhausted,  a nurse friend told me she thought it was my BP meds, so I quit taking them. The hiccups stopped!! I changed Dr.s after this!

High Blood Pressure	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	35-44	1/8/2008 9:54:59 AM	I toke the generic version of this and it did lower my blood pressure, however I have to urinate way too often (some vaginal discomfort) and sometimes cannot prevent the urine from &quot;starting before I am in the restroom&quot;.  I have stopped taking it.

I am very pleased and feel more energetic. I do not have that 'tired' feeling all the time. I am walking briskly 3 miles a day now and do not feel winded.I have no adverse reactions.

When I tried the same strength without it was not effective for me so after a month we switched back. I am curious about the long term effects that I may not have bee told about?

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	55-64	10/25/2007 8:22:17 PM	This drug made me extremely nauseous for 11-12 hours a day.  Could not work, barely sit up.  Took blood pressure down but I was apparently allergic to it.  Nausea was extreme and exactly what a friend described as an awful chemo treatment.  Took for 5 days, even a 75% drop in dosage still made me just as sick.  I did not read side effects and warnings until 5th day to make sure any effects were the medicine and not me just thinking I had side effects.
