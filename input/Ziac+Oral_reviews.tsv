I still watch my salt intake and exercise daily.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	10/6/2010 10:52:51 PM	Been on generic form since '03,10/6.25, without any problems, usual side effects; colder hands and feet, dry mouth etc. recently had fluid drawn from knee that showed calcium salt crystals, probably a result from the HCTZ, that can cause &quot;PSUEDO GOUT&quot; (fake gout). Changed to just the Bisoprolol Fumerate today. Puesdo gout mimics regular gout (caused by Uric Acid crystals) but with less frequency of symptoms. Been very happy with results, but if you don't need to take HCTZ, talk to your doctor about changing to just the Bisoprolol Fumerate.

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	25-34	1/30/2010 12:08:51 PM	I took a very low dose of the medication for about 5 years.  Blood pressure was good entire time but side effects gradually got worse. Experienced extremely dry mouth, fatigue, cold hands and feet, restless legs, and headaches. Taken off the drug about two months ago and started feeling much better within a week of stopping.  Still trying out medications to reduce blood pressure but the side effects of Ziac definitely outweighed the benefit for me.

(10MG/6.25MG tablet) BP is usually around 125-135/70-75. From everything I've read &amp; been told, you should not have to worry about BP until it's around 140/90. I guess I'll have a talk with my M.D. &amp; ask why I'm taking this.
