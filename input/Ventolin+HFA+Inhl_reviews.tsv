It scared me at first. When I felt my pulse I could feel my heart randomly speed up or &quot;flutter&quot;. I also felt very lightheaded the first 10-20 minutes after inhaling. But overall I was please and it helped me recover from my bronchitis.

Bronchospasm Prevention	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	45-54	5/6/2011 7:55:57 AM	This was my first time using Ventolin or any puffer. It worked well, opening my airway more and preventing coughing. After my 1st day of use, however, I got a severe leg cramp in my R calf muscle in bed in the morning.

Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/10/2010 5:06:07 PM	This is my first time using this medication and I have used several different ones in the  past and this on is by far the best. I also like the meter it lets me know when I'm getting close to running out. I also found that the cost is much better than other inhalers I've used.
Bronchitis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	2/12/2010 1:08:48 AM	It makes my heart beat pretty fast and I have to lay down until I come off of it, but for right now it's the only thing that relieves my shortness of breath. I do, however, feel that it makes me more light-headed than my shortness of breath does, which sometimes worries me.
Asthma	25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4		25-34	2/4/2010 2:22:19 AM	I find that this product is one of the better new HFA.  It still has a little more force to it then some of the other products.  The cost is the only downside to this product.

Bronchospasm	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	11/29/2009 10:47:48 PM	Initially it helped bring up the phlegm in my lungs. However, within hours I developed a terrible headache that was migraine in nature. It took several days of being in bed with the headache before I put 2 and 2 together and stopped using the inhaler. After stopping the inhaler the headache disappeared. The headache was definitely worse than the bronchospasms.

Asthma Attack	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/16/2009 7:42:01 PM	I Love it! No more shakiness or rapid heartbeats. It works fast, is soothing and reduced subsequent attacks. I was crushed when insurance stopped paying for it and I had to try Proventil which burned my lungs. Forutunately I got another insurance company and bought it myself.

It does something to my lungs and every morning I wake up coughing too much like if my lungs are trying to kick out the medicine. The side effects are terrible. I am scared to use it!
Other	Reverend, Arland Lester, 0-2 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Male	0-2	4/21/2009 9:30:29 AM	I am a Grandfather of a two year old which the wife and I care fore 4 days out of the week.  I personally observed yesterday that 30-60 minutes after giving our grandchild two puffs he became very agitated unable to sleep, Lying on the floor rubbing his head and eyes severely, twisting and turning, unable to touch him, almost like a seizure, lasted for about 1 hour.  Observed, headache, pain, invol-quivering, cough, sweating, Heart throbbing. Actions totally out of character for our grandchild,  Not the terrible twos.  After effects wear off everything goes back to normal.  It was scary, much more so when a baby cannot tell you what they are feeling.Reverend, Arland Lester618-233-6096
Asthma	45-54 Female  (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	3/14/2009 12:22:00 PM	The new inhalers do not seem to work as well as the old ones. After talking to my pharmasist (been one for 20 years) he said many people have complained about the effectiveness of the new inhalers and I agree they don't work! My neubulizer works much better but can't exactly take it to my job to use.
