Other	NO For Factive, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	6/17/2012 9:11:17 AM	My doctor has prescribed (Factive) as a treatment for my tonssils infection, and it was a 7 day course. After I was done with this medicine I experienced some red pimples all over my body on the 8th day, that turned onto itchy RASH all over my body, and my face was swaollen and redish. This is my 3rd day with the body rashes and I am still taking an Antihistamine but the rashes are spread all over my body and not gone yet. The dermatologist told me that it might take 3 weeks till they are gone. I would not take this medicine again because of the horrible side effects.
Other	mewtwo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	11/2/2011 3:25:19 AM	My physician put me on Factive for 7 days due to recurrent tonsillitis. After finishing my course of antibiotics, on the 9th day, I developed a rash over my torso and back. My face was also very swollen. The rash was not itchy. The pharmacist put me on Histamed for 5 days (this is the 3rd day I take Histamed). The swelling in my face is better, the rash on my chest is also better, but my back is still the same. My tonsillitis is gone but I am never taking this medication again. Check if you are allergic to quinolones before you take Factive, the side effects are not worth it.
Other	m.k., 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	11/1/2011 6:36:07 AM	My physician prescribed Factive for my tonsillitis, which has been recurrent throughout summer over the past few years. I took a 7 day course of antibiotics. On the afternoon of the 9th day, I noticed some red blotches behind my ears and over my chest. I have psoriasis so I dismissed it and thought that maybe my psoriasis was acting out. That evening, the blotches got way worse and I had a rash all over my chest and back. The next day the rash got even worse, and my face was very swollen. I contacted my physician and scheduled an appointment with him that day. In the meanwhile, I was taking Histamed (antihistamines) for the rash as prescribed by the pharmacist (I couldn't wait for the doctor's appointment as I was getting worse). The doctor told me that this was an allergic reaction to Factive, and that I was allergic to quinolones and should not take them anymore (I had never taken quinolones before). The rash is not itchy, but quite widespread all over my torso and back. This is the second day that I take antihistamines, and the sweeling on my face is better, although the rash on my chest and back looks the same. The doctor gave me the name of a steroid shot to take in case the rash gets worse and doesn't stay localized but I hope I won't have to use it. Before taking this medication make sure you are not allergic to quinolones and if there is a different antibiotic you can take that could still treat your infection. The side effects and the rash are not worth it!
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	45-54	10/6/2011 12:53:32 PM	Prescribed as antibiotic during treatment of a tough infection. Took for a couple of weeks.  No rash, but got extra extra fatigued and also very depressed which is not me, even while sick I am a persistent fighter. Doctor immediately stopped Factive and switched to different antibiotic, and I felt better only a couple of days later.  Something was not right. Look up and READ  the full Precautions section on RXLIST.com's drug info...NOT just the dumbed-down patient/consumer blurb  handed out by pharmacy. I see that depression and cns risks are clearly stated along with many other serious risks. Also, look up online the risks associated with this class of drugs... very significant. If you get rash or tendon/muscle symptoms discontinue immediately... tendon rupture can occur afterwards too.  
Bacterial Infection with Chronic Bronchitis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	4/28/2011 9:29:33 AM	I had a terrible experience with Factive.  I broke out with a rash over my entire body that was so itchy I literally couldn't sit still.  It was one of the worst experiences of my life. I was miserable!!
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	3/2/2011 11:28:58 PM	My Father-in-law's doctor prescribed me Factive for a sinus infection a few weeks ago. 9 days after the start of treatment (2 days after it was all finished) I broke out in a horrifying rash all over my body! I had never had an allergic reaction to a medication (or anything) before. The rash was the most awful experience, I could not stop thinking of the burning and itching (felt like the severe sunburn x 10). I could not sit down because my butt had the hives the worst (not a pretty sight)! I was forced to lay on my side for about 3 days non-stop, only place it was tolerable. Went to another doctor for the rash and she instantly knew the culprit was Factive. (I hadn't thought that this was the cause because I was already finished with the Factive). She said that the med builds up in the system and many allergic reactions have a delay. She also said that most doctors do not prescribe this med anymore because so many people have the allergic reaction to it. I was very upset that the first doctor did prescribe this to me, especially for something like a sinus infection. It is important to have a doctor who is up to date on their research! I was given steroids to treat the rash (Medrol). The rash started getting better and lasted a total of 5 days. Please, DO NOT TAKE FACTIVE! It is not worth the risk, you may be allergic to it even if you have never had a known allergy. Only try this med if it is the only antibiotic option you have, and you have a worthwhile infection!

On the 4th day after completeting the Factive, I broke out in a terrible itchy rash that started on my legs and is now covering my entire torso.  I ran to the doctor and was given a one week steroid treatment.  I am still not completely over my respiratory infection either.  I should have been suspicious of this drug when after going to 5 pharmacy's I finally found one that stocked it.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!

Other	Momof two, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	10/25/2010 5:35:52 PM	3 and a half days after I finished 7 days of this antibiotic named Factive, I developed a severe rash on my torso, arms and legs. I think the pharmaceutical company is downplaying this side effect. My doctor admitted that he's seen this side effect much more often than what the literature says. I've been put on steroids and antihistamines and I hope that takes care of it. I've never had a rash in my entire life and I'm concerned that other side effects may crop up too. The list of side effects is long and troubling. I wish I had not tried this rather new antibiotic for my sinus infection.

On Saturday, his cough was severly worse.On Sunday,he started with diarrhea. On Monday, he started with fever and aching all over, headaches,flu like symptons. Monday, he stopped taking it. Who in their right mind would put something on the market, that would make people have new like infections when they are already sick? How did this make it on the market? In my opinion it needs to be taken off the market. My husband is miserable and needless to say sicker now than before he went to the doctor.

It does not itch, but I feel better knowing that other people have experienced the same thing and that it is probably due to the medicine.
