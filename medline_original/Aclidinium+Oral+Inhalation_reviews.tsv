<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Aclidinium is used as a long term treatment to prevent wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways) such as chronic bronchitis (swelling of the air passages that lead to the lungs) and emphysema (damage to air sacs in the lungs). Aclidinium is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Aclidinium comes as a dry powder in an inhalation device to inhale by mouth. It is usually inhaled twice a day, once every 12 hours. Inhale aclidinium at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Inhale aclidinium exactly as directed. Do not inhale more or less of it or inhale it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not use aclidinium to treat a sudden attack of wheezing or shortness of breath. Your doctor will prescribe a rescue medication to treat sudden attacks of symptoms. Keep this medication with you at all times in case you have sudden difficulty breathing. </p>
<p>Your condition may worsen over time during your treatment with aclidinium. Do not take extra doses of aclidinium if this happens. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, you need to use your rescue medication to treat sudden attacks more often, or your rescue medication does not relieve your symptoms as well as it did in the past.</p>
<p>Aclidinium can help control your symptoms but does not cure COPD. You may notice some improvement in your symptoms the first day that you use aclidinium, but it may take longer for you to feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use aclidinium even if you feel well. Do not stop using aclidinium without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Before you use your aclidinium inhalation device for the first time, read the manufacturer's directions for use carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the device and practice using it while he or she watches.</p>
<p>Be careful not to get aclidinium powder in your eyes. If you get the powder in your eyes, you may experience blurred vision and sensitivity to light.</p>
<p>The aclidinium inhalation device does not need to be cleaned. If you want to clean the device, you may wipe the outside of the mouthpiece with a dry tissue or paper towel. Never use water to clean the device because you might damage the medication.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
