<p>Itraconazole can cause congestive heart failure (condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood through the body). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had heart failure. Your doctor may tell you not to take itraconazole. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a heart attack; an irregular heartbeat; any other type of heart disease; lung, liver, or kidney disease; or any other serious health problem. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking itraconazole and call your doctor immediately: shortness of breath; coughing up white or pink phlegm; weakness; excessive tiredness; fast heartbeat; swelling of the feet, ankles, or legs; waking up at night; and sudden weight gain.</p>
<p>Do not take cisapride (Propulsid), dofetilide (Tikosyn), levomethadyl acetate (Orlaam) (not available in the U.S.), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), pimozide (Orap), or quinidine while taking itraconazole. Taking these medications with itraconazole can cause a serious irregular heartbeat, which can lead to death.</p>
<p>You also should not take certain calcium channel blockers such as felodipine (Plendil) and nisoldipine (Sular); certain cholesterol-lowering medications (statins) such as lovastatin (Altoprev, Mevacor, in Advicor) and simvastatin (Zocor); ergot-type medications such as bromocriptine (Cycloset, Parlodel), cabergoline, dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45, Migranal), ergoloid mesylates (Hydergine), ergotamine (Cafergot, Ergomar, Migergot), and methylergonovine (Methergine); midazolam; or triazolam (Halcion) while taking itraconazole. </p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Itraconazole capsules are used to treat fungal infections in the lungs that can spread throughout the body. Itraconazole capsules are also used to treat fungal infections of the fingernails. Itraconazole tablets and capsules are used to treat fungal infections of the toenails. Itraconazole oral solution (liquid) is used to treat yeast infections of the mouth and throat or of the esophagus (tube that connects the throat to the stomach) . Itraconazole is in a class of antifungals called triazoles. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Itraconazole comes as a capsule a tablet, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. If you are taking itraconazole to treat fungal infections in the lungs, the capsules are usually taken with a full meal one or two times a day for at least 3 months. However, if you are taking itraconazole to treat a serious fungal infection in the lungs, the capsules may be taken with a meal three times a day for the first 3 days of treatment and then taken once or twice a day with a meal for at least 3 months. If you are taking itraconazole to treat fungal infections of the toenails (including or without fingernail infections), the capsules or tablets are usually taken once a day with a full meal for 3 months. If you are taking itraconazole to treat fungal infections of the fingernails only, the capsules are usually taken twice a day with a full meal for one week, skipped for three weeks, and then taken twice a day with a meal for a week. Itraconazole solution is usually taken on an empty stomach once or twice a day for 1–4 weeks or sometimes longer. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take itraconazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to take itraconazole capsules with a cola soft drink if you have certain medical conditions or are taking any of the following medications: cimetidine (Tagamet); famotidine (Pepcid); nizatidine (Axid); proton-pump inhibitors such as esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), and rabeprazole (AcipHex); or ranitidine (Zantac). Follow these directions carefully.</p>
<p>To take itraconazole oral solution for fungal infections of the mouth or throat, swish 10 milliliters (about 2 teaspoons) of the solution in your mouth for several seconds and swallow. Repeat if necessary to take your entire dose.</p>
<p>Itraconazole capsules and oral solution are absorbed into the body in different ways and work to treat different conditions. Do not substitute the capsules for the liquid or the liquid for the capsules. Be sure that your pharmacist gives you the itraconazole product that your doctor prescribed.</p>
<p>If you are taking itraconazole to treat a nail infection, your nails will probably not look healthier until new nails grow. It can take up to 6 months to grow a new fingernail and up to 12 months to grow a new toenail, so you should not expect to see improvement during your treatment or for several months afterward. Continue to take itraconazole even if you do not see any improvement.</p>
<p>Continue to take itraconazole until your doctor tells you to stop even if you feel well. Do not stop taking itraconazole without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking itraconazole too soon, your infection may come back after a short time.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
