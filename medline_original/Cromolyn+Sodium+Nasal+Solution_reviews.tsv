<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Cromolyn is used to prevent and treat stuffy nose, sneezing, runny nose, and other symptoms caused by allergies. It works by preventing the release of substances that cause inflammation (swelling) in the air passages of the nose.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Cromolyn comes as a solution to use with a special nasal applicator. It usually is inhaled three to six times a day to prevent allergy symptoms. It is most effective when used before you come in contact with substances that cause allergies. If you have seasonal allergies, continue to use the drug until the season is over.</p>
<p>Follow the directions on the package or your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use cromolyn exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed or prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>It may take up to 4 weeks for cromolyn to work. If your symptoms have not improved after 4 weeks, tell your doctor.</p>
<p>Cromolyn is used with a special applicator (Nasalmatic). Before you use cromolyn for the first time, read the instructions provided with the solution. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to demonstrate the proper technique. Practice using the device while in his or her presence.</p>
<p>If you are to use the nasal spray, first blow your nose, and clear it as much as possible. Insert the applicator into a nostril. Sniff as you squeeze the sprayer once. To prevent mucous from entering the sprayer, do not release your grip until after you remove the sprayer from your nose. Repeat this process for your other nostril.</p>
