<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Indinavir is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Indinavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although indinavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Indinavir comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 8 hours (three times a day). Take indinavir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take indinavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Take indinavir on an empty stomach, 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals, with water, skim or nonfat milk, juice, coffee, or tea. However, if indinavir upsets your stomach, it may be taken with a light meal, such as dry toast or cornflakes with skim or nonfat milk. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about what foods may be taken with indinavir.</p>
<p>Continue to take indinavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking indinavir without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may need to interrupt your treatment if you experience certain side effects. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with indinavir.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

Be sure to mention any of the following: bosentan (Tracleer); calcium-channel blockers such as amlodipine (Norvasc, in Caduet, Lotrel), felodipine (Plendil, in Lexxel), nicardipine (Cardene), and nifedipine (Adalat, Nifedical, Procardia); carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol, others); cholesterol-lowering medications (statins) such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor); clarithromycin (Biaxin, in PrevPac); colchicine (Colcrys); dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexpak); fluticasone (in Advair, Flonase, Flovent); itraconazole (Sporanox); ketoconazole (Nizoral); other medications for HIV including atazanavir (Reyataz), delavirdine (Rescriptor), efavirenz (Sustiva, in Atripla), nelfinavir (Viracept), nevirapine (Viramune), ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra), and saquinavir (Fortovase, Invirase); medications for irregular heartbeat such as lidocaine (Xylocaine) and quinidine; medications that suppress the immune system such as cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune), sirolimus (Rapamune), and tacrolimus (Prograf); midazolam (Versed) by injection; certain phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDE-5 inhibitors) used for erectile dysfunction such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra); phenobarbital; phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek, others); rifabutin (Mycobutin); rifampin (Rimactane, in Rifamate, in Rifater, Rifadin); salmeterol (in Advair, Serevent); tadalafil (Adcirca); trazodone; and venlafaxine (Effexor). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Many other medications may also interact with indinavir, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list.</li>
<li>tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort.</li>
<li>if you are taking didanosine (Videx), take it at least one hour before or after indinavir.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had hemophilia (bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly), diabetes, or kidney or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking indinavir, call your doctor. You should not breast-feed if you are infected with HIV or if you are taking indinavir.</li>
<li>you should know that your body fat may increase or move to different areas of your body such as your breasts, upper back, neck, chest, and stomach area. Loss of fat from the legs, arms, and face can also happen.</li>
<li>you should know that you may experience hyperglycemia (increases in your blood sugar) while you are taking this medication, even if you do not already have diabetes. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking indinavir: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, or weakness. It is very important to call your doctor as soon as you have any of these symptoms, because high blood sugar that is not treated can cause a serious condition called ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis may become life-threatening if it is not treated at an early stage. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include: dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, breath that smells fruity, and decreased consciousness.</li>
<li>you should know that while you are taking medications to treat HIV infection, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms at anytime during your treatment with indinavir, be sure to tell your doctor.</li>
