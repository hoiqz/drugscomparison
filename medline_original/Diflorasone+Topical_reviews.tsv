<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Diflorasone comes as a cream and an ointment to apply to the skin. It is usually applied to the affected area one to three times a day. To help you remember to use diflorasone, apply it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use diflorasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Wash or soak the affected area thoroughly before applying the medicine, unless it irritates your skin. Then apply the ointment or cream sparingly in a thin film and rub it in gently.</p>
<p>If you are using diflorasone on your face, keep it out of your eyes.</p>
<p>If you are using diflorasone on a child's diaper area, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. Such use may increase side effects.</p>
<p>Do not apply cosmetics or other skin preparations on the treated area without talking with your doctor.</p>
<h3>Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor tells you to wrap or bandage the treated area, follow these instructions:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Soak the area in water or wash it well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the skin is moist, gently rub the medication into the affected areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover the area with plastic wrap (such as Saran Wrap or Handi-Wrap). The plastic may be held in place with a gauze or elastic bandage or adhesive tape on the normal skin beside the treated area. (Instead of using plastic wrap, plastic gloves may be used for the hands, plastic bags for the feet, or a shower cap for the scalp.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carefully seal the edges of the plastic to make sure the wrap adheres closely to the skin. If the affected area is moist, you can leave the edges of the plastic wrap partly unsealed or puncture the wrap to allow excess moisture to escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the plastic wrapping in place as long as instructed by your doctor. Usually plastic wraps are left in place not more than 12 hours each day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleanse the skin and reapply the medication each time a new plastic wrapping is applied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
