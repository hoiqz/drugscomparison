<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Gefitinib is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer in people who have already been treated with certain other chemotherapy medications and have not improved or whose condition has worsened. Gefitinib has not been shown to help people who have non-small cell lung cancer live longer. There are other medications that may help people who have non-small cell lung cancer live longer. Therefore, only people who have already taken gefitinib and benefited from the medication should continue to take it. People who have never taken gefitinib should start their treatment with a medication that is known to help patients with lung cancer live longer. Gefitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of a certain naturally occurring substance that may be needed to help cancer cells multiply.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Gefitinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. Take gefitinib at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take gefitinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you are unable to swallow the tablets, you may dissolve them in water. Place one tablet in a half a glass of plain, non-carbonated drinking water. Stir with a spoon for about 10 minutes until the tablet is dissolved. Do not use the spoon to crush the tablet. Drink the mixture right away. Rinse the glass with another half glass of water and drink the rinse water to be sure that you swallow all of the medication.</p>
<p>Gefitinib is not available in pharmacies. You can only get gefitinib through a distribution program that has been set up by the manufacturer for people who have taken gefitinib in the past. You will need to sign a consent form before you receive any medication. You will receive your medication by mail from a specific mail order pharmacy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about receiving your medication.</p>
