<strong>Statement from Forest Laboratories Re: Availability of Thyrolar:</strong>
</p>
<p>[Posted 5/18/2012] U.S. Pharmacopeia, an official public standards-setting authority for all prescription and over-the-counter medicines and other health care products manufactured or sold in the United States, has mandated new specifications for a component used in the manufacturing of Thyrolar. As a result, all strengths of Thyrolar are currently on long-term back order while Forest makes the modifications necessary to meet these new specifications.</p>
<p>Forest is working diligently to complete these modifications. In the meantime, patients should speak with their physician regarding appropriate treatment for their condition, and check for future updates on the availability of Thyrolar through the Forest product availability toll-free hotline at 
<phone-num>(866) 927-3260</phone-num>.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Liotrix is used to treat hypothyroidism (a condition that results when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone). Symptoms of hypothyroidism include lack of energy, depression, constipation, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, dry coarse hair, muscle cramps, decreased concentration, aches and pains, swelling of the legs, and increased sensitivity to cold. When taken correctly, liotrix can reverse these symptoms. Liotrix is also used to treat goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). This medication is also used to test for hyperthyroidism (a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone). Liotrix is in a class of medications called thyroid agents. It works by supplying the thyroid hormones normally produced by the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Liotrix comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day before breakfast or the first food of the day. Take liotrix at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take liotrix exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of liotrix and gradually increase your dose not more than once every 2 to 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Liotrix controls hypothyroidism but does not cure it. It may take several weeks before you feel the full benefit of liotrix. Continue to take liotrix even if you feel well. Do not stop taking liotrix without talking to your doctor.</p>
