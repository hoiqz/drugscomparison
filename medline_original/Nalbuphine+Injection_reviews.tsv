<h2>About your treatment</h2>

<p>Your doctor has ordered nalbuphine, an analgesic (painkiller), to relieve your pain. The drug will be injected into a large muscle (such as your buttock or hip), under your skin, or into a vein.</p>
<p>You will probably receive nalbuphine every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Your doctor may also order other pain medications to make you more comfortable. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
<p>Your health care provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how you respond to the medication.</p>

<h2>Precautions</h2>

<h3>Before administering nalbuphine,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to nalbuphine, medications containing sulfites, or any other drugs.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially antidepressants; medications for cough, cold, or allergies; naloxone (Narcan); naltrexone (ReVia); other pain relievers; sedatives; sleeping pills; tranquilizers; and vitamins.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had breathing difficulties, including asthma and other respiratory diseases, liver or kidney disease, severe inflammatory bowel disease, or a history of drug dependence.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking nalbuphine, call your doctor.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking nalbuphine.</li>

<h2>Administering your medication</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Before you administer nalbuphine, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.</p>
<p>It is important that you use your medication exactly as directed. Nalbuphine can be habit forming. Do not administer it more often or for a longer period than your doctor tells you. Do not change your dosing schedule without talking to your health care provider.</p>
