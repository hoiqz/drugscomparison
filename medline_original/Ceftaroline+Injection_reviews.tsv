<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ceftaroline injection is used to treat some types of skin infections and pneumonia (lung infection) caused by certain bacteria. Ceftaroline is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ceftaroline injection comes as a powder to be added to fluid and given through a needle or catheter placed in your vein. It is usually injected intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 60 minutes twice a day (once every 12 hours) for 5 to 14 days. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have. You may receive ceftaroline injection in a hospital or you may give the medication at home. If you are using ceftaroline injection at home, use it at around the same times every day. Use ceftaroline injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you will be using ceftaroline injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to inject the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Ask your healthcare provider what to do if you have any problems injecting ceftaroline injection.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first few days of your treatment with ceftaroline injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Use ceftaroline injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ceftaroline injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
