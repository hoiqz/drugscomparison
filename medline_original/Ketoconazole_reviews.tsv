<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ketoconazole is used to treat fungal infections. Ketoconazole is most often used to treat fungal infections that can spread to different parts of the body through the bloodstream such as yeast infections of the mouth, skin, urinary tract, and blood, and certain fungal infections that begin on the skin or in the lungs and can spread through the body. Ketoconazole is also used to treat fungal infections of the skin or nails that cannot be treated with other medications. Ketoconazole is in a class of antifungals called imidazoles. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ketoconazole comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take ketoconazole, take it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ketoconazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you have certain medical conditions, your doctor will tell you to take ketoconazole tablets dissolved in an acid solution. Your doctor will tell you exactly how to do this. Follow these directions carefully.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of ketoconazole. Your doctor may increase your dose if your infection is very serious or your condition does not improve.</p>
<p>You may need to take ketoconazole for several weeks or months to cure your infection completely. Your doctor will probably order laboratory tests to be sure your infection has been treated. Continue to take ketoconazole until your doctor tells you that you should stop, even if you feel better. Do not stop taking ketoconazole without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking ketoconazole too soon, your infection may come back after a short time.</p>
