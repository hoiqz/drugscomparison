<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Vaginal clindamycin is used to treat bacterial vaginosis (an infection caused by an overgrowth of harmful bacteria in the vagina). Clindamycin is in a class of medications called lincomycin antibiotics. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of bacteria. Vaginal clindamycin cannot be used to treat vaginal irritation caused by yeast infections or by sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and trichomoniasis.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Vaginal clindamycin comes as a suppository to place in the vagina and a cream to apply to the inside of the vagina. The vaginal suppositories are usually used once a day, preferably at bedtime, for 3 days in a row. Most brands of the vaginal cream are used once a day, preferably at bedtime, for 3 days in a row or for 7 days in a row. One brand of vaginal cream (Clindesse<sup>®</sup>) is usually used as a single dose, given at any time of day. If you are using more than one dose of vaginal clindamycin, use it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use vaginal clindamycin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>This medication is for vaginal use only. Do not swallow the cream or suppositories, and do not apply the cream to any other part of your body. Be careful not to get the cream in your eyes. If you do get the cream in your eyes, rinse your eyes with plenty of cool water.</p>
<p>Your medication will come with directions for use. Read these directions and follow them carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use vaginal clindamycin.</p>
<p>Use vaginal clindamycin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using vaginal clindamycin too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
