<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Isoetharine is used to prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other lung diseases. It relaxes and opens air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Isoetharine comes as an aerosol and a solution to inhale by mouth. It is used as needed to relieve symptoms but usually should not be used more than every 4 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use isoetharine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Isoetharine controls symptoms of asthma and other lung diseases but does not cure them. Do not stop using isoetharine without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Before you use isoetharine the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to demonstrate the proper technique. Practice using the inhaler while in his or her presence.</p>
<h3>To use the inhaler, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Shake the inhaler well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the protective cap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exhale (breathe out) as completely as possible through your nose while keeping your mouth shut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Open Mouth Technique:</em> Open your mouth wide, and place the open end of the mouthpiece about 1 to 2 inches from your mouth.</p>
<p>
<em>Closed Mouth Technique:</em> Place the open end of the mouthpiece well into your mouth, past your front teeth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a slow, deep breath through the mouthpiece and, at the same time, press down on the container to spray the medication into your mouth. Be sure that the mist goes into your throat and is not blocked by your teeth or tongue. Adults giving the treatment to young children may hold the child's nose closed to be sure that the medication goes into the child's throat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold your breath for 5-10 seconds, remove the inhaler, and exhale slowly through your nose or mouth. If you take 2 puffs, wait 2 minutes and shake the inhaler well before taking the second puff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the protective cap on the inhaler.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have difficulty getting the medication into your lungs, a spacer (a special device that attaches to the inhaler) may help; ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist.</p>
