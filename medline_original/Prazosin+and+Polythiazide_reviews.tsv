<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Prazosin and polythiazide should not be the first medicine you use for high blood pressure. Your medications must be carefully adjusted to treat high blood pressure. If you have not been on any medication for high blood pressure before prazosin and polythiazide, check with your doctor again before taking it.</p>
</div><div id=hgroup
<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>The combination of prazosin and polythiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. It is a combination of two medicines. Prazosin, an alpha-block antihypertensive, works by relaxing blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body. Polythiazide, a thiazide diuretic ('water pill'), causes the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
<a name="how">

<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>The combination of prazosin and polythiazide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken two to three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take prazosin and polythiazide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>The combination of prazosin and polythiazide controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take prazosin and polythiazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking prazosin and polythiazide without talking to your doctor.</p>
