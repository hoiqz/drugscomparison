<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Saquinavir is used in combination with ritonavir (Norvir) and other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Saquinavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although saquinavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Saquinavir comes as a capsule and a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with ritonavir (Norvir) two times a day within 2 hours after a full meal. It may be easier to remember to take saquinavir if you take it with meals. Take saquinavir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take saquinavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Continue to take saquinavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking saquinavir without talking to your doctor. If you miss doses, take less than the prescribed dose or stop taking saquinavir, your condition may become more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with saquinavir and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<li>tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking or plan to take, especially St. John's wort and garlic capsules.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease, a prolonged QT interval (rare heart problem that may cause irregular heartbeat, fainting, or sudden death), or low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood. Also tell your doctor if you have complete atrioventricular (AV) block (slowed electrical activity in the heart) and you do not have a pacemaker. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take saquinavir.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol,  if you have ever taken any form of saquinavir in the past, and if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had diabetes. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had an irregular heartbeat, high cholesterol or triglycerides (fats in the blood); hemophilia (a bleeding disorder); or heart or kidney disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking saquinavir, call your doctor. You should not breast-feed if you are infected with HIV or are taking saquinavir.</li>
<li>you should know that saquinavir may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, or injections). Talk to your doctor about using another form of birth control.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking saquinavir.</li>
<li>you should be aware that your body fat may increase or move to different areas of your body, such as your upper back, neck (''buffalo hump''), breasts, and around your stomach. You may notice a loss of body fat from your face, legs, and arms.</li>
<li>you should know that you may experience hyperglycemia (increases in your blood sugar) while you are taking this medication, even if you do not already have diabetes. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking saquinavir: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, or weakness. It is very important to call your doctor as soon as you have any of these symptoms, because high blood sugar that is not treated can cause a serious condition called ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis may become life-threatening if it is not treated at an early stage. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include: dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, breath that smells fruity, and decreased consciousness.</li>
<li>you should know that while you are taking medications to treat HIV infection, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms after starting treatment with saquinavir, be sure to tell your doctor.</li>
