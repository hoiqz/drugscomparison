<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Tapentadol is used to treat moderate to severe pain that is expected to last for a short time. Tapentadol is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics. It works by changing the way the body responds to pain.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Tapentadol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Your doctor may tell you that you may take a second dose as soon as 1 hour after the first dose on your first day of treatment if needed to treat your pain. Do not take extra doses at any other time during your treatment. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tapentadol exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of tapentadol and gradually increase your dose until your pain is controlled. Your doctor may adjust your dose at any time during your treatment if your pain is not controlled. If you feel that your pain is not controlled, call your doctor. Do not change the dose of your medication without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Tapentadol should only be used to treat moderate to severe pain. You should not take tapentadol if your pain is mild and can be controlled with other pain medicines.</p>
<p>Tapentadol may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time or in a different way than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking tapentadol without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking tapentadol, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety; sweating; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; shivering; shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control; pain; nausea; diarrhea; runny nose, sneezing, or coughing; hair on your skin standing on end; or hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist).</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with tapentadol. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

Your doctor may tell you not to take tapentadol.</li>

<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking tapentadol, call your doctor.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking tapentadol.</li>
<li>you should know that tapentadol may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car, operate machinery, or participate in any other possibly dangerous activities until you know how this medication affects you.</li>
<li>ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking tapentadol. Alcohol can make the side effects from tapentadol worse.</li>
<li>you should know that tapentadol may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.</li>
