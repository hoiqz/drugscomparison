<p>Cetuximab may cause severe or life-threatening reactions while you receive the medication. These reactions are more common with the first dose of cetuximab, but may occur at any time during treatment. Your doctor will watch you carefully while you receive each dose of cetuximab and for at least one hour afterwards. Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms during or after your infusion: shortness of breath, wheezing or noisy breathing, hoarseness, hives, fainting, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, or chest pain or pressure. If you experience a severe reaction, your doctor will stop your infusion and treat the symptoms of the reaction. You will not be able to receive treatment with cetuximab in the future. </p>
<p>People with a head and neck cancer who are treated with radiation therapy and cetuximab may have an increased risk of cardiopulmonary arrest (condition in which the heart stops beating and breathing stops) and/or sudden death during or after their treatment. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had coronary artery disease (condition that occurs when the blood vessels of the heart are narrowed by fat or cholesterol deposits); angina (chest pain or pressure); a heart attack; congestive heart failure; irregular heartbeat; other heart disease; or lower than normal levels of magnesium, potassium, or calcium in your blood.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests during and after your treatment to check your body's response to cetuximab.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of using cetuximab.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Cetuximab is used with or without radiation therapy to treat a certain type of cancer of the head and neck. Cetuximab is also used alone or in combination with another medication to treat a certain type of cancer of the colon (large intestine) or rectum that has spread to other parts of the body. Cetuximab has been shown to slow the growth of tumors in people who have cancer of the colon or rectum. However, it has not been shown to help people who have cancer of the colon or rectum feel better or live longer. Cetuximab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells.</p>
