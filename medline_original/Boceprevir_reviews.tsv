<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Boceprevir is used along with two other medications (ribavirin [Copegus, Rebetol] and peginterferon alfa [Pegasys]) to treat chronic hepatitis C (an ongoing viral infection that damages the liver) in people who have not yet been treated for this condition or whose condition did not improve when they were treated with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa alone. Boceprevir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the body. Boceprevir may not prevent the spread of hepatitis C to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Boceprevir comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with a meal or light snack three times a day (every 7 to 9 hours). Take boceprevir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take boceprevir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You will take peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for 4 weeks before you begin treatment with boceprevir. Then you will take all three medications for 12 to 44 weeks. After this time, you will stop taking boceprevir, but you may continue to take peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for an additional number of weeks. The length of your treatment depends on your condition, how well you respond to the medication, and whether you experience severe side effects. Continue to take boceprevir, peginterferon alfa, and ribavirin as long as they are prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking any of these medications without talking to your doctor even if you are feeling well.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with boceprevir and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
