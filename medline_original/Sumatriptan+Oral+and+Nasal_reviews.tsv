<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Sumatriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes is accompanied by nausea or sensitivity to sound and light). Sumatriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the head and stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain. Sumatriptan does not prevent migraine attacks.</p>

Do not take more than 200 mg of the tablets or 40 mg of the nasal spray in any 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sumatriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
