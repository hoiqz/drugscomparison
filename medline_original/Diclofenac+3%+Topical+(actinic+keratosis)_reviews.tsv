<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Diclofenac 3% topical gel is used to treat actinic keratosis (flat, scaly growths on the skin caused by too much sun exposure). Diclofenac is in a class of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The way diclofenac 3% gel works to treat actinic keratosis is not known.</p>
<p>Diclofenac is also available as a 1% liquid (Pennsaid) and a 1% gel (Voltaren) that are applied to the skin to treat arthritis pain. This monograph only gives information about diclofenac 3% gel. If you are using either of the 1% products, read the monograph entitled <a href="a611002.html">Diclofenac 1% Topical (osteoarthritis pain)</a> that has been written about those products.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Topical diclofenac 3% comes as a gel to apply to the skin. It is applied to the affected area two times a day for 60 to 90 days. Apply diclofenac 3% gel at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use diclofenac 3% gel exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not apply diclofenac 3% gel to open skin wounds, infections, or red, scaly, or peeling skin.</p>
<p>Diclofenac 3% gel is only for use on the skin. Be careful not to get the medication in your eyes.</p>
<p>Wash your hands before applying diclofenac 3% gel. Then use your fingers to gently smooth the gel onto each affected area. Use enough gel to cover the areas completely. When you are finished applying the gel, wash your hands again. Be careful not to touch your eyes or nose before you wash your hands.</p>
<p>Your condition may begin to improve after 30 days of treatment, but it may take up to 30 days after the end of treatment before you see complete healing of the affected area or the full benefit of diclofenac 3% gel. Continue to use diclofenac 3% gel even if your condition has begun to improve. Do not stop using the medication without talking to your doctor.</p>
