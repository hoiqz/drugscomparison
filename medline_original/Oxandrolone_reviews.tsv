<p>Medications similar to oxandrolone may have caused damage to the liver or spleen (a small organ just below the ribs) and tumors in the liver. Tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol or used street drugs and if you have or have ever had liver disease. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medications or herbal products: acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), cholesterol lowering medications (statins), comfrey tea, iron products, isoniazid (INH, Nydrazid), kava, methotrexate (Rheumatrex), niacin (nicotinic acid), or rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane). If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: upset stomach; extreme tiredness; unusual bruising or bleeding; lack of energy; loss of appetite; pain in the upper right part of the stomach; yellowing of the skin or eyes; flu-like symptoms; pale, cool, or clammy skin; extreme thirst; fast but weak pulse; vomiting; or fast shallow breathing.</p>
<p>Oxandrolone may increase the amount of low density lipoprotein (LDL; 'bad cholesterol') and decrease the amount of high density lipoprotein (HDL; 'good cholesterol') in your blood. This may increase your risk of developing heart disease. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had high cholesterol, heart disease, a heart attack, chest pain, or a stroke. Also tell your doctor if you smoke or have ever smoked and if you have high blood pressure or diabetes.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to oxandrolone. Oxandrolone may damage the liver or increase LDL without causing symptoms. It is important to have regular laboratory tests to be sure that the liver is working properly and that LDL has not increased.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking oxandrolone.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Oxandrolone is used with a diet and exercise program to cause weight gain in patients who have lost too much weight due to surgery, injury, or long lasting infections, or who are very underweight for unknown reasons. Oxandrolone is also used to treat bone pain in patients with osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) and to prevent certain side effects in patients who take corticosteroids (a group of medications used to treat many conditions that involve inflammation or swelling of part of the body for a long time. Oxandrolone is in a class of medications called anabolic steroids. It works by increasing the amount of protein made by the body. This protein is used to build more muscle and increase body weight.</p>
