<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Cefpodoxime comes as a tablet and liquid to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 12 hours (twice a day) for 7-14 days. A single dose is given to treat gonorrhea. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefpodoxime exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.</p>
<p>The tablets should be swallowed whole and taken with a full glass of water.</p>
<p>Continue to take cefpodoxime even if you feel well. Do not stop taking cefpodoxime without talking to your doctor.</p>
