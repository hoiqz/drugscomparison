<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Mometasone inhalation is used to prevent difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, and coughing caused by asthma. Mometasone inhalation is not used to treat an asthma attack (sudden episode of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) that has already started. Mometasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Mometasone inhalation comes as a powder to inhale by mouth. It is usually inhaled twice daily or once a day in the evening. Use mometasone inhalation at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use mometasone inhalation exactly as directed. Do not inhale more or less of it or inhale it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with mometasone inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone, your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least 1 week after you begin to use mometasone inhalation. Special care will be needed in certain situations for several months as your body adjusts to the change in medication. Ask your doctor for more information.</p>
<p>Mometasone inhalation helps to prevent asthma attacks but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use mometasone inhalation during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of mometasone inhalation. Your doctor may decrease your dose if your symptoms are controlled or gradually increase your dose if your symptoms have not improved after 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Mometasone inhalation controls asthma but does not cure it. It may take 1 to 2 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use mometasone inhalation even if you feel well. Do not stop using mometasone inhalation without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Call your doctor immediately if you have an asthma attack that does not stop when you use your fast-acting asthma medication, or if you need to use more of your fast-acting medication than usual.</p>
<p>Before you use your mometasone oral inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler while he or she watches.</p>
<p>The dose counter on the base of your mometasone inhaler tells you how many doses of medication are left in your inhaler. Read the numbers on the dose counter from top to bottom. The number on the dose counter decreases every time you lift the cap to load a dose of medication and will read ''01'' just before you use your last dose of medication. Do not use the inhaler if the numbers on the dose counter do not change after you load a dose. Call your pharmacist if your inhaler is not working properly.</p>
<p>Throw away the inhaler after you use the last dose or 45 days after you removed it from the package, whichever is sooner.</p>
<h3>To use the inhaler, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are using a new inhaler for the first time, remove it from the foil pouch. Write the date that you opened the inhaler in the space provided on the cap label.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the inhaler straight up with the colored base on the bottom. Twist the white cap counterclockwise and remove it. This loads the correct amount of medication in the base of the inhaler, so it is important to twist the cap and not twist the base with your hand. As you lift the cap off, the dose counter on the base will count down by one to show the number of doses left after this use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe out fully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the inhaler on its side with the mouthpiece facing you. Be sure that you are not covering the ventilation holes on the sides of the inhaler. Place the mouthpiece of the inhaler in your mouth and close your lips firmly around it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe in a fast, deep breath. You will receive your medication as a very fine powder, so you may not be able to smell, feel, or taste it as you inhale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can. Do not breathe out into the inhaler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe the mouthpiece dry. Put the cap back onto the inhaler so that the indented arrow is in line with the dose counter. Gently press down and turn clockwise until you hear a click.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rinse your mouth with water.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If your inhaler needs to be cleaned, gently wipe it with a dry cloth. Do not wash the inhaler. Keep the inhaler away from water or other liquids.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

<h3>Before using mometasone oral inhalation,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to mometasone or any other medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention ketoconazole (Nizoral). Also tell your doctor if you are taking corticosteroids or medications for seizures, or if you have taken these medications in the past. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) and if you have or have ever had tuberculosis (a type of infection) in your lungs, cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), glaucoma (an eye disease) or high pressure in the eye, or liver disease. Also tell your doctor if you have any type of untreated infection anywhere in your body or a herpes infection (a type of infection that causes a sore on the eyelid or eye surface) in your eye, or if you are on bedrest or unable to move around.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using mometasone inhalation, call your doctor.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using mometasone inhalation.</li>
<li>you should know that your body may be less able to cope with stress such as surgery, illness, severe asthma attack, or injury. Call your doctor right away if you get sick and be sure that all healthcare providers who treat you know that you are using mometasone inhalation.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have never had chickenpox or measles and you have not been vaccinated against these infections. Stay away from people who are sick, especially people who have chickenpox or measles. If you are exposed to one of these infections or if you develop symptoms of one of these infections, call your doctor right away. You may need treatment to protect you from these infections.</li>
<li>you should know that mometasone inhalation sometimes causes wheezing and difficulty breathing immediately after it is inhaled. If this happens, use your fast-acting (rescue) asthma medication right away and call your doctor. Do not use mometasone inhalation again unless your doctor tells you that you should.</li>
