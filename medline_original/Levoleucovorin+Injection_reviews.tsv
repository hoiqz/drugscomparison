<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Levoleucovorin injection is used to prevent harmful effects of methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) when methotrexate is used to to treat certain types of cancer. Levoleucovorin injection is also used to treat people who have accidentally received an overdose of methotrexate or similar medications. Levoleucovorin injection is in a class of medications called folic acid analogs. It works by protecting healthy cells from the effects of methotrexate while allowing methotrexate to enter and kill cancer cells.</p>

<h3>Before receiving levoleucovorin injection,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to levoleucovorin injection, leucovorin, folic acid (Folicet, in multi-vitamins), or any other medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: certain medications for seizures such as phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), and primidone (Mysoline); or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>your doctor may prescribe levoleucovorin along with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). If you receive this combination of medications, you will be monitored very carefully because levoleucovorin may increase both the benefits and the harmful effects of 5-fluorouracil.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have anemia (low number of red blood cells) caused by lack of vitamin B12 or inability to absorb vitamin B12. Your doctor will not prescribe levoleucovorin to treat this type of anemia.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a buildup of fluid in the chest cavity or the stomach area, or kidney disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while receiving levoleucovorin injection, call your doctor.</li>
