<p>[Posted 02/26/2013] <strong>ISSUE:</strong> FDA has stopped all pediatric clinical trials of cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar) after the recent death of a 14-year-old patient in a trial. Posting this information does not mean that FDA has concluded whether or not cinacalcet had a role in the patient's death. This communication is intended to inform health care professionals that we are evaluating the information and will communicate our final conclusions and recommendations when our review is complete.</p>
<p>
<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Cinacalcet is a calcium-sensing receptor agonist indicated in adults for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid cancer and severe hypercalcemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy. FDA has approved cinacalcet for use in adults but not in children (less than 18 years of age), and the clinical trials were underway to determine if the drug is effective and can be used safely in children.</p>
<h3> At this time, FDA would like to remind health care professionals of the following: 

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Patients should be monitored for the development of low serum calcium levels (hypocalcemia) since cinacalcet lowers calcium levels in the blood. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The potential signs of low serum calcium levels include muscular problems such as muscle cramping, tetany, convulsions, paresthesias, and myalgias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If serum calcium levels decrease below the normal range, appropriate steps should be taken to increase calcium levels, such as by providing supplemental calcium, initiating or increasing the dose of a calcium-based phosphate binder, initiating or increasing the dose of vitamin D sterols, or temporarily withholding treatment with cinacalcet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serum calcium levels should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet. Once a maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium should be measured monthly.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Cinacalcet is used alone or with other medications to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (a condition in which the body produces too much parathyroid hormone [a natural substance needed to control the amount of calcium in the blood] which can cause serious problems with the bones, heart, blood vessels, and lungs) in patients with chronic kidney disease (condition in which the kidneys stop working slowly and gradually) who are being treated with dialysis (medical treatment to clean the blood when the kidneys are not working properly). Cinacalcet is also used to treat high levels of calcium in the blood of patients who have parathyroid cancer (cancer of the glands in the neck that make parathyroid hormone). Cinacalcet is in a class of medications called calcimimetics. It works by signaling the body to produce less parathyroid hormone in order to decrease the amount of calcium in the blood. </p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Cinacalcet comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with food or shortly after a meal. To help you remember to take cinacalcet, take it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cinacalcet exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of cinacalcet and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2-4 weeks. </p>
<p>Cinacalcet may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take cinacalcet even if you feel well. Do not stop taking cinacalcet without talking to your doctor.</p>
