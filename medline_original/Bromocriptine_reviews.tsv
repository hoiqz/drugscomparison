<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat symptoms of hyperprolactinemia (high levels of a natural substance called prolactin in the body) including lack of menstrual periods, discharge from the nipples, infertility (difficulty becoming pregnant) and hypogonadism (low levels of certain natural substances needed for normal development and sexual function). Bromocriptine (Parlodel) may be used to treat hyperprolactinemia caused by certain types of tumors that produce prolactin, and may shrink these tumors. Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is also used alone or with other treatments to treat acromegaly (condition in which there is too much growth hormone in the body) and Parkinson's disease (PD; a disorder of the nervous system that causes difficulties with movement, muscle control, and balance). Bromocriptine (Cycloset) is used with a diet and exercise program and sometimes with other medications to control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Bromocriptine (Cycloset) is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated). Bromocriptine is in a class of medications called dopamine receptor agonists. It treats hyperprolactinemia by decreasing the amount of prolactin in the body. It treats acromegaly by decreasing the amount of growth hormone in the body. It treats Parkinson's disease by stimulating the nerves that control movement. The way bromocriptine works to treat diabetes is not known.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Bromocriptine (Parlodel) comes as a capsule and a tablet to take by mouth. Bromocriptine (Cycloset) comes as a tablet to take by mouth. When bromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat hyperprolactinemia, it is usually taken once a day with food. When bromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat acromegaly, it is usually taken once a day at bedtime with food. When bromocriptine (Parlodel) is used to treat Parkinson's disease, it is usually taken twice a day with food. Bromocriptine (Cycloset) is usually taken once a day with food within 2 hours of waking in the morning. Take bromocriptine at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take bromocriptine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of bromocriptine and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 to 28 days. The timing of the dose increases depends on the condition being treated and on your response to the medication.</p>
<p>Bromocriptine may help to control your condition but will not cure it. It may take some time for you to feel the full benefit of bromocriptine. Do not stop taking bromocriptine without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking bromocriptine, your condition may worsen.</p>
<p>If you are taking bromocriptine (Cycloset) for diabetes, ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
