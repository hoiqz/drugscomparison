<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Frovatriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Frovatriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain. Frovatriptan does not prevent migraine attacks.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Frovatriptan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. If your symptoms improve after you take frovatriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take frovatriptan, do not take a second tablet before calling your doctor. Do not take more than three frovatriptan tablets in any 24-hour period. Call your doctor if you need to take frovatriptan more than four times a month. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take frovatriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You may take your first dose of frovatriptan in a doctor's office or other medical facility where you can be monitored for serious reactions.</p>
<p>Before taking frovatriptan, read the manufacturer's information for patients that comes with it.</p>
