<p>Sibutramine is no longer available in the U.S. The manufacturer has decided to stop producing sibutramine based on information from a recent clinical study. In this study, people taking sibutramine had an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. If you are currently taking sibutramine, you should stop taking this medication and call your doctor to discuss switching to another treatment for weight loss or maintenance of weight loss.</p>
</div><div id=hgroup
<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Sibutramine is used in combination with a reduced calorie diet and exercise to help people who are overweight lose weight and maintain their weight loss. Sibutramine is in a class of medications called appetite suppressants. It works by acting on appetite control centers in the brain to decrease appetite.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Sibutramine comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. To help you remember to take sibutramine, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sibutramine exactly as directed. Sibutramine can be habit forming. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often or for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of sibutramine and increase your dose, after you have been taking sibutramine for at least 4 weeks. Your doctor may decrease your dose if you experience certain side effects while you are taking your starting dose.</p>
<p>You will probably lose weight soon after you begin taking sibutramine and following your diet and exercise program. Be sure to monitor your weight, and call your doctor if you do not lose at least 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms) during your first 4 weeks of therapy. Your doctor may wish to change your dose of sibutramine.</p>
<p>Sibutramine may not work for everybody. Tell your doctor how much weight you lose during your treatment with sibutramine. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking sibutramine if you do not lose a certain amount of weight during the first 3 to 6 months of your treatment.</p>
<p>You may not continue to lose weight after your first 6 months of treatment. However, you should continue to take sibutramine even if you have stopped losing weight. If you stop taking sibutramine, you may gain weight. Do not stop taking sibutramine without talking to your doctor.</p>
