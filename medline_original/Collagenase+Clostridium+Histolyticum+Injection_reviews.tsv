<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection is used to treat Dupuytren's contracture (a painless thickening and tightening of tissue [cord] beneath the skin in the palm of the hand, which may make it difficult to straighten one or more fingers) when a cord of tissue can be felt upon examination.  Collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection is in a class of medications called enzymes. It works by helping to break down the cord of thickened tissue and allows the finger(s) to be straightened.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection comes as a powder to be mixed with a liquid and injected into a cord just under the skin in the affected hand by a doctor. Your doctor will choose the best place to inject the medication into the cord.</p>
<p>Do not bend or straighten the fingers of the injected hand or put pressure on the injected area after your injection. Keep the injected hand elevated until bedtime. You must return to your doctor's office on the day after your injection. Your doctor will check your hand, and possibly move and extend the finger to help break up the cord. Ask your doctor when you can expect to see improvement, and call your doctor if your condition does not improve during the expected time.</p>
<p>Do not perform strenuous activity with the injected hand until your doctor tells you that you can do so. Your doctor will probably tell you to wear a splint every night (at bedtime) for up to 4 months after the injection. Your doctor may also tell you to do finger exercises each day. Follow the directions of your doctor carefully and ask the doctor to explain any part you do not understand.</p>
<p>Your doctor may need to give you one or two additional injections, not more often than once every 4 weeks. You may receive up to three injections per cord.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
