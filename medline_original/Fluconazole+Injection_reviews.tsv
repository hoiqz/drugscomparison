<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Fluconazole injection is used to treat fungal infections, including yeast infections of the mouth, throat, esophagus (tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), abdomen (area between the chest and waist), lungs, blood, and other organs. Fluconazole is also used to treat meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain and spine) caused by fungus. Fluconazole is also used to prevent yeast infections in patients who are likely to become infected because they are being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy before a bone marrow transplant (replacement of unhealthy spongy tissue inside the bones with healthy tissue). Fluconazole is in a class of antifungals called triazoles. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Fluconazole injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be given through a needle or catheter placed in your vein. It is usually infused (injected slowly) intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 1 to 2 hours, usually once a day for up to 14 days. The length of your treatment depends on your condition and on how well you respond to fluconazole injection. Your doctor will tell you how long to use fluconazole injection.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to use a higher dose of fluconazole injection on the first day of your treatment. Follow these directions carefully.</p>
<p>You may receive fluconazole injection in a hospital or you may use the medication at home. If you are using fluconazole injection at home, use it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or other health care provider to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluconazole injection exactly as directed. Do not infuse it more quickly than directed, and do not use more or less of it, or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you will be using fluconazole injection at home, your health care provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your health care provider if you have any questions. Ask your health care provider what to do if you have any problems infusing fluconazole injection.</p>
<p>Before you administer fluconazole, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with fluconazole injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Use fluconazole injection until your doctor tells you that you should stop, even if you feel better. If you stop using fluconazole injection too soon, your infection may come back after a short time.</p>

<h2>Other uses for this medicine</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Fluconazole injection is also sometimes used to treat serious fungal infections that begin in the lungs and can spread through the body and fungal infections of the eye, prostate (a male reproductive organ), skin and nails. Fluconazole injection is also sometimes used to prevent fungal infections in people who are likely to become infected because they have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or cancer or have had a transplant operation (surgery to remove an organ and replace it with a donor or artificial organ). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication for your condition.</p>
<p>This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
