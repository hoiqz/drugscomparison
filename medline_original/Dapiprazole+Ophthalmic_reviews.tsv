<p>Dapiprazole ophthalmic is no longer available in the U.S. If you are currently using dapiprazole ophthalmic, you should call your doctor to discuss switching to another treatment.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Dapiprazole causes the pupil of the eye to constrict. It reverses pupil dilation caused by other drugs given during an eye examination.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Dapiprazole comes as eyedrops. Usually, 2 drops are applied following an eye examination, and 2 more drops are applied 5 minutes later. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use dapiprazole exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<h3>To use the eyedrops, follow these instructions:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a mirror or have someone else put the drops in your eye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shake the container well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the protective cap. Make sure that the end of the dropper is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper tip down at all times to prevent drops from flowing back into the bottle and contaminating the remaining contents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lie down or tilt your head back or lie down and gaze upward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding the bottle between your thumb and index finger, place the dropper tip as near as possible to your eyelid without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your cheek or nose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the index finger of your other hand, pull the lower lid of the eye down to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop the prescribed number of drops into the pocket made by the lower lid and the eye. Placing drops on the surface of the eyeball can cause stinging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye and press lightly against the lower lid with your finger for 2-3 minutes to keep the medication in the eye. Do not blink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap right away. Do not wipe or rinse it off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe off any excess liquid from your cheek with a clean tissue. Wash your hands again.</p>
</li>
</ol>
