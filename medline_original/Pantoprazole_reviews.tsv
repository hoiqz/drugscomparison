<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Pantoprazole is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which backward flow of acid from the stomach causes heartburn and possible injury of the esophagus (the tube between the throat and stomach). Pantoprazole is used to treat the symptoms of GERD, allow the esophagus to heal, and prevent further damage to the esophagus. It is also used to treat conditions where the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Pantoprazole is in a class of medications called proton-pump inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Pantoprazole comes as a delayed-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth and packets of delayed-release (long-acting) granules to be mixed with applesauce or apple juice and taken by mouth or given through a feeding tube. The tablet is usually taken with or without food one or two times a day. The oral suspension is usually taken 30 minutes before a meal one or two times a day. Take pantoprazole at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take pantoprazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If your doctor has prescribed the 40 mg tablet and it is too big for you to swallow, ask your doctor to prescribe two of the 20 mg tablets instead.</p>
<p>To take the powder for oral suspension, open the packet and sprinkle the granules onto one teaspoonful of applesauce or into a cup containing one teaspoonful of apple juice. Use all of the granules in the packet; do not divide the granules into smaller doses. If you sprinkle the granules into apple juice, stir the mixture for 5 seconds. Swallow the mixture of applesauce or apple juice and medication right away without chewing or crushing the granules. If you sprinkled the granules on applesauce, take several sips of water to wash the granules down to your stomach. If you sprinkled the granules into apple juice, rinse the cup once or twice with apple juice and drink the apple juice right away to be sure you swallow any leftover granules.</p>
<p>Pantoprazole powder mixed with apple juice may be given through a feeding tube. If you have a feeding tube, ask your doctor how you should take pantoprazole.</p>
<p>Continue to take pantoprazole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking pantoprazole without talking to your doctor. If your condition does not improve or gets worse, call your doctor.</p>
