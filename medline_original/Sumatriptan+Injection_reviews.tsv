<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Sumatriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Sumatriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain and by stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain. Sumatriptan does not prevent migraine attacks.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Sumatriptan is taken by injection, just under your skin, as soon as your migraine symptoms appear. You should feel relief of your symptoms within 1 hour (maybe within 10 minutes). If your symptoms then return after the first injection, you may take a second injection after 1 hour. But do not use more than two injections in a 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sumatriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Sumatriptan comes in an autoinjection device so that you can self-inject this medication into your thigh or deltoid area (shoulder joint). Your doctor or pharmacist should show you how to load the injector and administer the medication. Also read the instruction pamphlet and be sure that you understand the correct injection technique before you use the autoinjector.</p>
<p>Try the autoinjector for the first time in your doctor's office so that he/she can be sure that you are using it correctly and can monitor any side effects.</p>
