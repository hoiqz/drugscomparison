<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Linezolid injection is used to treat infections, including pneumonia, and infections of the skin and blood. Linezolid is in a class of antibacterials called oxazolidinones. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics will not kill viruses that can cause colds, flu, or other infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Linezolid injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be infused into a vein. It is usually given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes to two hours twice a day (every 12 hours) for 10 to 28 days. Children 11 years of age and younger usually receive linezolid injection two to three times a day (every 8 to 12 hours) for 10 to 28 days.  Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use linezolid injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Linezolid infusions are usually given by a doctor or nurse. Your doctor may decide that you or a friend or relative can give the infusions. Your doctor will train the person who will be administering the medication and will test him to be sure he can give the infusion correctly. Be sure that you and the person who will be giving the infusions know the correct dose, how to give the medication, and how often to give the medication. Be sure that you and the person who will be giving the infusion read the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with this medication before you use it for the first time at home.</p>
<p>Continue to use linezolid injection even if you feel well. Do not skip doses or stop using linezolid injection without talking to your doctor. Stopping linezolid injection too soon may cause bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
