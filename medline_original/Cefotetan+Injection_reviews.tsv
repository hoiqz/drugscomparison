<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Cefotetan injection is used to treat infections of the lungs, skin, bones, joints, stomach area, blood, female reproductive organs, and urinary tract. Cefotetan injection is also used before surgery to prevent infections. Cefotetan injection is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Cefotetan injection comes as a powder to be added to fluid and injected intravenously (into a vein) or it can be injected into a large muscle (such as your buttock). It is usually given one or two times a day. You may receive cefotetan injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you are using cefotetan injection at home, use it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefotetan injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with cefotetan injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Use cefotetan injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using cefotetan injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
