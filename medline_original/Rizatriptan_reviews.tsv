<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Rizatriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Rizatriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and stopping the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Rizatriptan does not prevent migraine attacks.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Rizatriptan comes as a tablet and an orally disintegrating tablet to take by mouth. It should be taken at the first sign of a migraine headache. If you are at risk for heart disease and you have never taken rizatriptan before, you may need to take the first dose in your doctor's office. Usually only one dose is needed. If pain is not relieved with the first dose, your doctor may prescribe a second dose to be taken 2 hours after the first dose. Do not take more than 30 mg of rizatriptan in any 24-hour period. If you are also taking propranolol (Inderal), you should not take more than 15 mg of rizatriptan in any 24-hour period. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rizatriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>The orally disintegrating tablet should not be removed from the package until just before it is taken. The packet should be opened with dry hands, and the orally disintegrating tablet should be placed on the tongue, where it will dissolve and be swallowed with saliva.</p>

<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, or herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, in Symbyax), fluvoxamine, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft); and selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine (Cymbalta), sibutramine (Meridia),and venlafaxine (Effexor). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you more carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you smoke, if you have a strong family history of heart disease, if you are postmenopausal, or if you are a man over 40. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure; phenylketonuria; angina (recurring chest pain); a heart attack; diabetes; high cholesterol; obesity; stroke; transient ischemic attack (ministroke); ischemic bowel disease; coronary artery disease; seizures; or blood vessel, kidney, or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking rizatriptan, call your doctor.</li>
<li>you should know that this drug may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how rizatriptan will affect you.</li>
<li>remember that alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this drug. Do not drink alcohol while taking this medication.</li>
