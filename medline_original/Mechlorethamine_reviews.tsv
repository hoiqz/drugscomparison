<p>Mechlorethamine injection must be given under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in giving chemotherapy medications for cancer.</p>
<p>Mechlorethamine is usually administered only into a vein. However, it may leak into surrounding tissue causing severe irritation or damage. Your doctor or nurse will monitor your administration site for this reaction. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: pain, itching, redness, swelling, blisters, or sores in the place where the medication was injected.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Mechlorethamine is used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma (Hodgkin's disease) and certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (types of cancer that begin in a type of white blood cells that normally fights infection); mycosis fungoides (a type of cancer of the immune system that first appear as skin rashes); certain types of leukemia (cancer of the white blood cells), including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); and lung cancer. Mechlorethamine is also used to treat polycythemia vera (a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow). It is also used to treat malignant effusions (a condition when fluid collects in the lungs or around the heart) that are caused by cancerous tumors. Mechlorethamine is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Mechlorethamine comes as powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility. It may also be injected intraperitoneally (into the abdominal cavity), intrapleurally (into the chest cavity), or intrapericardially (into the lining of the heart). The length of treatment depends on the types of drugs you are taking, how well your body responds to them, and the type of cancer or condition you have.</p>
