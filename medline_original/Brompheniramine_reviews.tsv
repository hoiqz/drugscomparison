<strong>FDA Intends to Remove <em>Some</em> Unapproved Cough, Cold, and Allergy Drugs from the Market</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>This safety alert does not apply to this medication, but only to some products which contain this medication. In addition, it is important that you know that there is not a problem with most of the products described in this medication monograph. And some drug companies may decide to seek full approval from the FDA so that they can continue marketing their products.</em>
</p>
<p>On March 2, 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety alert about certain unapproved prescription cough, cold, and allergy products containing this drug in combination with other drugs. These products are not currently approved by the FDA for safety, effectiveness, and quality. FDA asked drug companies to stop shipping most of these products for sale in the US within the next 6 months. Although some of these products have been marketed for many years, laws about what a company must prove to FDA for drug product approval have gotten tougher and increased enforcement of these laws is now taking place. The FDA took this action due to concerns about certain potential risks associated with use of these medications. These risks may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the possibility of improper use in infants and young children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>potentially risky combinations of ingredients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>patients receiving too much or too little of the medication because of problems with the way some ''timed-release'' products are made</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are concerned that the prescription cough, cold, and allergy medication you are taking is not approved by the FDA, you should talk to your doctor or pharmacist. If the medication you are taking is not approved, your doctor can prescribe another prescription medication or your doctor or pharmacist can suggest an over-the-counter (OTC) cough, cold, and allergy product for your condition. There are many safe and effective alternative approved products that can be taken instead. Your doctor probably prescribed the medicine without knowing that FDA had not approved it. This is because it has been so difficult for doctors and pharmacists to find out that these products are unapproved. For additional information:</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Brompheniramine relieves red, irritated, itchy, watery eyes; sneezing; and runny nose caused by allergies, hay fever, and the common cold. Brompheniramine helps control symptoms, but does not treat the cause of the symptoms or speed recovery. Brompheniramine should not be used to cause sleepiness in children. Brompheniramine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Brompheniramine comes in combination with other cough and cold medications as a chewable tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) capsule, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and a liquid to be taken by mouth. The chewable tablet and liquid are usually taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed. The extended-release tablets and capsules are usually taken every 8 or 12 hours as needed. Follow the directions on the package label or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take brompheniramine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Brompheniramine comes in combination with other cough and cold medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for your symptoms. Check nonprescription cough and cold product labels carefully before taking two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child.</p>
<p>Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain brompheniramine, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 6 years of age. If you give these products to children 6-11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully.</p>
<p>If you are giving a product that contains brompheniramine to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give brompheniramine products that are made for adults to children.</p>
<p>Before you give a brompheniramine product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child.</p>
<p>If you are taking the liquid, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made especially for measuring medication.</p>
<p>If you are taking the extended-release tablets or capsules swallow them whole; do not crush, break, or chew them.</p>
<p>Stop taking brompheniramine and call your doctor if your symptoms last longer than 7 days or if you have a fever.</p>
