<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Memantine is used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Memantine is in a class of medications called NMDA receptor antagonists. It works by decreasing abnormal activity in the brain. Memantine can help people with Alzheimer's disease to think more clearly and perform daily activities more easily, but it is not a cure and does not stop the progression of the disease.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Memantine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. To help you remember to take memantine, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Take memantine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of memantine and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week.</p>
<p>Memantine controls Alzheimer's disease but does not cure it. Continue to take memantine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking memantine without talking to your doctor.</p>
