<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Zafirlukast comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken two times a day, 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. Try to take zafirlukast at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take zafirlukast exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not use zafirlukast to treat a sudden attack of asthma symptoms. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during attacks. Talk to your doctor about how to treat symptoms of a sudden asthma attack.</p>
<p>Continue to take or use all other medications that your doctor has prescribed to treat your asthma. Do not stop taking any of your medications or change the doses of any of your medications unless your doctor tells you that you should.</p>
<p>Zafirlukast may help control asthma symptoms, but it does not cure asthma. Continue to take zafirlukast even if you feel well. Do not stop taking zafirlukast without talking to your doctor.</p>
