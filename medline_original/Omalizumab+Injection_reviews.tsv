<p>[07/16/2009] FDA is evaluating interim safety findings from an ongoing study of omalizumab (Xolair) titled Evaluating the Clinical Effectiveness and Long-Term Safety in Patients with Moderate to Severe Asthma (EXCELS) that suggests a disproportionate increase in ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension, cerebrovascular disorders, and embolic, thrombotic and thrombophlebitic events in patients treated with omalizumab compared to the control group of patients not given the drug. Omalizumab is approved for use by adults and adolescents (12 years of age and above) with moderate to severe persistent asthma who test positive for reactivity to a perennial airborne allergen, and whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids.</p>
<p>FDA is not recommending any changes to the prescribing information for omalizumab and is not advising patients to stop taking omalizumab at this time. Until the evaluation of the EXCELS study is completed, healthcare providers and patients should be aware of the risks and benefits described in the prescribing information, as well as the new information from the ongoing EXCELS study that may suggest a risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Omalizumab injection is used to decrease the number of asthma attacks (sudden episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, and trouble breathing) in people with allergic asthma (asthma caused by inhaling substances such as dander, pollen, and dust mites) whose symptoms are not controlled with inhaled steroids. Omalizumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by blocking the action of IgE, a natural substance in the body that causes the symptoms of allergic asthma.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Omalizumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected in a doctor's office once every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks. You may receive one or more injections at each visit, depending on the dose prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>It may take some time before you feel the full benefit of omalizumab. Call your doctor if your asthma symptoms worsen. Talk to your doctor so that you know what to do if you have an asthma attack or breathing problems while using omalizumab. Omalizumab will not relieve the symptoms of a sudden asthma attack.</p>
<p>Omalizumab injection may be used along with other medications for asthma. Do not decrease your dose of any other asthma medication or stop taking any other asthma medication that has been prescribed by your doctor, unless your doctor tells you to do so. Your doctor may want to decrease your dose of some other asthma medications gradually.</p>

<h2>What special precautions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before using omalizumab injection,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to any medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have any other medical conditions and if you are being treated with allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots; a series of injections given regularly to prevent the body from developing allergic reactions to specific substances).</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using omalizumab, call your doctor.</li>
<li>talk to your doctor about whether there is a risk that you will develop a hookworm, roundworm, whipworm, or threadworm infection (infection with worms that live inside the body). If you are at high risk of developing this type of infection, using omalizumab may increase the chance that you will actually become infected. Most of these infections are rare in the United States, but if you are at risk of developing an infection, your doctor can suggest ways to prevent infection and will monitor you carefully during your treatment.</li>
