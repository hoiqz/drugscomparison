<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>When used in combination with insulin or other medications used to treat diabetes, acarbose may cause excessive lowering of blood sugar levels.</h3>
<h3>If you have any of these symptoms, glucose products (Insta-Glucose or B-D Glucose tablets) should be used and you should call your doctor. Because acarbose blocks the breakdown of table sugar and other complex sugars, fruit juice or other products containing these sugars will not help to increase blood sugar. It is important that you and other members of your household understand this difference between acarbose and other medications used to treat diabetes.
