<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Clorazepate is used to relieve anxiety. Clorazepate is also used along with other medications to treat certain types of seizures. It is also used to relieve unpleasant symptoms that may be experienced by people who have stopped drinking alcohol after drinking large amounts for a long time. Clorazepate is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Clorazepate comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken one to three times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take clorazepate exactly as directed.</p>
<p>If you are taking clorazepate to treat anxiety or seizures, your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of clorazepate and gradually increase your dose. If you are taking clorazepate to treat alcohol withdrawal, your doctor will probably start you on a high dose of clorazepate and gradually decrease your dose as your symptoms are controlled.</p>
<p>Clorazepate can be habit-forming. Take clorazepate exactly as directed. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Clorazepate may help to control seizures and anxiety, but it will not cure these conditions. Continue to take clorazepate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking clorazepate without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking clorazepate, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as nervousness, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, irritability, diarrhea, muscle aches, memory problems, seizures, confusion, uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, stomach cramps, muscle cramps, vomiting, or sweating.</p>

<li>you should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.</li>
<li>talk to your doctor about the safe use of alcohol during your treatment with clorazepate. Alcohol can make the side effects of this medication worse.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you use tobacco products. Cigarette smoking may decrease the effectiveness of this medication.</li>
<li>you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways, and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking clorazepate for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as clorazepate to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as clorazepate, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood), talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life, withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying, giving away prized possessions, or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.</li>
