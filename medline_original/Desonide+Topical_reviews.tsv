<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Desonide comes as a cream, an ointment, and a lotion to apply to the skin. It is usually applied 2 or 3 times a day. Apply it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use desonide exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply it to other areas of your body or use it to treat other skin conditions unless directed to do so by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your skin condition should improve during the first 2 weeks of your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during this time.</p>
<p>Shake the lotion well before each use to mix the medication evenly.</p>
<p>This medication is only for use on the skin. Do not let desonide get into your eyes, nose, or mouth and do not swallow it.</p>
<p>To use desonide, apply a small amount of ointment, cream, or lotion to cover the affected area of the skin with a thin even film and rub it in gently.</p>
<p>If you are applying desonide to a child's diaper area, do not cover the area with tight fitting diapers or plastic pants.</p>
<h3>Do not wrap or bandage the treated area unless your doctor tells you that you should. If your doctor tells you to wrap or bandage the treated area, follow these instructions:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Soak the area in water or wash it well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the skin is moist, gently rub the medication into the affected areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover the area with plastic wrap (such as Saran Wrap<sup>®</sup> or Handi-Wrap<sup>®</sup>). The plastic may be held in place with a gauze or elastic bandage or adhesive tape on the normal skin beside the treated area. (Instead of using plastic wrap, plastic gloves may be used for the hands, plastic bags for the feet, or a shower cap for the scalp.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carefully seal the edges of the plastic to make sure the wrap adheres closely to the skin. If the affected area is moist, you can leave the edges of the plastic wrap partly unsealed or puncture the wrap to allow excess moisture to escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the plastic wrap in place as long as directed by your doctor. Usually plastic wraps are left in place no more than 12 hours each day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleanse the skin and reapply the medication each time a new plastic wrapping is applied. Do not discontinue treatment abruptly without talking to your doctor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
