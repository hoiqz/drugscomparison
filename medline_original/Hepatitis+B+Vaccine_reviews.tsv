<h2>What is hepatitis B?</h2>

<p>Hepatitis B is a serious infection that affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>In 2009, about 38,000 people became infected with hepatitis B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each year about 2,000 to 4,000 people die in the United States from cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by hepatitis B.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Hepatitis B can cause:</p>
<p>
<strong>Acute (short-term) illness:</strong>
</p>
<p>This can lead to:

</p><ul>
<li>
<p>loss of appetite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tiredness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pain in muscles, joints, and stomach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>diarrhea and vomiting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Chronic (long-term) infection:</strong>
</p>
<p>Some people go on to develop chronic hepatitis B infection. Most of them do not have symptoms, but the infection is still very serious, and can lead to:

</p><ul>
<li>
<p>liver damage (cirrhosis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>liver cancer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>death</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Chronic infection is more common among infants and children than among adults. People who are chronically infected can spread hepatitis B virus to others, even if they don't look or feel sick. Up to 1.4 million people in the United States may have chronic hepatitis B infection.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B virus is easily spread through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. People can also be infected from contact with a contaminated object, where the virus can live for up to 7 days.</p>
<p>A baby whose mother is infected can be infected at birth; children, adolescents, and adults can become infected by:

</p><ul>
<li>
<p>contact with blood and body fluids through breaks in the skin such as bites, cuts, or sores</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contact with objects that have blood or body fluids on them such as toothbrushes, razors, or monitoring and treatment devices for diabetes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>having unprotected sex with an infected person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sharing needles when injecting drugs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being stuck with a used needle.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hepatitis B vaccine: Why get vaccinated?</h2>

<p>Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, and the serious consequences of hepatitis B infection, including liver cancer and cirrhosis.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B vaccine may be given by itself or in the same shot with other vaccines.</p>
<p>Routine hepatitis B vaccination was recommended for some U.S. adults and children beginning in 1982, and for all children in 1991. Since 1990, new hepatitis B infections among children and adolescents have dropped by more than 95%, and by 75% in other age groups.</p>
<p>Vaccination gives long-term protection from hepatitis B infection, possibly lifelong.</p>

<h2>Who should get hepatitis B vaccine and when?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>
<strong>Children and Adolescents:</strong>
</p>
<p>Babies normally get 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine:

</p><ul>
<li>
<p>1st Dose: Birth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2nd Dose: 1 to 2 months of age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3rd Dose: 6 to 18 months of age</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some babies might get 4 doses, for example, if a combination vaccine containing hepatitis B is used. (This is a single shot containing several vaccines.) The extra dose is not harmful.</p>
<p>Anyone through 18 years of age who didn't get the vaccine when they were younger should also be vaccinated.</p>
<p>
<strong>Adults:</strong>
</p>
<p>All unvaccinated adults at risk for hepatitis B infection should be vaccinated. This includes:

</p><ul>
<li>
<p>sex partners of people infected with hepatitis B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>men who have sex with men</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people who inject street drugs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people with more than one sex partner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people with chronic liver or kidney disease</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people under 60 years of age with diabetes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people with jobs that expose them to human blood or other body fluids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>household contacts of people infected with hepatitis B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>residents and staff in institutions for the developmentally disabled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kidney dialysis patients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people who travel to countries where hepatitis B is common</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people with HIV infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other people may be encouraged by their doctor to get hepatitis B vaccine; for example, adults 60 and older with diabetes. Anyone else who wants to be protected from hepatitis B infection may get the vaccine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pregnant women who are at risk for one of the reasons stated above should be vaccinated. Other pregnant women who want protection may be vaccinated.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Adults getting hepatitis B vaccine should get 3 doses, with the second dose given 4 weeks after the first and the third dose 5 months after the second. Your doctor can tell you about other dosing schedules that might be used in certain circumstances.</p>

<h2>Who should not get hepatitis B vaccine?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to yeast, or to any other component of the vaccine, should not get hepatitis B vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine should not get another dose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Your doctor can give you more information about these precautions.</p>
<p>Note: You might be asked to wait 28 days before donating blood after getting hepatitis B vaccine. This is because the screening test could mistake vaccine in the bloodstream (which is not infectious) for hepatitis B infection.</p>

<h2>What are the risks from hepatitis B vaccine?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine. Most people do not have any problems with it.</p>
<p>The vaccine contains non-infectious material, and cannot cause hepatitis B infection.</p>
<p>Some mild problems have been reported:

</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Soreness where the shot was given (up to about 1 person in 4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temperature of 99.9 °F (37.7 °C) or higher (up to about 1 person in 15).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Severe problems are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses.</p>
<p>A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. More than 100 million people in the United States have been vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine.</p>

<h2>What if there is a moderate or severe reaction?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>
<strong>What should I look for?</strong>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or unusual behavior. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>What should I do?</strong>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS web site at <a href="http://www.vaers.hhs.gov">http://www.vaers.hhs.gov</a>, or by calling 
<phone-num>1-800-822-7967</phone-num>.</p>
