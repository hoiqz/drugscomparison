<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Butorphanol injection is used to relieve moderate to severe pain. Butorphanol injection is also used to relieve pain during labor and to prevent pain and decrease awareness before or during surgery. Butorphanol is in a class of medications called opioid agonist-antagonists. It works by changing the way the body senses pain.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Butorphanol injection comes as a liquid to be injected into a muscle or vein. When butorphanol injection is used to relieve pain, it is usually given once every 3 to 4 hours as needed. When butorphanol injection is used to relieve pain during surgery, it may be given 60 to 90 minutes before surgery and then as needed during the surgery. When butorphanol injection is used to relieve pain during labor, it may be given once every 4 hours, but should not be given less than 4 hours before delivery is expected.</p>
<p>You may receive butorphanol injection in a hospital, or you may be given the medication to use at home. If you have been told to administer butorphanol injection at home, it is very important that you use the medication exactly as directed. Follow the directions that you are given carefully, and ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions or do not understand the directions.</p>
<p>Butorphanol injection may be habit-forming. Do not use a larger dose, use it more often, or use it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. Call your doctor if you develop a strong desire to use more medication than prescribed or if butorphanol injection no longer controls your pain.</p>
<p>If you have been told to use butorphanol injection at home, do not stop using the medication without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using butorphanol injection, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, shakiness, diarrhea, chills, sweats, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, confusion, loss of coordination, or hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist). Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.</p>

<h3>Before using butorphanol injection,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to butorphanol, any other medications, or benzethonium chloride (a preservative found in some medications and personal care products).</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: antidepressants; antihistamines; barbiturates such as amobarbital (Amytal, in Tuinal), butabarbital (Butisol), pentobarbital, phenobarbital, or secobarbital (Seconal); erythromycin (E.E.S., E-Mycin, Erythrocin); medications for anxiety, mental illness, or seizures; monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors including isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), and tranylcypromine (Parnate); sedatives; sleeping pills; theophylline (Theochron, Theolair); and tranquilizers. Also tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking narcotic medications for pain or if you have recently taken these medications. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you use or have ever used street drugs or have overused prescription medications or if you need to take narcotic pain medications regularly in order to feel well. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a head injury; any condition that increases the pressure in your brain or skull; problems with your brain or nervous system; a heart attack; breathing problems; high blood pressure; or heart, kidney, or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using butorphanol injection, call your doctor.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using butorphanol injection.</li>
<li>you should know that butorphanol injection may make you drowsy and dizzy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery for at least one hour after you receive a dose. After one hour has passed, do not drive until you are certain that you are not dizzy, drowsy, or less alert than usual.</li>
<li>do not drink alcoholic beverages while you are receiving butorphanol injection. Alcohol can make the side effects from butorphanol injection worse.</li>
