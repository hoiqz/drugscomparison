<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Estramustine comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with water 3 to 4 times a day at least one hour before or two hours after meals. Do not take estramustine with milk, milk products, or foods that contain large amounts of calcium. Take estramustine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take estramustine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Estramustine may control the spread of your cancer but does not cure it. It may take up to 3 months before your doctor can tell if this medication is helpful for your condition. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with estramustine. Continue to take estramustine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking estramustine without talking to your doctor.</p>
