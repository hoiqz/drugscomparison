<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Enzalutamide is used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body in men who have not been helped by other medical and surgical treatments including docetaxel (Docefrez, Taxotere). Enzalutamide is in a class of medications called androgen receptor inhibitors. It works by blocking the effects of androgen (a male reproductive hormone) to stop the growth and spread of cancer cells.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Enzalutamide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. Take enzalutamide at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take enzalutamide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole; do not chew, dissolve, or open them.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to stop taking enzalutamide for a short time or decrease your dose if you experience serious side effects during your treatment. Be sure to talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with enzalutamide.</p>
<p>If your doctor has prescribed another medication such as degarelix (Firmagon), goserelin (Zoladex), histrelin (Supprelin LA, Vantas), leuprolide (Eligard, Lupron), or triptorelin (Trelstar) to treat your prostate cancer, you will need to continue receiving this medication during your treatment with enzalutamide.</p>
<p>Continue to take enzalutamide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking enzalutamide without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
