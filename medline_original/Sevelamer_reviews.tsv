<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Sevelamer is used to treat high blood levels of phosphorus in patients with kidney disease who are on dialysis. It binds phosphorus that you get from foods in your diet and prevents it from being absorbed into your blood stream.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Sevelamer comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day with meals. Swallow the capsules whole. Do not chew or take the capsule apart before you swallow it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sevelamer exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Sevelamer controls high blood levels of phosphorus which is a common problem in patients with kidney disease, but it does not cure the disease. Continue to take sevelamer even if you feel well. Do not stop taking sevelamer without talking to your doctor.</p>
