<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Riluzole is used to slow the progress of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease). The drug also may delay the need for a tracheostomy (breathing tube), but it is not a cure for ALS.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Riluzole comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken twice a day, every 12 hours. You should take it at the same time each day (usually in the morning and in the evening). Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take riluzole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Riluzole slows progression of ALS but does not cure it. Continue to take riluzole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking riluzole without talking to your doctor.</p>
