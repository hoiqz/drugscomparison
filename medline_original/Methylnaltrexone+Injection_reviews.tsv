<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Methylnaltrexone injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected once every other day as needed, but it can be used up to once every 24 hours if needed. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use methylnaltrexone injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Methylnaltrexone is to be used by people who are taking opioid (narcotic) medications. If you stop taking opioid medications, talk to your doctor about whether you should stop using methylnaltrexone.</p>
<p>You can inject methylnaltrexone injection yourself or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions that describe how to prepare and inject a dose of methylnaltrexone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to prepare or inject this medication.</p>
<p>Methylnaltrexone injection comes in vials to use with disposable syringes. Your medication may come on a tray with a syringe, or you may need to buy syringes separately. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of syringes to use. Use vials and disposable syringes only once. Throw away the vial and syringe after one use, even if they are not empty. Throw away used syringes and vials in a puncture-resistant container, out of the reach of children. Do not throw a filled container into the household trash or recycling. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to throw away the puncture-resistant container. There may be special state and local laws for throwing away used needles and syringes.</p>
<p>You can inject methylnaltrexone under the skin on your stomach or thighs. If someone else will be injecting the medication for you, that person can also inject it into your upper arm. Choose a new spot each time you use methylnaltrexone injection. Do not inject methylnaltrexone into a spot that is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Also, do not inject into areas with scars or stretch marks.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
