<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Nisoldipine comes as an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. The tablet should be swallowed whole. Do not chew, divide, or crush the tablet. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take nisoldipine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Nisoldipine controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take nisoldipine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking nisoldipine without talking to your doctor.</p>
