<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Fentanyl nasal spray should only be prescribed by doctors who are experienced in treating pain in cancer patients. It should be used only to treat breakthrough cancer pain (sudden episodes of pain that occur despite around-the-clock treatment with pain medication) in cancer patients at least 18 years of age who are taking regularly scheduled doses of another narcotic (opiate) pain medication, and who are tolerant (used to the effects of the medication) to narcotic pain medications. This medication should not be used to treat pain other than chronic cancer pain, especially short-term pain such as migraines or other headaches, pain from an injury, or pain after a medical or dental procedure. Fentanyl nasal spray may cause serious breathing problems or death if it is used by people who are not being treated with other narcotic medications or who are not tolerant to narcotic medications.</p>
<p>Fentanyl nasal spray may cause serious harm or death if used accidentally by a child or by an adult who has not been prescribed the medication. Partially used fentanyl nasal spray bottles contain enough medication to cause serious harm or death to children or other adults. Always keep fentanyl nasal spray in its child-resistant container and out of the reach of children. If fentanyl nasal spray is used by a child or an adult who has not been prescribed the medication, get emergency medical help.</p>
<p>Fentanyl nasal spray should be used along with your other pain medication(s). If you stop taking your other pain medication(s) you will need to stop using fentanyl nasal spray.</p>
<p>You must wait at least 2 hours after using fentanyl nasal spray before using another dose, even if you still have pain.Tell your doctor if you still have pain 30 minutes after using fentanyl nasal spray.</p>
<p>Taking certain medications during your treatment with fentanyl nasal spray may increase the risk that you will develop serious or life-threatening breathing problems. Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medications: amiodarone (Cordarone); certain antibiotics such as clarithromycin (Biaxin, in PrevPac), erythromycin (Erythocin), and telithromycin (Ketek); certain antifungals such as fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Sporanox), and ketoconazole (Nizoral); aprepitant (Emend); cimetidine (Tagamet); diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac, others); certain medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) such as amprenavir (Agenerase), fosamprenavir (Lexiva), indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra), and saquinavir (Invirase); nefazodone; or verapamil (Calan, Covera, Verelan). Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully.</p>
<p>Fentanyl comes as several different products. The medication in each product is absorbed differently by the body, so one product cannot be substituted for any other fentanyl product. If you are switching from one product to another, your doctor will prescribe a dose that is best for you.</p>
<p>A program has been set up to decrease the risk of using fentanyl nasal spray. Your doctor will need to enroll in the program in order to prescribe fentanyl nasal spray and you will need to have your prescription filled at a pharmacy that is enrolled in the program. As part of the program, your doctor will talk with you about the risks and benefits of using fentanyl nasal spray and about how to safely use, store, and dispose of the medication. After you talk with your doctor, you will sign a form acknowledging that you understand the risks of using fentanyl nasal spray and that you will follow your doctor's instructions to use the medication safely. Your doctor will give you more information about the program and how to get your medication and will answer any questions you have about the program and your treatment with fentanyl nasal spray.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with fentanyl nasal spray and each time you get more medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this medication.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Fentanyl nasal spray is used to treat breakthrough pain (sudden episodes of pain that occur despite round the clock treatment with pain medication) in cancer patients 18 years of age or older who are taking regularly scheduled doses of another narcotic (opiate) pain medication, and who are tolerant (used to the effects of the medication) to narcotic pain medications. Fentanyl is in a class of medications called narcotic (opiate) analgesics. It works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain.</p>
<a name="how">
    </a>
</div>
<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Fentanyl nasal spray comes as a solution (liquid) to spray in the nose. It is used as needed to treat breakthrough pain, but not more often than four times per day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.</p>
<p>Your doctor will start you on a low dose of fentanyl nasal spray and gradually increase your dose until you find the dose that will relieve your breakthrough pain. Talk to your doctor about how well the medication is working and whether you are experiencing any side effects so that your doctor can decide whether your dose should be adjusted. If you still have pain 30 minutes after using fentanyl nasal spray, your doctor may tell you to use another pain medication to relieve that pain, and may increase your dose of fentanyl nasal spray to treat your next episode of pain. Do not increase your dose of fentanyl nasal spray unless your doctor tells you that you should.</p>
<p>Do not use fentanyl nasal spray more than four times a day. Call your doctor if you experience more than four episodes of breakthrough pain per day. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of your other pain medication(s) to better control your pain.</p>
<p>Fentanyl nasal spray may be habit forming. Use fentanyl nasal spray exactly as directed. Do not use a larger dose, use it more often, or use it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not stop using fentanyl nasal spray without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using fentanyl nasal spray, you may experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<h3>To use fentanyl nasal spray, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Blow your nose, if you have a runny nose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the cap from the child-resistant container and take the bottle of fentanyl nasal spray out. Remove the protective cap from the bottle tip. Hold the bottle so that the nozzle is between your first and second fingers and your thumb is on the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using a new bottle, you must prime the bottle before use. Prime the bottle by spraying 4 sprays into the pouch following the manufacturer's instructions in the Medication Guide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sit upright and insert the tip of the bottle approximately 1/2 inch (1 cm) into one nostril, pointing the tip toward the bridge of your nose. Close your other nostril with your finger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press down firmly on the finger grips until you hear a ''click'' sound. You may not feel the spray go into your nose, but as long as the number in the counting window increases by one, the spray has been given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe in gently through your nose and out through your mouth one time after spraying. Do not sniff after spraying the medication into your nose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your doctor wants you to use two sprays, repeat steps 4 through 6, using your other nostril.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the number in the counting window is an ''8'', do not try to use any more sprays from the bottle. There will still be some liquid in the bottle that will need to be sprayed in the pouch following the manufacturer's instructions in the Medication Guide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay sitting down for at least 1 minute after using fentanyl nasal spray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not blow your nose for at least 30 minutes after using fentanyl nasal spray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the protective cap on the bottle and put the bottle back in the child-resistant container, out of reach of children.</p>
</li>
