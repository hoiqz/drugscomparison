Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had heart disease, a heart attack, or a stroke; if you smoke; and if you have or have ever had high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes.  Get emergency medical help right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness in one part or side of your body, or slurred speech.</p>

The risk may be higher for people who use NSAIDs for a long time, are older in age, have poor health, smoke, or drink alcohol while using topical diclofenac.

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Diclofenac 1% topical gel is used to relieve pain from osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by a breakdown of the lining of the joints) in certain joints such as those of the knees, ankles, feet, elbows, wrists, and hands. Diclofenac 1% topical liquid is used to relieve osteoarthritis pain in the knees. Diclofenac is in a class of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It works by stopping the body's production of a substance that causes pain.</p>
<p>Diclofenac is also available as a 3% gel (Solaraze) that is applied to the skin to treat actinic keratosis (flat, scaly growths on the skin caused by too much sun exposure). This monograph only gives information about diclofenac 1% gel and liquid. If you are using the 3% product, read the monograph entitled Diclofenac 3% Topical (actinic keratosis) that has been written about this product.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>After you apply diclofenac 1% gel or liquid, you should not cover the treated area with any type of dressing or bandage and you should not apply heat to the area. You should not shower or bathe for at least 30 minutes after you apply the liquid and for at least 1 hour after you apply the gel.

<li>
<p>Place one of the dosing cards from the package on a flat surface so that you can read the print. If the print is backward, flip the dosing card over.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Clean and dry the skin area where you will apply the medication.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Use your hand to evenly spread the liquid around the front, back, and sides of the knee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat this step until 40 drops of liquid have been applied and the knee is completely covered with the liquid. </p>
</li>
