<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Dabigatran is used to help prevent strokes or serious blood clots in people who have  atrial fibrillation (a condition in which the heart beats irregularly, increasing the chance of clots forming in the body, and possibly causing strokes) without heart valve disease. Dabigatran is in a class of anticoagulant (''blood thinner'') medications called direct thrombin inhibitors. It works by preventing blood clots from forming in the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Dabigatran comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day. Take dabigatran at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dabigatran exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not open the capsules and sprinkle the contents on food or into drinks.</p>
<p>Dabigatran will help prevent strokes and blood clots only as long as you continue to take it. Continue to take dabigatran even if you feel well. Make sure to refill your prescription before you run out of medication so that you will not miss doses of dabigatran. Do not stop taking dabigatran without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking dabigatran, the risk that you will have a stroke may increase.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with dabigatran and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
