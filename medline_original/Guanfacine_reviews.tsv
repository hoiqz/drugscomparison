<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Guanfacine tablets (Tenex brand only) are used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Guanfacine extended-release (long-acting) tablets (Intuniv brand only) are used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in children. Guanfacine is in a class of medications called centrally acting alpha<sub>2A</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonists. Guanfacine treats high blood pressure by decreasing heart rate and relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body. Guanfacine extended-release tablets may treat ADHD by affecting the part of the brain that controls attention and impulsivity.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Guanfacine comes as a tablet and as an extended-release tablet to take by mouth. The tablet is usually taken once a day at bedtime. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day and should not be taken with a high fat meal. Take guanfacine at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take guanfacine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the extended-release tablets whole with a small amount of water or another liquid; do not break, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of guanfacine and may gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week if you are taking the extended-release tablets, and not more often than once every 3-4 weeks if you are taking the tablets.</p>
<p>Guanfacine may control your condition, but will not cure it. It may take 2 weeks before you feel the full benefit of guanfacine extended-release tablets. Continue to take guanfacine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking guanfacine without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking guanfacine, your blood pressure may increase and you may become nervous or anxious. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.</p>
