<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ranibizumab is used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD; an ongoing disease of the eye that causes loss of the ability to see straight ahead and may make it more difficult to read, drive, or perform other daily activities). Ranibizumab is in a class of medications called vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) antagonists. It works by stopping abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage in the eye(s) that may cause vision loss in people with wet AMD.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ranibizumab comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into the eye by a doctor. It is usually given in a doctor's office every month. Your doctor may give you injections on a different schedule if that is best for you.</p>
<p>Before you receive a ranibizumab injection, your doctor will clean your eye to prevent infection and numb your eye to reduce discomfort during the injection. You may feel pressure in your eye when the medication is injected. After your injection, your doctor will need to examine your eyes before you leave the office.</p>
<p>Ranibizumab controls wet AMD, but does not cure it. Your doctor will watch you carefully to see how well ranibizumab works for you. Talk to your doctor about how long you should continue treatment with ranibizumab.</p>

<h3>Before receiving ranibizumab injection,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ranibizumab or any other medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention if you have received verteporfin (Visudyne) recently.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had glaucoma (an eye disease) or an infection in or around your eyes.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking ranibizumab, call your doctor.</li>
<li>your doctor may prescribe antibiotic eye drops for you to use for a few days after you receive each injection. Talk to your doctor about how to use these eye drops.</li>
<li>ask your doctor if there are any activities you should avoid during your treatment with ranibizumab injection.</li>
<li>you should know that your eyes will be dilated (treated with eye drops that widen the pupils) before you receive each ranibizumab injection. This may make your eyes sensitive to bright light and may make it difficult for you to drive. Bring a hat or sunglasses to your appointment and plan to have someone drive you home after your treatment.</li>
<li>talk to your doctor about testing your vision at home during your treatment. Check your vision in both eyes as directed by your doctor, and call your doctor if there are any changes in your vision.</li>
