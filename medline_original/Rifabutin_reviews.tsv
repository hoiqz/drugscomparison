<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Rifabutin comes as a capsule to take by mouth. Rifabutin usually is taken once or twice a day. Take it on an empty stomach, 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. If you have difficulty swallowing the capsule, you may empty its contents into applesauce. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rifabutin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
