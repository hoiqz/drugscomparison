<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Bosutinib is used to treat a certain type of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; a type of cancer of the white blood cells), including treatment in people who can no longer benefit from other medications for CML or who cannot take these medications because of side effects. Bosutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop the spread of cancer cells.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Bosutinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food once a day. Take bosutinib at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take bosutinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If any of the tablets are broken or crushed, do not touch them with your bare hands.</p>
<p>Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose of bosutinib during your treatment. This depends on how well the medication works for you and on the side effects that you experience. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment. Continue to take bosutinib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking bosutinib without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
