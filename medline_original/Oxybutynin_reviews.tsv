<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Oxybutynin is used to control urgent, frequent, or uncontrolled urination in people who have overactive bladder (a condition in which the bladder muscles have uncontrollable spasms), spina bifida (a disability that occurs when the spinal cord does not close properly before birth), or other conditions that affect the bladder muscles. Oxybutynin is in a class of medications called anticholinergics. It works by relaxing the bladder muscles to prevent urgent, frequent, or uncontrolled urination.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Oxybutynin comes as a tablet, a syrup, and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The tablets and syrup are usually taken two to four times a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take oxybutynin at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take oxybutynin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the extended-release tablets whole with plenty of water or other liquid. Do not split, chew, or crush the extended-release tablets. Tell your doctor if you cannot swallow tablets.</p>
<p>Use a dose-measuring spoon or cup to measure the correct amount of liquid for each dose, not a household spoon.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of oxybutynin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week.</p>
<p>Oxybutynin may control your symptoms, but will not cure your condition. Continue to take oxybutynin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking oxybutynin without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>You may notice some improvement in your symptoms within the first two weeks of your treatment. However, it may take six to eight weeks to experience the full benefit of oxybutynin. Talk to your doctor if your symptoms do not improve at all within eight weeks.</p>
