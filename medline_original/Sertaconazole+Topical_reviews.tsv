<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Sertaconazole comes as a cream to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice a day for 4 weeks. Use sertaconazole cream at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use sertaconazole exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your symptoms should improve in the first two weeks of your treatment. Continue to use sertaconazole cream even if your condition improves. If you stop using sertaconazole cream too soon, your infection may not be completely cured and your symptoms may return. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Sertaconazole cream is only for use on the skin. Keep sertaconazole cream away from your eyes, nostils, mouth, lips, vagina, and rectal area and do not swallow the medication.</p>
<p>If you clean the affected area, allow it to dry, and then gently rub the cream into the skin. Wash your hands with soap and water after applying sertaconazole cream. Do not use any bandages, dressings, or wraps unless directed to do so by your doctor.</p>
