<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ophthalmic epinastine is used to prevent itching of the eyes caused by allergic conjunctivitis (a condition in which the eyes become itchy, swollen, red, and teary when they are exposed to certain substances in the air). Epinastine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by preventing the release of natural substances which cause allergic reactions in the eyes.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ophthalmic epinastine comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes. It is usually instilled twice a day. Use epinastine eye drops at around the same times every day, usually morning and evening. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use epinastine eye drops exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of them or use them more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Epinastine eye drops are only for use in the eyes. Do not swallow this medication.</p>
<p>Epinastine eye drops control the itching of allergic conjunctivitis only when they are used regularly. Epinastine eye drops will not work if you use them only when you experience symptoms. Continue to use epinastine eye drops even if you feel well. Do not stop using epinastine eye drops without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>When you apply epinastine eye drops, be careful not to let the tip of the bottle touch your eye, fingers, face, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops. Using eye drops that are contaminated with bacteria may cause serious damage to the eye or loss of vision. If you think your eye drops have become contaminated, call your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<h3>To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before using epinastine eye drops,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to epinastine or any other medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking. Your doctor may need to adjust the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using epinastine, call your doctor.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you wear contact lenses. You should not wear contact lenses if your eyes are red or irritated, and you should not use epinastine eye drops to treat irritation that you think may be caused by contact lenses. You should also not instill epinastine eye drops while you are wearing contact lenses. Remove your contact lenses before you instill epinastine eye drops and do not replace them for at least 10 minutes afterward. You may find it convenient to instill the eye drops before you put your lenses on in the morning and after you take them out in the evening.</li>
