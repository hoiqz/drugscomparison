<p>Testosterone gel may cause harmful effects to people who touch your skin in the area where you applied it. Women and children are especially likely to be affected if they touch skin that has been covered with testosterone gel. If a pregnant woman touches skin that has been covered with testosterone gel, her unborn baby may be harmed.</p>
<p>You must take precautions to be sure that others will not come into contact with testosterone gel that is on your skin. After you apply testosterone gel, you should allow the medication to dry for a few minutes and then put on clothing that completely covers the area so that no one will touch your bare skin. When you have finished applying the medication, you must wash your hands with soap and water to remove any medication that may be left on your hands.</p>
<p>Do not let anyone touch your skin in the area where you applied testosterone gel. If you expect that you may have skin-to-skin contact with another person, you should wash the area very well with soap and water. If anyone touches skin that has been covered with testosterone gel and has not been washed, that person should wash his or her skin with soap and water as soon as possible. You should also tell others to be careful when handling your clothing, bed linens, or other items that may have testosterone gel on them.</p>
<p>If women or children touch skin that has been treated with testosterone gel, they may develop certain symptoms. If a woman who may have come into contact with testosterone gel develops either of the following symptoms, she should call her doctor immediately: growth of hair in new places on the body or acne. If a child who may have come into contact with testosterone gel develops any of the following system, you should call the child's doctor immediately: enlarged genitals, growth of pubic hair, increased erections, increased sexual desire, and aggressive behavior. Most of these symptoms can be expected to go away after the child stops coming into contact with testosterone gel, but in some cases, genitals may remain larger than normal.</p>
<p>Testosterone gel may cause the bones to mature more quickly than normal in children who come into contact with the medication. This means that the children may stop growing sooner than expected and may have a shorter than expected adult height. Even if these children no longer come into contact with testosterone gel, their bones may remain more mature than normal.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Testosterone topical gel is used to treat the symptoms of low testosterone in men who do not produce enough natural testosterone. Testosterone is a hormone that is usually produced by the body that is needed for the growth and functioning of the male sexual organs and for the development of typical male characteristics. Symptoms of low testosterone include decreased sexual desire and ability, extreme tiredness, low energy, depression, brittle bones that may break easily, and loss of certain male characteristics such as muscular build and deep voice. Testosterone gel works by supplying testosterone to replace the testosterone that is normally produced in the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Topical testosterone comes as a gel to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day. It is best to apply testosterone gel in the morning. To help you remember to apply testosterone gel, apply it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use testosterone gel exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>AndroGel <sup>®</sup> and Testim<sup>®</sup> brand gels both contain testosterone, but they are manufactured differently and are used in slightly different ways. Be sure that you know which brand of gel you are using and how and where you should apply it. Read the manufacturer's patient information that came with your gel carefully.</p>
<p>You can apply AndroGel<sup>®</sup> anywhere on your shoulders, upper arms, or abdomen (area between your chest and your waist). You can apply Testim<sup>®</sup> anywhere on your shoulders or upper arms, but you should <em>not</em> apply it to your abdomen. You should <em>not</em> apply either gel to your penis or scrotum or to skin that has sores, cuts, or irritation. </p>
<p>Be careful not to get testosterone gel in your eyes. If you do get testosterone gel in your eyes, wash them right away with warm, clean water. Call a doctor if your eyes become irritated.</p>
<p>You should not shower, bathe, swim, or wash the place where you applied the medication for at least 2 hours after you apply Testim<sup>®</sup> gel or at least 5-6 hours after you apply AndroGel <sup>®</sup>. Once in while, you may shower, bathe or swim as soon as 1 hour after you apply Testim<sup>®</sup>, but you should usually wait the full 2 hours. If you usually take a bath or shower in the morning, be sure to take your bath or shower before you apply either brand of testosterone gel.</p>
<p>Testosterone gel comes in single use tubes and packets and a multiple use pump. The pump releases a specific amount of testosterone gel each time the top is pressed. You will probably need to press the top of the pump four to eight times to get your full dose of testosterone gel. Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how many times to press the pump for each dose, and how many doses your pump contains. Throw away the pump after you have used that number of doses even if it is not empty.</p>
<p>Testosterone gel may catch fire. Stay away from open flames and do not smoke while you are applying testosterone gel and until the gel has dried completely.</p>
<p>Your doctor may adjust your dose of testosterone gel depending on the amount of testosterone in your blood during your treatment.</p>
<p>Testosterone gel may control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to use testosterone gel even if you feel well. Do not stop using testosterone gel without talking to your doctor. If you stop using testosterone gel, your symptoms may return.</p>
<h3>To use testosterone gel, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be sure that the skin in the place where you plan to apply testosterone gel is clean and completely dry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open your container of testosterone gel. If you are using a packet, fold the top edge at the perforation and tear across the packet along the perforation. If you are using a tube, unscrew the cap. If you are using a pump for the first time, press down on the top of the pump three times and discard the medication that comes out down a drain or in a trash can that is safe from children and pets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squeeze the packet or tube or press down on the top of the pump the right number of times to place the medication on the palm of your hand. It may be easier to apply testosterone gel if you squeeze the medication onto your palm and apply it to your skin in small portions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply the medication to the area you have chosen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throw away the empty packet or tube in a trash can that is safe from children and pets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands with soap and water right away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the medication to dry for a few minutes before you cover the area with clothing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
