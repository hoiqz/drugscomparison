<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Dexamethasone comes as eyedrops and eye ointment. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use dexamethasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you are using the suspension form of dexamethasone eyedrops (Maxidex), shake the bottle well before each dose. It is not necessary to shake dexamethasone eyedrop solution.</p>
<h3>To use the eyedrops, follow these instructions:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eyedrops and dropper must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>To use the eye ointment, follow these instructions:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a mirror or have someone else apply the ointment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the tip of the tube against your eye or anything else. The ointment must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tilt your head forward slightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding the tube between your thumb and index finger, place the tube as near as possible to your eyelid without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your cheek or nose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the index finger of your other hand, pull the lower lid of your eye down to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a small amount of ointment into the pocket made by the lower lid and the eye. A 1/2-inch (1.25-centimeter) strip of ointment usually is enough unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently close your eyes and keep them closed for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap right away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe off any excess ointment from your eyelids and lashes with a clean tissue. Wash your hands again.</p>
</li>
</ol>
