<p>Taking elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir may cause life-threatening damage to the liver and a potentially life-threatening condition called lactic acidosis (buildup of lactic acid in the blood). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: nausea; vomiting; pain in the upper right part of your stomach; loss of appetite; flu-like symptoms; extreme tiredness; unusual bleeding or bruising; weakness; dizziness; lightheadedness; fast or irregular heartbeat; trouble breathing; dark yellow or brown urine; light-colored bowel movements; yellowing of the skin or eyes; feeling cold, especially in the arms or legs; or muscle pain that is different than any muscle pain you usually experience.</p>
<p>Elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir should not be used to treat hepatitis B virus infection (HBV; an ongoing liver infection). Tell your doctor if you have or think you may have HBV. Your doctor may test you to see if you have HBV before you begin your treatment with elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. If you have HBV and you take elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir, your condition may suddenly worsen when you stop taking this medication. Your doctor will examine you and order lab tests regularly for several months after you stop taking this medication to see if your HBV has worsened.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>The combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir is used to treat HIV in patients who have not been treated with other medications. Elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir is in a class of medications called antivirals. Elvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir work by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Cobicistat helps to keep elvitegravir in the body longer so that the medication will have a greater effect. Although elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir will not cure HIV, these medications may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</p>
