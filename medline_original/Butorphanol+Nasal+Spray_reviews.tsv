<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Butorphanol nasal spray comes as a solution (liquid) to spray in the nose. It is usually used as needed for pain, but not more often than once every 3 to 4 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.</p>
<p>Butorphanol nasal spray should relieve your pain soon after you use it. If you are using a low starting dose of butorphanol nasal spray, your doctor may tell you that you may use a second dose if you still have pain 60 to 90 minutes after your first dose. Do not use this second dose unless your doctor tells you that you may. Call your doctor if you still have pain after using butorphanol nasal spray as prescribed. Also call your doctor if you have used butorphanol nasal spray for some time and find that it no longer works as well as it did at the beginning of your treatment.</p>
<p>Butorphanol nasal spray may be habit-forming. Use butorphanol nasal spray exactly as directed. Do not use a larger dose or use it more often or for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor. Call your doctor if you develop a strong desire to use more medication than prescribed.</p>
<p>Do not stop using butorphanol nasal spray without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using butorphanol nasal spray, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, shakiness, diarrhea, chills, sweats, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, loss of coordination,confusion, or hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist).Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.</p>
<p>Before you use butorphanol nasal spray for the first time, read the written directions provided by the manufacturer. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use butorphanol nasal spray.</p>
