<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Chloral hydrate, a sedative, is used in the short-term treatment of insomnia (to help you fall asleep and stay asleep for a proper rest) and to relieve anxiety and induce sleep before surgery. It is also used after surgery for pain and to treat alcohol withdrawal.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Chloral hydrate comes as a capsule and liquid to take by mouth and as a suppository to insert rectally. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take chloral hydrate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>The liquid should be added to a half glass of water, fruit juice, or ginger ale and you should drink it immediately.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsule whole with a full glass of water or fruit juice; do not chew the capsule.</p>
<h3>To use the suppository, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the wrapper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dip the tip of the suppository in water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest. (A left-handed person should lie on the right side and raise the left knee.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using your finger, insert the suppository into the rectum, about 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 centimeters) in infants and children and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in adults. Hold it in place for a few moments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand up after about 15 minutes. Wash your hands thoroughly and resume your normal activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Chloral hydrate can be habit-forming; do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer period than your doctor tells you to. Continue to take chloral hydrate even if you feel well. Do not stop taking chloral hydrate without talking to your doctor, especially if you have taken large doses for a long time. Your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually.</p>
