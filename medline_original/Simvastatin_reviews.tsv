<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Simvastatin is used together with diet, weight-loss, and exercise to reduce the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Simvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Simvastatin is also used to decrease the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death, and to decrease the need for surgery to improve blood flow in people who have medical conditions that put them at high risk of developing heart and blood vessel problems. Simvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Simvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day in the evening. Take simvastatin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take simvastatin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of simvastatin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Continue to take simvastatin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking simvastatin without talking to your doctor.</p>

<h3>Before taking simvastatin,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to simvastatin, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in simvastatin tablets. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are taking antifungal medications such as itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), and posaconazole (Noxafil); boceprevir (Victrelis); clarithromycin (Biaxin, in PrevPac); cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune); danazol; erythromycin (E.E.S., E-Mycin, Erythrocin); gemfibrozil (Lopid); HIV protease inhibitors such as atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista), fosamprenavir (Lexiva), indinavir (Crixivan), lopinavir (in Kaletra), nelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra), saquinavir (Invirase), and tipranavir (Aptivus); nefazodone; telaprevir (Incivek); and telithromycin (Ketek). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take simvastatin if you are taking these medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone); amlodipine (Norvasc, in Caduet, in Lotrel); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); colchicine (Colcrys); digoxin (Digitek, Lanoxicaps, Lanoxin); diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac); other cholesterol-lowering medications such as fenofibrate (Tricor) and niacin (nicotinic acid, Niacor, Niaspan); ranolazine (Ranexa); verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin, Verelan); and voriconazole (Vfend). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have liver disease. Your doctor will order blood tests to see how well your liver is working even if you do not think you have liver disease. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take simvastatin if you have liver disease or if the tests show that you may be developing liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you drink more than two alcoholic beverages per day or if you are Asian, especially if you are Chinese. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had an underactive thyroid gland, diabetes, seizures, low blood pressure, or kidney disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You should not become pregnant during your treatment with simvastatin. Talk to your doctor about birth control methods that will work for you. If you become pregnant while taking simvastatin, stop taking simvastatin and call your doctor immediately. Simvastatin can harm the fetus.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. You should not breast-feed while you are taking simvastatin.</li>
<geriatric-precaut>
<p>you should know that the risk that you will develop serious muscle and kidney problems during your treatment with simvastatin is higher if you are 65 years of age or older. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking simvastatin.</p>
</geriatric-precaut>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking simvastatin. If you are hospitalized due to serious injury or infection, tell the doctor who treats you that you are taking simvastatin.</li>
<li>ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking simvastatin. Alcohol can increase the risk of serious side effects.</li>
