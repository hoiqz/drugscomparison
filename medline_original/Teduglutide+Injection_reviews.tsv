<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Teduglutide injection is used to treat short bowel syndrome in people who need additional nutrition or fluids from intravenous (IV) therapy. Teduglutide injection is in a class of medications called glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analogs. It works by improving the absorption of fluids and nutrients in the intestines.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Teduglutide comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid and injected subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected once a day. Inject teduglutide at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Inject teduglutide exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor. If you inject more teduglutide than prescribed by your doctor, call your doctor right away.</p>
<p>Continue to use teduglutide even if you feel well. Do not stop using teduglutide without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>You may inject teduglutide yourself or have a friend or relative give the injections. You and the person who will be injecting the medication should read the manufacturer's directions for mixing and injecting the medication before you use it for the first time at home. Ask your doctor to show you or the person who will be injecting teduglutide how to mix and inject it.</p>
<p>Teduglutide comes as a kit containing vials of teduglutide powder for injection, prefilled syringes containing diluent (liquid to be mixed with teduglutide powder), needles to attach to the diluent syringe, dosing syringes with needles attached, and alcohol swab pads. Throw away needles, syringes, and vials in a puncture-resistant container after you use them once. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.</p>
<p>Always look at your teduglutide injection before you inject it. The solution should be clear and colorless or pale yellow, with no particles in it. Teduglutide must be used within 3 hours after mixing teduglutide powder with the diluent.</p>
<p>You can inject your teduglutide in your upper arm, thigh, or stomach. Never inject teduglutide into a vein or muscle. Use a different injection site each day. Do not inject teduglutide into any area that is tender, bruised, red, or hard.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with teduglutide injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<h3>Before injecting teduglutide,</h3>
<ul>

Be sure to mention any of the following: antihistamines; medications for anxiety and seizures; medications for mental illness and nausea; sedatives; sleeping pills; and tranquilizers. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have a stoma (a surgically created opening from an area inside the body to the outside, usually in the abdominal area) or if you have or have ever had cancer, polyps in your intestines or rectum, high blood pressure, or gallbladder, heart, kidney, or pancreatic disease.</li>
<li>you should know that teduglutide injection may cause polyps (growths) in the colon (large intestine). Your doctor will check your colon within 6 months before you start using teduglutide, again right after you have used this medication for 1 year, and then at least once every 5 years. If polyps are found, they will need to be removed. If cancer is found in a polyp, your doctor may tell you to stop using teduglutide injection.</li>
