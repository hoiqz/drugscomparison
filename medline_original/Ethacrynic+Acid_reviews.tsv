<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ethacrynic acid comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with food. If you take ethacrynic acid once a day, take it with breakfast in the morning. If you take it twice a day, take it in the morning and in the afternoon to avoid going to the bathroom during the night. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ethacrynic acid exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Ethacrynic acid controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take ethacrynic acid even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ethacrynic acid without talking to your doctor.</p>

<h3>Before taking ethacrynic acid,</h3>
<ul>

<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes, gout, or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking ethacrynic acid, call your doctor.</li>
<geriatric-precaut>
<p>talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking ethacrynic acid if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take ethacrynic acid because it is not as safe as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition.</p>

<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking ethacrynic acid.</li>
<li>you should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this affects you.</li>
