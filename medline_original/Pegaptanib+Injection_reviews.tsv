<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Pegaptanib injection is used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD; an ongoing disease of the eye that causes loss of the ability to see straight ahead and may make it more difficult to read, drive, or perform other daily activities). Pegaptanib injection is in a class of medications called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonists. It works by stopping abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage in the eye(s) that may cause vision loss in people with wet AMD.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Pegaptanib injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into the eye by a doctor. It is usually given in a doctor's office once every 6 weeks. </p>
<p>Before you receive a pegaptanib injection, your doctor will clean your eye to prevent infection and numb your eye to reduce discomfort during the injection. You may feel pressure in your eye when the medication is injected. After your injection, your doctor will need to examine your eyes before you leave the office.</p>
<p>Pegaptanib controls wet AMD, but does not cure it. Your doctor will watch you carefully to see how well pegaptanib works for you. Talk to your doctor about how long you should continue treatment with pegaptanib.</p>
