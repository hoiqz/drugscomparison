<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Aminocaproic acid is used to control bleeding that occurs when blood clots are broken down too quickly. This type of bleeding may occur during or after heart or liver surgery; in people who have certain bleeding disorders; in people who have cancer of the prostate (a male reproductive gland), lung, stomach, or cervix (opening of the uterus); and in pregnant women experiencing placental abruption (placenta separates from the uterus before the baby is ready to be born). Aminocaproic acid is also used to control bleeding in the urinary tract (the organs in the body that produce and excrete urine) that may occur after prostate or kidney surgery or in people who have certain types of cancer. Aminocaproic acid should not be used to treat bleeding that is not caused by faster than normal clot breakdown, so your doctor may order tests to find the cause of your bleeding before you begin your treatment. Aminocaproic acid is in a class of medications called hemostatics. It works by slowing the breakdown of blood clots.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Aminocaproic acid comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once an hour for about 8 hours or until the bleeding is controlled. When aminocaproic acid is used to treat ongoing bleeding, it is usually taken every 3 to 6 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take aminocaproic acid exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a high dose of aminocaproic acid and gradually decrease your dose as the bleeding is controlled.</p>
