<p>Telavancin injection has caused birth defects in animals. This medication has not been studied in pregnant women, but it is possible that it may also cause birth defects in babies whose mothers received telavancin injection during pregnancy. You should not use telavancin injection while you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant unless your doctor decides that this is the best treatment for your infection. If you can become pregnant, you will need to have a pregnancy test before beginning treatment with telavancin injection. You will also need to use an effective form of birth control during your treatment. You may be excused from meeting these requirements only if you have not menstruated for 24 months in a row, your doctor says you have passed menopause (change of life), you have had a tubal ligation (''tubes tied''; surgery to prevent pregnancy), or you have had surgery to remove your uterus and/or both ovaries. If you become pregnant while using telavancin injection, call your doctor immediately. You should also talk to your healthcare provider about taking part in the VIBATIV Pregnancy Registry (study to learn how telavancin injection affects pregnancy and babies).</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with telavancin injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of using telavancin injection.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Telavancin injection is used alone or with other medications to treat serious skin infections caused by certain types of bacteria. Telavancin injection is in a class of medications called lipoglycopeptide antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Telavancin injection comes as a powder to be added to fluid and given through a needle or catheter placed in your vein. It is usually infused (injected slowly) intravenously (into a vein) over a period of 60 minutes once every 24 hours for 7 to 14 days. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have. You may receive telavancin injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you are using telavancin injection at home, use it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or other healthcare provider to explain any part you do not understand. Use telavancin injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you will be using telavancin injection at home, your healthcare provider will show you how to infuse the medication. Be sure that you understand these directions, and ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Ask your healthcare provider what to do if you have any problems infusing telavancin injection.</p>
<p>It is important that telavancin injection be infused slowly over at least 60 minutes. If it is given too quickly, you may develop red coloring of your upper body, hives, itching, or rash.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with telavancin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, tell your doctor.</p>
<p>Use telavancin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using telavancin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
