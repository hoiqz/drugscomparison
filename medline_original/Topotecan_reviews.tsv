You should not take topotecan if you already have a low number of blood cells. Your doctor will order laboratory tests regularly before and during your treatment to check whether your body has enough blood cells. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: sore throat, chills, fever, cough, burning or painful urination, or other signs of infection; stomach pain; unusual bruising or bleeding; excessive tiredness; headache; dizziness; confusion; pale skin; fast heartbeat; or shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to topotecan.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Topotecan is used to treat small cell lung cancer (a type of cancer that begins in the lungs) that was successfully treated with a different chemotherapy medication but has returned no sooner than 45 days after the last dose of the first chemotherapy medication was taken. Topotecan is in a class of medications called topoisomerase I inhibitors. It works by killing cancer cells.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Topotecan comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It may be taken with or without food. It is usually taken once a day for 5 days in a row every 21 days. Your doctor will decide how many times you should repeat this cycle. Take topotecan at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take topotecan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole with water; do not open, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Topotecan capsules come in two different strengths. Your doctor may want you to take a combination of both strengths of capsules to make up your full dose. Be sure that you know what each type of capsule looks like and how many you are to take of each. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p>
<p>If any of the capsules are broken or leaking, do not touch them with your bare hands. Carefully throw away the broken capsules without touching them directly and then wash your hands well with soap and water. If the capsule contents do touch your skin, wash the area well with soap and water right away. If any capsule contents get in your eyes, wash your eyes right away with gently flowing water for at least 15 minutes. Call your doctor if you have any skin reaction or if medication gets in your eyes.</p>
<p>You may vomit after you take the medication. If this happens, let your doctor know right away. Do not take another dose of topotecan on the same day.</p>
<p>Your doctor may need to delay your treatment or adjust your dose if you experience certain side effects. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with topotecan.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
