<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Cabazitaxel injection may cause a serious or life-threatening decrease in the number of white blood cells (a type of blood cell that is needed to fight infection) in your blood. This increases the risk that you will develop a serious infection. Tell your doctor if you are 65 years of age or older, if you have or have ever had a low number of white blood cells along with a fever, if you have been treated with radiation therapy, and if you are unable to eat a healthy diet. Your doctor will order laboratory tests to check the number of white blood cells in your blood before and during your treatment. If you have a low number of white blood cells, your doctor may decrease your dose or stop or delay your treatment. Your doctor may also prescribe a medication to help prevent life-threatening complications if your white blood cells decrease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: sore throat, fever (a temperature greater than 100.4°F), chills, muscle aches, cough, burning on urination, or other signs of infection.</p>
<p>Cabazitaxel injection may cause severe or life-threatening allergic reactions, especially when you receive your first two infusions of cabazitaxel injection. Your doctor will give you medications to prevent an allergic reaction at least 30 minutes before you receive cabazitaxel injection. You should receive your infusion in a medical facility where you can be treated quickly if you have a reaction. Tell your doctor if you are allergic to cabazitaxel injection or polysorbate 80 (an ingredient found in some foods and medications). Ask your doctor if you are not sure if a food or medication you are allergic to contains polysorbate 80. If you experience an allergic reaction to cabazitaxel injection, it may begin within a few minutes after your infusion starts, and you may experience the following symptoms: rash, reddening of the skin, itching, dizziness, faintness, or tightening of the throat. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you experience any of these symptoms.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to cabazitaxel injection.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking cabazitaxel injection.</p>
