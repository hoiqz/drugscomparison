<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Topical clindamycin comes as a foam, a gel, a solution (liquid), a lotion, and a pledget (swab) to apply to the skin. The foam and one brand of the gel (Clindagel<sup>®</sup>) are usually applied once a day. The solution, lotion, pledgets, and most brands of gel are applied twice a day. Apply topical clindamycin at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use topical clindamycin exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Topical clindamycin is only for use on the skin. Do not swallow the medication, and do not get the medication in your eyes, nose, mouth, or vagina. If you do get the medication in your eyes, nose, or mouth, or on broken skin, rinse it out with plenty of cool water.</p>
<p>Your medication will probably come with directions for use. Read these directions and follow them carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to apply topical clindamycin.</p>
<p>Shake the lotion well before each use to mix the medication evenly.</p>
<p>The pledgets are for one-time use only. Do not remove a pledget from its foil pouch until you are ready to use it. Throw away each pledget after you have used it one time.</p>
<p>The foam may catch fire. Stay away from open flames and do not smoke while you are applying the foam and for a short time afterward.</p>
