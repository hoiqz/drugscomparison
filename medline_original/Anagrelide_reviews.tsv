<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Anagrelide is used to decrease the number of platelets (a type of blood cell that is needed to control bleeding) in the blood of patients who have a bone marrow disorder, in which the body makes too many of one or more types of blood cells, such as essential thrombocythemia (condition in which the body makes too many platelets) or polycythemia vera (condition in which the body makes too many red blood cells and sometimes too many platelets). Anagrelide is in a class of medications called platelet-reducing agents. It works by slowing the production of platelets in the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Anagrelide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two to four times a day. Take anagrelide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take anagrelide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of anagrelide and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week. Your doctor may change your dose during your treatment based upon your body's response to the medication. Follow these directions carefully.</p>
<p>Anagrelide may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take anagrelide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking anagrelide without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking anagrelide, the number of platelets in your blood will increase and you may experience symptoms.</p>
