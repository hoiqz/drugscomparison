<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Butoconazole comes as a cream to insert into the vagina. It is usually used daily at bedtime. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use butoconazole exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<h3>To use the vaginal cream, read the instructions provided with the medication and follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fill the special applicator that comes with the cream to the level indicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lie on your back with your knees drawn upward and spread apart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insert the applicator high into your vagina (unless you are pregnant), and then push the plunger to release the medication. If you are pregnant, insert the applicator gently. If you feel resistance (hard to insert), do not try to insert it further; call your doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdraw the applicator and discard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands promptly to avoid spreading the infection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The dose should be applied when you lie down to go to bed. The drug works best if you do not get up again after applying it except to wash your hands. You may wish to wear a sanitary napkin to protect your clothing against stains. Do not use a tampon because it will absorb the drug. Do not douche unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p>
<p>Continue to use butoconazole even if you feel well. Do not stop using butoconazole without talking to your doctor. Continue using this medication during your menstrual period.</p>
