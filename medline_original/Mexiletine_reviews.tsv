<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Antiarrhythmic drugs, similar to mexiletine, have been reported to increase the risk of death or heart attack, especially in people who have had a heart attack within the past 2 years. Mexiletine may increase the chance of having arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and has not been proven to help people without life-threatening arrhythmias to live longer. Mexiletine should be used only to treat people with life-threatening arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking mexiletine.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Mexiletine is used to treat certain types of ventricular arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). Mexiletine is in a class of medications called antiarrhythmics. It works by blocking certain electrical signals in the heart to stabilize the heart rhythm.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Mexiletine comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day, every 8 hours. Some people may take it twice daily, every 12 hours, once their arrhythmias have been controlled with mexiletine. Mexiletine should be taken with food or an antacid to prevent stomach upset. Take mexiletine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take mexiletine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You will probably be hospitalized when you begin your treatment with mexiletine. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during this time and for as long as you continue to take mexiletine. Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of mexiletine and gradually increase or decrease your dose, not more than once every 2 to 3 days.</p>
<p>Mexiletine controls arrhythmias but does not cure them. Continue to take mexiletine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking mexiletine without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking mexiletine, your condition may become worse.</p>
