<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Alitretinoin comes in topical gel. Alitretinoin is usually used twice a day. Your doctor may tell you to use alitretinoin more or less frequently depending on your response to it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use alitretinoin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<h3>Alitretinoin controls Kaposi's sarcoma lesions but does not cure them. It will take at least 2 weeks of using alitretinoin before a benefit can be seen. For some patients, it may take 8 to 14 weeks to see results. Do not stop using alitretinoin without talking to your doctor. To apply alitretinoin, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands and affected skin area thoroughly with mild soap (not medicated or abrasive soap or soap that dries the skin) and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use clean fingertips, a gauze pad, or a cotton swab to apply the medication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply enough gel to cover the lesion with a generous coating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply the medication to the affected skin area only. Do not apply to unaffected areas; do not apply on or near mucus membranes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the gel to dry for 3-5 minutes before covering with clothing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
