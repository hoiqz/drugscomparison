<p>Stavudine, when used alone or in combination with other antiviral medications, may cause serious and possibly deadly damage to the liver and pancreas and a life-threatening condition called lactic acidosis. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver or pancreas disease or gallstones, and if you have taken medication to treat HIV for a long time. Also tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large quantities of alcohol and if you are taking didanosine (Videx) or hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea). Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking stavudine, call your doctor.</p>
<p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: upset stomach, vomiting, unusual or unexpected stomach pain, sudden weight loss, extreme weakness or tiredness, shortness of breath, fast breathing, weakness in arms or legs, and any sudden change in your general health. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your response to stavudine.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Stavudine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Stavudine is in a class of medications called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although stavudine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Stavudine comes as a capsule and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day (every 12 hours), with or without food and with plenty of water. To help you remember to take stavudine, take it at around the same time each day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take stavudine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you are giving the oral solution to a child, shake the bottle well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure the child's dose.</p>
<p>Stavudine controls HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take stavudine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking stavudine without talking to your doctor. If you miss doses or suddenly stop taking stavudine, your condition may become more difficult to treat.</p>
