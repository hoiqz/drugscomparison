<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Vincristine is used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs to treat certain types of leukemia (cancer of the white blood cells), including acute myeloid leukemia (AML, ANLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin's lymphoma (Hodgkin's disease), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (types of cancer that begin in a type of white blood cells that normally fights infection). Vincristine is also used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs to treat Wilms tumor (a type of kidney cancer that occurs in children), neuroblastoma (a cancer that begins in nerve cells and occurs mainly in children), and rhabdomyosarcoma (cancer that forms in muscles in children).
