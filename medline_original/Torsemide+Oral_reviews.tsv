<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Torsemide, a 'water pill,' is used to reduce the swelling and fluid retention caused by various medical problems, including heart or liver disease. It also is used to treat high blood pressure. It causes the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.</p>
<p>This medicine is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Torsemide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day in the morning. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take torsemide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Torsemide controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take torsemide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking torsemide without talking to your doctor.</p>
