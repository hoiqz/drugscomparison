<p>Tiludronate comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken on an empty stomach once a day for 3 months. This treatment may be repeated if symptoms come back or worsen after some time has passed. Take tiludronate at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tiludronate exactly as directed. Do not take it more or less often or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Take tiludronate with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces [180 to 240 milliliters]) of plain water. Do not take tiludronate with any other liquid, including mineral water. Do not eat or drink for 2 hours before or 2 hours after you take tiludronate. Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking this medication.</p>
<p>Tiludronate controls Paget's disease of bone only when it is taken as prescribed. Do not stop taking tiludronate without talking to your doctor.</p>
