<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Eflornithine is used to slow the growth of unwanted hair on the face in women, usually around the lips or under the chin. Eflornithine works by blocking a natural substance that is needed for hair to grow and is located in your hair follicle (the sac where each hair grows).</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Eflornithine comes as a cream to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice a day. To help you remember to apply eflornithine cream, apply it around the same times every day, such as in the morning and in the evening. You should wait at least 8 hours between applications of eflornithine.  Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Apply eflornithine cream exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Eflornithine cream slows hair growth but does not prevent it. You should continue to use your current method of hair removal (e.g., shaving, plucking, cutting) or treatment while using eflornithine cream. It may take four weeks or longer before you see the full benefit of eflornithine cream. Do not stop applying eflornithine without talking to your doctor. Stopping use of eflornithine will cause hair to grow as it did before treatment. You should notice improvement (less time spent using your current method of hair removal) within 6 months of beginning treatment with eflornithine. If no improvement is seen, your doctor will likely ask you to stop using eflornithine.</p>
<h3>To use eflornithine cream, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash and dry the affected area(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply a thin layer to affected area(s) and rub in until absorbed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply eflornithine cream only to affected skin areas. Do not allow the cream to get into your eyes, mouth, or vagina.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should wait at least 4 hours after applying eflornithine cream before washing the area where it was applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should wait at least 5 minutes after using your current method of hair removal before applying eflornithine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You may apply cosmetics or sunscreen after an application of eflornithine cream has dried.</p>
<p>You may feel temporary stinging or burning if you apply eflornithine to broken skin.</p>
