<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Calcitonin salmon injection is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to weaken and break more easily. Calcitonin salmon injection is also used to treat Paget's disease of bone and to quickly reduce calcium levels in the blood when needed. Calcitonin is a human hormone that is also found in salmon. It works by preventing bone breakdown and increasing bone density (thickness).</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Calcitonin salmon comes as a solution to be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) or into the muscle (intramuscularly). It is usually used once a day or once every other day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use calcitonin salmon injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist will show you how to administer the medication. Follow all directions carefully. Throw away all empty syringes and vials as directed by your healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Before preparing a dose, look at the vial. If the solution is discolored or contains particles, do not use it, and call your pharmacist.</p>
<p>Calcitonin salmon helps treat osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone but does not cure them. Continue to use calcitonin salmon even if you feel well. Do not stop using calcitonin salmon without talking to your doctor.</p>
