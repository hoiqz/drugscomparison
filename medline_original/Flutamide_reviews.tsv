<p>Flutamide may cause liver damage that can be serious or life-threatening. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, extreme tiredness, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, soreness, pain in the upper right part of the stomach, yellowing of the skin or eyes, or dark urine.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain blood tests to check how well your liver is working before you begin taking flutamide, every month for the first 4 months of your treatment, and periodically for as long as your treatment continues.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking flutamide.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Flutamide is used together with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRH; a type of hormonal injection such as leuprolide [Lupron, Eligard], goserelin [Zoladex], or triptorelin [Trelstar]) to treat certain types of prostate cancer. Flutamide is in a class of medications called nonsteroidal antiandrogens. It works by blocking the effects of androgen (a male hormone) to stop the growth and spread of cancer cells.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Flutamide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food every 8 hours (three times a day.) Take flutamide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take flutamide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Continue to take flutamide along with the LHRH agonist treatment even if you feel well. Do not stop taking either medication without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
