If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: itching, yellow eyes or skin, dark urine, or pain or discomfort in the right upper stomach area.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests such as blood tests, X-rays, and electrocardiograms (EKGs, tests that record the electrical activity of the heart) before and during your treatment to be sure that it is safe for you to take sunitinib and to check your body's response to the medication.</p>

Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Sunitinib is used to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST; a type of tumor that grows in the stomach, intestine (bowel), or esophagus (tube that connects the throat with the stomach) in people with tumors that were not treated successfully with imatinib (Gleevec) or people who cannot take imatinib. Sunitinib is also used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC, a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the kidneys). Sunitinib is also used to treat pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET, a type of tumor that begins in certain cells of the pancreas) in people with tumors that have worsened and cannot be treated with surgery. Sunitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells and may help shrink tumors.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Sunitinib comes as a capsule to take by mouth with or without food. For treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) or advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), sunitinib is usually taken once a day for 4 weeks (28 days) followed by a 2-week break before beginning the next dosing cycle. For treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), sunitinib is usually taken once daily. Take sunitinib at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sunitinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not open the capsules.</p>
<p>You may need to take one or more capsules at a time depending on your dose of sunitinib.</p>
<p>Your doctor may gradually increase or decrease your dose of sunitinib during your treatment. This depends on how well the medication works for you and the side effects you experience. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment. Continue to take sunitinib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking sunitinib without talking to your doctor.</p>
