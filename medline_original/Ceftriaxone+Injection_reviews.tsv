<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ceftriaxone injection is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria such as gonorrhea (a sexually transmitted disease), pelvic inflammatory disease (infection of the female reproductive organs that may cause infertility), meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord), and infections of the lungs, ears, skin, urinary tract, blood, bones, joints, and abdomen. Ceftriaxone injection is also sometimes given before certain types of surgery to prevent infections that may develop after the operation. Ceftriaxone injection is in a class of medications called cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ceftriaxone injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle). It is sometimes given as a single dose and sometimes given once or twice a day for 4-14 days, depending on the type of infection being treated. You may receive ceftriaxone injection in a hospital or doctor's office, or you may administer the medication at home. If you are using ceftriaxone injection at home, use it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ceftriaxone injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first few days of your treatment with ceftriaxone injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor.</p>
<p>If you will be using more than one dose of ceftriaxone injection, use the medication until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ceftriaxone injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
