<h2>About your treatment</h2>

<p>Your doctor has ordered oxytocin, a hormone, to stimulate contractions of the uterus and smooth muscle tissue. The drug will be either injected into a large muscle (such as your buttock or hip) or added to an intravenous fluid that will drip through a needle or catheter in your vein.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland. It is used to help start or strengthen labor and to reduce bleeding after delivery. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
<p>Your health care provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how your symptoms respond to the medication.</p>

<h2>Precautions</h2>

<h3>Before administering oxytocin,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to oxytocin or any other drugs.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, including vitamins.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a premature delivery, herpes infection, eclampsia, cervical cancer, previous uterine surgery, prolapsed uterus, breech position, placenta previa, or other abnormal position of the fetus or umbilical cord.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Administering your medication</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Before you administer oxytocin, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.</p>
<p>It is important that you use your medication exactly as directed. Do not change your dosing schedule without talking to your health care provider. Your health care provider may tell you to stop your infusion if you have a mechanical problem (such as a blockage in the tubing, needle, or catheter); if you have to stop an infusion, call your health care provider immediately so your therapy can continue.</p>
