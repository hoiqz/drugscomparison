<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>[Posted 05/06/2013]<strong>ISSUE</strong>: FDA is advising health care professionals and women that the anti-seizure medication valproate sodium and related products, valproic acid and divalproex sodium, are contraindicated and should not be taken by pregnant women for the prevention of migraine headaches. Based on information from a recent study, there is evidence that these medications can cause decreased IQ scores in children whose mothers took them while pregnant. Stronger warnings about use during pregnancy will be added to the drug labels, and valproate's pregnancy category for migraine use will be changed from "D" (the potential benefit of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its potential risks) to "X" (the risk of use in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit of the drug). Valproate products will remain in pregnancy category D for treating epilepsy and manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>
<strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: Valproate products are approved for the treatment of certain types of epilepsy, the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, and the prevention of migraine headaches. They are also used off-label (for uses not approved by FDA) for other conditions, particularly other psychiatric conditions. This alert is based on the final results of the Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (NEAD) study showing that children exposed to valproate products while their mothers were pregnant had decreased IQs at age 6 compared to children exposed to other anti-epileptic drugs. For additional details, see the Drug Safety Communication Data Summary section.</p>
<p>
<strong>RECOMMENDATION</strong>: Valproate products should not be used in pregnant women for prevention of migraine headaches and should be used in pregnant women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder only if other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Women who are pregnant and taking a valproate medication should not stop their medication but should talk to their health care professionals immediately. Stopping valproate treatment suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening medical problems to the woman or her baby.

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Valproic acid is used alone or with other medications to treat certain types of seizures. Valproic acid is also used to treat mania (episodes of frenzied, abnormally excited mood) in people with bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder; a disease that causes episodes of depression, episodes of mania, and other abnormal moods). It is also used to prevent migraine headaches, but not to relieve headaches that have already begun. Valproic acid is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by increasing the amount of a certain natural substance in the brain.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Valproic acid comes as a capsule, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, a delayed-release (slow to begin working) tablet, a sprinkle capsule (capsule that contains small beads of medication that can be sprinkled on food), and a syrup (liquid) to take by mouth. The syrup, capsules, delayed-release tablets, and sprinkle capsules are usually taken two or more times daily. The extended-release tablets are usually taken once a day. Take valproic acid at around the same time(s) every day. Take valproic acid with food to help prevent the medication from upsetting your stomach. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take valproic acid exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the regular capsules and extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>You can swallow the sprinkle capsules whole, or you can open the capsules and sprinkle the beads they contain on a teaspoonful of soft food, such as applesauce or pudding. Swallow the mixture of food and medication beads right after you prepare it. Be careful not to chew the beads. Do not store unused mixtures of food and medication.</p>
<p>Do not mix the syrup into any carbonated drink.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of valproic acid and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week.</p>
<p>Valproic acid may help to control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take valproic acid even if you feel well. Do not stop taking valproic acid without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking valproic acid, you may experience a severe, long-lasting and possibly life-threatening seizure. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.</p>

<h2>Other uses for this medicine</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Valproic acid is also sometimes used to treat outbursts of aggression in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing or remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age), chorea (a group of conditions that affect the ability to control body movements), and certain conditions that affect thinking, learning, and understanding. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>What special precautions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before taking valproic acid,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to valproic acid, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in the type of valproic acid that has been prescribed for you. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: acyclovir (Zovirax); antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as amitriptyline (Elavil) and nortriptyline (Pamelor); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); aspirin; clonazepam (Klonopin); diazepam (Valium); medications for anxiety or mental illness; other medications for seizures such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), ethosuximide (Zarontin), felbamate (Felbatol), lamotrigine (Lamictal), mephobarbital (Mebaral), phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), primidone (Mysoline), and topiramate (Topamax); meropenem (Merrem IV); rifampin (Rifadin); sedatives; sleeping pills; tolbutamide; tranquilizers;and zidovudine (Retrovir). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a urea cycle disorder (one of a group of conditions that affect the ability to change protein from food into energy). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take valproic acid.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if anyone in your family has ever had a urea cycle disorder or has died of unknown causes in the first months of life. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had episodes of vomiting, extreme tiredness and/or irritability; episodes of confusion and loss of ability to think and understand, especially during pregnancy or after childbirth; coma (loss of consciousness for a period of time); mental retardation; difficulty coordinating your movements; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); cytomegalovirus (CMV; a virus that can cause symptoms in people who have weak immune systems); hyperlipidemia (higher than normal amount of fats in the blood); or kidney disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking valproic acid.</li>
<li>you should know that valproic acid may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.</li>
<li>remember that alcohol can add to the drowsiness caused by this medication.</li>
<li>you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking valproic acid for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as valproic acid to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as valproic acid, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; giving away prized possessions; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.</li>
