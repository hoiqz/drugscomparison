<p>Teniposide injection must be given in a hospital or medical facility under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in giving chemotherapy medications for cancer.</p>
<p>Teniposide can cause a severe decrease in the number of blood cells in your bone marrow. This increases the risk that you will develop a serious infection or bleeding. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fever, sore throat, chills, ongoing cough and congestion, or other signs of infection; unusual bleeding or bruising; black and tarry stools; red blood in stools; bloody vomit; vomited material that looks like coffee grounds.</p>
<p>Teniposide may cause severe or life-threatening allergic reactions. If you experience an allergic reaction to teniposide injection, it may begin during or after your infusion ends, and you may experience the following symptoms: hives; rash; itching; swelling of the eyes, face, throat, lips, tongue, hands, arms, feet, or ankles; difficulty breathing or swallowing; flushing; dizziness; faintness; or fast heartbeat. Your doctor or nurse will watch you carefully while you receive each dose of teniposide and for a period of time afterwards. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. You will receive certain medications to help prevent an allergic reaction before you receive each dose of teniposide if you have experienced an allergic reaction to teniposide.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Teniposide is used with other chemotherapy drugs to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL; a type of cancer of the white blood cells) in children that has not improved or that has worsened after treatment with other medications. Teniposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body.</p>
