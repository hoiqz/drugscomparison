<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Lisdexamfetamine can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, take it for a longer time, or take it in a different way than prescribed by your doctor. If you take too much lisdexamfetamine, you may find that the medication no longer controls your symptoms, you may feel a need to take large amounts of the medication, and you may experience symptoms such as rash, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, irritability, hyperactivity, and unusual changes in your personality or behavior. Overusing lisdexamfetamine may also cause sudden death or serious heart problems, such as heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications. Your doctor will probably not prescribe lisdexamfetamine for you.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking lisdexamfetamine without talking to your doctor, especially if you have overused the medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually and monitor you carefully during this time. You may develop severe depression and extreme tiredness if you suddenly stop taking lisdexamfetamine after overusing it.</p>
<p>Do not sell, give away, or let anyone else take your medication. Selling or giving away lisdexamfetamine may harm others and is against the law. Store lisdexamfetamine in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many tablets or capsules are left so you will know if any are missing.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with lisdexamfetamine and each time you get more medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Lisdexamfetamine is used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in adults and children. Lisdexamfetamine is in a class of medications called central nervous system stimulants. It works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain.</p>
<a name="how">

<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Lisdexamfetamine comes as a capsule to be taken by mouth. It is usually taken once a day in the morning with or without food. Take lisdexamfetamine at around the same time every day. Do not take lisdexamfetamine in the late afternoon or evening because it may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lisdexamfetamine exactly as directed.</p>
<p>You may swallow the capsule whole, or you may open the capsule, sprinkle the entire contents into a glass of water, and stir to dissolve. Drink the mixture right away. Do not store the mixture for future use, and do not divide the contents of one capsule into more than one dose.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of lisdexamfetamine and increase your dose gradually, not more often than once every week.Your doctor may decrease your dose if you experience unpleasant side effects.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to stop taking lisdexamfetamine from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.</p>
