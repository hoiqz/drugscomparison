<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Desmopressin is used to control the symptoms of a certain type of diabetes insipidus ('water diabetes'; condition in which the body produces an abnormally large amount of urine). Desmopressin is also used to control excessive thirst and the passage of an abnormally large amount of urine that may occur after a head injury or after certain types of surgery. Desmopressin is also used to control bed-wetting. Desmopressin is in a class of medications called hormones. It works by replacing vasopressin, a hormone that is normally produced in the body to help balance the amount of water and salt.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Desmopressin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken two to three times a day. When desmopressin is used to treat bed-wetting, it is usually taken once a day at bedtime. Try to take desmopressin at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take desmopressin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of desmopressin and gradually increase your dose. Follow these directions carefully.</p>

<h2>What special precautions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before taking desmopressin,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to desmopressin or any other medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: antidepressants such as amitriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine (Anafranil), desipramine (Norpramin), doxepin (Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor), protriptyline (Vivactil), and trimipramine (Surmontil); aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); carbamazepine (Tegretol); chlorpromazine (Thorazine, Sonazine); chlorpropamide (Diabinese); clofibrate; demeclocycline (Declomycin); fludrocortisone; heparin; lamotrigine (Lamictal); lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid); narcotic (opiate) medications for pain; oxybutynin (Ditropan); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem), fluvoxamine, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft); and urea (Pytest). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Other medications may also interact with desmopressin, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney disease or a low level of sodium in your blood. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take desmopressin.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had high blood pressure, any condition that causes you to be extremely thirsty, cystic fibrosis,  or heart disease.</li>
<li>if you are taking desmopressin to treat bed-wetting, tell your doctor if you develop an infection, fever, vomiting, or diarrhea; if the weather is unusually hot; or if you plan to exercise more than usual. You may need to drink more fluid than usual in these situations. Drinking too much fluid while you are taking desmopressin can be dangerous, so your doctor will probably tell you to stop taking desmopressin temporarily.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking desmopressin, call your doctor.</li>
<li>ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking desmopressin. </li>

<h2>What special dietary instructions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Your doctor may tell you to limit the amount of fluid you drink during your treatment with desmopressin. If you are taking desmopressin to treat bed-wetting, your doctor will probably tell you to avoid drinking for at least one hour before you take desmopressin and at least 8 hours after you take desmopressin. Follow your doctor's directions carefully to prevent serious side effects.</p>
