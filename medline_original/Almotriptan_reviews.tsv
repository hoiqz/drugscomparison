<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Almotriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Almotriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and stopping the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Almotriptan does not prevent migraine attacks.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Almotriptan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. If your symptoms improve after you take almotriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take almotriptan, do not take a second tablet before calling your doctor. Do not take more than two almotriptan tablets in any 24-hour period. Call your doctor if you need to take almotriptan more than four times a month. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take almotriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You may take your first dose of almotriptan in a doctor's office or other medical facility where you can be monitored for serious reactions.</p>
