<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Romidepsin injection is used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL; a group of cancers of the immune system that first appear as skin rashes) in people who have already been treated with at least one other medication given by mouth or by injection. Romidepsin injection is in a class of medications called histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. It works by slowing the growth of cancer cells.</p>

<h3>Before receiving romidepsin injection,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to romidepsin injection, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in romidepsin injection. Ask your pharmacist or check the patient information for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: certain antibiotics such as clarithromycin (Biaxin), erythromycin (E.E.S., E-Mycin, Erythrocin), moxifloxacin (Avelox), and telithromycin (Ketek); anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin (Coumadin); antifungals such as itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), and voriconazole (Vfend); cisapride (Propulsid) (not available in the U.S.); dexamethasone; medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) such as atazanavir (Reyataz), indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (in Kaletra, Norvir), and saquinavir (Invirase); medications for irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone (Cordarone), disopyramide (Norpace), dofetilide (Tikosyn), procainamide (Procanbid, Pronestyl), quinidine (Quinidex), and sotalol (Betapace, Betapace AF); certain medications for seizures such as carbamazepine (Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol), phenobarbital, and phenytoin (Dilantin); nefazodone; pimozide (Orap), rifabutin (Mycobutin), rifampin (Rifadin, in Rifamate, in Rifater, Rimactane); rifapentine (Priftin); sparfloxacin (Zagam), or thioridazine (Mellaril). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea before you begin your treatment with romidepsin injection. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a prolonged QT interval (a rare heart problem that may cause irregular heartbeat, fainting, or sudden death), an irregular heartbeat, too much or too little potassium or magnesium in your blood, or liver, kidney, or heart disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. You should use birth control to prevent pregnancy during your treatment with romidepsin injection. However, you should not use hormonal (estrogen) contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, implants, or injections) because romidepsin injection may stop these medications from working as they should. If you become pregnant while receiving romidepsin injection, call your doctor. Romidepsin injection may harm the fetus.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are receiving romidepsin injection.</li>
