<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Budesonide comes as an aerosol nasal spray to be sprayed in the nose. Budesonide is usually used once or twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use budesonide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Budesonide treats symptoms in your nose; you may need other drugs if you have other allergy symptoms. Do not stop taking budesonide without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not use budesonide if you have recently had a sinus infection, nasal bleeding, or surgery inside your nose.</p>
<p>If you have recently stopped taking a corticosteroid drug by mouth, tell your doctor if you have joint pain, muscle pain, depression, or tiredness. These symptoms may mean that you have too little corticosteroid in your body.</p>
<h3>Before you use budesonide for the first time, read the written directions that come with it. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use the nasal spray, and practice using it in front of them. Follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Blow your nose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the canister by turning the arrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shake the canister well, both before and between sprays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plug one nostril and place the end of the inhaler in the other nostril. Hold your breath and squeeze down on the canister to release the drug into your nose. If your doctor prescribes a second spray, repeat these steps with the inhaler in the other nostril.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close the canister.</p>
</li>
</ol>
