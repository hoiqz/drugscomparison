<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Omacetaxine injection is used to treat adults with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; a type of cancer of the white blood cells) who have already been treated with at least two other medications for CML and can no longer benefit from these medications or cannot take these medications due to side effects. Omacetaxine injection is in a class of medications called protein synthesis inhibitors. It works by slowing the growth of cancer cells. </p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Omacetaxine injection comes as a liquid to be injected under the skin by a healthcare provider in a medical facility. At the beginning of treatment, it is usually given twice a day for the first 14 days of a 28-day cycle. Once your doctor finds that you are responding to omacetaxine injection, it is usually given twice a day for the first 7 days of a 28-day cycle.</p>
<p>Your doctor may delay the start of a treatment cycle or may decrease the number of days that you receive omacetaxine injection during a treatment cycle if you experience serious side effects of the medication or if blood tests show a decrease in the number of blood cells you have. Be sure to talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment.</p>
