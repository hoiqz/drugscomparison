<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Rectal morphine comes as a suppository to insert in the rectum. It is usually inserted every 4 hours. Use rectal morphine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use morphine exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Your doctor may adjust your dose of morphine during your treatment to control your pain as well as possible. If you feel that your pain is not controlled, call your doctor. Do not change the dose of your medication without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Morphine may be habit-forming. Do not use a larger dose, use it more often, or use it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not stop using morphine without talking to your doctor. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop using morphine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety; sweating; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; chills; shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control; nausea; diarrhea; runny nose, sneezing or coughing; hair on your skin standing on end; or hallucinating (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist).</p>
<h3>To use the suppositories, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the wrapper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dip the tip of the suppository in water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest (A left-handed person should lie on the right side and raise the left knee.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using your finger, insert the suppository about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) into the rectum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold it in place with your finger for a few moments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand up after about 15 minutes. Wash your hands thoroughly and resume normal activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
