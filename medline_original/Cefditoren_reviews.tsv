<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Cefditoren is used to treat infections such as community acquired pneumonia (a lung infection that developed in a person who was not in the hospital), flare-ups of chronic bronchitis (infection of the tubes that lead to the lungs), strep throat (sore throat caused by bacteria), tonsillitis (infection of the glands in the back of the throat), and some types of skin infections. Cefditoren is in a class of antibiotics called cephalosporins. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. </p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Cefditoren comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day with the morning and evening meals for 10 to 14 days. To help you remember to take cefditoren, take it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cefditoren exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets with a full glass of water.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during your first few days of treatment with cefditoren. If you do not, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Take cefditoren until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking cefditoren too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely cured and bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>

<h3>Before taking cefditoren,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to cefditoren or any other medications.

Be sure to mention any of the following: antacids (Maalox, Mylanta, Tums, others); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); medications that block stomach acid such as cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid) and ranitidine (Zantac); or probenecid (Probalan).Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had carnitine deficiency (a rare condition in which the body does not have enough of a certain substance that is needed for energy production), or kidney or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking cefditoren, call your doctor.</li>
<li>you should know that cefditoren may cause a serious type of diarrhea during or after your treatment. Call your doctor if you have diarrhea at these times. Do not treat this diarrhea with over the counter medications.</li>
