<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Budesonide is used to treat Crohn's disease (a condition in which the body attacks the lining of the digestive tract, causing pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever). Budesonide is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by decreasing inflammation (swelling) in the digestive tract of people who have Crohn's disease.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Budesonide comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day in the morning. Take budesonide at around the same time every day. Your doctor will tell you how long to take budesonide. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take budesonide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. If you are unable to swallow the capsules whole, talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>Budesonide may help control your symptoms, but it will not cure your condition. Your doctor will watch you carefully to see how well budesonide works for you. If your symptoms are controlled, your doctor may decrease your dose of budesonide. After your symptoms have been controlled for 3 months, your doctor may slowly decrease your dose and then stop treating you with this medication. It is important to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
