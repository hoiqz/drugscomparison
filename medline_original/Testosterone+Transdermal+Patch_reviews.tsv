<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Testosterone transdermal patches are used to treat the symptoms of low testosterone in men whose bodies do not produce enough natural testosterone. Testosterone, a hormone that is usually produced by the body, contributes to the growth, development, and functioning of the male sexual organs and typical male characteristics. Symptoms of low testosterone include decreased sexual desire and ability, extreme tiredness, low energy, depression, and loss of certain male characteristics such as muscular build and deep voice. Testosterone patches work by providing a steady supply of testosterone through the skin to the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Transdermal testosterone comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied each night between 8:00 p.m. and midnight and left in place for 24 hours. Apply testosterone patches at around the same time every evening.Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use testosterone patches exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Choose a spot on your back, stomach, thighs, or upper arms to apply your patch(es). Be sure that the spot you have chosen is not oily, hairy, likely to perspire heavily, over a bone such as a shoulder or hip, or likely to be under pressure from sitting or sleeping. Do not apply to the scrotum or to a skin area with open sores, wounds, or irritation. Also be sure that the patch will stay flat against the skin and will not be pulled, folded, or stretched during normal activity. Choose a different spot each night and wait at least 7 days before applying another patch to a spot you have already used.</p>
<p>Wear your testosterone patch(es) at all times until you are ready to apply the new patch(es). Do not remove your patch(es) before swimming, bathing, showering, or sexual activity.</p>
<p>If a patch becomes loose, smooth it down with your fingers. If a patch falls off before noon, apply a new patch. If a patch falls off after noon, do not apply a new patch until your next scheduled application time that evening.</p>
<p>Testosterone patches may control your condition but will not cure it. I Continue to use testosterone patches even if you feel well. Do not stop using testosterone patches without talking to your doctor. If you stop using testosterone, your symptoms may return.</p>
<h3>To use testosterone patches, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clean and dry the spot where you will apply the patch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tear the foil pouch along the edge and remove the patch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to apply the patch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peel the protective liner and silver disc off the patch and throw them away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the patch on your skin with the sticky side down and press down firmly with your palm for 10 seconds. Be sure the patch is completely stuck to your skin, especially around the edges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are ready to remove the patch, pull it off the skin and throw it away in a trash can that is out of the reach of children and pets. Children and pets can be harmed if they chew on or play with used patches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply a new patch immediately by following steps 1-4.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Before using testosterone patches,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to testosterone or any other medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking. Be sure to mention any of the following: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin) and insulin (Humalin, Humalog, Novolin, others . Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had breast or prostate cancer, and if you have or have ever had a blood disorder, diabetes, or heart, kidney, or liver disease.</li>
<li>you should know that transdermal testosterone is only for use in men. Women should not use this medication, especially if they are or may become pregnant or are breast-feeding. Testosterone may harm the baby.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you will be having a magnetic resonance imaging exam (MRI; a medical test that uses powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body). Your doctor will probably tell you to remove your testosterone patch(es) before you have the exam.</li>
<li>you should know that testosterone patches may be worn during sexual activity. It is very unlikely that your partner will be exposed to more than slight amounts of testosterone. Call a doctor immediately if your female partner develops new or increasing acne, or grows hair in new places on her body.</li>
<li>you should know that your skin may become irritated in the place where you apply the patch(es). If this happens, you may apply a small amount of hydrocortisone cream to the area after removing your patch(es). Only use hydrocortisone cream; do not use an ointment.
