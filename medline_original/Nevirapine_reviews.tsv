<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Nevirapine can cause severe, life-threatening liver damage, skin reactions, and allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease, especially hepatitis B or C. Tell your doctor if you have a rash or other skin condition before you start taking nevirapine. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking nevirapine and call your doctor immediately: rash, especially if it is severe or comes along with any of the other symptoms on this list; excessive tiredness; lack of energy or general weakness; nausea; vomiting; loss of appetite; dark (tea colored) urine; pale stools; yellowing of the skin or eyes; pain in the upper right part of the stomach; fever;sore throat, chills, or other signs of infection; flu-like symptoms; muscle or joint aches; blisters; mouth sores; red or swollen eyes; hives; itching; swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; hoarseness; or difficulty breathing or swallowing.</p>
<p>If your doctor tells you to stop taking nevirapine because you had a serious skin or liver reaction, you should never take nevirapine again.</p>
<p>Your doctor will start you on a low dose of nevirapine and increase your dose after 14 days. This will decrease the risk that you will develop a serious skin reaction. If you develop any type of rash or any of the symptoms listed above while you are taking a low dose of nevirapine, call your doctor right away. Do not increase your dose until your rash or symptoms have gone away.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to nevirapine, especially during the first 18 weeks of your treatment.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with nevirapine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website: <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking nevirapine. There is a greater risk that you will develop serious liver damage during your treatment if you are a woman and if you have a high CD4 count (large number of a certain type of infection fighting cell in your blood).</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Nevirapine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Nevirapine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although nevirapine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Nevirapine comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day for 2 weeks and twice a day after the first 2 weeks. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take nevirapine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow nevirapine with liquids such as water, milk, or soda.</p>
<p>Shake the liquid gently before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use an oral dosing cup or dosing syringe to measure your dose. It is best to use a syringe, especially if your dose is less than 5 mL (1 teaspoon). If you use a dosing cup, first drink all of the medication that you measured in the dosing cup. Then fill the dosing cup with water and drink the water to be sure that you get your full dose.</p>
<p>Nevirapine may control HIV but will not cure it. Continue to take nevirapine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking nevirapine or any of the other medications that you are taking to treat HIV or AIDS without talking to your doctor.Your doctor will probably tell you to stop taking your medications in a certain order. If you miss doses or stop taking nevirapine, your condition may become more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>If you do not take nevirapine for 7 days or longer, do not start taking it again without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will start you on a low dose of nevirapine, and increase your dose after 2 weeks.</p>
