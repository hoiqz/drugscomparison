<p>Medications similar to cilostazol caused an increased risk of death in patients with congestive heart failure (condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the other parts of the body). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had congestive heart failure. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take cilostazol.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking cilostazol.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Cilostazol is used to reduce the symptoms of intermittent claudication (pain in the legs that worsens when walking and improves when resting that is caused by narrowing of the blood vessels that supply blood to the legs). Cilostazol is in a class of medications called platelet-aggregation inhibitors (antiplatelet medications).  It works by improving blood flow to the legs.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Cilostazol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day, at least 30 minutes before or 2 hours after breakfast and dinner. Take cilostazol at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on the prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take cilostazol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Cilostazol controls the symptoms of intermittent claudication but does not cure it. Although you may notice improvements in 2 to 4 weeks, it may take up to 12 weeks before you notice the full benefit (increased walking distance) of cilostazol. Continue taking cilostazol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking cilostazol without talking to your doctor.</p>
