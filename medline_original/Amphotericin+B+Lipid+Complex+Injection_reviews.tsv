<h2>About your treatment</h2>

<p>Your doctor has ordered amphotericin B lipid complex, an antifungal medication, to help treat your fungal infection. It will be added to an intravenous fluid that will drip through a needle or catheter placed in your vein for several hours, once a day.</p>
<p>Amphotericin B lipid complex is used to kill some types of fungus that can cause serious and life-threatening infections. Amphotericin B lipid complex is not effective against bacterial infections or viruses. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
<p>Your health care provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how your infection and symptoms respond to the medication.</p>

<h2>Administering your medication</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Before you administer amphotericin B lipid complex, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or check the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.</p>
<p>It is important that you use your medication exactly as directed. Do not stop your therapy on your own for any reason because your infection could worsen and result in hospitalization. Do not change your dosing schedule without talking to your health care provider. Your health care provider may tell you to stop your infusion if you have a mechanical problem (such as a blockage in the tubing, needle, or catheter); if you have to stop an infusion, call your health care provider immediately so your therapy can continue.</p>
