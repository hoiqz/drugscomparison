The risk that you will develop severe bleeding in the stomach or intestines may be greater if you are taking any of the following medications: anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin (Coumadin); aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs); certain medications to strengthen the bones including alendronate (Fosamax), etidronate (Didronel), ibandronate (Boniva), risedronate (Actonel), and tiludronate (Skelid); or oral steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone.</p>
<p>If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: decreased urination, swelling in the ankles, legs, or feet, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, confusion, yellowing of the skin or eyes, flu-like symptoms, lack of energy, loss of appetite, pain in the upper right part of the stomach, unusual bruising or bleeding, vomit that is bright red or looks like coffee grounds, bright red blood in stools, or black, tarry stools.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order laboratory tests before and during your treatment to be sure it is safe for you to take deferasirox and to see if you are developing these serious side effects.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Deferasirox is used to remove excess iron in the body in people who have received a large number of blood transfusions. Deferasirox is in a class of medications called iron chelators. It works by attaching to iron in the body so that it can be excreted (removed from the body) in feces.</p>
<a name="how">
    </a>
</div>
<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Deferasirox comes as a tablet for suspension (a tablet to dissolve in liquid) to take by mouth. It should be taken on an empty stomach once a day, at least 30 minutes before eating. Take deferasirox at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take deferasirox exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may adjust your dose of deferasirox at least once every 3 to 6 months, depending on the results of your laboratory tests. Your doctor may also decrease your dose, tell you to stop taking deferasirox for a time or tell you to stop taking the medication completely if the amount of iron in your body decreases or if you experience serious side effects.</p>
<p>Always dissolve the tablets in liquid before you take them. Do not chew or swallow the tablets whole.</p>
<h3>To take the tablets for suspension, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are taking less than 1000 mg of deferasirox, fill a cup halfway (about 3.5 oz/100 mL) with water, apple juice, or orange juice. If you are taking more than 1000 mg of deferasirox, fill a cup (about 7 oz/200 mL) with water, apple juice, or orange juice. If you are not sure how much deferasirox you are to take, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the number of tablets your doctor has told you to take in the cup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir the liquid for 3 minutes to completely dissolve the tablets.The mixture may become thick as you stir it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drink the liquid immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a small amount of liquid to the empty cup and stir. Swish the cup to dissolve any medication that is still in the glass or on the stirrer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drink the rest of the liquid.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Deferasirox removes extra iron from your body slowly over time. Continue to take deferasirox as long as it is prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking deferasirox without talking to your doctor.</p>
