<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>This combination of medications comes as eardrops, eye drops, and a topical cream and ointment. The eye drops are usually used every 3 to 4 hours. The eardrops and topical cream and ointment are usually used two to four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use this combination exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not use this medication for more than 10 days. If your infection does not improve within 1 week or if it worsens, call your doctor.</p>
<h3>To instill the eardrops, follow these directions (to make this procedure easier, have someone else instill the drops):

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently clean your ear with a damp facecloth and then dry your ear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warm the drops to near body temperature by holding the container in the palm of your hand for a few minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the drops are a suspension or if the label indicates, shake the bottle well for 10 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw the medication into the dropper, or hold the dropper-top bottle with the dropper tip down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tilt the affected ear up or lie on your side. Pull the ear backward and upward (or if giving to a child younger than 3 years of age, pull backward and downward) to open the ear canal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your ear or anything else; the dropper must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the correct number of drops in your ear. Then gently press on the small skin flap (tragus) over the ear to help the drops to run into the ear canal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep your ear tilted up for 5 minutes or insert a soft cotton plug in your ear, whichever method has been recommended by your pharmacist or doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap or dropper right away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tilt your head backward slightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With your index finger, pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squeeze a 1/4- to 1/2-inch (0.6- to 1.25-centimeter) ribbon of ointment or gel into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blink your eye slowly; then gently close your eye for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a tissue, wipe any excess ointment or gel from the eyelids and lashes. With another clean tissue, wipe the tip of the tube clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap right away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your vision may be blurry for a short amount of time after using the eye ointment. Wait until you can see normally before you drive or do other activities that require good vision.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To use the skin cream, wash the affected skin area thoroughly. Then apply a small amount of cream and rub it in gently. If you use the cream on your face, keep it out of your eyes.</p>
<p>When using the cream, do not bandage or otherwise wrap your skin unless directed by your doctor. Do not apply this medication to other areas of the body unless directed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not apply cosmetics or other skin preparations to the treated skin area without talking with your doctor.</p>
