<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Nasal desmopressin is used to control the symptoms of a certain type of diabetes insipidus ('water diabetes'; condition in which the body produces an abnormally large amount of urine). Nasal desmopressin is also used to control excessive thirst and the passage of an abnormally large amount of urine that may occur after a head injury or after certain types of surgery. One brand of desmopressin nasal spray (Stimate<sup>Â®</sup>) is used to stop bleeding in people who have certain bleeding disorders. Desmopressin is in a class of medications called hormones. It works by replacing vasopressin, a hormone that is normally produced in the body to help balance the amount of water and salt.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Nasal desmopressin comes as a liquid that is administered into the nose through a rhinal tube (thin plastic tube that is placed in the nose to administer medication), and as a nasal spray. It is usually used one to three times a day. If you are using desmopressin nasal spray (Stimate) to treat bleeding problems, your doctor will tell you when you should use the medication. Try to use nasal desmopressin at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nasal desmopressin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you are using desmopressin nasal spray (Stimate) to treat bleeding problems, you will receive your first dose in a doctor's office. Your doctor will order laboratory tests to see if this dose was effective before you begin to use the medication on your own.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of nasal desmopressin and gradually increase your dose. Follow these directions carefully.</p>
<p>After you use nasal desmopressin for 6 months or longer, you may find that the medication does not work as well as it worked at the beginning of your treatment. Call your doctor if this happens.</p>
<p>If you will be using the nasal spray, you should check the manufacturer's information to find out how many sprays your bottle contains. Keep track of the number of sprays you use, not including the priming sprays. Throw away the bottle after you use the stated number of sprays, even if it still contains some medication, because additional sprays might not contain a full dose of medication. Do not try to transfer the leftover medication to another bottle.</p>
<h3>To use the nasal spray, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the protective cap from the bottle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press down on the pump 4 times to prime it before you use the spray bottle for the first time. If you have not used the spray bottle in longer than one week, press down on the pump once to re-prime it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the tip of the spray bottle in your nostril. Hold the bottle at an angle so that the dip tube inside the bottle draws from the deepest portion of the medication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press the spray pump once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your doctor told you to use 2 sprays, repeat steps 3-4, but place the tip of the spray bottle in your other nostril.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the protective cap on the bottle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>To use the rhinal tube, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pull the plastic tag on the neck of the bottle. Break the security seal and remove the plastic cap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twist the small seal off the tip of the dropper. Do not throw away or lose this seal because you will need it to close the bottle between uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the plastic tube in one hand and the top of the dropper in the other. Place the tip of the dropper into the end of the plastic tube that is marked with an arrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squeeze the dropper until the tube is filled up to the mark that matches the dose your doctor prescribed. Remove the tube from the bottle by pulling the bottle quickly downwards while keeping constant pressure on the dropper so that air bubbles will not form in the tube. Talk to your doctor if you have trouble filling the tube to the proper mark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the tube so that your fingertips are about 3/4 inch (about 2 centimeters) from the end of the tube. Place the end of the tube in one nostril and push it in until your fingertips reach the nostril.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the other end of the tube in your mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold your breath. Tilt your head back and blow into the tube with a short strong puff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the tube from your nose and mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the seal on the dropper and replace the plastic cap on the bottle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash the tube with water and shake thoroughly to dry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask your doctor for directions if you will be giving the medication to a baby or young child.</p>
</li>
