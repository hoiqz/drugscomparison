<p>Terbutaline should not be used to stop or prevent premature labor in pregnant women, especially in women who are not in a hospital.

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Terbutaline is used to prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Terbutaline is in a class of medications called beta agonists. It works by relaxing and opening the airways, making it easier to breathe.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Terbutaline comes as a tablet to take by mouth. The tablets are usually taken three times a day, once every six hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take terbutaline exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Each dose of terbutaline should control your symptoms for at least 6 hours after you take it. If you find that your symptoms return before it is time for your next dose, that terbutaline does not control your symptoms as well as it did at the beginning of your treatment, or that your symptoms are getting worse, call your doctor. These may be signs that your condition is worsening.</p>
<p>Terbutaline may control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to use terbutaline even if you feel well. Do not stop taking terbutaline without talking to your doctor.</p>
