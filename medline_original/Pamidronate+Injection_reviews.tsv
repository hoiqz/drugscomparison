<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Pamidronate is used to treat high levels of calcium in the blood that may be caused by certain types of cancer. Pamidronate is also used along with cancer chemotherapy to treat bone damage caused by multiple myeloma (cancer that begins in the plasma cells [a type of white blood cell that produces substances needed to fight infection]) or by breast cancer that has spread to the bones. Pamidronate is also used to treat Paget's disease (a condition in which the bones are soft and weak and may be deformed, painful, or easily broken). Pamidronate injection is in a class of medications called bisphosphonates. It works by slowing bone breakdown, increasing bone density (thickness) and decreasing the amount of calcium released from the bones into the blood.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Pamidronate injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject into a vein slowly, over 2 to 24 hours. It is usually injected by a health care provider in a doctor's office, hospital, or clinic. It may be given once every 3 to 4 weeks, once a day for 3 days in a row, or as a single dose that may be repeated after 1 week or longer. The treatment schedule depends on your condition.</p>
<p>Your doctor may recommend a calcium supplement and a multivitamin containing vitamin D to take during your treatment. You should take these supplements every day as directed by your doctor.</p>
