<p>Hydroxyurea can cause a severe decrease in the number of blood cells in your bone marrow. This may cause certain symptoms and may increase the risk that you will develop a serious infection or bleeding. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fever, sore throat, ongoing cough and congestion, or other signs of infection; unusual bleeding or bruising; bloody or black, tarry stools; bloody vomit; or vomiting blood or brown material that resembles coffee grounds.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests on a regular basis to check your body's response to hydroxyurea and to see if your blood count has dropped. Your doctor may need to change your dose or tell you to stop taking hydroxyurea for a period of time to allow your blood count to return to normal if it has dropped too low.</p>
<p>Hydroxyurea may increase the risk that you will develop other cancers. Talk with your doctor about the risks of taking hydroxyurea.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Hydroxyurea is used to treat a certain type of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; a type of cancer of the white blood cells). It is also used to treat ovarian cancer (cancer that begins in the female reproductive organs where eggs are formed), melanoma (a type of skin cancer), and certain types of head and neck cancer (including cancer of the mouth, cheek, tongue, throat, tonsils, and sinuses). Hydroxyurea is also used to reduce the frequency of painful crises and reduce the need for blood transfusions in patients with sickle cell anemia (an inherited blood disorder in which the red blood cells are abnormally shaped [shaped like a sickle] and cannot bring enough oxygen to all parts of the body). Hydroxyurea is in a class of medications called antimetabolites. Hydroxyurea treats cancer by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body. Hydroxyurea treats sickle cell anemia by helping to prevent formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Hydroxyurea comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. When hydroxyurea is used to treat certain types of cancer, it may be taken once every third day. Take hydroxyurea at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take hydroxyurea exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may need to delay your treatment or adjust your dose of hydroxyurea depending on your response to treatment and any side effects that you may experience. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment. Do not stop taking hydroxyurea without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably tell you to take another medication, folic acid (a vitamin), to decrease some of the side effects of this medication. Take this medication exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>You should wear rubber or latex gloves when you handle the capsules so that your skin does not come into contact with the capsules. Wash your hands before and after you touch the bottle or capsules. If the powder from a capsule spills, wipe it up immediately with a damp disposable towel. Then place the towel in a closed container, such as a plastic bag and throw it away in a trash can that is out of the reach of children and pets.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
