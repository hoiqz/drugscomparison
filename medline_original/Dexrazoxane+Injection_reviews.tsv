<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Dexrazoxane injection is available as 2 different products that are used to treat or prevent certain side effects that may be caused by chemotherapy medications. Dexrazoxane injection (Zinecard) is used to prevent or decrease heart damage caused by doxorubicin (Doxil) in women who are taking the medication to treat breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Dexrazoxane injection (Zinecard) is not used to prevent heart damage in women who are just beginning treatment with doxorubicin; it is only given to women who have been treated with doxorubicin in the past and need continued treatment with doxorubicin. Dexrazoxane injection (Totect) is used to decrease damage to the skin and tissues that may be caused when an anthracycline chemotherapy medication such as daunorubicin (Daunoxome, Cerubidine), doxorubicin (Doxil), epirubicin (Ellence) or idarubicin (Idamycin) leaks out of a vein as it is being injected. Dexrazoxane injection is in classes of medications called cardioprotectants and chemoprotectants. It works by stopping the chemotherapy medications from damaging the heart and the tissues.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Dexrazoxane injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid and injected into a vein by a doctor or nurse in a hospital. When dexrazoxane injection is used to prevent heart damage caused by doxorubicin, it is given just before each dose of doxorubicin. When dexrazoxane injection is used to prevent tissue damage after an anthracycline medication has leaked out of a vein, it is given once a day for 3 days. The first dose is given as soon as possible within the first 6 hours after the leak occurs, and the second and third doses are given about 24 and 48 hours after the first dose.</p>
