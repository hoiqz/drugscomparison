<p>Some people who received rituximab experienced severe reactions to the medication. Some of these people died within 24 hours after they received a dose of rituximab. Most of these deaths happened after the first dose of rituximab. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; a type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells), mantle cell lymphoma (a fast-growing cancer that begins in the cells of the immune system), an irregular heartbeat, or heart or lung disease. If you have any of these conditions, or if you are female, there is a greater chance that you will experience a serious reaction to rituximab. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor or other health care provider immediately: hives; swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing or swallowing; dizziness; fainting; shortness of breath, wheezing; blurred vision; headache; pounding or irregular heartbeat; fast or weak pulse; loss of consciousness, fast breathing; pale or bluish skin; pain in the chest that may spread to other parts of the upper body; weakness; excessive tiredness; sweating; or anxiety.</p>
<p>When rituximab is used to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; a type of cancer that begins in a type of white blood cells that normally fight infection) it may cause a condition called tumor lysis syndrome (TLS; a group of symptoms caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells). TLS may cause kidney failure and the need for dialysis treatment. Tell your doctor if you are also receiving cisplatin (Platinol). If you notice that you need to urinate less often than usual or that you produce less urine than usual, tell your doctor immediately.</p>
<p>Rituximab has caused severe skin reactions. These reactions have caused death. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately: painful sores, ulcers, blisters, rash, or peeling skin.</p>
<p>Some people who received rituximab developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML; a rare infection of the brain that cannot be treated, prevented, or cured and that usually causes death or severe disability) during or after their treatment. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: difficulty thinking clearly or walking, loss of strength, vision problems, or any other unusual symptoms that develop suddenly.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of using rituximab.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Rituximab is used alone or with other medications to treat certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; a type of cancer that begins in a type of white blood cells that normally fights infection). Rituximab is also used with another medication to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function) in people who have already been treated with a certain type of medication called a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. Rituximab is in a class of medications called biologic antineoplastic agents. It treats NHL by causing the death of blood cells that have multiplied abnormally. It treats rheumatoid arthritis by causing the death of certain blood cells that may cause the immune system to attack the joints.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Rituximab comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a vein. Rituximab is administered by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or infusion center. When rituximab is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, it is usually given as 2 doses spaced 2 weeks apart. When rituximab is used to treat NHL it is either given once a week for 4-8 weeks or on the first day of each chemotherapy cycle. Your dosing schedule will depend on the condition that you have, the other medications you are using, and how well your body responds to treatment.</p>
<p>Rituximab must be given slowly. It may take several hours or longer to receive your first dose of rituximab, so you should plan to spend most of the day at the medical office or infusion center. After the first dose, you may receive your medication more quickly, depending on how you respond to treatment.</p>
<p>You may experience symptoms such as fever, shaking chills, tiredness, headache, or nausea while you are receiving a dose of rituximab, especially the first dose. Tell your doctor or other healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms while you are receiving your medication. Your doctor may prescribe other medications to help prevent or relieve these symptoms. Your doctor may tell you to take these medications before you receive each dose of rituximab.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
