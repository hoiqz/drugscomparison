<p>Do not take ambrisentan if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Ambrisentan may harm the fetus. If you are sexually active and able to become pregnant, you should not begin taking ambrisentan until a pregnancy test has shown that you are not pregnant. You must use two reliable methods of birth control during treatment with this medication and for one month after stopping treatment. Do not have unprotected sex. Talk to your doctor about birth control methods that will work for you. Call your doctor immediately if you miss a menstrual period or think you may be pregnant while you are taking ambrisentan.</p>
<p>Because of the risk of birth defects, ambrisentan is available only through a special restricted distribution program. A program called LEAP (Letairis Education and Access Program) has been set up to make sure that all patients have appropriate lab tests before and while they are receiving ambrisentan. All patients, including women who cannot become pregnant and men, can get ambrisentan only if they are registered with LEAP. Your doctor must enroll you in this program. As part of enrolling, your doctor will explain the benefits and risks of taking this medication and the need to have a blood test to check for anemia (low red blood cell count) and pregnancy before you begin treatment. If you are a woman who can become pregnant you must have regular monthly pregnancy tests throughout your treatment with ambrisentan. When you enroll you will choose a certified specialty pharmacy that will ship your medication to you.  Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how you will receive your medication.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests during your treatment with ambrisentan.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with ambrisentan and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking ambrisentan.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ambrisentan is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, high blood pressure in the vessels that carry blood to the lungs). Ambrisentan may improve the ability to exercise and slow the worsening of symptoms in people with PAH. Ambrisentan is in a class of medications called endothelin receptor antagonists. It works by stopping the action of endothelin, a natural substance that causes blood vessels to narrow and prevents normal blood flow in people who have PAH.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ambrisentan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. Take ambrisentan at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ambrisentan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of ambrisentan and gradually increase your dose.</p>
<p>Ambrisentan controls the symptoms of PAH but does not cure it. Continue to take ambrisentan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ambrisentan without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking ambrisentan, your condition may worsen.</p>
