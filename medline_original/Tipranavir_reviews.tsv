You should also tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking vitamin E, other than the amount contained in a regular daily multivitamin. If you need to get emergency medical treatment for any reason, be sure to tell all of the doctors who treat you that you are taking tipranavir. Call your doctor immediately if you experience unusual bruising or bleeding during your treatment with tipranavir.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Tipranavir is used with ritonavir (Norvir) and other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Tipranavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although tipranavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Tipranavir comes as a capsule and an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is taken with ritonavir, usually twice a day, with or without food. Take tipranavir and ritonavir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tipranavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not take tipranavir without ritonavir.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole; do not chew them. If you are unable to swallow the capsules, tell your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>Tipranavir helps to control HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take tipranavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tipranavir without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking tipranavir or skip doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat. When your supply of tipranavir starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read this information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p>

Many other medications may also interact with tipranavir, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list. Be sure to talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you begin taking any new medications during your treatment with tipranavir. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>if you are taking didanosine, take it 2 hours before or 2 hours after you take tipranavir.</li>
<li>if you are taking antacids, take them 1 hour before or 2 hours after you take tipranavir.</li>

<li>you should know that some people with diabetes develop worsening of their diabetes while taking tipranavir. If you have diabetes, it is important to carefully monitor your blood sugar while taking tipranavir and call your doctor if your blood sugar becomes difficult to control. Your doctor may need to change your diabetes medication or prescribe new medication to control your blood sugar.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking tipranavir, call your doctor. Do not breast-feed if you are infected with HIV or are taking tipranavir.</li>
<li>you should know that tipranavir may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, and injections). You will need to use another method of contraception to prevent pregnancy while taking tipranavir.  Talk to your doctor about other ways to prevent pregnancy while you are taking this medication.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking tipranavir.</li>
<li>plan to avoid unnecessary or prolonged exposure to sunlight and to wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Tipranavir may make your skin sensitive to sunlight.</li>
<li>you should know that your body fat may increase or move to different areas of your body such as the back of your neck and upper shoulders ('buffalo hump'), stomach, and breasts. Your body may lose fat from your arms, legs, face, and buttocks. Talk to your doctor if you notice any of these changes in your body fat.</li>
<li>you should know that you may experience hyperglycemia (increases in your blood sugar) while you are taking this medication, even if you do not already have diabetes. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking tipranavir: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, or weakness. It is very important to call your doctor as soon as you have any of these symptoms, because high blood sugar that is not treated can cause a serious condition called ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis may become life-threatening if it is not treated at an early stage. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include: dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, breath that smells fruity, and decreased consciousness.</li>
<li>you should know that while you are taking medications to treat HIV infection, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms at anytime during your treatment with tipranavir, be sure to tell your doctor.</li>
