<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Tafluprost ophthalmic is used to treat glaucoma (a condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision) and ocular hypertension (a condition which causes increased pressure in the eye). Tafluprost is in a class of medications called prostaglandin analogs. It lowers pressure in the eye by increasing the flow of natural eye fluids out of the eye.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Tafluprost comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eye. It is usually instilled in the affected eye(s) once a day in the evening. Use tafluprost at around the same time in the evening every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use tafluprost exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Tafluprost ophthalmic comes in single-use containers. The solution from one container should be used immediately after opening for one or both eyes. Throw away each single-use container and any remaining solution after one use.</p>
<p>Tafluprost controls glaucoma and ocular hypertension but does not cure them. Continue to use tafluprost even if you feel well. Do not stop using tafluprost without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Tafluprost ophthalmic is for use only in the eye(s). Do not swallow tafluprost solution.</p>
<h3>To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the strip of single-use containers from the foil pouch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull off one single-use container from the strip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the remaining strip of single-use containers back in the foil pouch and fold the edge to close the pouch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the single-use container upright. Make sure that the tafluprost solution is in the bottom part of the single-use container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the single-use container by twisting off the tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tilt your head backwards. If you are not able to tilt your head, lie down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the tip of the single-use container close to your eye. Be careful not to touch your eye with the tip of the container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull your lower eyelid downwards and look up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently squeeze the container and let a single drop fall into the space between your lower eyelid and your eye. If the drop misses your eye, try again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throw away the single-use container out of the reach of children even if it is not empty.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

<h3>Before using tafluprost,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to tafluprost, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in tafluprost solution. Ask your pharmacist or check the manufacturer's patient information for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any other eye medications.</li>
<li>If tafluprost is used with other topical eye medications, allow at least 5 minutes between each medication.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have ever had eye surgery, inflammation of the eye or other eye conditions, and if you have or have ever had any other medical problems.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you are able to become pregnant, you should use an effective form of birth control while you are using tafluprost. If you become pregnant while using tafluprost, call your doctor.</li>
<li>if you are having eye surgery, tell the doctor that you are using tafluprost.</li>
<li>Tafluprost may change your eye color to brown or a deeper shade of brown. This color change usually occurs slowly, but it may be permanent. If you use tafluprost in only one eye, you should know that there may be a difference in color between your eyes after using tafluprost. Tafluprost also may cause darkening of the color of the skin around your eyes, an increase in the length, thickness, color, or number of your eyelashes, or fine hair on your eyelids. The eyelash changes and any darkening of the skin around your eyes usually go away when you stop using tafluprost.</li>
