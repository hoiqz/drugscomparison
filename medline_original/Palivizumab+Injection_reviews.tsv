<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Before you administer palivizumab to your child, you will need to mix it up. Your health care provider should show you how to mix and measure the first dose. You will need to use a needle and syringe to draw up 1 mL of sterile water into the syringe. Slowly add the sterile water to the palivizumab vial. Gently swirl the vial (do not shake it) for 30 seconds. You will then need to let the vial sit at room temperature for 20 minutes until the solution becomes clear. After 20 minutes, you are ready to give your child palivizumab. The solution should be clear and free of floating material. Do not use the solution if it is discolored or if it contains particles. Call your health care provider if you are unsure whether you should use the solution.</p>
<p>It is important to use this medicine exactly as directed. Do not stop giving this medicine to your child without talking to your child's health care provider. Do not change the dosing schedule without talking to your child's health care provider.</p>
