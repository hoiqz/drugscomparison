<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Temsirolimus is used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC, a type of cancer that begins in the kidney). Temsirolimus is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that tells the cancer cells to multiply. This may help slow the growth of tumors.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Temsirolimus comes as a solution (liquid) to be given by infusion (slow injection into a vein) over 30 to 60 minutes. It is usually given by a doctor or nurse in a doctor's office or infusion center. Temsirolimus is usually given once every week. </p>
<p>You may experience symptoms such as hives, rash, itching, difficulty breathing or swallowing, swelling of the face, flushing, or chest pain.
