<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Using golimumab injection may decrease your ability to fight infection and increase the risk that you will get a serious infection, including severe fungal, bacterial, or viral infections that spread through the body. These infections may need to be treated in a hospital and may cause death. Tell your doctor if you often get any type of infection or if you think you may have any type of infection now. This includes minor infections (such as open cuts or sores), infections that come and go (such as cold sores) and chronic infections that do not go away. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) , acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or any other condition that affects your immune system. You should also tell your doctor if you live or have ever lived in areas such as the Ohio or Mississippi river valleys where severe fungal infections are more common. Ask your doctor if you are not sure if these infections are common in your area. Tell your doctor if you are taking medications that decrease the activity of the immune system such as the following: abatacept (Orencia); anakinra (Kineret); methotrexate (Rheumatrex); rituximab (Rituxan); steroids including dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), prednisolone (Prelone) and prednisone; tocilizumab (Actemra); and other TNF-blockers such as adalimumab (Humira), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), and infliximab (Remicade).</p>
<p>Your doctor will monitor you for signs of infection during and after your treatment. If you have any of the following symptoms before you begin your treatment or if you experience any of the following symptoms during or shortly after your treatment, call your doctor immediately: weakness; sweating; sore throat; cough; coughing up bloody mucus; fever; weight loss; extreme tiredness; diarrhea; stomach pain; warm, red, or painful skin; sores on the skin; painful, difficult, or frequent urination; or other signs of infection.</p>
<p>You may be infected with tuberculosis (TB, a type of lung infection) or hepatitis B (a type of liver disease) but not have any symptoms of the disease. In this case, golimumab injection may increase the risk that your infection will become more serious and you will develop symptoms. Your doctor will perform a skin test to see if you have an inactive TB infection and may order blood tests to see if you have an inactive hepatitis B infection. If necessary, your doctor will give you medication to treat this infection before you start using golimumab injection. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had TB or hepatitis B, if you have visited any country where TB is common, or if you have been around someone who has TB. If you have any of the following symptoms of TB, or if you develop any of these symptoms during your treatment, call your doctor immediately: cough, weight loss, loss of muscle tone, or fever.. Also call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms of hepatitis B or if you develop any of these symptoms during or after your treatment: excessive tiredness, yellowing of the skin or eyes, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements, fever, chills, stomach pain, or rash.</p>
<p>Some children and teenagers who received golimumab injection and similar medications developed severe or life-threatening cancers including lymphoma (cancer that begins in the cells that fight infection). Children and teenagers should not normally receive golimumab injection, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that golimumab injection is the best medication to treat a child's condition. If golimumab injection is prescribed for your child, you should talk to your child's doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication. If your child develops any of these symptoms during his treatment, call his doctor immediately: unexplained weight loss; swollen glands in the neck, underarms, or groin; or easy bruising or bleeding.|</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with golimumab injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>)or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving golimumab injection.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<h3>Golimumab injection is used alone or with other medications to relieve the symptoms of certain autoimmune disorders (conditions in which the immune system attacks healthy parts of the body and causes pain, swelling, and damage) including:

</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis (condition in which the body attacks its own joints causing pain, swelling, and loss of function),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ankylosing spondylitis (condition in which the body attacks the joints of the spine and other areas causing pain and joint damage),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>psoriatic arthritis (condition that causes joint pain and swelling and scales on the skin).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Golimumab is in a class of medications called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of TNF, a substance in the body that causes inflammation. </p>

<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Golimumab injection comes as a liquid in a prefilled syringe and as a liquid in an auto-injection device to inject under the skin. It is usually injected once every month. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use golimumab injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You will receive your first dose of golimumab injection in your doctor's office. After that, your doctor may allow you to inject golimumab yourself or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Before you use golimumab injection yourself the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it.</p>
<p>Golimumab injection comes in prefilled syringes and auto-injection devices. Use each syringe or device only once and inject all the solution in the syringe or device. Even if there is still some solution left in the syringe or pen after you inject, do not inject again. Dispose of used syringes and devices in a puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes before you are ready to inject golimumab injection, you will need to remove the medication from the refrigerator, take it out of its carton, and allow it to rest on a flat suface so that it can warm to room temperature. Do not try to warm the medication by heating it in a microwave, placing it in hot water, or through any other method.</p>
<p>Do not remove the cap from the auto-injection device or the cover from the prefilled syringe while the medication is warming. You should remove the cap or cover no more than 5 minutes before you inject the medication. Do not replace the cap or cover after you remove it. Do not use the syringe or device if you drop it on the floor while it is uncapped or uncovered.</p>
<p>Never shake the auto-injection device or the prefilled syringe. This may damage the medication.</p>
<p>Always look at golimumab injection before injecting it. Check the expiration date printed on the auto-injection device or carton and do not use the medication if the expiration date has passed. Do not use a prefilled syringe or auto-injection device that appears damaged, and do not use an auto-injection device if the security seal is broken. Look through the viewing window on the prefilled syringe or auto-injection device. The liquid inside should be clear and colorless or slightly yellow, but it may contain some small white particles or an air bubble. Do not use the syringe or device if the medication is cloudy or discolored or contains large particles.</p>
<p>The best place to inject golimumab is the front of the middle thighs. However, you can also inject golimumab in your lower stomach below your navel, except for the 2 inch (5 centimeter) area around the navel. If someone else is giving you the injection, that person can also inject the medication into your upper arms. Choose a different spot to inject the medication every day. Do not inject into an area where your skin is red, bruised, tender, hard or scaly, or where you have scars or stretch marks.</p>
<p>Golimumab injection may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to use golimumab injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using golimumab injection without talking to your doctor.</p>
