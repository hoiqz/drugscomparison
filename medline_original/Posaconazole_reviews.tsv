<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Posaconazole is used to prevent serious fungal infections in people with a weakened ability to fight infection. Posaconazole is also used to treat yeast infections of the mouth and throat including yeast infections that could not be treated successfully with other medications. Posaconazole is in a class of antifungals called triazoles. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Posaconazole comes as a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. Each dose should be taken with a full meal or liquid nutritional supplement. When posaconazole is used to prevent fungal infections, it is usually taken three times a day. When posaconazole is used to treat yeast infections of the mouth and throat, it is usually taken once or twice a day. The length of your treatment depends on your general health, the type of infection you have, and how well you respond to this medication. Take posaconazole at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take posaconazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.</p>
<p>Posaconazole comes with a dosing spoon to measure your dose. The spoon should be rinsed thoroughly with water after each use and before storing.</p>
<p>Continue to take posaconazole until your doctor tells you that you should stop, even if you feel better. Do not stop taking posaconazole without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking posaconazole too soon, your infection may not be completely treated. </p>
