<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution is used to treat bacterial infections of the eye including conjunctivitis (pinkeye; infection of the membrane that covers the outside of the eyeball and the inside of the eyelid) and corneal ulcers (infection and loss of tissue in the clear front part of the eye). Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic ointment is used to treat conjunctivitis. Ciprofloxacin is in a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. It works by killing the bacteria that cause infection.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ophthalmic ciprofloxacin comes as a solution (liquid) and an ointment to apply to the eyes. Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution is usually used often, between once every 15 minutes to once every 4 hours while awake for 7 to 14 days or longer. Ciprofloxacin ophthalmic ointment is usually applied 3 times a day for 2 days and then twice a day for 5 days. Use ophthalmic ciprofloxacin at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ophthalmic ciprofloxacin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You should expect your symptoms to improve during your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not go away or get worse, or if you develop other problems with your eyes during your treatment.</p>
<p>Use ophthalmic ciprofloxacin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ophthalmic ciprofloxacin too soon, your infection may not be completely cured and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>

</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
