<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Bromfenac ophthalmic is used to treat swelling and redness (inflammation) and pain that can occur after cataract surgery. Bromfenac ophthalmic is in a class of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It works by stopping the release of certain natural substances that cause pain and swelling.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Bromfenac ophthalmic comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes. It is usually instilled in the affected eye(s) once a day beginning one day before cataract surgery, on the day of the surgery, and for 14 days after the surgery. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use bromfenac ophthalmic exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<h3>To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
