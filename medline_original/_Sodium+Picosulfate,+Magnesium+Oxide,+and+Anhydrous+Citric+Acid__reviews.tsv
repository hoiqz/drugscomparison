<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid combination powder is used to empty the colon (large intestine, bowel) before a colonoscopy (examination of the inside of the colon to check for colon cancer and other abnormalities) so that the doctor will have a clear view of the walls of the colon. Sodium picosulfate is in a class of medications called stimulant laxatives. Magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid combine when the powder is mixed with water to form a medication called magnesium citrate. Magnesium citrate is in a class of medications called osmotic laxatives. These medications work by causing watery diarrhea so that the stool can be emptied from the colon.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid combination comes as a powder to take by mouth. It is generally taken as two doses in preparation for a colonoscopy. It is usually taken as a split-dose regimen with the first dose taken the night before the colonoscopy and the second dose taken the morning of the procedure. The medication may also be taken as a day-before regimen with the first dose taken the late afternoon or early evening before the colonoscopy and the second dose taken 6 hours later. Your doctor will tell you exactly when you should take your medication. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid combination exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>To prepare for your colonoscopy, you may not eat any solid food or drink milk beginning the day before the procedure. You should only drink clear liquids during this time. Clear liquids are liquids that can be seen through, such as water, light colored fruit juice without pulp, clear broth, coffee or tea without milk, flavored gelatin, popsicles and soft drinks. Do not drink alcoholic beverages or any liquid that is red or purple. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about which liquids you may drink before your colonoscopy.</p>
<p>You will need to mix the medication powder with cold water right before you take it. If you swallow the powder without mixing it with water, there is a greater chance that you will experience unpleasant or dangerous side effects. To prepare each dose of your medication, fill the dosing cup that was provided with the medication with cold water up to the lower line (5 ounces, 150 mL) that is marked on the cup. Pour in the contents of one packet of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid powder and stir for 2-3 minutes to dissolve the powder. The mixture may become slightly warm as the powder dissolves. Drink the entire mixture right away. Mix the medication with water only when you are ready to take it; do not prepare the mixture in advance.</p>
<p>If you are following the split-dose regimen, you will take your first dose between 5:00-9:00 p.m. on the night before your colonoscopy. After you take this dose, you will need to drink five 8- ounce (240 mL) drinks of clear liquid within the next 5 hours before you go to bed. You will take your second dose the next morning, about 5 hours before your colonoscopy is scheduled. After you take the second dose, you will need to drink three 8-ounce drinks of clear liquid within the next 5 hours, but you should finish all the drinks at least 2 hours before your colonoscopy.</p>
<p>If you are following the day-before regimen, you will take your first dose between 4:00-6:00 p.m. on the evening before your colonoscopy. After you take this dose, you will need to drink five 8-ounce drinks of clear liquid within 5 hours. You will take your next dose 6 hours later, between 10:00 pm-12:00 a.m. After you take the second dose, you will need to drink three 8-ounce drinks of clear liquid within 5 hours.</p>
<p>It is very important that you drink the required amounts of clear liquid during your treatment to replace the fluid that you will lose as your colon is emptied. You can use the dosing cup provided with your medication to measure your 8-ounce portions of liquid by filling the cup to the top line. You may find it easier to drink the full amount of liquid if you choose a variety of different clear liquid drinks.</p>
<p>You will have many bowel movements during your treatment with sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid combination. Be sure to stay close to a toilet from the time you take your first dose of the medication until the time of your colonoscopy appointment. Ask your doctor about other things you can do to stay comfortable during this time.</p>
<p>If you experience severe bloating or stomach pain after you take the first dose of this medication, wait until these symptoms go away before you take the second dose.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
