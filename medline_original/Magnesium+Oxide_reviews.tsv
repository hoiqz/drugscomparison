<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Magnesium is an element your body needs to function normally. Magnesium oxide may be used for different reasons. Some people use it as an antacid to relieve heartburn, sour stomach, or acid indigestion. Magnesium oxide also may be used as a laxative for short-term, rapid emptying of the bowel (before surgery, for example). It should not be used repeatedly. Magnesium oxide also is used as a dietary supplement when the amount of magnesium in the diet is not enough. Magnesium oxide is available without a prescription.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Magnesium oxide comes as a tablet and capsule to take by mouth. It usually is taken one to four times daily depending on which brand is used and what condition you have. Follow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take magnesium oxide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Take any other medicine and magnesium oxide at least 2 hours apart.</p>
<p>If you are using magnesium oxide as a laxative, take it with a full glass (8 ounces [240 milliliters]) of cold water or fruit juice. Do not take a dose late in the day on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Do not take magnesium oxide as an antacid for longer than 2 weeks unless your doctor tells you to. Do not take magnesium oxide as a laxative for more than 1 week unless your doctor tells you to.</p>
