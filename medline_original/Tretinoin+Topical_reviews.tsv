<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Tretinoin is used to treat acne. It promotes peeling of affected skin areas and unclogs pores. Tretinoin controls acne but does not cure it.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Tretinoin comes in topical liquid, cream, and gel. Tretinoin usually is used daily at bedtime or once every 2 or 3 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use tretinoin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your acne probably will get worse (red, scaling skin and an increase in acne sores) during the first 7-10 days that you use this medication. Nevertheless, continue to use it; the acne sores should disappear. Usually 2-3 weeks (and sometimes more than 6 weeks) of regular use of tretinoin is required before improvement is seen.</p>
<p>Use only nonmedicated cosmetics on cleansed skin. Do not use topical preparations with a lot of alcohol, menthol, spices, or lime (e.g., shaving lotions, astringents, and perfumes); they can sting your skin, especially when you first use tretinoin.</p>
<p>Do not use any other topical medications, especially benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid (wart remover), and dandruff shampoos containing sulfur or resorcinol unless your doctor directs you to do so. If you have used any of these topical medications recently, ask your doctor if you should wait before using tretinoin.</p>
<h3>If you are to apply any form of tretinoin, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands and affected skin area thoroughly with mild, bland soap (not medicated or abrasive soap or soap that dries the skin) and water. To be sure that your skin is thoroughly dry, wait 20-30 minutes before applying tretinoin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use clean fingertips, a gauze pad, or a cotton swab to apply the medication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use enough medication to cover the affected area lightly. Do not oversaturate the gauze pad or cotton swab.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Apply the medication to the affected skin area only (e.g., skin with acne sores).</p>
