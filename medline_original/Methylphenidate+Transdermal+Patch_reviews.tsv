<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Methylphenidate can be habit-forming. Do not apply more patches, apply the patches more often, or leave the patches on for longer than prescribed by your doctor. If you use too much methylphenidate, you may find that the medication no longer controls your symptoms, you may feel a need to use large amounts of the medication, and you may experience unusual changes in your behavior. Tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications.</p>
<p>Do not stop using methylphenidate transdermal patches without talking to your doctor, especially if you have overused the medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually and monitor you carefully during this time. You may develop severe depression if you suddenly stop using methylphenidate transdermal patches after overusing the medication. Your doctor may need to monitor you carefully after you stop using methylphenidate transdermal patches, even if you have not overused the medication, because your symptoms may worsen when treatment is stopped.</p>
<p>Do not sell, give away, or let anyone else use your methylphenidate transdermal patches. Selling or giving away methylphenidate transdermal patches may harm others and is against the law. Store methylphenidate transdermal patches in a safe place so no one else can use them accidentally or on purpose. Keep track of how many patches are left so you will know if any are missing.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with methylphenidate transdermal patches and each time you get more medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Methylphenidate transdermal patches are used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age). Methylphenidate is in a class of medications called central nervous system stimulants. It works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain.</p>
<a name="how">
    </a>
</div>
<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Transdermal methylphenidate comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day in the morning and left in place for up to 9 hours. Apply the methylphenidate patch at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use methylphenidate patches exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of methylphenidate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every week.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to stop using methylphenidate patches from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.</p>
<p>Apply the patch to the hip area. Do not apply the patch to an open wound or cut, to skin that is irritated, red, or swollen, or to skin that is affected by a rash or other skin problem. Do not apply to the patch to the waistline because it may be rubbed off by tight clothing. Do not apply a patch to the same spot two days in a row; each morning apply the patch to the hip that did not have a patch the day before.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate patches should remain attached during normal daily activities, including swimming, showering, and bathing. If a patch does fall off, ask your child how and when this happened. When you notice that a patch has fallen off, you may apply a new patch to a different area of the same hip. However, you should remove the new patch at the time that you were scheduled to remove the original patch.</p>
<p>While you are wearing the patch, keep that hip away from direct sources of heat such as heating pads, electric blankets, and heated waterbeds.</p>
<h3>To apply the patch, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Talk to your doctor about what time you should apply the patch. You should apply the patch 2 hours before the effects of the medication are needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash and dry the skin in the area where you plan to apply the patch. Be sure that the skin is free of powders, oils, and lotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the tray that contains the patches and throw away the drying agent that comes in the tray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove one pouch from the tray and cut it open with scissors. Be careful not to cut the patch. Never use a patch that has been cut or damaged in any way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the patch from the pouch and hold it with the protective liner facing you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peel off half of the liner. Be careful not to touch the sticky side of the patch with your fingers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the other half of the liner as a handle and apply the patch to the skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press the patch firmly in place and smooth it down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the sticky half of the patch down with one hand. Use the other hand to pull back the other half of the patch and gently peel off the remaining piece of the protective liner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the palm of your hand to press the entire patch firmly in place for about 30 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go around the edges of the patch with your fingers to press them onto the skin. Be sure that the entire patch is firmly attached to the skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throw away the empty pouch and the protective liner in a closed trash can that is out of reach of children and pets. Do not flush the pouch or liner down the toilet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands after you handle the patch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record the time that you applied the patch on the administration chart that comes with the patches. Use the timetable in the patient information that comes with the patches to find the time that the patch should be removed. Do not follow these times if your doctor has told you to use the patch for less than 9 hours. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully and ask your doctor if you do not know when you should remove the patch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When it is time to remove the patch, use your fingers to peel it off slowly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fold the patch in half with the sticky sides together and press firmly to seal it shut. Flush the patch down the toilet or throw it away in a closed trash can that is out of the reach of children and pets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is any adhesive left on the skin, gently rub the area with oil or lotion to remove it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record the time that you removed the patch and the way that you threw it away on the administration chart.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
