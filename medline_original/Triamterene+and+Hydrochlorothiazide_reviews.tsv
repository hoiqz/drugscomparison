<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>The combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure and edema (fluid retention; excess fluid held in body tissues) in patients who have lower amounts of potassium in their bodies or for whom low potassium levels in the body could be dangerous. The combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It causes the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and sodium from the body into the urine, but reduces the loss of potassium.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>The combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide comes as a capsule and tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day. It is best to take this medication earlier in the day so that frequent trips to the bathroom do not interfere with nighttime sleep. Take triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>This medication controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide without talking to your doctor.</p>

<h3>Before taking triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to triamterene, hydrochlorothiazide, sulfonamide-derived medications ('sulfa drugs'), or any other medications.</li>
<li>do not take triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide if you are taking amiloride (Midamor), spironolactone (Aldactone), or other medications containing triamterene.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention amphotericin B (Amphocin, Fungizone); angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), perindopril, (Aceon), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace), and trandolapril (Mavik); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); barbiturates (phenobarbital); digoxin (Lanoxin); laxatives; lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid); medications for diabetes, gout, or high blood pressure; methenamine (Hiprex, Urex); narcotic pain relievers; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Deltasone); and potassium supplements. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney stones, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, a chronic inflammatory condition), diabetes, gout, or thyroid, heart, kidney, or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Do not breastfeed if you are taking triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide. If you become pregnant while taking triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide, call your doctor.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide.</li>
<li>plan to avoid unnecessary or prolonged exposure to sunlight and to wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may make your skin sensitive to sunlight.</li>
<li>You should know that triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide and may be made worse by drinking alcohol. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.</li>
