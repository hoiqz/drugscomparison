<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Enfuvirtide is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Enfuvirtide is in a class of medications called HIV entry and fusion inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although enfuvirtide does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Enfuvirtide comes as a powder to be mixed with sterile water and injected subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected twice a day. To help you remember to inject enfuvirtide, inject it at about the same times each day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use enfuvirtide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Enfuvirtide controls HIV but does not cure it. Continue to use enfuvirtide even if you feel well. Do not stop using enfuvirtide without talking to your doctor. If you miss doses or stop using enfuvirtide, your condition may become more difficult to treat.When your supply of enfuvirtide starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>You will receive your first dose of enfuvirtide in your doctor's office. After that, you can inject enfuvirtide yourself or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Your doctor will train the person who will be injecting the medication, and will test him to be sure he can give the injection correctly. Be sure that you and the person who will be giving the injections read the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with enfuvirtide before you use it for the first time at home.</p>
<p>You can inject enfuvirtide anywhere on the front of your thighs, your stomach, or upper arms. Do not inject enfuvirtide in or near your navel (belly button) or in any area directly under a belt or waistband; near the elbow, knee, groin, the lower or inner buttocks; or directly over a blood vessel. To reduce the chances of soreness, choose a different area for each injection. Keep track of the areas where you inject enfuvirtide, and do not give an injection into the same area two times in a row. Use your fingertips to check your chosen area for hard bumps under the skin. Never inject enfuvirtide into any skin that has a tattoo, scar, bruise, mole, a burn site, or has had a reaction to a previous injection of enfuvirtide.</p>
<p>Never reuse needles, syringes, vials of enfuvirtide, or vials of sterile water. Dispose of used needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Do not put them in a trash can. You can dispose of used alcohol pads and vials in the trash, but if you see blood on an alcohol pad, put it in the puncture-resistant container. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.</p>
<p>Before preparing an enfuvirtide dose, wash your hands with soap and water. After you wash your hands, do not touch anything except the medication, supplies, and the area where you will inject the medication.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's injection information for the patient. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions to learn how to prepare and inject your dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about how to inject enfuvirtide.</p>
