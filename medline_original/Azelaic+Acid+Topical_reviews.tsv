<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Azelaic acid gel is used to clear the bumps, lesions, and swelling caused by rosacea (a skin disease that causes redness, flushing, and pimples on the face). Azelaic acid cream is used to treat acne. Azelaic acid is in a class of medications called dicarboxylic acids. It works to treat acne by killing the bacteria that infect pores and by decreasing production of keratin, a natural substance that can lead to the development of acne. The way azelaic acid works to treat rosacea is not known.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Azelaic acid comes as a gel and a cream to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice a day, in the morning and the evening. To help you remember to use azelaic acid, use it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use azelaic acid exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Azelaic acid controls acne and rosacea but does not cure these conditions. It may take 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of azelaic acid. Continue to use azelaic acid exactly as directed even if you do not notice much improvement at first.</p>
<h3>To use the cream or gel, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash the affected skin with water and a mild soap or soapless cleansing lotion and pat dry with a soft towel. Ask your doctor to recommend a cleanser, and avoid alcoholic cleansers, tinctures, abrasives, astringents, and peeling agents, especially if you have rosacea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply a thin layer of cream or gel to the affected skin. Gently and thoroughly massage it into the skin. Be careful not to get the medication in your eyes or mouth. If you do get azelaic acid in your eyes, wash with plenty of water and call your doctor if your eyes are irritated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not cover the affected area with any bandages, dressings,or wrappings. You may apply non-irritating make up over the medication after it is dry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands with soap and water after you finish handling the medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
