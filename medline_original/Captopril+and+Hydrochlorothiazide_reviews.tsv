<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>The combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. Captopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly. Hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>The combination of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day on an empty stomach, 1 hour before meals. To help you remember to take captopril and hydrochlorothiazide, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take captopril and hydrochlorothiazide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 6 to 8 weeks.</p>
<p>Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take captopril and hydrochlorothiazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking captopril and hydrochlorothiazide without talking to your doctor.</p>

<h3>Before taking captopril and hydrochlorothiazide,</h3>
<ul>

Be sure to mention any of the following: amphotericin B (Fungizone); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as indomethacin (Indocin); calcium supplements; cancer chemotherapy drugs; cholestyramine (Questran); colestipol (Colestid); digoxin (Lanoxin); insulin or oral medications for diabetes; lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid); medications for gout such as probenecid (Benemid) and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane); medications that suppress the immune system; methenamine (Mandelamine, Hiprex); monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, including phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate); nitrates such as isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, ISMO, Monoket), and nitroglycerin (Nitrogard, Nitrolingual, Nitrostat, others); oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Deltasone); other diuretics; other medications for high blood pressure; pain medications; phenobarbital (Luminal, Solfoton); and potassium supplements. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lupus; scleroderma; heart failure; diabetes; allergy; asthma; or liver or kidney disease.</li>
