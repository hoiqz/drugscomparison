<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Bortezomib comes as a solution (liquid) to inject into a vein. Bortezomib is given by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or clinic. It is usually given on a rotating schedule that alternates 2 weeks when bortezomib is given twice a week with 10 days when the medication is not given. During the weeks that bortezomib is given, doses will always be at least 72 hours apart. The rotating schedule may be followed for up to eight cycles. After that, your doctor may decide to continue your treatment, but you will receive bortezomib less often.</p>
<p>Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment. Your doctor may stop your treatment for a while or decrease your dose of bortezomib if you experience side effects of the medication.</p>
