<p>Paclitaxel injection must be given in a hospital or medical facility under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in giving chemotherapy medications for cancer.</p>
<p>Paclitaxel injection may cause a large decrease in the number of white blood cells (a type of blood cell that is needed to fight infection) in your blood. This increases the risk that you will develop a serious infection. You should not receive paclitaxel if you already have a low number of white blood cells. Your doctor will order laboratory tests before and during your treatment to check the number of white blood cells in your blood. Your doctor will delay or interrupt your treatment if the number of white blood cells is too low. Call your doctor immediately if you develop a temperature greater than 100.4 °F (38 °C); a sore throat; cough; chills; difficult, frequent, or painful urination; or other signs of infection during your treatment with paclitaxel injection.</p>
<p>Paclitaxel injection is manufactured with additional ingredients to allow the medication to reach parts of the body where it is needed. One form of paclitaxel injection (Abraxane) is manufactured with human albumin, and the other form of paclitaxel injection (Onxol, Taxol) is manufactured with a solvent called polyoxyethylated castor oil. There are important differences between the two forms of paclitaxel, so these products should not be substituted for each other.</p>
<p>If you are using the form of paclitaxel injection that is manufactured with polyoxyethylated castor oil, you may experience a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction. You will receive certain medications to help prevent an allergic reaction before you receive each dose of paclitaxel. Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms of an allergic reaction: rash; hives; itching; swelling of the eyes, face, throat, lips, tongue, hands, arms, feet, or ankles; difficulty breathing or swallowing; flushing; fast heartbeat; dizziness; or fainting.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to paclitaxel injection.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving paclitaxel injection.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Paclitaxel injection manufactured with human albumin is used to treat breast cancer that has not improved or that has come back after treatment with other medications. Paclitaxel injection manufactured with polyoxyethylated castor oil is used to treat ovarian cancer (cancer that begins in the female reproductive organs where eggs are formed), breast cancer, and lung cancer. Paclitaxel injection with polyoxyethylated castor oil is also used to treat Kaposi's sarcoma (a type of cancer that causes patches of abnormal tissue to grow under the skin) in people who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It works by stopping the growth and spread of cancer cells.</p>
