<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Temazepam comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken as needed at bedtime. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take temazepam exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You will probably become very sleepy soon after you take temazepam and will remain sleepy for some time after you take the medication. Plan to go to bed right after you take temazepam and to stay in bed for 7 to 8 hours. Do not take temazepam if you will be unable to remain asleep for 7 to 8 hours after taking the medication. If you get up too soon after taking temazepam, you may experience memory problems.</p>
<p>Your sleep problems should improve within 7 to 10 days after you start taking temazepam. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time, if they get worse at any time during your treatment, or if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behavior.</p>
<p>If your doctor has told you to take temazepam regularly, talk to your doctor before you stop taking this medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking temazepam, you may feel depressed or have more difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, or you may experience more severe withdrawal symptoms such as uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, stomach and muscle cramp s, vomiting, sweating, and rarely, seizures.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with temazepam and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<h2>What special precautions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before taking temazepam,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to temazepam, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in temazepam capsules. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: antidepressants; antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl); digoxin (Lanoxin); and medications for anxiety, mental illness, seizures, or pain; sedatives; other sleeping pills; and tranquilizers. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications. Also tell your doctor if you have ever thought about killing yourself or tried to do so, and if you have or have ever had any condition that affects your breathing; depression; mental illness; seizures or kidney or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking temazepam, call your doctor immediately.</li>
<geriatric-precaut>
<p>talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking temazepam if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should usually take lower doses of temazepam because higher doses may not be more effective and are more likely to cause serious side effects.</p>
</geriatric-precaut>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking temazepam.</li>
<li>you should know that this medication may make you drowsy during the daytime. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.</li>
<li>do not drink alcohol during your treatment with temazepam. Alcohol can make the side effects of temazepam worse.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you use tobacco products. Cigarette smoking may decrease the effectiveness of this medication.</li>
<li>you should know that some people who took medications for sleep got out of bed and drove their cars, prepared and ate food, had sex, made phone calls, or were involved in other activities while partially asleep. After they woke up, these people were usually unable to remember what they had done. Call your doctor right away if you find out that you have been driving or doing anything else while you were sleeping.</li>
<li>you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways while you are taking this medication. It is hard to tell if these changes are caused by temazepam or if they are caused by physical or mental illnesses that you already have or suddenly develop. Tell your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: aggressiveness, strange or unusually outgoing behavior, hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist), feeling as if you are outside of your body, memory problems, difficulty concentrating, new or worsening depression, thinking about killing yourself, confusion, and any other changes in your usual thoughts, mood, or behavior. Be sure that your family knows which symptoms may be serious so that they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.</li>
