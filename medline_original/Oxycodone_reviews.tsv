<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Oxycodone extended-release (long-acting) tablets should be used only to treat people who need regularly scheduled doses of pain medication to treat continuous pain for an extended period of time. Extended-release oxycodone tablets should not be taken as-needed or to treat occasional episodes of pain.</p>
<p>Oxycodone 60-mg tablets and oxycodone 160-mg tablets (not available in the United States) should only be used to treat people who are tolerant (used to the effects of a medication) to narcotic pain medication. These tablet strengths may cause serious breathing problems or death in people who are not tolerant to narcotics.</p>
<p>Swallow oxycodone extended-release tablets whole; do not chew, break, divide, crush, or dissolve them. If you swallow broken, chewed, or crushed extended-release tablets, you will receive the entire dose of oxycodone at once, instead of slowly over 12 hours. This may cause serious problems, including overdose and death.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking oxycodone.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Oxycodone is used to relieve moderate to severe pain. Oxycodone is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics. It works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain.</p>
<p>Oxycodone is also available in combination with acetaminophen (Endocet, Percocet, Roxicet, Tylox, others); aspirin (Endodan, Percodan, Roxiprin, others); and ibuprofen (Combunox). This monograph only includes information about the use of oxycodone alone. If you are taking an oxycodone combination product, be sure to read information about all the ingredients in the product you are taking and ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Oxycodone comes as a solution (liquid), concentrate solution, tablet, capsule, and extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The solution, concentrated solution, tablet, and capsule are usually taken with or without food every 4 to 6 hours, either as needed for pain or as regularly scheduled medications. The extended-release tablet are usually taken every 12 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take oxycodone exactly as directed.</p>
<p>If you are taking the oxycodone concentrate solution, be sure to carefully measure and double check the dose before taking the medication. Use the measuring dropper that comes with the medication to measure your dose. Mix the medication with at least 1 ounce (30 milliliters) of juice or other liquid, or with a semi-solid food such as applesauce or pudding. If you are taking oxycodone concentrate solution from an ampoule (small pre-packaged tube containing oxycodone liquid), be sure to follow your doctor's instructions for taking a dose. Ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about measuring your dose or taking your medication.</p>
<p>Your doctor will likely start you on a low dose of oxycodone and may increase this dose over time if your pain is not controlled. After you take oxycodone for a period of time, your body may become used to the medication. If this happens, your doctor may need to increase your dose to control your pain. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with oxycodone.</p>
<p>Oxycodone can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. If you have been taking oxycodone for more than a few days, do not stop taking oxycodone suddenly. If you stop taking this medication suddenly, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, yawning, sweating, chills, muscle or joint aches or pains, weakness, irritability, anxiety, depression, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, fast heartbeat, and fast breathing. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. Call your doctor if you have any withdrawal symptoms when your dose is decreased or when you stop taking oxycodone.</p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
