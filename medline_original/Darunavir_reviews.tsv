<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Darunavir is used with ritonavir (Norvir) and other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults and children 3 years of age and older. Darunavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although darunavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Darunavir comes as a tablet and oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food and with ritonavir once or twice a day. Take darunavir at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take darunavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not take darunavir without ritonavir.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole with a drink such as water or milk. Do not chew the tablets.</p>
<p>Shake the suspension well right before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the oral dosing syringe that came with the medication to withdraw the right amount of suspension from the bottle. You can swallow the suspension straight from the syringe. Wash the syringe with water and allow it to dry thoroughly after use.</p>
<p>Darunavir controls HIV but does not cure it. Continue to take darunavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking darunavir without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking darunavir or skip doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat. When your supply of darunavir starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

Many other medications may also interact with darunavir, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>if you are taking didanosine (Videx), take it 1 hour before or 2 hours after you take darunavir.</li>
<li>tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort. You should not take St. John's wort during your treatment with darunavir.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes or high blood sugar; hemophilia (bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly); hepatitis (swelling of the liver caused by a virus), cirrhosis (a disease which causes scarring of liver tissue), or any other liver disease; or an infection that does not go away or that comes and goes such as cytomegalovirus (CMV; a viral infection that may cause symptoms in patients with weak immune systems), mycobacterium avium complex disease (MAC; a bacterial infection that may cause serious symptoms in people with AIDS), pneumonia, or tuberculosis (TB; a type of lung infection).</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking darunavir, call your doctor. Do not breast-feed if you are infected with HIV or are taking darunavir.</li>
<li>you should know that darunavir may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, injections, or implants). Talk to your doctor about other ways to prevent pregnancy while you are taking this medication.</li>
<li>you should know that your body fat may increase or move to different areas of your body such as your breasts, upper back, neck, chest, and stomach area. Loss of fat from the legs, arms, and face can also happen.</li>
<li>you should know that you may experience hyperglycemia (increases in your blood sugar) while you are taking this medication, even if you do not already have diabetes. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking darunavir: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, or weakness. It is very important to call your doctor as soon as you have any of these symptoms, because high blood sugar that is not treated can cause a serious condition called ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis may become life-threatening if it is not treated at an early stage. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include: dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, breath that smells fruity, and decreased consciousness.</li>
<li>you should know that while you are taking medications to treat HIV infection, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms at anytime during your treatment with darunavir, be sure to tell your doctor.</li>
