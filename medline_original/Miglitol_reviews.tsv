<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Miglitol is used, alone or with other drugs, to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood), particularly in people whose diabetes cannot be controlled by diet alone. It slows the breakdown and absorption of table sugar and other complex sugars in the small intestine. This process results in decreased blood sugar (hypoglycemia) levels following meals.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Miglitol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day with the first bite of a meal. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take miglitol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>

<h3>Before taking miglitol,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to miglitol or any other drugs.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially other medications for diabetes, digestive enzymes (Viokase, Pancrease, or Ultrase), digoxin (Lanoxin), propranolol (Inderal), ranitidine (Zantac), and vitamins.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a chronic intestinal disease, inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal obstruction, or kidney disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking miglitol, call your doctor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What special dietary instructions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Miglitol is used in combination with proper diet and exercise to control blood sugar. Skipping or delaying meals or exercising more than usual may cause your blood sugar to fall too low (hypoglycemia). Maintaining the diet and exercise program suggested by your doctor will ensure that the drug works properly.</p>
<p>Alcohol may cause a decrease in blood sugar. Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking miglitol.</p>

<h2>What should I do if I forget a dose?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. Remember that miglitol should only be taken with a meal. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.</p>

<h2>What side effects can this medication cause?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>When used in combination with insulin or other medications used to treat diabetes, miglitol may cause excessive lowering of blood sugar levels.</p>
<h3>If you have any of the following symptoms, glucose products (Insta-Glucose or B-D Glucose tablets) should be used and you should call your doctor. Because miglitol blocks the breakdown of table sugar and other complex sugars, fruit juice or other products containing these sugars will not help to increase blood sugar. It is important that you and other members of your household understand this difference between miglitol and other medications used to treat diabetes.
