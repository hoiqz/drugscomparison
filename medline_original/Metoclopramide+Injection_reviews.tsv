<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Receiving metoclopramide injection may cause you to develop a muscle problem called tardive dyskinesia. If you develop tardive dyskinesia, you will move your muscles, especially the muscles in your face in unusual ways. You will not be able to control or stop these movements. Tardive dyskinesia may not go away even after you stop receiving metoclopramide injection. The longer you receive metoclopramide injection , the greater the risk that you will develop tardive dyskinesia. Therefore, your doctor will probably tell you not to receive metoclopramide injection for longer than 12 weeks. The risk that you will develop tardive dyskinesia is also greater if you are taking medications for mental illness, if you have diabetes, or if you are elderly, especially if you are a woman. Call your doctor immediately if you develop any uncontrollable body movements, especially lip smacking, mouth puckering, chewing, frowning, scowling, sticking out your tongue, blinking, eye movements, or shaking arms or legs.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with metoclopramide injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risk of receiving metoclopramide injection.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Metoclopramide injection is used to relieve symptoms caused by slow stomach emptying in people who have diabetes. These symptoms include nausea, vomiting, heartburn, loss of appetite, and feeling of fullness that lasts long after meals. Metoclopramide injection is also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy or that may occur after surgery. Metoclopramide injection is also sometimes used to empty the intestines during certain medical procedures. Metoclopramide injection is in a class of medications called prokinetic agents. It works by speeding the movement of food through the stomach and intestines.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Metoclopramide injection comes as a liquid to be injected into a muscle or into a vein. When metoclopramide injection is used to treat slowed stomach emptying due to diabetes, it may be given up to four times a day. When metoclopramide injection is used to prevent nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, it is usually given 30 minutes before the chemotherapy, then once every 2 hours for two doses, then once every 3 hours for three doses. Metoclopramide injection is also sometimes given during surgery. If you are injecting metoclopramide injection at home, inject it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use metoclopramide injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
