<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Lisinopril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It is used in combination with other medications to treat heart failure. Lisinopril is also used to improve survival after a heart attack. Lisinopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly and the heart can pump blood more efficiently.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Lisinopril comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take lisinopril, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lisinopril exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of lisinopril and gradually increase your dose.</p>
<p>Lisinopril controls high blood pressure and heart failure but does not cure them. Continue to take lisinopril even if you feel well. Do not stop taking lisinopril without talking to your doctor.</p>
