<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Naloxone injection is used to prevent or reverse the effects of opiate (narcotic) overdose, including difficulty breathing, sleepiness, low blood pressure, and death. Naloxone injection is also used after surgery to reverse the effects of opiates given during surgery. Naloxone injection is given to newborns to decrease the effects of opiates received by the pregnant mother prior to delivery. Naloxone injection is also used to diagnose a suspected opiate overdose and to increase low blood pressure associated with septic shock (life-threatening infection). Naloxone injection is in a class of medications called opiate antagonists. It works by blocking the central nervous system effects of several types of opiate medications such as morphine, oxycodone, methadone or illegal substances such as heroin.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Naloxone injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject intravenously (into a vein), intramuscularly (into a muscle), or subcutaneously (just under the skin). Naloxone injection may also sometimes be given intranasally (sprayed into the nose) using a special nasal spray device. It is usually given by intravenous injection for emergencies and to infants and children. Naloxone injection is usually injected as needed by healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Some community overdose prevention programs provide emergency opiate overdose education and a take-home supply of naloxone for people who may abuse opiate medications and their family members, friends, or caregivers to use in case of an opiate overdose. If you, your family, a friend, or a caregiver has been trained in giving naloxone as an injection or as a nasal spray, follow the instructions carefully if you think an opiate overdose has happened. It is important to call 911 and get immediate emergency medical care for the person following use of naloxone.</p>
