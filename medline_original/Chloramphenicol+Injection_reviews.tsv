<p>Chloramphenicol injection may cause a decrease in the number of certain types of blood cells in the body. In some cases, people who experienced this decrease in blood cells later developed leukemia (cancer that begins in the white blood cells). You may experience this decrease in blood cells whether you are being treated with chloramphenicol for a long time or a short time. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: pale skin; excessive tiredness; shortness of breath; dizziness; fast heartbeat; unusual bruising or bleeding; or signs of infection such as sore throat, fever, cough, and chills.</p>
<p>Your doctor will order laboratory tests regularly during your treatment to check whether the number of blood cells in your body has decreased. You should know that these tests do not always detect changes in the body that may lead to a permanent decrease in the number of blood cells. It is best that you receive chloramphenicol injection in the hospital so that you can be closely monitored by your doctor.</p>
<p>Chloramphenicol injection should not be used when another antibiotic can treat your infection. It must not be used to treat minor infections, colds, flu, throat infections or to prevent the development of an infection.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving chloramphenicol injection.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Chloramphenicol injection is used to treat certain types of serious infections caused by bacteria when other antibiotics cannot be used. Chloramphenicol injection is in a class of medications called antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Chloramphenicol injection comes as a liquid to be injected into a vein by a doctor or nurse in a hospital. It is usually given every 6 hours. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection being treated. After your condition improves, your doctor may switch you to another antibiotic that you can take by mouth to complete your treatment.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with chloramphenicol injection. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, tell your doctor.</p>
<p>Use chloramphenicol injection for as long as your doctor tells you, even if you feel better. If you stop using chloramphenicol injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>

If treatment is stopped at the first sign of any symptoms, the symptoms may go away, and the infant may recover completely.
