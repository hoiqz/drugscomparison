<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Rilpivirine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Rilpivirine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although rilpivirine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Rilpivirine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food once a day. Take rilpivirine at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rilpivirine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Rilpivirine controls HIV but does not cure it. Continue to take rilpivirine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking rilpivirine without talking to your doctor. When your supply of rilpivirine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you miss doses or stop taking rilpivirine, your condition may become more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

<li>if you are taking a medication for indigestion, heartburn, or ulcers such as cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), or ranitidine (Zantac), take it at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after rilpivirine.</li>

Call your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following symptoms while you are taking rilpivirine: new or worsening depression; feeling sad, hopeless, anxious, or restless; or thinking about killing yourself or planning or trying to do so.

This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms after starting treatment with rilpivirine, be sure to tell your doctor.</li>
