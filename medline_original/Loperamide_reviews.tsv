<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Loperamide comes as a tablet, capsule, and liquid to take by mouth. It usually is taken immediately after each loose bowel movement; it is sometimes taken on a schedule (one or more times a day) for chronic diarrhea. Follow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take loperamide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If your symptoms do not improve within 2 days (10 days for chronic diarrhea) or if you develop a fever or bloody stools, call your doctor. Drink plenty of water or other beverages to replace fluids lost while having diarrhea.</p>
