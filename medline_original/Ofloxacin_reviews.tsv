<p>
<strong>Taking ofloxacin increases the risk that you will develop tendinitis (swelling of a fibrous tissue that connects a bone to a muscle) or have a tendon rupture (tearing of a fibrous tissue that connects a bone to a muscle) during your treatment or for up to several months afterward. These problems may affect tendons in your shoulder, your hand, the back of your ankle, or in other parts of your body. Tendinitis or tendon rupture may happen to people of any age, but the risk is highest in people over 60 years of age. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a kidney, heart, or lung transplant; kidney disease; a joint or tendon disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis (a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function); or if you participate in regular physical activity. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking oral or injectable steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexpak), methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Sterapred). If you experience any of the following symptoms of tendinitis, stop taking ofloxacin, rest, and call your doctor immediately: pain, swelling, tenderness, stiffness, or difficulty in moving a muscle. If you experience any of the following symptoms of tendon rupture, stop taking ofloxacin and get emergency medical treatment: hearing or feeling a snap or pop in a tendon area, bruising after an injury to a tendon area, or inability to move or bear weight on an affected area.</strong>
</p>
<p>Taking ofloxacin may worsen muscle weakness in people with myasthenia gravis (a disorder of the nervous system that causes muscle weakness) and cause severe difficulty breathing or death. Tell your doctor if you have myasthenia gravis. Your doctor may tell you not to take ofloxacin. If you have myasthenia gravis and your doctor tells you that you should take ofloxacin, call your doctor immediately if you experience muscle weakness or difficulty breathing during your treatment.</p>
<p>
<strong>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking ofloxacin.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with ofloxacin. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs</a>) or check the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</strong>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ofloxacin is used to treat certain infections including bronchitis, pneumonia, and infections of the skin, bladder, urinary tract, reproductive organs, and prostate (a male reproductive gland). Ofloxacin is in a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. It works by killing bacteria that cause infections. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.</p>
<a name="how">
    </a>
</div>
<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ofloxacin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day for 3 days to 6 weeks. The length of treatment depends on the type of infection being treated. Your doctor will tell you how long to take ofloxacin. Take ofloxacin at around the same times every day and try to space your doses 12 hours apart. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ofloxacin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first few days of your treatment with ofloxacin. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Take ofloxacin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. Do not stop taking ofloxacin unless you experience the symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture described in the IMPORTANT WARNING section or the symptoms of allergic reaction described in the SIDE EFFECTS section. If you stop taking ofloxacin too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>

<h2>Other uses for this medicine</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Ofloxacin is also sometimes used to treat other types of infection, including infections of the bones and joints and of the stomach and intestines. Ofloxacin may also be used to treat or prevent anthrax or plague (serious infections that may be spread on purpose as part of a bioterror attack) in people who may have been exposed to the germs that cause these infections in the air. Talk to your doctor about the risks of using ofloxacin to treat your condition.</p>
<p>This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
