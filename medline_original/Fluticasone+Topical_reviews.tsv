<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Fluticasone comes as an ointment and cream to apply to the skin. It usually is applied two to four times a day at evenly spaced intervals. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluticasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not stop using fluticasone without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Thoroughly clean the affected area, allow it to dry, and then gently rub the medication in until most of it disappears. Use just enough medication to cover the affected area. You should wash your hands after applying the medication. The scalp lotion should be applied directly from the squeeze bottle to the affected area.</p>
