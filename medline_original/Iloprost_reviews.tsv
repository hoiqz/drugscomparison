<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Iloprost is used to treat certain kinds of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; high blood pressure in the vessels carrying blood to the lungs, causing shortness of breath, dizziness, and tiredness). Iloprost may improve the ability to exercise and slow the worsening of symptoms in patients with PAH. Iloprost is in a class of medications called vasodilators. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, including those in the lungs.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Iloprost comes as a solution to inhale by mouth. It is usually inhaled six to nine times a day during waking hours. Use iloprost exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use iloprost inhalation solution with your delivery device. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions that describe how to prepare and inhale a dose of iloprost. Be sure to ask your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse if you have any questions about how to prepare or inhale this medication. After each dose of medication, throw away any solution remaining in the delivery device and carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning the delivery system components. Do not mix other medications with iloprost solution.</p>
<p>Do not swallow iloprost solution. If iloprost solution gets on your skin or in your eyes, rinse your skin or eyes with water right away. Be careful not to use iloprost inhaler too close to other people, especially pregnant women and infants, so that they do not inhale the medication.</p>
<p>Do not use iloprost inhaler more than once every two hours. Because the effects of the medication may not last 2 hours, you may need to adjust the timing of your doses to cover your planned activities.</p>
<p>Iloprost solution is used with certain inhaler devices. Make sure you can get another delivery device to use right away if your device does not work for any reason.</p>
<p>Iloprost is not available at retail pharmacies. Your medication will be mailed to you from a specialty pharmacy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how you will receive your medication.</p>
<p>Iloprost controls PAH but does not cure it. Continue to take iloprost even if you feel well. Do not stop taking iloprost without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient and a copy of the user's guide for the inhaler device.</p>
