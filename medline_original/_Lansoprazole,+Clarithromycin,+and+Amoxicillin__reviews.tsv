<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin are used to treat and prevent the return of ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or intestine) caused by a certain type of bacteria (<em>H. pylori</em>). Lansoprazole is in a class of medications called proton pump inhibitors. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are in a class of medications called antibiotics. Lansoprazole works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin work by stopping the growth of the bacteria that may cause ulcers. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Lansoprazole comes as a delayed-release (long-acting) capsule, clarithromycin comes as a tablet, and amoxicillin comes as a capsule, all to be taken by mouth. These medications are usually taken before a meal twice a day. To help you take the right number of capsules and tablets at each dose, the medication is packaged in dosing cards. Each dosing card contains all of the medication needed for both daily doses. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take the medication exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets and capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Take lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking antibiotics too soon your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p>If your condition does not improve or gets worse, call your doctor.</p>
