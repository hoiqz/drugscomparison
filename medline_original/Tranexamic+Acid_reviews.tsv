<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Tranexamic acid comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food three times a day for up to 5 days during monthly menstruation. You should begin taking this medication each month when your period starts. Do not take tranexamic acid when you do not have a period. Take tranexamic acid at around the same times every day you are to receive a dose. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tranexamic acid exactly as directed. Do not take tranexamic acid tablets for more than 5 days in a menstrual cycle or take more than 6 tablets in a 24 hour period of time.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Tranexamic acid is used to decrease the amount of blood lost during your monthly period but does not stop menstrual bleeding. Call your doctor if your bleeding does not improve or gets worse during your treatment.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

<h3>Before taking tranexamic acid,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to tranexamic acid, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in tranexamic acid tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, and injections); certain medications used to improve blood clotting including Factor IX complex concentrate (AlphaNine SD, Bebulin VH, Benefix, Mononine, Profilmine SD) and activated prothrombin complex concentrate (Feiba NF); and tretinoin.  Tell your doctor you are taking tranexamic acid if you will be receiving medications to treat blood clots, including tissue plasminogen activators such as alteplase (Activase) and reteplase (Retavase). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a blood clot, if you have a blood clotting condition, or if you have been told you are at risk of having a blood clot. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take tranexamic acid.</li>
<renal-hepatic-precaut>
