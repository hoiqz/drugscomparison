<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Methyldopa comes as a tablet and a liquid to take by mouth. It usually is taken two to four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take methyldopa exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Shake the liquid well before each dose to mix the medication evenly. Use a dose-measuring spoon or cup to measure the correct amount of liquid for each dose, not a regular household spoon.</p>
<p>Methyldopa controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take methyldopa even if you feel well. Do not stop taking methyldopa without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking methyldopa, your blood pressure may increase and you may experience side effects. Your doctor will decrease your dose gradually.</p>
