<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Amoxicillin is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria, such as pneumonia; bronchitis; gonorrhea; and infections of the ears, nose, throat, urinary tract, and skin. It is also used in combination with other medications to eliminate <em>H. pylori</em>, a bacteria that causes ulcers. Amoxicillin is in a class of medications called penicillin-like antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, and other viral infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Amoxicillin comes as a capsule, a tablet, a chewable tablet, a suspension (liquid), and pediatric drops to take by mouth. It is usually taken every 12 hours (twice a day) or every 8 hours (three times a day) with or without food. To help you remember to take amoxicillin, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take amoxicillin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Shake the liquid and pediatric drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the bottle dropper to measure the dose of pediatric drops. The pediatric drops and liquid may be placed on a child's tongue or added to formula, milk, fruit juice, water, ginger ale, or other cold liquid and taken immediately.</p>
<p>The chewable tablets should be crushed or chewed thoroughly before they are swallowed. The tablets and capsules should be swallowed whole and taken with a full glass of water.</p>
<p>Take amoxicillin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. Stopping amoxicillin too soon may cause bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
