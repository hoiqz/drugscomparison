<p>Prasugrel may cause serious or life-threatening bleeding. Tell your doctor if you currently have or have had a condition that causes you to bleed more easily than normal, if you have recently had surgery or been injured in any way, or if you have or have ever had a stomach ulcer; bleeding in your stomach, intestines, or head; a stroke or mini-stroke; a condition that may cause bleeding in your intestines such as polyps (abnormal growths in the lining of the large intestine) or diverticulitis (inflamed bulges in the lining of the large intestine); or liver disease. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking medications that may cause bleeding including anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin (Coumadin); heparin; other medications to treat or prevent blood clots; or regular use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). Your doctor may not prescribe prasugrel for you if you have any of these conditions, you are taking any of these medications, you weigh less than 132 lb (60 kg), or you are older than 75 years of age. Your doctor also will probably not prescribe prasugrel if you are likely to need heart bypass surgery (a certain type of open heart surgery) right away. While you are taking prasugrel, you will probably bruise and bleed more easily than usual, bleed for longer than usual, and have nosebleeds. However, if you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: bleeding that is unexplained, severe, long-lasting, or uncontrollable; pink or brown urine; red or black, tarry stools; vomit that is bloody or that looks like coffee grounds; coughing up blood or blood clots; or bruises that are unexplained or that get larger.</p>
<p>If you are having surgery, including dental surgery, or any type of medical procedure, tell your doctor or dentist that you are taking prasugrel. Your doctor will probably tell you to stop taking prasugrel at least 7 days before your surgery is scheduled.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with prasugrel and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risk of taking prasugrel.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Prasugrel is used along with aspirin to prevent serious or life-threatening problems with the heart and blood vessels in people who have had a heart attack or severe chest pain and have been treated with angioplasty (procedure to open the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart). Prasugrel is in a class of medications called anti-platelet medications. It works by preventing platelets (a type of blood cell) from collecting and forming clots that may cause a heart attack or stroke.</p>

<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Prasugrel comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take prasugrel at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take prasugrel exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablet whole; do not split, chew, or crush it.</p>
<p>Prasugrel will help prevent serious problems with your heart and blood vessels only as long as you take the medication. Do not stop taking prasugrel without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking prasugrel, there is a higher risk that you may have a heart attack, develop a blood clot, or die.</p>
