<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ophthalmic betaxolol is used to treat glaucoma, a condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision. Betaxolol is in a class of medications called beta blockers. It works by decreasing the pressure in the eye.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ophthalmic betaxolol comes as a solution (liquid) and a suspension (liquid) to instill in the eyes. Ophthalmic betaxolol is usually used twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use betaxolol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Betaxolol eye drops control glaucoma but do not cure it. Continue to use betaxolol eye drops even if you feel well. Do not stop using betaxolol eye drops without talking to your doctor.</p>
<h3>To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the label on your bottle to see if you need to shake the eye drops before using them. Shake the bottle well if the label says that you should.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the instructions that came with your medication to see how you should dispense your dose. You will need to either gently squeeze the sides of the bottle or push the bottom of the bottle to dispense one drop of medication into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
