<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Scopolamine comes as a patch to be placed on the skin behind your ear. Apply one patch to a clean, dry, hairless area behind the ear. The patch should be applied at least 4 hours before its effects will be needed. Each patch is good for 3 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use the scopolamine patch exactly as directed.</p>
<h3>To apply the patch, follow the directions provided by the manufacturer and these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After washing the area behind the ear, wipe the area with a clean, dry tissue to ensure that the area is dry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the patch from its protective pouch. To expose the adhesive surface of the patch, the clear plastic protective strip should be peeled off and discarded. Contact with the exposed adhesive layer should be avoided to prevent contamination of fingers with scopolamine. Temporary blurred vision and dilation of the pupils may result if scopolamine comes into contact with your eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the adhesive side against the skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press the patch firmly for 10 to 20 seconds. Be sure that the edges adhere to your skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you have placed the patch behind your ear, wash your hands thoroughly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of 3 days, or when the scopolamine patch is no longer needed, remove the patch and throw it away. Wrap the patch in tissue or paper to avoid exposing anyone else to the remaining medication. Wash your hands and the area behind your ear thoroughly to remove any traces of scopolamine from the area. If a new patch needs to be applied, place a fresh patch on the hairless area behind your other ear.</p>

<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to scopolamine or any other drugs.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially medications that decrease mental alertness; cough, cold, and allergy products; and vitamins.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had glaucoma; heart, liver, or kidney disease; stomach or intestinal obstruction; or difficulty urinating.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using scopolamine patches, call your doctor immediately.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using scopolamine patches.</li>
<li>you should know that this drug may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how scopolamine patches will affect you. This is especially important during the first 3 to 5 days of therapy and when your dose is increased.</li>
