<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Belimumab is used with other medications to treat people with certain types of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus; an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks healthy parts of the body such as joints, skin, blood vessels, and organs).  Belimumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by blocking the activity of a certain protein in people with SLE. Belimumab may not work as well to treat African Americans who have SLE.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Belimumab comes as a powder to be mixed with sterile water and given intravenously (into a vein) over at least an hour by a doctor or nurse. It is usually given once every 2 weeks for the first three doses, and then once every 4 weeks. Your doctor will decide how often you are to receive belimumab based on your body's response to this medication.</p>
<p>Belimumab may cause serious reactions during an infusion and up to a day after receiving the infusion. A doctor or nurse will watch you closely while you are receiving the infusion and after the infusion to be sure you are not having a serious reaction to the medication. You may be given other medications to treat or help prevent reactions to belimumab. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms during or for about a day after you receive the infusion: rash; itching; hives; swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, throat, tongue, or lips; difficulty breathing or swallowing; wheezing or shortness of breath; anxiousness; flushing; dizziness; fainting; headache; nausea; fever; chills; seizures; muscle aches; and slow heart beat.</p>
<p>Belimumab helps control lupus but does not cure it. Your doctor will watch you carefully to see how well belimumab works for you. It may take some time before you feel the full benefit of belimumab. It is important to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with belimumab and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a> or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
