<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before taking demeclocycline,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to demeclocycline, tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline, or any other medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take, especially antacids, anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), and penicillin. Demeclocycline decreases the effectiveness of some oral contraceptives; another form of birth control should be used while taking this drug.</li>
<li>be aware that antacids, calcium supplements, iron products, and laxatives containing magnesium interfere with demeclocycline, making it less effective. Take demeclocycline 1 hour before or 2 hours after antacids (including sodium bicarbonate), calcium supplements, and laxatives containing magnesium. Take demeclocycline 2 hours before or 3 hours after iron preparations and vitamin products that contain iron.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes or kidney or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking demeclocycline, call your doctor immediately. Demeclocycline can harm the fetus.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking demeclocycline.</li>
<li>plan to avoid unnecessary or prolonged exposure to sunlight and to wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Demeclocycline may make your skin sensitive to sunlight.</li>
<li>you should know that when demeclocycline is used during pregnancy or in babies or children up to age 8, it can cause the teeth to become permanently stained. Demeclocycline should not be used in children under age 8 unless your doctor decides it is needed.</li>

<h2>What other information should I know?</h2>

<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your response to demeclocycline.</p>
