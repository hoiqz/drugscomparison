<p>Propylthiouracil may cause severe liver damage in adults and children. Some people who took propylthiouracil needed liver transplants and some people died because of the liver damage. Because of this risk, propylthiouracil should only be given to people who cannot receive other treatments such as surgery, radioactive iodine, or a different medication called methimazole (Tapazole). Propylthiouracil may also be given to women during the first months (about 12 weeks) of pregnancy because methimazole may cause birth defects if it is used during this part of a pregnancy.</p>
<p>If you are taking propylthiouracil, call your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following symptoms: fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, itching, dark urine, pale or light colored stools, yellowing of the skin or eyes, or pain in the upper right part of the stomach.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with propylthiouracil and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>).</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Propylthiouracil is used to treat hyperthyroidism (a condition that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, speeding the body's metabolism, and causing certain symptoms) in adults and children 6 years of age or older. Propylthiouracil is in a class of medications called antithyroid agents. It works by stopping the thyroid gland from making thyroid hormone.</p>
