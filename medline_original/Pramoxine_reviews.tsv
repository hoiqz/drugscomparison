<p>Pramoxine comes as a gel or spray to apply to the skin. Pramoxine also comes as a cream, foam, lotion, or solution (liquid) to apply to the rectal area.

Pramoxine cream or pledgets may be used up to five times a day;the spray or gel may be used 3 or 4 times daily. Pramoxine hemorrhoidal cream, lotion, and foam may be applied after bowel movements as needed or directed.

Do not use more or less of it or use it more often or for a longer time than described on the package or prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If your symptoms continue for longer than seven days, your condition worsens, or your condition clears up for a few days and then comes back, stop using pramoxine and call your doctor.</p>
