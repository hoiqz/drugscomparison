<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Tesamorelin injection is used to decrease the amount of extra fat in the stomach area in adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who have lipodystrophy (increased body fat in certain areas of the body). Tesamorelin injection is not used to help with weight loss. Tesamorelin injection is in a class of medications called human growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) analogs. It works by increasing the production of a certain natural substance that can decrease the amount of body fat.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Tesamorelin injection comes as a powder to be mixed with the liquid provided with your medication and injected subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected once a day. Use tesamorelin injection at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use tesamorelin injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Before you use tesamorelin injection for the first time, read the manufacturer's information for the patient that comes with the medication. Your medication comes in 2 boxes: one box with tesamorelin injection vials and another with vials containing liquid to mix with the medication, needles, and syringes. Ask your pharmacist or doctor to show you how to mix and inject the medication. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to inject this medication.</p>
<p>You should inject tesamorelin into the skin of your stomach area below the navel (belly button). Do not inject tesamorelin into the navel or into any scarred, reddened, irritated, infected, or bruised areas of skin. Do not inject tesamorelin into any areas with hard bumps from previous injections. Choose a different area for each injection to help prevent bruising and irritation. Keep track of the areas where you inject tesamorelin, and do not give an injection into the same spot two times in a row.</p>
<p>After mixing tesamorelin injection, use the medication right away. Do not store tesamorelin injection after mixing. Throw away any used tesamorelin injection and any extra liquid used to mix the injection.</p>
<p>You should always look at tesamorelin injection solution (liquid) after mixing and before you inject it. The solution should be clear and colorless with no particles in it. Do not use tesamorelin injection solution if it is colored, cloudy, contains particles, or if the expiration date on the bottle has passed.</p>
<p>Never reuse syringes or needles, and never share needles with another person. Do not share syringes with another person even if the needle was changed. Sharing needles and syringes can cause the spread of certain diseases, such as HIV. If you accidently prick someone with a used needle, tell him to talk to his healthcare provider right away. Throw away any remaining tesamorelin injection, extra liquid used to mix the injection, and used needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container made of hard plastic or metal that has a lid. Never throw used needles or syringes into the trash. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container and all other used materials.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
