<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Insulin lispro is used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin lispro is always used with another type of insulin, unless it is used in an external insulin pump. In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin lispro may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin lispro is a short-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin lispro works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Insulin lispro comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected 15 minutes before a meal or immediately after a meal. Your doctor will tell you how many times you should inject insulin lispro each day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use insulin lispro exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Never use insulin lispro when you have symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or if you have checked your blood sugar and found it to be low. Do not inject insulin into a skin area that is red, swollen, itchy, or thickened.</p>
<p>Insulin lispro controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use insulin lispro even if you feel well. Do not stop using insulin lispro without talking to your doctor. Do not switch to another brand or type of insulin or change the dose of any type of insulin you are using without talking to your doctor. Always check the insulin label to make sure you received the right type of insulin from the pharmacy.</p>
<p>Insulin lispro comes in vials, cartridges that contain medication and are to be placed in dosing pens, and dosing pens that contain cartridges of medication. Be sure you know what type of container your insulin lispro comes in and what other supplies, such as needles, syringes, or pens you will need to inject your medication.</p>
<p>If your insulin lispro comes in vials, you will need to use syringes to inject your dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to inject insulin lispro using a syringe. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of syringe you should use.</p>
<p>If your insulin lispro comes in cartridges, you will need to purchase an insulin pen separately. Check the manufacturer's information for the patient to see what type of pen is right for the cartridge size you are using. Carefully read the instructions that come with your pen, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of pen you should use.</p>
<p>If your insulin lispro comes in pens, be sure to read and understand the manufacturer's instructions. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the pen. Follow the directions carefully, and always prime the pen before use.</p>
<p>Never reuse needles or syringes and never share needles, syringes, cartridges, or pens. If you are using an insulin pen, always remove the needle right after you inject your dose. Throw away needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to mix your insulin lispro with another type of insulin (NPH insulin) in the same syringe. Your doctor will tell you exactly how to do this. Always draw insulin lispro into the syringe first, always use the same brand of syringe, and always inject the insulin immediately after mixing. Insulin lispro should not be mixed with insulin preparations other than NPH insulin.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to dilute insulin lispro before injection to allow easier measurement of your dose. Your doctor will tell you exactly how to do this.</p>
<p>You can inject your insulin lispro in your thighs, stomach, upper arms, or buttocks. Each time you inject insulin lispro you should choose a spot that is at least 1/2 inch (1.25 centimeters) away from the spot where you gave your last injection.</p>
<p>Always look at your insulin lispro before you inject it. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use your insulin lispro if it is colored, cloudy, or contains solid particles, or if the expiration date on the bottle has passed.</p>
<p>Insulin lispro in vials or cartridges also can be used with an external insulin pump. Before using insulin lispro in a pump system, read the pump label to make sure the pump can be used for continuous delivery of fast-acting insulin. Read the pump manual for recommended reservoir and tubing sets, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the insulin pump. Do not dilute insulin lispro or mix it with any other type of insulin when using it with an external insulin pump. When using insulin lispro with an external insulin pump, replace the insulin in the reservoir at least every 7 days, and change the infusion set and infusion set insertion site at least every 3 days. If the infusion site is red, itchy, or thickened, tell your doctor and use a different infusion site.</p>
