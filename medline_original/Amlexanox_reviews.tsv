<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Amlexanox is used to treat ulcers of the mouth called aphthous ulcers or canker sores. It decreases the time ulcers take to heal. Because amlexanox decreases the healing time, it also decreases the pain you feel.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor, dentist, or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Amlexanox comes as a beige-colored paste. Amlexanox should be used as soon as possible after noticing symptoms of an ulcer. Amlexanox is usually applied four times a day, following brushing and flossing after breakfast, lunch, dinner, and at bedtime. Squeeze 1/4 inch (0.6 centimeters) of the paste on your finger. With gentle pressure, dab amlexanox onto each ulcer in the mouth. Wash hands immediately after using amlexanox. Amlexanox is only used until the ulcer has healed, usually within 10 days. Contact your physician or dentist if significant healing has not occurred within 10 days.</p>
<p>Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor, dentist, or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use amlexanox exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor or dentist.</p>
