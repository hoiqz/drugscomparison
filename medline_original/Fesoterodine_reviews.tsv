<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Fesoterodine is used to treat overactive bladder (a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause frequent urination, urgent need to urinate, and inability to control urination). Fesoterodine is in a class of medications called antimuscarinics. It works by relaxing the bladder muscles to prevent urgent, frequent, or uncontrolled urination.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Fesoterodine comes as an extended release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food, once a day. Take fesoterodine at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fesoterodine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole with plenty of liquid; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of fesoterodine and increase your dose if your symptoms are not controlled. Talk to your doctor about how fesoterodine works for you</p>
<p>Your symptoms should begin to improve during the first few weeks of your treatment with fesoterodine. However, it may take up to 12 weeks for you to feel the full benefit of fesoterodine. Tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after you have taken fesoterodine for several weeks.</p>
<p>Fesoterodine may help control your symptoms, but it will not cure your condition. Continue to take fesoterodine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking fesoterodine without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking fesoterodine, your symptoms may return.</p>
