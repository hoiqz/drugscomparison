<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>You will use pramlintide with mealtime insulin to control your blood sugar levels. When you use insulin, there is a chance that you will experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This risk may be greater during the first 3 hours after you inject pramlintide, especially if you have Type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). You may harm yourself or others if your blood sugar drops while you are involved in an activity that requires you to be alert or to think clearly. Do not drive a car or use heavy machinery until you know how pramlintide affects your blood sugar. Talk to your doctor about what other activities you should avoid while you are using pramlintide.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have had diabetes for a long time, if you have diabetic nerve disease, if you cannot tell when your blood sugar is low, and if you needed medical treatment for hypoglycemia several times in the past 6 months. Also tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medications: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors used to treat high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetic kidney disease; beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), labetalol (Normodyne), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), nadolol (Corgard), and propranolol (Inderal); clonidine (Catapres); disopyramide (Norpace); fenofibrate (Lofibra, Tricor);  fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem); gemfibrozil (Lopid); guanethidine (Ismelin); other medications for diabetes; monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl), and tranylcypromine (Parnate); pentoxifylline (Trental); propoxyphene (Darvon); reserpine (Serpalan, Serpasil); salicylate pain relievers such as aspirin; and sulfonamide antibiotics such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra).</p>
<p>While you are using pramlintide, you must measure your blood sugar before and after every meal and at bedtime. You also will need to see or talk to your doctor often, and frequently change your doses of pramlintide and insulin according to your doctor's directions. Tell your doctor if you think that it will be difficult for you to do these things, if you have had difficulty checking your blood sugar or using your insulin correctly in the past, or if you find it difficult to manage your treatment after you start using pramlintide.</p>
<p>Your doctor will decrease your dose of insulin when you start using pramlintide. Your doctor will start you on a low dose of pramlintide and will gradually increase your dose. Call your doctor right away if you have an upset stomach during this time; your dose may need to be changed or you may have to stop using pramlintide. Your doctor will probably change your dose of insulin once you are using a dose of pramlintide that is right for you. Follow all of these directions carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist right away if you are not sure how much insulin or pramlintide you should use.</p>
<h3>The risk of hypoglycemia may be greater in certain situations.  Call your doctor if you plan to be more active than usual. If you have any of the following conditions you should not use pramlintide and should call your doctor to find out what to do: 

</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you plan to skip a meal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you plan to eat a meal with less than 250 calories or 30 grams of carbohydrates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you cannot eat because you are sick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you cannot eat because you are scheduled for surgery or a medical test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your blood sugar is very low before a meal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alcohol may cause a decrease in blood sugar. Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are using pramlintide.</p>
<p>Call your doctor right away if your blood sugar is lower than normal or if you have any of the following symptoms of low blood sugar: hunger, headache, sweating, shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control, irritability, difficulty concentrating, loss of consciousness, coma, or a seizure. Be sure that you always have a fast acting source of sugar such as hard candy, juice, glucose tablets, or glucagon available to treat hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with pramlintide and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website: <a href="http://www.fda.gov">http://www.fda.gov</a>.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Pramlintide is used with mealtime insulin to control blood sugar levels in people who have diabetes. Pramlintide is only used to treat patients whose blood sugar could not be controlled by insulin or insulin and an oral medication for diabetes. Pramlintide is in a class of medications called antihyperglycemics. It works by slowing the movement of food through the stomach. This prevents blood sugar from rising too high after a meal, and may decrease appetite and cause weight loss.</p>
<a name="how">
    </a>
</div>
<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Pramlintide comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin). It is usually injected several times a day, before each meal that includes at least 250 calories or 30 grams of carbohydrate. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use pramlintide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Pramlintide controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use pramlintide even if you feel well. Do not stop using pramlintide without talking to your doctor. If you do stop using pramlintide for any reason, do not start using it again without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Use a U-100 insulin syringe to inject pramlintide. It is best to use the 0.3-mL size. Use the table in the medication guide to find the number of insulin syringe units that matches your prescribed dose (in micrograms [mcg]) of pramlintide. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure how many syringe units of medication you will need to inject.</p>
<p>Use a new syringe and needle for each injection. Do not mix pramlintide and insulin in the same syringe, and do not use the same syringe or needle to inject pramlintide and insulin one after another. Throw away your needle and syringe in a puncture-resistant container that is out of the reach of children. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how to throw away the puncture-resistant container.</p>
<p>You can inject pramlintide anywhere on your stomach or thigh. Do not inject pramlintide into your arm. Choose a different spot to inject pramlintide every day. Be sure that the spot you choose is more than 2 inches away from the spot where you will inject insulin.</p>
<p>You should inject pramlintide under the skin the same way that you inject insulin. Allow the vial of pramlintide to warm to room temperature before you inject the medication. Look at the liquid in the vial before you inject it, and do not use it if it is cloudy. If you have questions about injecting pramlintide, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
