<p>Corticotropin repository injection is used to treat the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>infantile spasms (seizures that usually begin during the first year of life and may be followed by developmental delays) in infants and children younger than 2 years of age;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>episodes of symptoms in people who have multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>episodes of symptoms in people who have rheumatoid arthritis (a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>episodes of symptoms in people who have psoriatic arthritis (a condition that causes joint pain and swelling and scales on the skin);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>episodes of symptoms in people who have ankylosing spondylitis (a condition in which the body attacks the joints of the spine and other areas, causing pain and joint damage);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lupus (a condition in which the body attacks many of its own organs);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systemic dermatomyositis (condition that causes muscle weakness and skin rash) or polymyositis (condition that causes muscle weakness but not skin rash);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>serious allergic reactions that affect the skin including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe allergic reaction that may cause the top layer of skin to blister and shed);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>serum sickness (a serious allergic reaction that occurs several days after taking certain medications and causes skin rash, fever, joint pain, and other symptoms);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allergic reactions or other conditions that cause swelling of the eyes and the area around them;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sarcoidosis (condition in which small clumps of immune cells form in various organs such as the lungs, eyes, skin, and heart and interfere with the function of these organs);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nephrotic syndrome (a group of symptoms including protein in the urine; low levels of protein in the blood; high levels of certain fats in the blood; and swelling of the arms, hands, feet, and legs).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Corticotropin repository injection is in a class of medications called hormones. It treats many conditions by decreasing the activity of the immune system so that it will not cause damage to the organs.  There is not enough information to tell how corticotropin repository injection works to treat infantile spasms.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Corticotropin repository injection comes as a long acting gel to inject under the skin or into a muscle. When corticotropin repository injection is used to treat infantile spasms, it is usually injected into a muscle twice a day for two weeks and then injected on a gradually decreasing schedule for another two weeks. When corticotropin repository injection is used to treat multiple sclerosis, it is usually injected once a day for 2 to 3 weeks, and then the dose is gradually decreased. When corticotropin repository injection is used to treat other conditions, it is injected once every 24 to 72 hours, depending on the condition being treated and how well the medication works to treat the condition. Inject corticotropin repository injection at around the same time(s) of day on every day that you are told to inject it. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use corticotropin repository injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Continue to use corticotropin repository injection as long as it has been prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop using corticotropin repository injection without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using corticotropin repository injection, you may experience symptoms such as weakness, tiredness, pale skin, changes in skin color, weight loss, stomach pain, and loss of appetite. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.</p>
<p>You can inject corticotropin repository injection yourself or have a relative or friend inject the medication. You or the person who will be performing the injections should read the manufacturer's directions for injecting the medication before you inject it for the first time at home. Your doctor will show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to perform the injections, or your doctor can arrange for a nurse to come to your home to show you how to inject the medication.</p>
<p>You will need a needle and syringe to inject corticotropin. Ask your doctor which type of needle and syringe you should use. Do not share needles or syringes or use them more than once. Throw away used needles and syringes in a puncture-proof container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-proof container.</p>
<p>If you are injecting corticotropin repository injection under your skin, you can inject it anywhere in your upper thigh, upper arm, or stomach area except for your navel (belly button) and the 1 inch area around it. If you are injecting corticotropin repository injection into a muscle, you can inject it anywhere on your upper arm or upper outer thigh. If you are giving the injection to a baby you should inject it into the upper outer thigh. Choose a new spot at least 1 inch away from a spot where you have already injected the medication each time you inject it. Do not inject the medication into any area that is red, swollen, painful, hard, or sensitive, or that has tattoos, warts, scars, or birthmarks. Do not inject the medication into your knee or groin areas.</p>
<p>Look at the vial of corticotropin repository injection before you prepare your dose. Be sure that the vial is labeled with the correct name of the medication and an expiration date that has not passed. The medication in the vial should be clear and colorless and should not be cloudy or contain flecks or particles. If you do not have the right medication, if your medication is expired or if it does not look as it should, call your pharmacist and do not use that vial.</p>
<p>Allow your medication to warm to room temperature before you inject it. You can warm the medication by rolling the vial between your hands or holding it under your arm for a few minutes.</p>
<p>If you are giving corticotropin repository injection to your child, you can hold your child on your lap or have your child lie flat while you are giving the injection. You may find it helpful to have someone else hold the child in position or distract the child with a noisy toy while you are injecting the medication. You can help decrease your child's pain by placing an ice cube on the spot where you will inject the medication before or after the injection.</p>
<p>If you are giving corticotropin repository injection to your child to treat infantile spasms, your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when your child begins treatment with corticotropin repository injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
