<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>For female patients:</p>
<p>Do not take bosentan if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Bosentan may harm the fetus. If you are sexually active and able to become pregnant, you should not begin taking bosentan until a pregnancy test has shown that you are not pregnant. You must use a reliable method of birth control and be tested for pregnancy every month during your treatment. Hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, shots, implants, and intrauterine devices) may not work well when used with bosentan and should not be used as your only method of birth control. Talk to your doctor about birth control methods that will work for you. Call your doctor immediately if you miss a period or think that you may be pregnant while you are taking bosentan.</p>
<p>For male and female patients:</p>
<p>Bosentan may cause liver damage. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: upset stomach, vomiting, fever, stomach pain, yellowing of the skin or eyes, or extreme tiredness.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order a blood test to be sure your liver is working normally before you start taking bosentan and every month during your treatment. Bosentan may damage the liver without causing symptoms. Regular blood tests are the only way to find liver damage before it becomes permanent and severe.</p>
<p>Bosentan is not available at retail pharmacies. Your medication will be mailed to you from a central pharmacy. This program is required to be sure that all patients who receive the medication are tested for liver damage and pregnancy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how you will receive your medication.</p>
<p>You will receive the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with bosentan and each time you refill the prescription. Read the information carefully each time and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You also can obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website: <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking bosentan.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Bosentan is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, high blood pressure in the vessels that carry blood to the lungs). Bosentan may improve the ability to exercise and slow the worsening of symptoms in patients with PAH. Bosentan is in a class of medications called endothelin receptor antagonists. It works by stopping the action of endothelin, a natural substance that causes blood vessels to narrow and prevents normal blood flow in people who have PAH.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Bosentan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day in the morning and evening. To help you remember to take bosentan, take it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take bosentan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of bosentan and increase your dose after 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Bosentan controls the symptoms of PAH but does not cure it. It may take 1-2 months or longer before you feel the full benefit of bosentan. Continue to take bosentan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking bosentan without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking bosentan, your symptoms may get worse. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually.</p>
