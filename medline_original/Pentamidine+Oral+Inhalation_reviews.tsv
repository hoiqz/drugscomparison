<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Pentamidine comes as a solution to be inhaled using a nebulizer. It usually is used once every 4 weeks. Inhalation of pentamidine delivers the drug directly to your lungs. Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist will show you how to use the nebulizer. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take pentamidine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
