<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Polyethylene glycol 3350 is used to treat occasional constipation. Polyethylene glycol 3350 is in a class of medications called osmotic laxatives. It works by causing water to be retained with the stool. This increases the number of bowel movements and softens the stool so it is easier to pass.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Polyethylene glycol 3350 comes as a powder to be mixed with a liquid and taken by mouth. It is usually taken once a day as needed for up to 2 weeks. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take polyethylene glycol 3350 exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Polyethylene glycol 3350 may be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than your doctor tells you to.</p>
<p>It may take 2 to 4 days for polyethylene glycol 3350 to produce a bowel movement.</p>
<h3>To use the powder, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are using polyethylene glycol 3350 from a bottle, use the measuring line on the bottle cap to measure a single dose (about 1 heaping tablespoon). If you are using polyethylene glycol 3350 packets, each packet contains a single dose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour the powder into a cup containing 8 ounces (240 milliliters) of water, juice, soda, coffee, or tea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir to dissolve the powder.</p>
</li>
<li>
