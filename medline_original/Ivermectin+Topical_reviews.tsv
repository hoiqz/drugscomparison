<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ivermectin comes as a lotion to apply to the scalp and hair. It is usually applied to the scalp and hair in one treatment. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ivermectin lotion exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Ivermectin lotion should only be used on the hair and scalp. Avoid getting ivermectin lotion in your eyes, mouth, or vagina.</p>
<p>If ivermectin lotion gets in your eyes, flush them with water right away.</p>
<h3>To use the lotion, follow these steps: 

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Children will need an adult to help apply the lotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the top of the cap to break the seal on the tube of lotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply ivermectin lotion to dry hair and dry scalp area starting at the scalp and then working outwards towards the ends of your hair. Be sure to use enough lotion to cover the entire scalp area and hair thoroughly. Use up to one entire tube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the lotion on your hair and scalp for 10 minutes after you have completely covered your hair and scalp with ivermectin lotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 10 minutes have passed, rinse your hair and scalp only with water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You and anyone who helped you apply the lotion should wash your hands carefully after the application and rinsing steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a fine-tooth comb or lice comb to remove the dead lice and nits (empty egg shells) after this treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discard any unused portion of the tube once you finish this treatment. Do not use ivermectin lotion again without talking to your doctor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After using ivermectin lotion, sanitize all the clothing, underwear, pajamas, hats, sheets, pillowcases, and towels you have used recently.
