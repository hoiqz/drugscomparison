<p>Alemtuzumab injection may cause a decrease in the number of blood cells made by your bone marrow. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: unusual bruising or bleeding, small reddish or purple blood spots on your body, pale skin, weakness, or excessive tiredness. You will need to take extra precautions to avoid injury during your treatment because you may bleed heavily from minor cuts or scrapes. Brush your teeth with a soft toothbrush, use an electric razor if you shave, and avoid contact sports and other activities that may cause injury.</p>
<p>Alemtuzumab injection may decrease your ability to fight infection and increase the risk that you will get a serious or life threatening infection. Call your doctor immediately if you develop any signs of infection such as fever (temperature &gt; 100.4 Â°F), cough, sore throat, or a wound that is red, oozing pus, or slow to heal.</p>
<p>You will need to take precautions to decrease the risk of infection during your treatment with alemtuzumab injection. Your doctor will prescribe certain medications to prevent infection. You will take these medications during your treatment and for at least 2 months after your treatment. Take these medications exactly as directed. You should also wash your hands often and avoid people who have contagious infections such as coughs and colds. If you need any type of blood transfusion during your treatment with alemtuzumab injection, you should receive only irradiated blood products (blood products that have been treated to prevent a certain serious reaction that may occur in people who have weakened immune systems).</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor before receiving any vaccines during your treatment with alemtuzumab injection or after your treatment has been completed. Also ask your doctor if you and your family should receive the flu vaccine.</p>
<p>You may experience a serious or fatal reaction while you receive a dose of alemtuzumab injection. You will receive each dose of medication in a medical facility, and your doctor will monitor you carefully while you are receiving the medication. Your doctor will prescribe certain medications to prevent these reactions. You will take these medications by mouth shortly before you receive each dose of alemtuzumab. Your doctor will start you on a low dose of alemtuzumab and gradually increase your dose to allow your body to adjust to the medication. If you experience any of the following symptoms during or after your infusion, tell your doctor immediately: fever; chills; nausea; vomiting; hives; rash; itching; difficulty breathing or swallowing; slowed breathing; tightening of the throat; swelling of the eyes, face, mouth, lips, tongue or throat; hoarseness; dizziness; lightheadedness; fainting; fast or irregular heartbeat; or chest pain.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests during and after your treatment to check your body's response to alemtuzumab injection.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving alemtuzumab injection.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Alemtuzumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over at least 2 hours by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or medical office. At first, alemtuzumab injection is usually given in gradually increasing doses for 3 to 7 days to allow the body to adjust to the medication. Once the body has adjusted to the needed dose of alemtuzumab injection, the medication is usually given three times weekly on alternate days (usually Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for up to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The medications you receive before each dose of alemtuzumab injection might make you sleepy. You will probably want to ask a family member or friend to come with you when you receive your medication and to take you home afterward.</p>
<p>Although your condition may improve as soon as 4 to 6 weeks after you begin treatment with alemtuzumab injection, your treatment will probably last for 12 weeks. Your doctor will decide whether to continue your treatment and may adjust your dose depending on how well the medication works for you and on the side effects you experience.</p>
