<p>[Posted 03/14/2013] <strong>ISSUE:</strong> FDA is evaluating unpublished new findings by a group of academic researchers that suggest an increased risk of pancreatitis and pre-cancerous cellular changes called pancreatic duct metaplasia in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with a class of drugs called incretin mimetics. These findings were based on examination of a small number of pancreatic tissue specimens taken from patients after they died from unspecified causes. FDA has asked the researchers to provide the methodology used to collect and study these specimens and to provide the tissue samples so the Agency can further investigate potential pancreatic toxicity associated with the incretin mimetics.</p>
<p>
<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Drugs in the incretin mimetic class include exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), liraglutide (Victoza), sitagliptin (Januvia, Janumet, Janumet XR, Juvisync), saxagliptin (Onglyza, Kombiglyze XR), alogliptin (Nesina, Kazano, Oseni), and linagliptin (Tradjenta, Jentadueto). These drugs work by mimicking the incretin hormones that the body usually produces naturally to stimulate the release of insulin in response to a meal. They are used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>
<strong>RECOMMENDATIONS:</strong> FDA has not reached any new conclusions about safety risks with incretin mimetic drugs. This early communication is intended only to inform the public and health care professionals that the Agency intends to obtain and evaluate this new information. FDA will participate in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Workshop on Pancreatitis-Diabetes-Pancreatic Cancer in June 2013 to gather and share additional information. FDA will communicate its final conclusions and recommendations when its review is complete or when the Agency has additional information to report. </p>
<p>The Warnings and Precautions section of drug labels and patient Medication Guides for incretin mimetics contain warnings about the risk of acute pancreatitis. FDA has not previously communicated about the potential risk of pre-cancerous findings of the pancreas with incretin mimetics. FDA has not concluded these drugs may cause or contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>
<strong>At this time, patients should continue to take their medicine as directed until they talk to their health care professional, and health care professionals should continue to follow the prescribing recommendations in the drug labels.</strong> For more information visit the FDA website at: <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation">http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation</a> and <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety</a>.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Linagliptin is used along with diet and exercise and sometimes with other medications to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (condition in which blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally). Linagliptin is in a class of medications called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances that lower blood sugar when it is high. Linagliptin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated). Linagliptin used in combination with insulin to treat diabetes has not been studied to date.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Linagliptin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take linagliptin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take linagliptin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Linagliptin helps to control high blood sugar but does not cure diabetes. Continue to take linagliptin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking linagliptin without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

<h3>Before taking linagliptin,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to linagliptin, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in linagliptin tablets. Ask your pharmacist or check the manufacturer's patient information for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: carbamazepine (Tegretol); insulin; oral medications for diabetes such as acetohexamide, chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glimepiride (Amaryl, in Avandaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol, in Metaglip), glyburide (Diabeta, Glynase, Micronase, in Glucovance), nateglinide (Starlix), pioglitazone (Actos, in Actoplus Met, in Duetact), repaglinide (Prandin), rosiglitazone (Avandia, in Avandamet, in Avandaryl), tolazamide, and tolbutamide; phenytoin (Dilantin); phenobarbital; rifabutin (Mycobutin); rifampin (Rifadin, in Rifamate, in Rifater); and ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra).

<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking linagliptin.</li>
<li>talk to your doctor about what you should do if you get hurt or if you develop a fever or infection. These conditions may affect your blood sugar and the amount of linagliptin you may need for treatment.</li>

<h2>What other information should I know?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) should be checked regularly to determine your response to linagliptin.
