<h2>About your treatment</h2>

<p>Your doctor has ordered interferon alfacon-1 to help treat your hepatitis C infection. The drug will be injected under your skin (subcutaneously) three times a week. Your healthcare provider will show you what to do.</p>
<p>Interferon alfacon-1 is a synthetic interferon that helps to prevent the hepatitis C virus from growing inside your body. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
<p>Your healthcare provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how you respond to the medication.</p>

<h2>Administering your medication</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Before you administer interferon alfacon-1, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored or if it contains particles. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your healthcare provider.</p>
<p>It is important that you use your medication exactly as directed. Do not stop your therapy on your own for any reason because your infection may worsen and result in hospitalization. Do not administer it more often than or for longer periods than your doctor tells you. Do not change your dosing schedule without talking to your healthcare provider.</p>
