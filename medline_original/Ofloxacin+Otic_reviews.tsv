<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ofloxacin otic is used to treat outer ear infections in adults and children, chronic (long-lasting) middle ear infections in adults and children with a perforated eardrum (a condition where the eardrum has a hole in it), and acute (suddenly occurring) middle ear infections in children with ear tubes. Ofloxacin otic is in a class of medications called quinolone antibiotics. It works by killing the bacteria that cause infection.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ofloxacin otic comes as a solution (liquid) to place into the ear. It is usually used once or twice a day for 7 to 14 days, depending on your condition. Use ofloxacin otic at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ofloxacin otic exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Ofloxacin otic is only for use in the ears. Do not use in the eyes.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with ofloxacin otic. If your symptoms do not improve after one week or get worse, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Use ofloxacin otic until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ofloxacin otic too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<h3>To use the eardrops, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hold the bottle or single-dispensing container(s) in your hand for 1 or 2 minutes to warm the solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lie down with the affected ear upward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the prescribed number of drops or the contents of the prescribed number of single-dispensing containers into your ear </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using a bottle of solution, be careful not to touch the tip to your ear, fingers, or any other surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For middle ear infections, push the tragus (small flap of cartilage just in front of the ear canal near the face) of the ear inward four times so that the drops will enter the middle ear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remain lying down with the affected ear upward for 5 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat steps 1-6 for the opposite ear if necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
