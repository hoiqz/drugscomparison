<p>Toremifene may cause QT prolongation (an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to fainting, loss of consciousness, seizures, or sudden death). Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had long QT syndrome (an inherited condition in which a person is more likely to have QT prolongation) or you have or have ever had low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood, an irregular heartbeat, heart failure, or liver disease. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking amitriptyline (Elavil); antifungals such as ketoconazole (Nizoral), itraconazole (Sporanox), or voriconazole (Vfend); clarithromycin (Biaxin, in Prevpac); erythromycin (E.E.S., E-Mycin, Erythrocin); granisetron (Kytril); haloperidol (Haldol); certain medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) such as atazanavir (Reyataz), indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (Norvir, in Kaletra), and saquinavir (Invirase); certain medications for irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone), disopyramide (Norpace), dofetilide (Tikosyn), ibutilide (Corvert), procainamide (Procanbid, Pronestyl), quinidine, and sotalol (Betapace, Betapace AF); levofloxacin (Levaquin); nefazodone; ofloxacin; ondansetron (Zofran); telithromycin (Ketek); thioridazine; and venlafaxine (Effexor). If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking toremifene and call your doctor immediately: fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat; fainting; loss of consciousness; or seizures.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your body's response to toremifene. Your doctor also may order electrocardiograms (EKGs, tests that record the electrical activity of the heart) before and during your treatment to be sure that it is safe for you to take toremifene.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking toremifene.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Toremifene is used to treat breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body in women who have experienced menopause ('change of life'; end of monthly menstrual periods). Toremifene is in a class of medications called nonsteroidal antiestrogens. It works by blocking the activity of estrogen (a female hormone) in the breast. This may stop the growth of some breast tumors that need estrogen to grow.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Toremifene comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. Take toremifene at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take toremifene exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>

<h3>Before taking toremifene,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to toremifene, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in toremifene tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention the medications listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section and any of the following: anticoagulants (''blood thinners'') such as warfarin (Coumadin); carbamazepine (Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol);  cimetidine (Tagamet); clonazepam (Klonopin); dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone); diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac, others); diuretics ('water pills'); fluvoxamine; phenobarbital; phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); rifabutin (Mycobutin); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane); and verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin, Verelan). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Many other medications may also interact with toremifene, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list.</li>
<li>tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if your cancer has spread to your bones and if you have or have ever had any condition that causes your blood to clot more easily than normal  or endometrial hyperplasia (overgrowth of the lining of the uterus).</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking toremifene, call your doctor. Toremifene may harm the fetus. If you have not experienced menopause, you should use a reliable nonhormonal method of birth control to prevent pregnancy while you are taking toremifene.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking toremifene.</li>
<li>you should know that your tumor may grow slightly bigger when you begin treatment with toremifene. If this happens, you may experience redness of the skin and bone pain. This is normal and does not mean that your cancer is worsening. As you continue your treatment with toremifene, your tumor will shrink.</li>
