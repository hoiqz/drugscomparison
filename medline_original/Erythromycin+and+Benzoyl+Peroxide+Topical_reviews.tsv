<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>The combination of erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide comes as a gel to apply to the skin. It is usually applied twice a day, in the morning and evening. To help you remember to use erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide gel, apply it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide gel exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>It may take several weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of this medication. Continue to use this medication even if you do not see much improvement at first.</p>
<h3>To use the gel, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash the affected areas with a mild soapless cleanser and gently pat dry with a clean towel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your medication comes in a large jar, remove a pea-sized dab with your finger and go on to step 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your medication comes in small pouches, use scissors or your fingers to tear off the top at the notched tab. Do not open the pouch with your teeth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squeeze the contents of the pouch onto your palm. You will see a clear gel and a white gel. Use your fingertip to blend the gels with 5-10 circular motions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your fingertips to spread a thin layer of gel evenly over the affected area. Avoid getting the gel in your eyes, nose, mouth, or other body openings. If you do get the gel in your eyes, wash with warm water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look in the mirror. If you see a white film on your skin, you have used too much medication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throw away the empty pouch and wash your hands.</p>
</li>
</ol>
