<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide comes as a shampoo to apply to the skin and hair. It is usually applied to the skin and hair in two or three treatments. The second treatment must be applied 7-10 days after the first one. Sometimes a third treatment may be necessary, as recommended by your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label or the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package label or prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>The package label gives you an estimate of how much shampoo you will need based on your hair length. Be sure to use enough shampoo to cover all of your scalp area and hair.</p>
<p>Pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo should only be used on the skin or hair and scalp. Avoid getting pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo in your eyes, nose, mouth, or vagina. Do not use it on your eyebrows or eyelashes.</p>
<p>If pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo gets in your eyes, flush them with water right away. If your eyes are still irritated after flushing with water, call your doctor or get medical help right away.</p>
<h3>To use the shampoo, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Shake the shampoo well right before use to mix the medication evenly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a towel to cover your face and eyes. Be sure to keep your eyes closed during this treatment. You may need to have an adult help you apply the shampoo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo to your dry hair and scalp area or skin. If you have head lice, begin to apply the shampoo behind your ears and at the back of your neck and then cover all of the hair on your head and scalp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the shampoo on for 10 minutes, but no longer. You should use a timer or clock to track the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 10 minutes, use a small amount of warm water to form a lather and shampoo as usual. Rinse your hair and scalp or skin thoroughly with warm water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have head lice, dry your hair with a towel and comb out tangles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lice comb may also be used to remove the dead lice and nits (empty egg shells) after this treatment. You may also need to have an adult help you to do this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need to repeat this entire process in 7-10 days to kill the lice that hatch from eggs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After using pyrethrin and piperonyl butoxide shampoo, sanitize all the clothing, underwear, pajamas, hats, sheets, pillowcases, and towels you have used recently. These items should be washed in very hot water or dry-cleaned. You should also wash combs, brushes, hairs clips and other personal care items in hot water.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
