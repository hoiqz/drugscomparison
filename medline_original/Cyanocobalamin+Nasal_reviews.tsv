<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Cyanocobalamin nasal gel is used to prevent a lack of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> that may be caused by any of the following: pernicious anemia (lack of a natural substance needed to absorb vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from the intestine); certain diseases, infections or medications that decrease the amount of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorbed from food; or a vegan diet (strict vegetarian diet that does not allow any animal products including eggs and dairy products). Lack of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can cause anemia (condition in which the red blood cells do not bring enough oxygen to the organs) and permanent damage to the nerves. This anemia must be treated with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> injections. After the red blood cells have returned to normal, cyanocobalamin nasal gel can be used to stop anemia and other symptoms of lack of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> from coming back. Cyanocobalamin nasal gel is also used to supply extra vitamin B<sub>12</sub> to people who need unusually large amounts of this vitamin because they are pregnant or have certain diseases. Cyanocobalamin nasal gel is in a class of medications called vitamins. It enters the bloodstream through the nose, so it can be used to supply vitamin B<sub>12</sub> to people who cannot take in this vitamin through the intestine.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Cyanocobalamin comes as a gel to apply to the inside of the nose. It is usually used once a week. To help you remember to use cyanocobalamin nasal gel, use it on the same day of the week every week. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use cyanocobalamin nasal gel exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Cyanocobalamin nasal gel will supply you with enough vitamin B<sub>12</sub> only as long as you use it regularly. You may need to use cyanocobalamin nasal gel every week for the rest of your life. Continue to use cyanocobalamin nasal gel even if you feel well. Do not stop using cyanocobalamin nasal gel without talking to your doctor. If you stop using cyanocobalamin nasal gel, your anemia may return and your nerves may be damaged.</p>
<p>Hot foods and drinks may cause your nose to produce mucus that can wash away cyanocobalamin nasal gel. Do not eat or drink hot foods or drinks for 1 hour before you plan to use cyanocobalamin nasal gel or for 1 hour after you use this medication.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will show you how to use cyanocobalamin nasal gel. You will also be given the manufacturer's printed information on using this medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p>
