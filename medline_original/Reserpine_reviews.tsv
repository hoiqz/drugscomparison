<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Reserpine is used to treat high blood pressure. It also is used to treat severe agitation in patients with mental disorders. Reserpine is in a class of medications called rauwolfia alkaloids. It works by slowing the activity of the nervous system, causing the heartbeat to slow and the blood vessels to relax.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Reserpine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once daily. Take reserpine at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take reserpine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Reserpine controls high blood pressure or symptoms of agitation, but does not cure them. Continue to take reserpine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking reserpine without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking reserpine you may develop high blood pressure and experience unwanted side effects.</p>
