If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fever, sore throat, chills, frequent or painful urination, or other signs of infection; new sores or changes on the skin; night sweats; swollen glands in the neck, armpits, or groin; unexplained weight loss; trouble breathing; chest pain; weakness or tiredness that does not go away; or pain, swelling, or fullness in the stomach.</p>

<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to sirolimus.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Sirolimus comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day, either always with food or always without food. To help you remember to take sirolimus, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sirolimus exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably adjust your dose of sirolimus during your treatment, usually not more than once every 7 to 14 days.</p>
<p>Continue to take sirolimus even if you feel well. Do not stop taking sirolimus without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Sirolimus solution may develop a haze when refrigerated. If this happens, let the bottle stand at room temperature and gently shake it until the haze goes away. The haze does not mean that the medication is damaged or unsafe to use.</p>
<h3>To use the bottles of solution, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the solution bottle. On first use, insert the plastic tube with stopper tightly into the bottle until it is even with the top of the bottle. Do not remove from the bottle once inserted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each use, tightly insert one of the amber syringes, with the plunger fully pushed in, into the opening in the plastic tube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw up the amount of solution your doctor has prescribed by gently pulling out the plunger of the syringe until the bottom of the black line of the plunger is even with the correct mark on the syringe. Keep the bottle upright. If bubbles form in the syringe, empty the syringe into the bottle and repeat this step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empty the syringe into a glass or plastic cup containing at least 2 ounces (60 milliliters [1/4 cup]) of water or orange juice. Do not use apple juice, grapefruit juice, or other liquids. Stir vigorously for 1 minute and drink immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refill the cup with at least 4 ounces (120 milliliters [1/2 cup]) of water or orange juice. Stir vigorously and drink the rinse solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throw away the used syringe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need to carry a filled syringe with you, snap a cap onto the syringe and put the syringe in the carrying case. Use the medication in the syringe within 24 hours.</p>
