<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Sulfinpyrazone comes as a tablet and capsule to take by mouth. Sulfinpyrazone usually is taken twice a day. Take with food or milk. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sulfinpyrazone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>

<h2>What special dietary instructions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Sulfinpyrazone helps your body get rid of uric acid through your urine. This process may cause kidney stones. To help prevent kidney stones, be sure to drink 10 to 12 glasses (8 ounces [240 milliliters] each) of fluid each day or drink enough water to keep your urine a light yellow color.</p>
