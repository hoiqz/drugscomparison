<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Difluprednate ophthalmic comes as an emulsion (liquid) to apply to the eye. It is usually applied to the affected eye(s) 4 times a day beginning 24 hours after surgery and continuing for 2 weeks, and then 2 times a day for 1 week. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually depending on your condition and how you respond to treatment. Use difluprednate eye drops at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use difluprednate ophthalmic exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>When you use difluprednate eye drops, be careful not to let the tip of the bottle touch your eyes, fingers, face, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops. Using eye drops that are contaminated with bacteria may cause serious damage to the eye or loss of vision. If you think your eye drops have become contaminated, call your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<h3>To use the eye drops, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eyedrops and dropper must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>you should know that difluprednate eye drops may slow healing after surgery, increase the risk of certain complications after cataract surgery, and increase your chances of getting an eye infection or worsen an infection that you already have. Call your doctor right away if your pain and swelling do not improve or if you have any of the following symptoms: eye redness, itching, tearing, or discharge;  feeling that something is in your eye; seeing floating spots; sensitivity to light;  or red, swollen, or crusty eyelids.</li>
