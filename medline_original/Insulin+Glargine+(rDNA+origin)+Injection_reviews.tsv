<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Insulin glargine is used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin glargine must be used with another type of insulin (a short-acting insulin). In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin glargine also may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin glargine is a long-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin glargine works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Insulin glargine comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is injected once a day. You should use insulin glargine at the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use insulin glargine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Insulin glargine controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use insulin glargine even if you feel well. Do not stop using insulin glargine without talking to your doctor. Do not switch to another brand or type of insulin or change the dose of any type of insulin you are using without talking to your doctor. Always check the insulin label to make sure you received the right type of insulin from the pharmacy.</p>
<p>Insulin glargine comes in vials and in dosing pens that contain cartridges of medication. Be sure you know what type of container your insulin glargine comes in and what other supplies, such as needles, syringes, or pens, you will need to inject your medication.</p>
<p>If your insulin glargine comes in vials, you will need to use syringes to inject your dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to inject insulin glargine using a syringe. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of syringe you should use.</p>
<p>If your insulin glargine comes in pens, be sure to read and understand the manufacturer's instructions. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the pen. Follow the directions carefully, and always perform the safety test before use.</p>
<p>Never reuse needles or syringes and never share needles, syringes, or pens. If you are using an insulin pen, always remove the needle right after you inject your dose. Throw away needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.</p>
<p>Do not dilute insulin glargine and do not mix insulin glargine with any other type of insulin.</p>
<p>You can inject your insulin glargine in your upper arm, thigh, or stomach. Never inject insulin glargine into a vein or muscle. Change (rotate) the injection site within the chosen area with each dose; try to avoid injecting the same site more often than once every 1 to 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Always look at your insulin glargine before you inject it. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use your insulin glargine if it is colored, cloudy, or contains solid particles, or if the expiration date on the bottle has passed.</p>
<p>Do not use insulin glargine in an external insulin pump.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
