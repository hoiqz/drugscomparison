<h2>About your treatment</h2>

<p>Your doctor has ordered the drug trimetrexate to help treat your illness. The drug can be given by injection into a vein.</p>
<h3>This medication is used to treat:

</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>infections caused by the bacteria <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em> in patients that do not have a fully functioning immune system</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
<p>Trimetrexate resembles a normal nutrient needed for cell growth. The <em>Pneumocystis</em> bacteria and cancer cells take in trimetrexate, which then interferes with their growth. You also will be given the drug leucovorin with each trimetrexate treatment. Leucovorin replaces the same needed nutrient in normal cells. <em>Pneumocystis</em> bacteria and cancer cells cannot use leucovorin. Take leucovorin exactly as prescribed by your doctor.</p>

<h2>Precautions</h2>

<h3>Before taking trimetrexate,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to trimetrexate or any other drugs.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin, clotrimazole (Mycelex), erythromycin, fluconazole (Diflucan), ketoconazole (Nizoral), miconazole(Monistat), rifabutin (Mycobutin), rifampin (Rifadin), zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir), and vitamins.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease, stomach ulcers, or intestinal disease.</li>
<li>you should know that trimetrexate may interfere with the normal menstrual cycle (period) in women and may stop sperm production in men. However, you should not assume that you cannot get pregnant or that you cannot get someone else pregnant. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should tell their doctors before they begin taking this drug. You should not plan to have children while receiving chemotherapy or for a while after treatments. (Talk to your doctor for further details.) Use a reliable method of birth control to prevent pregnancy. Trimetrexate may harm the fetus.</li>
<li>do not have any vaccinations (e.g., measles or flu shots) without talking to your doctor.</li>
