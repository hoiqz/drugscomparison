<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Atazanavir is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Atazanavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although atazanavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Atazanavir comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with a meal or snack. Take atazanavir at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take atazanavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You will take other medications for HIV while you are taking atazanavir. Your doctor will tell you whether these medications should be taken at the same time as atazanavir, or several hours before or after you take atazanavir. Follow this schedule carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the times you should take your medications.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or open them.</p>
<p>Atazanavir helps to control HIV infection, but it does not cure it. Continue to take atazanavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking atazanavir without talking to your doctor. When your supply of atazanavir starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you stop taking atazanavir or skip doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

<li>if you are taking antacids, didanosine delayed-release capsules (Videx EC), or any other buffered medication such as buffered aspirin (Bufferin), take atazanavir 2 hours before or 1 hour after you take the medication.

<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had an irregular heartbeat, diabetes or high blood sugar, hemophilia (a condition in which the blood does not clot normally) or any other bleeding disorder, hepatitis (a viral infection of the liver) or any other liver disease, kidney or heart disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking atazanavir, call your doctor. You should not breast-feed if you are infected with HIV and are taking atazanavir.</li>

<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking atazanavir.</li>
<li>you should know that you may experience hyperglycemia (increases in your blood sugar) while you are taking this medication, even if you do not already have diabetes. Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking atazanavir: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, or weakness. It is very important to call your doctor as soon as you have any of these symptoms, because high blood sugar that is not treated can cause a serious condition called ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis may become life-threatening if it is not treated at an early stage. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include: dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, breath that smells fruity, and decreased consciousness.</li>
<li>you should know that while you are taking atazanavir your body fat may increase or move to different areas of your body such as the back of your neck and upper shoulders ('buffalo hump'), stomach, and breasts. You may lose fat from your arms, legs, face, and buttocks. Talk to your doctor if you notice any of these changes in your body fat.</li>
<li>you should know that while you are taking medications to treat HIV infection, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms at anytime during your treatment with atazanavir, be sure to tell your doctor.</li>
