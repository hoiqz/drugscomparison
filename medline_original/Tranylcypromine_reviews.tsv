<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>A small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as tranylcypromine during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take tranylcypromine, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that tranylcypromine is the best medication to treat a child's condition.</p>
<p>You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take tranylcypromine or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over age 24. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor when you are unable to seek treatment on your own.</p>
<p>Your healthcare provider will want to see you often while you are taking tranylcypromine, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to keep all appointments for office visits with your doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with tranylcypromine. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You also can obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website: <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrugClass/UCM096273">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrugClass/UCM096273</a>.</p>
<p>No matter what your age, before you take an antidepressant, you, your parent, or your caregiver should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with an antidepressant or with other treatments. You should also talk about the risks and benefits of not treating your condition. You should know that having depression or another mental illness greatly increases the risk that you will become suicidal. This risk is higher if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited) or mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood) or has thought about or attempted suicide. Talk to your doctor about your condition, symptoms, and personal and family medical history. You and your doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Tranylcypromine is used to treat depression in people who have not been helped by other medications. Tranylcypromine is in a class of medications called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances that are needed to maintain mental balance.</p>
<a name="how">
    </a>
</div>
<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Tranylcypromine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day. Take tranylcypromine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tranylcypromine exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Tranylcypromine may be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. Call your doctor if you find that you want to take extra medication or you notice any other unusual changes in your behavior or mood.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of tranylcypromine and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 1-3 weeks. After your symptoms improve, your doctor will probably gradually decrease your dose of tranylcypromine.</p>
<p>Tranylcypromine controls the symptoms of depression but does not cure the condition. It may take 3 weeks or longer for you to feel the full benefit of tranylcypromine. Continue to take tranylcypromine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tranylcypromine without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually.</p>

<h2>What special dietary instructions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

Your doctor or dietitian will tell you which foods you must avoid completely, and which foods you may eat in small amounts.
