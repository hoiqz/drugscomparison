<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Pancrelipase delayed-release capsules (Creon, Pancreaze, Pertzye, Ultresa, Zenpep) are used to improve digestion of food in children and adults who do not have enough pancreatic enzymes (substances needed to break down food so it can be digested) because they have a condition that affects the pancreas (a gland that produces several important substances including enzymes needed to digest food) such as cystic fibrosis (an inborn disease that causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus that may clog the pancreas, the lungs, and other parts of the body), chronic pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas that does not go away), or a blockage in the passages between the pancreas and the intestine. Pancrelipase delayed-release capsules (Creon, Pancreaze, Zenpep) are also used to improve digestion of food in infants who do not have enough pancreatic enzymes (substances needed to break down food so it can be digested) because they have cystic fibrosis or another condition that affects the pancreas. Pancrelipase delayed-release capsules (Creon) are also used to improve digestion in people who have had surgery to remove all or part of the pancreas or stomach. Pancrelipase tablets (Viokace) are used along with another medication (proton pump inhibitor; PPI) to improve digestion of foods in adults who have chronic pancreatitis or who have had surgery to remove the pancreas. Pancrelipase is in a class of medications called enzymes.  Pancrelipase acts in place of the enzymes normally made by the pancreas.  It works to decrease fatty bowel movements and to improve nutrition by breaking down fats, proteins, and starches from food into smaller substances that can be absorbed from the intestine.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Pancrelipase comes as a tablet, and a delayed-release capsule to take by mouth. It is taken with plenty of water with every meal or snack, usually 5 to 6 times per day.  Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take pancrelipase exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Pancrelipase is sold under several different brand names, and there are differences among the brand name products. Do not switch to a different brand of pancrelipase without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets and delayed-release capsules whole with plenty of water; do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not suck the tablets or capsules or hold them in your mouth. Be sure that none of the tablet is left in your mouth after you swallow it.</p>
<p>If you cannot swallow the delayed-release capsules whole, you can open the capsules and mix the contents with a small amount of a soft, acidic food such as applesauce. You may be able to mix the capsule contents with certain other foods. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Swallow the mixture right after you mix it without chewing or crushing the capsule contents. After you swallow the mixture, drink a full glass of water or juice right away to wash down the medication.</p>
<p>If you are giving the delayed release capsules to a baby, you may open the capsule, sprinkle the contents on a small amount of a soft, acidic food such as jarred baby applesauce, bananas or pears, and feed it to the baby right away. Do not mix the capsule contents with formula or breast-milk. You can also sprinkle the contents directly into the baby's mouth. After you give the baby pancrelipase, give plenty of liquid to wash down the medication. Then look in the baby's mouth to be sure that he or she has swallowed all of the medication.</p>
<p>The contents of the delayed-release capsule must be taken right after the capsule is opened. Do not open capsules or prepare mixtures of capsules and food before you are ready to use them. Throw away any unused capsule contents or pancrelipase and food mixtures; do not save them for future use.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of medication and gradually increase your dose depending on your response to treatment and the amount of fat in your diet. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling and whether your bowel symptoms improve during your treatment. Do not change the dose of your medication unless your doctor tells you that you should.</p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you the maximum amount of pancrelipase you should take in one day. Do not take more than this amount of pancrelipase in one day even if you eat more than your usual number of meals and snacks. Talk to your doctor if you are eating additional meals and snacks.</p>
<p>Pancrelipase will help improve your digestion only as long as you continue to take it. Continue to take pancrelipase even if you feel well. Do not stop taking pancrelipase without talking to your doctor. </p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with pancrelipase and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. </p>
