<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Fluvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Fluvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of cholesterol (a fat-like substance) and other fatty substances in the blood. Fluvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Fluvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Fluvastatin comes as a capsule and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The capsule is usually taken with or without food once a day at bedtime or twice a day.

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of fluvastatin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Continue to take fluvastatin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking fluvastatin without talking to your doctor.</p>
