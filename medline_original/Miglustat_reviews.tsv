<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Miglustat is used to treat Gaucher's disease (a condition in which a certain fatty substance is not broken down normally in the body and instead builds up in some organs and causes liver, spleen, bone, and blood problems). Miglustat is in a class of medications called enzyme inhibitors. It works by preventing the body from producing the fatty substance so that less of it will build up in the body and cause symptoms.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Miglustat comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food and with plenty of water up to three times a day. To help you remember to take miglustat, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take miglustat exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Miglustat controls Gaucher disease but does not cure it. Continue to take miglustat even if you feel well. Do not stop taking miglustat without talking to your doctor.</p>
