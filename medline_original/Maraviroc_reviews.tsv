<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Maraviroc is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Maraviroc is in a class of medications called HIV entry and fusion inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although maraviroc does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</p>

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow maraviroc tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
