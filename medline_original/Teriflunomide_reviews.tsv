<p>Teriflunomide may cause serious or life-threatening liver damage. The risk of liver damage may be increased in people taking other medications known to cause liver damage, and in people who already have liver disease. Tell your doctor if you have liver disease. Your doctor may tell you not to take teriflunomide. Tell your doctor and pharmacist about all the medications you are taking so they can check whether any of your medications may increase the risk that you will develop liver damage during your treatment with teriflunomide. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: nausea, vomiting, extreme tiredness, unusual bleeding or bruising, lack of energy, loss of appetite, pain in the upper right part of the stomach, yellowing of the skin or eyes, dark-colored urine, or flu-like symptoms. If liver damage is suspected, your doctor may stop teriflunomide treatment and may give you a treatment that will help to remove teriflunomide more quickly from your body.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests before you begin your treatment and regularly during your treatment to check your body's response to teriflunomide.</p>
<p>Do not take teriflunomide if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Teriflunomide may harm the fetus. You should not begin taking teriflunomide until you have taken a pregnancy test with negative results and your doctor tells you that you are not pregnant. You must use an effective method of birth control before you begin taking teriflunomide, during your treatment with teriflunomide, and for up to 2 years after treatment, until blood tests show that you have low enough levels of teriflunomide in your blood. If your period is late, you miss a period, or you think you may be pregnant during your treatment with teriflunomide or for 2 years after your treatment, call your doctor immediately. If you plan to become pregnant or can become pregnant, talk to your doctor about a treatment that will help to remove teriflunomide more quickly from your body after you stop taking the medication.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with teriflunomide and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking teriflunomide.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Teriflunomide is used to prevent episodes of symptoms and slow the worsening of disability in patients with relapsing forms (course of disease where symptoms flare up from time to time) of multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control). Teriflunomide is in a class of medications called immunomodulatory agents. It is thought to work by decreasing inflammation and decreasing the action of immune cells that may cause nerve damage.</p>
<a name="how">

<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Teriflunomide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day, with or without food. Take teriflunomide at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take teriflunomide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Teriflunomide may help control the symptoms of multiple sclerosis but does not cure it. Continue to take teriflunomide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking teriflunomide without talking to your doctor.</p>

<h3>Before taking teriflunomide,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to teriflunomide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in teriflunomide tablets. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are taking leflunomide (Arava). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take teriflunomide if you are taking this medication.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention the medications listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section and any of the following: alosetron (Lotronex); anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); duloxetine (Cymbalta); eltrombopag (Promacta); gefitinib (Iressa); medications that can cause nerve damage such as medications for cancer, HIV, or AIDS; other medications that suppress the immune system such as azathioprine (Imuran), cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune), sirolimus (Rapamune), and tacrolimus (Prograf); oral contraceptives (birth control pills); paclitaxel (Abraxane); pioglitazone (Actos, in Actoplus Met, in Duetact); repaglinide (Prandin, in Prandimet); rosiglitazone (Avandia, in Avandamet, in Avandaryl); theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Uniphyl, others); and tizanidine (Zanaflex).

Many other medications may also interact with teriflunomide, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have an infection now, including an ongoing infection that does not go away, or if you have or have ever had a serious skin reaction after you took another medication; diabetes; breathing problems; cancer or other conditions affecting the bone marrow or the immune system; high blood pressure; peripheral neuropathy (numbness, burning or tingling in the hands or feet that feels different from your MS symptoms);</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.</li>
<li>if your partner plans to become pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about stopping teriflunomide and receiving a treatment to help remove this medication from your body more quickly. If your partner does not plan to become pregnant, you and your partner should use an effective method of birth control during your treatment with teriflunomide and for up to 2 years after treatment, until blood tests show that you have low enough levels of teriflunomide in your blood.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking teriflunomide.</li>
