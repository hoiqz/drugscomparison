<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Metronidazole is used to treat acne rosacea (adult acne), a chronic condition in which the facial skin is inflamed and sores develop. Metronidazole decreases the redness and number of sores but may not be a cure. It is also used to treat some vaginal infections.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Metronidazole comes as a cream, lotion, or gel to be applied to your skin and as a gel to be used in the vagina. Metronidazole usually is used once or twice a day. It is used twice daily for 5 consecutive days to treat vaginal infections. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use metronidazole exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you are using metronidazole to treat acne, your symptoms probably will improve within 3 weeks and continue to improve over the following 6 weeks or more. Continue to use metronidazole. Do not stop using metronidazole without talking to your doctor. Your symptoms may worsen when you stop the drug.</p>
<p>For acne, wash the affected skin area with mild soap about 15-20 minutes before applying the medication. Apply a thin layer of cream, lotion, or gel and rub it gently into the affected area. Do not allow the gel to get into your eyes. You may then apply a moisturizer (if your skin is dry) and cosmetics. Ask your doctor for advice on what cosmetics to use.</p>
<h3>Metronidazole gel for the vagina comes with a special applicator. Read the instructions provided with it and follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fill the special applicator that comes with the gel to the level indicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lie on your back with your knees drawn upward and spread apart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently insert the applicator into your vagina and push the plunger to release the medication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdraw the applicator and wash it with soap and warm water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands promptly to avoid spreading the infection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The dose should be applied when you lie down to go to bed. The drug works best if you do not get up again after applying the drug except to wash your hands and the applicator. You may wish to wear a sanitary napkin while using the vaginal gel to protect your clothing against stains. Do not use a tampon because it will absorb the drug. While using this drug, do not douche because it will wash the drug out of the vagina and decrease its effectiveness. Continue using this drug even if you get your period during the time of treatment.</p>
