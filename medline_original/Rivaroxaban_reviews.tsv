<p>If you have epidural or spinal anesthesia or a spinal puncture while taking a 'blood thinner' such as rivaroxaban, you are at risk for having a blood clot form in or around your spine that could cause you to become paralyzed. Tell your doctor if you have an epidural catheter that is left in your body or have or have ever had repeated epidural or spinal punctures, spinal deformity, or spinal surgery. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking anagrelide (Agrylin); other anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), indomethacin (Indocin), ketoprofen (Oruvail), naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprelan), or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); cilostazol (Pletal); clopidogrel (Plavix); dipyridamole (Persantine); eptifibatide (Integrilin); prasugrel (Effient); sulfinpyrazone (Anturane); ticlopidine (Ticlid); and tirofiban (Aggrastat).

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Rivaroxaban is used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT; a blood clot, usually in the leg), which can lead to pulmonary embolism (PE; a blood clot in the lung), in people who are having hip replacement or knee replacement surgery. Rivaroxaban is in a class of medications called factor Xa inhibitors. It works by decreasing the clotting ability of the blood.</p>

<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Rivaroxaban comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. The first dose should be taken at least 6 to 10 hours after surgery. Rivaroxaban can be taken with or without food, unless you are told specifically to take it with food by your doctor or pharmacist. When rivaroxaban is taken after hip replacement surgery, it is usually taken for 35 days. When rivaroxaban is taken after knee replacement surgery, it is usually taken for 12 days. Take rivaroxaban at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rivaroxaban exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Rivaroxaban tablets can be crushed and given in certain types of feeding tubes. Ask your doctor if you should take this medication in your feeding tube. Follow your doctor's directions carefully.</p>
<p>Continue to take rivaroxaban even if you feel well. Do not stop taking rivaroxaban without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking rivaroxaban, your risk of a blood clot may increase.</p>
