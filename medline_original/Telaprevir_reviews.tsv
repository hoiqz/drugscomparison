<p>Telaprevir may cause serious or life-threatening skin reactions. Call your doctor right away or seek emergency medical treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms: rash, blisters, or sores on the skin; itching; fever; yellowing of the skin or eyes; decreased urination; swelling of the face; sores in the mouth; or red, swollen, itchy, or teary eyes. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking telaprevir (and possibly some other medications) if you have skin changes; do not stop taking your medication unless your doctor tells you to do so. If your doctor tells you to stop taking telaprevir because of skin changes, you should not take it again.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Telaprevir is used along with two other medications (ribavirin [Copegus, Rebetol] and peginterferon alfa [Pegasys]) to treat chronic hepatitis C (an ongoing viral infection that damages the liver) in people who have not yet been treated for this condition or whose condition could not successfully be treated with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa alone. Telaprevir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the body. Telaprevir may not prevent the spread of hepatitis C to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Telaprevir comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day (every 7 to 9 hours). You must eat a meal or snack that contains about 20 grams of fat within 30 minutes before you take telaprevir. Examples of foods (regular versions, not low-fat or non-fat products) that could be taken with telaprevir include: a bagel with cream cheese, one half cup nuts, 3 tablespoons peanut butter, 1 cup ice cream, 2 ounces American or cheddar cheese, 2 ounces potato chips, or one-half cup trail mix. Ask your doctor for other examples of foods that contain 20 grams of fat that you can eat when you take telaprevir. Do not take telaprevir without food. Take telaprevir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take telaprevir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Continue to take telaprevir even if you feel well. Telaprevir must be taken in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, usually for 12 weeks. Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin are usually continued after treatment with telaprevir is finished. Do not stop taking telaprevir, peginterferon alfa, or ribavirin, unless told to do so by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with telaprevir and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
