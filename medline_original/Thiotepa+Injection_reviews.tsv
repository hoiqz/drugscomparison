<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Thiotepa is used to treat certain types of ovarian cancer (cancer that begins in the female reproductive organs where eggs are formed), breast, and bladder cancer. It is also used to treat malignant effusions (a condition when fluid collects in the lungs or around the heart) that are caused by cancerous tumors. Thiotepa is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body. </p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Thiotepa comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility. It may also be injected intraperitoneally (into the abdominal cavity), intrapleurally (into the chest cavity), or intrapericardially (into the lining of the heart). The schedule for your treatment depends on your condition and on how you respond to thiotepa.</p>
<p>When used for bladder cancer, thiotepa is infused (injected slowly) into your bladder through a tube or catheter once a week for 4 weeks. Avoid drinking fluids for 8 to 12 hours before your treatment. You should keep the medication in your bladder for 2 hours. If you cannot keep the medication in your bladder for the entire 2 hours, tell your health care provider. </p>
