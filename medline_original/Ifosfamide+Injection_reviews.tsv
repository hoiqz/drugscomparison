This may cause certain symptoms and may increase the risk that you will develop a serious or life-threatening infection or bleeding. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fever, chills, sore throat, ongoing cough and congestion, or other signs of infection; unusual bleeding or bruising; bloody or black, tarry stools; bloody vomit; or vomiting blood or brown material that resembles coffee grounds. </p>
<p>Ifosfamide may cause severe or life-threatening damage to the nervous system. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: confusion; drowsiness; blurred vision; seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist (hallucinating); or pain, burning, numbness, tingling in the hands or feet; seizures; or coma (loss of consciousness for a period of time).</p>
<p>Ifosfamide may cause severe or life-threatening kidney problems. Kidney problems may occur during therapy or months or years after you stop receiving treatment. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had kidney disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: decreased urination; swelling of the face, arms, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs; or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p>
<p>Ifosfamide may cause severe urinary side effects. Tell your doctor if you have problems urinating.
