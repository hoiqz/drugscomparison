<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Latanoprost ophthalmic is used to treat glaucoma (a condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision) and ocular hypertension (a condition which causes increased pressure in the eye). Latanoprost is in a class of medications called prostaglandin analogs. It lowers pressure in the eye by increasing the flow of natural eye fluids out of the eye.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Latanoprost comes as eye drops. Usually, one drop is applied to the affected eye(s) once a day in the evening. If latanoprost is used with other topical eye medications, allow at least 5 minutes between each medication. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use latanoprost exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Latanoprost controls glaucoma but does not cure it. Continue to use latanoprost even if you feel well. Do not stop using latanoprost without talking to your doctor.</p>
<h3>To apply the eye drops, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a mirror or have someone else put the drops in your eye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the end of the dropper is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper against your eye or anything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper tip down at all times to prevent drops from flowing back into the bottle and contaminating the remaining contents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lie down or tilt your head back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding the bottle between your thumb and index finger, place the dropper as near as possible to your eyelid without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your cheek or nose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the index finger of your other hand, pull the lower lid of the eye down to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop the prescribed number of drops into the pocket made by the lower lid and the eye. Placing the drops on the surface of the eyeball can cause stinging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye and press lightly against the lower lid with your finger for 2 to 3 minutes to keep the medication in the eye. Do not blink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap right away. Do not wipe or rinse it off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe off any excess liquid from your cheek with a clean tissue. Wash your hands again.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you still have symptoms of glaucoma (eye pain or blurred vision) after using this medication for a couple of days, call your doctor.</p>

<h2>What side effects can this medication cause?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Latanoprost may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:

</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>stinging, burning, itching, watering, or swelling of the eye</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>redness of the eyelids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>irritation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dry eyes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Latanoprost may increase the brown pigmentation in your iris, changing your eye color to brown. The pigmentation changes may be more noticeable in patients who already have some brown eye coloring. Latanoprost may also cause your eyelashes to grow longer and thicker and darken in color. These changes usually occurs slowly, but they may be permanent. If you use latanoprost in only one eye, you should know that there may be a difference between your eyes after using latanoprost. Call your doctor if you notice these changes.</p>
<p>If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online [at <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch">http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch</a>] or by phone [1-800-332-1088].</p>
