<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Betaxolol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. Take betaxolol at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take betaxolol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of betaxolol and may increase your dose after 7-14 days if your blood pressure is not controlled.</p>
<p>Betaxolol controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. It may take 1-2 weeks or longer before the full benefit of betaxolol is noted. Continue to take betaxolol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking betaxolol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking betaxolol, your blood pressure may increases and you may develop new or worsening chest pain. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually over about 2 weeks and will monitor you carefully during this time. Your doctor may also tell you to limit physical activity while your dose is being decreased.</p>
