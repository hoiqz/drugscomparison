<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Calcitonin salmon is used to treat osteoporosis in women who are at least 5 years past menopause and cannot or do not want to take estrogen products. Osteoporosis is a disease that causes bones to weaken and break more easily. Calcitonin is a human hormone that is also found in salmon. It works by preventing bone breakdown and increasing bone density (thickness).</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Calcitonin salmon comes as a spray to be used in the nose. It is usually used once a day, alternating nostrils every day. To help you remember to use calcitonin salmon, use it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use calcitonin salmon exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Calcitonin salmon helps treat osteoporosis but does not cure it. Continue to use calcitonin salmon even if you feel well. Do not stop using calcitonin salmon without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Before using calcitonin salmon nasal spray the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use it. Practice using the nasal spray while he or she watches.</p>
<p>To put the pump and bottle together, remove the rubber stopper from the bottle, and then remove the plastic protective cap from the bottom of the spray unit. Put the spray pump into the bottle and turn to tighten. Then take the plastic cover off of the top of the spray unit.</p>
<h3>Before the first time you use a new bottle, you need to prime (activate) the pump. To prime the pump, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allow the bottle to reach room temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the bottle upright, and press down on the two white side arms of the pump at least 5 times, until a full spray is produced. The pump is now primed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>To use the nasal spray, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Keep your head up and place the nozzle in one nostril.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press down on the pump to release the calcitonin salmon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the opposite nostril each day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each bottle has enough medication for 30 doses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
