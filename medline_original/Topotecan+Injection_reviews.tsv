<p>Topotecan injection should be given only in a hospital or clinic under the supervision of a doctor with experience in the use of chemotherapy medications for cancer.</p>
<p>Topotecan injection may cause low levels of white blood cells in the blood. This increases the risk that you will develop a serious infection. You should not receive topotecan injection if you already have a low number of white blood cells. Your doctor will order laboratory tests regularly before and during your treatment to check whether your body has enough white blood cells. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking carboplatin (Paraplatin), cisplatin (Platinol), other chemotherapy medications, or filgrastim (Neupogen). If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fever, sore throat, chills, cough, abdominal pain, or other signs of infection.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of using topotecan injection.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Topotecan is used to treat ovarian cancer (cancer that begins in the female reproductive organs where eggs are formed) and small cell lung cancer (a type of cancer that begins in the lungs) that have spread and did not improve after treatment with other medications. It is also used together with other medications to treat cervical cancer (cancer that begins in the opening of the uterus [womb]) that has not improved or has come back after other treatments. Topotecan is in a class of medications called topoisomerase type I inhibitors. It works by killing cancer cells.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Topotecan comes as a liquid to be given intravenously (into a vein) over 30 minutes by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or clinic. When topotecan injection is used to treat ovarian or lung cancer, it is usually given once a day for 5 days in a row every 21 days. When topotecan injection is used to treat cervical cancer, it is usually given once a day for 3 days in a row every 21 days. You will probably receive at least 4 cycles of treatment since it may take a while to tell if your condition has responded to the medication.</p>
