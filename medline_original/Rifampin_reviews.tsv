<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Rifampin is used with other medications to treat tuberculosis (TB; a serious infection that affects the lungs and sometimes other parts of the body). Rifampin is also used to treat some people who have Neisseria meningitidis (a type of bacteria that can cause a serious infection called meningitis) infections in their noses or throats. These people have not developed symptoms of the disease, and this treatment is used to prevent them from infecting other people. Rifampin should not be used to treat people who have developed symptoms of meningitis. Rifampin is in a class of medications called antimycobacterials. It works by killing the bacteria that cause infection. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Rifampin comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It should be taken with a full glass of water on an empty stomach, 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. When rifampin is used to treat tuberculosis, it is taken once daily. When rifampin is used to prevent the spread of Neisseria meningitidis bacteria to other people, it is taken twice daily for two days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rifampin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you cannot swallow the capsules. Your pharmacist can prepare a liquid for you to take instead.</p>
<p>If you are taking rifampin to treat tuberculosis, your doctor may tell you to take rifampin for several months or longer. Continue to take rifampin until you finish the prescription even if you feel better, and be careful not to miss doses. If you stop taking rifampin too soon, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics. If you miss doses of rifampin, you may develop uncomfortable or serious symptoms when you begin to take the medication again.</p>

<h3>Before taking rifampin,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to rifampin, rifabutin (Mycobutin), rifapentine (Priftin), any other medications, or any of the ingredients in rifampin capsules. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medications: atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista), fosamprenavir (Lexiva), saquinavir (Invirase), tipranavir (Aptivus), or ritonavir (Norvir) and saquinavir (Invirase) taken together. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take rifampin if you are taking any of these medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); antifungals such as fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Onmel, Sporanox), and ketoconazole (Nizoral); atovaquone (Mepron, in Malarone); barbiturates such as phenobarbital; beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), labetalol (Normodyne), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), nadolol (Corgard), and propranolol (Inderal); calcium channel blockers such as dilitiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, Dilacor), nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), and verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin, Verelan); chloramphenicol; clarithromycin (Biaxin); cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune); dapsone; diazepam (Valium); doxycycline (Doryx, Monodox, Vibramycin); enalapril (Vaseretic); fluroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro); haloperidol (Haldol); ; levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Synthroid); medications for irregular heartbeat such as digoxin (Lanoxin), disopyramide (Norpace), mexiletine, and quinidine; medications for seizures such as phenytoin (Dilantin); methadone (Dolophine, Methadose); narcotic medications for pain; oral medications for diabetes; probenecid (Probalan); quinine (Qualquin); steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron), methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone; trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra); tacrolimus; (Prograf); theophylline (Theochron, Theolair); tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (in Limbitrol) and nortriptyline (Pamelor); and zidovudine (Retrovir, in Trizivir). Many other medications may interact with rifampin, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>if you are taking antacids, take them at least 1 hour after you take rifampin.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are taking or using hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, patches, rings, implants, and injections). Rifampin can decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. You should use another method of birth control while taking this medication. Talk to your doctor about birth control while taking rifampin.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had diabetes, porphyria (condition in which certain natural substances build up in the body and may cause stomach pain, changes in thinking and behavior, or other symptoms), any condition that affects your adrenal gland (small gland next to the kidney that produces important natural substances) or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking rifampin, call your doctor.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you wear soft contact lenses. Rifampin may cause permanent red stains on your contact lenses.</li>

However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and call your doctor. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.</p>

<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your response to rifampin.</p>
<p>Before having any laboratory test, including drug screening tests, tell the laboratory personnel that you are taking rifampin. Rifampin may cause the results of certain drug screening tests to be positive even though you have not taken the drugs.</p>
