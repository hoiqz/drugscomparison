<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Morphine is available as long-acting capsules or tablets. These capsules or tablets contain enough morphine to relieve pain for 12 or 24 hours and are designed to release the medication slowly over that period of time. It is very important not to split, chew, or crush these tablets or capsules and not to dissolve the beads contained in the capsules in any liquid before you swallow them. This would release all of the medication into your body at once and could cause serious health problems or death.</p>
<p>If you are taking Oramorph SR or MS Contin brand long-acting tablets or Avinza or Kadian brand long-acting capsules, you should swallow the tablets or capsules whole. If you are unable to swallow the capsules, you can carefully open a capsule, sprinkle all of the beads that it contains on a spoonful of cold or room temperature applesauce, and swallow the entire mixture immediately without chewing or crushing the beads. Then rinse your mouth with a little water and swallow the water to be sure that you have swallowed all the medication. Do not save mixtures of medication and applesauce for later.</p>
<p>If you are taking Avinza brand long-acting capsules, you should not drink any drinks that contain alcohol or take any prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or check the list of ingredients if you do not know if a medication contains alcohol. Alcohol may cause the morphine in Avinza<sup>®</sup> brand long-acting capsules to be released in your body too quickly, causing serious health problems or death.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Morphine is used to relieve moderate to severe pain. Morphine long-acting tablets and capsules are only used by patients who are expected to need medication to relieve moderate to severe pain around-the-clock for longer than a few days. Morphine is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics. It works by changing the way the body senses pain.</p>
<a name="how">
    </a>

<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Morphine comes as a tablet, a solution (liquid), a controlled- or extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and a controlled- or sustained-release (long-acting) capsule all to take by mouth. The regular tablet and liquid usually are taken every 4 hours. The long-acting tablet is usually taken every 8 to 12 hours. Kadian brand long-acting capsules are usually taken with or without food every 12 hours or every 24 hours. Avinza brand long-acting capsules are usually taken once a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.</p>
<p>If you are taking morphine solution, use the spoon or dropper that comes with the medication to measure your dose. Be sure that you know how many milliliters of the solution you should take. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about how much medication you should take or how to use the spoon or dropper.</p>
<p>If you are taking Kadian brand long-acting capsules and you have a gastrostomy tube (surgically inserted feeding tube), ask your doctor or pharmacist how to administer the medication through your tube.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of morphine and gradually increase your dose until your pain is controlled. Your doctor may adjust your dose at any time during your treatment if your pain is not controlled. If you feel that your pain is not controlled, call your doctor. Do not change the dose of your medication without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Morphine can be habit-forming. Take morphine exactly as directed. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time or in a different way than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking morphine without talking to your doctor. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking morphine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety; sweating; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; chills; shaking of a part of your body that you cannot control; nausea; diarrhea; runny nose, sneezing or coughing; hair on your skin standing on end; or hallucinating (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist).</p>
