<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Bepotastine ophthalmic is used to treat itching of the eyes caused by allergic conjunctivitis (a condition in which the eyes become itchy, swollen, red, and teary when they are exposed to certain substances in the air). Bepotastine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action and preventing the release of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Bepotastine comes as an ophthalmic solution (eye drops) to apply to the eyes. It is usually applied to the affected eye(s) twice a day. Use bepotastine eye drops at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use bepotastine eye drops exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>When you use bepotastine eye drops, be careful not to let the tip of the bottle touch your eye, fingers, or any surface. If the tip does touch another surface, bacteria may get into the eye drops. Using eye drops that are contaminated with bacteria may cause serious damage to the eye or loss of vision. If you think your eye drops have become contaminated, call your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<h3>To use the eye drops, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eyedrops and dropper must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Before using bepotastine eye drops,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to bepotastine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in bepotastine eye drops. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any medical condition.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using bepotastine eye drops, call your doctor.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you wear contact lenses. You should not wear contact lenses if your eyes are red and you should not use bepotastine eye drops to treat irritation that you think may be caused by contact lenses. Bepotastine eye drops contain benzalkonium chloride, which can be absorbed by soft contact lenses. You should also not apply bepotastine eye drops while you are wearing contact lenses. Remove your contact lenses before you use bepotastine eye drops and do not replace them for at least 10 minutes afterward.</li>
