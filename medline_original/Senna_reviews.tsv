<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Senna is used on a short-term basis to treat constipation. It also is used to empty the bowels before surgery and certain medical procedures. Senna is in a class of medications called stimulant laxatives. It works by increasing activity of the intestines to cause a bowel movement.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Senna comes as a liquid, powder, granules, and tablets to take by mouth. It is usually taken the evening before a bowel movement is desired. Senna normally causes a bowel movement within 6 to 12 hours. Do not take senna for more than 1 week without talking to your doctor. Follow the directions on your package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take senna exactly as directed. Frequent or continued use of senna may make you dependent on laxatives and cause your bowels to lose their normal activity. If you do not have a regular bowel movement after taking senna, do not take any more medication and talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>If you are taking the senna tablets, swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>

<geriatric-precaut>
