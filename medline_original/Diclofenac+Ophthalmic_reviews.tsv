<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Diclofenac ophthalmic solution is used to treat eye pain, redness, and swelling in patients who are recovering from cataract surgery (procedure to treat clouding of the lens in the eye). Diclofenac ophthalmic solution is also used to temporarily relieve eye pain and sensitivity to light in patients who are recovering from corneal refractive surgery (surgery to improve vision). Diclofenac is in a class of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It works by stopping the production of certain natural substances that cause pain and swelling.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ophthalmic diclofenac comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes. When diclofenac eye drops are used by patients recovering from cataract surgery, they are usually instilled 4 times a day beginning 24 hours after surgery and continuing for 2 weeks after surgery. When diclofenac eye drops are used by patients undergoing corneal refractive surgery, they are usually instilled one hour before the surgery, 15 minutes after the surgery, and then four times a day for up to 3 days. Use diclofenac eye drops at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use diclofenac eye drops exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of them or use them more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<h3>To use the eye drops, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eyedrops and droppers must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
