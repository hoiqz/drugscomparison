<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Denosumab injection (Prolia) is used to treat osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily) in women who have undergone menopause ('change of life;' end of menstrual periods) and have an increased risk for fractures (broken bones) or who cannot take or did not respond to other medications for osteoporosis. Denosumab injection (Xgeva) is used to reduce fractures from cancer that began in another part of the body but has spread to the bones. Denosumab injection (Xgeva) is not used to reduce fractures from multiple myeloma (cancer that begins in the plasma cells [a type of white blood cell that produces substances needed to fight infection]). Denosumab injection is in a class of medications called RANK ligand inhibitors. It works by decreasing bone breakdown and increasing bone strength and density (thickness).</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Denosumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in your upper arm, upper thigh, or stomach area. It is usually injected by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or clinic. When denosumab injection is used to treat osteoporosis, it is usually given once every 6 months. When denosumab injection is used to reduce fractures from cancer that has spread to the bones, it is usually given once every 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you to take supplements of calcium and vitamin D while you are being treated with denosumab injection. Take these supplements exactly as directed.</p>
<p>When denosumab injection is used to treat osteoporosis, your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with denosumab injection and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have hypocalcemia (lower than normal level of calcium in your blood). Your doctor will probably tell you not to receive denosumab injection.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had anemia (condition in which the red blood cells do not bring enough oxygen to all the parts of the body); cancer; any type of infection, especially in your mouth; problems with your mouth, teeth, gums, or dentures; any condition that stops your blood from clotting normally; any condition that decreases functioning of your immune system; thyroid surgery; surgery to remove part of your small intestine; problems with your stomach or intestine that make it difficult for your body to absorb nutrients; or thyroid or kidney disease.</li>
