<p>In 2007, tegaserod was removed from the U.S. market and was made available only through a restricted distribution program from the manufacturer. Beginning in April 2008, tegaserod will no longer be available through the restricted distribution program; therefore, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has decided to make tegaserod available to physicians for patients in emergency situations that are life-threatening or require hospitalization. If your doctor believes that you should receive tegaserod, he or she may contact the FDA for more information. If you are receiving tegaserod through the restricted distribution program, you should talk to your doctor about switching to another treatment.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Tegaserod is used to relieve pain, bloating, and constipation caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; a condition that causes stomach pain, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea) in women whose main symptom is constipation. This medication is also used to increase the frequency of bowel movements and relieve bloating, straining, and stomach pain in women and men with chronic idiopathic constipation (constipation that is not due to other diseases or medications and that has been a problem for longer than 6 months). Tegaserod is in a class of medications called serotonin agonists. It works by improving muscle movement and increasing production of fluid in the bowels.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Tegaserod comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day on an empty stomach shortly before a meal. Take tegaserod at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tegaserod exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you have IBS with constipation, your doctor will probably tell you to take tegaserod for 4-6 weeks. If your symptoms improve, your doctor may tell you to take tegaserod for another 4-6 weeks. If you have chronic idiopathic constipation, you should talk to your doctor regularly to see if you should continue to take tegaserod. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling, and do not take tegaserod for longer than your doctor prescribes.</p>
<p>Tegaserod controls the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and chronic idiopathic constipation, but does not cure these conditions. Continue to take tegaserod even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tegaserod without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking tegaserod, your symptoms may return within 1-2 weeks.</p>
