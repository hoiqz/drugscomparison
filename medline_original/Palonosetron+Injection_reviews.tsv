<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Palonosetron injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a healthcare provider in a hospital or clinic. When palonosetron is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, it is usually given as a single dose about 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy. If you are receiving more than one course of chemotherapy, you may receive a dose of palonosetron before each treatment cycle. When palonosetron is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by surgery, it is usually given as a single dose just before the surgery.</p>
