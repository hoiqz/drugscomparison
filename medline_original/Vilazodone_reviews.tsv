<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>A small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as vilazodone during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take vilazodone, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that vilazodone is the best medication to treat a child's condition.</p>
<p>You should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take vilazodone or other antidepressants, even if you are an adult over 24 years of age. You may become suicidal, especially at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is increased or decreased. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; frenzied abnormal excitement; or any other changes in your usual thoughts, mood, or behavior. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.</p>
<p>Your healthcare provider will want to see you often while you are taking vilazodone, especially at the beginning of your treatment. Be sure to keep all appointments for office visits with your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with vilazodone and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
<p>No matter your age, before you take an antidepressant, you, your parent, or your caregiver should talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of treating your condition with an antidepressant or with other treatments. You should also talk about the risks and benefits of not treating your condition. You should know that having depression or another mental illness greatly increases the risk that you will become suicidal. This risk is higher if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had bipolar disorder (mood that changes from depressed to abnormally excited) or mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood) or has thought about or attempted suicide. Talk to your doctor about your condition, symptoms, and personal and family medical history. You and your doctor will decide what type of treatment is right for you.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Vilazodone is used to treat depression. Vilazodone is in a class of medications called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is also a 5HT1A receptor partial agonist. It works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain that helps maintain mental balance.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Vilazodone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food once a day. Take vilazodone at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take vilazodone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of vilazodone and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 7 days.</p>
<p>Vilazodone controls depression but does not cure it. It may take several weeks before you feel the full benefit of vilazodone. Continue to take vilazodone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking vilazodone without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking vilazodone, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness; nausea; headache; confusion; irritability; agitation; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; anxiety; extreme tiredness; seizures; pain, burning, or tingling in the hands or feet; or sweating. Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms while you are decreasing your dose of vilazodone or soon after you stop taking vilazodone.</p>

Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Many other medications may also interact with vilazodone, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list.</li>
<li>tell your doctor what herbal products and nutritional supplements you are taking, especially St. John's wort and tryptophan.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had bleeding problems, seizures, or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, especially if you are in the last few months of your pregnancy, or if you plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking vilazodone, call your doctor. Vilazodone may cause problems in newborns following delivery if it is taken during the last months of pregnancy.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking vilazodone.</li>
<li>you should know that vilazodone may make you drowsy and affect your judgment and thinking. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.</li>
<li>ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking vilazodone. Alcohol can make the side effects from vilazodone worse.</li>
