<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Metaproterenol is used to prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other lung diseases. It relaxes and opens air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Metaproterenol comes as tablets and syrup to take by mouth and as a solution to inhale by mouth. It usually is used by oral inhalation every 4 hours to relieve symptoms or 3 to 4 times a day to prevent symptoms or by mouth three or four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use metaproterenol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Metaproterenol controls symptoms of asthma and other lung diseases but does not cure them. Continue to use metaproterenol even if you feel well. Do not stop using metaproterenol without talking to your doctor.</p>
