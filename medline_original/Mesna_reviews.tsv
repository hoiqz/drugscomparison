<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Mesna is used to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis (a condition that causes inflammation of the bladder and can result in serious bleeding) in people who receive ifosfamide (a medication used for the treatment of cancer). Mesna is in a class of medications called cytoprotectants. It works by protecting the bladder against some of the harmful effects of certain chemotherapy medications.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Mesna comes as a tablet to take by mouth. The first dose of mesna is usually given as an injection into your vein at the same time as you receive your chemotherapy treatment.

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. </p>
<p>If you vomit less than 2 hours after you take a dose of mesna tablets, call your doctor right away.</p>
<p>Drink at least 1 quart (4 cups; about 1 liter) of liquid daily while you are taking mesna tablets.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
