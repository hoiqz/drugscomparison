<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Vitamins are natural substances that your body needs to grow, develop, and function normally. Vitamins are contained in food; a well-balanced diet usually provides all of the vitamins required. However, there are times, such as during pregnancy and childhood, when your body needs more vitamins than usual. During certain illnesses, your body either cannot get or cannot efficiently use all of the vitamins it needs.</p>
<p>Multivitamins are prescribed for patients who need extra vitamins, who cannot eat enough food to obtain the required vitamins, or who cannot receive the full benefit of the vitamins contained in the food they eat.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Multivitamins come in regular tablets, chewable tablets, capsules, and oral liquid. They are usually taken once a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label or package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take multivitamins exactly as directed.</p>
<p>If your vitamins come in a dropper bottle, use the specially marked dropper to measure each dose.</p>
<p>Your doctor will tell you if you need a specific type of vitamin product and how much to take. Some multivitamin preparations do not require a prescription. Ask your pharmacist for advice in selecting a multivitamin product and follow the directions on the label carefully.</p>
