<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Nebivolol is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Nebivolol is in a class of medications called beta blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate to improve blood flow and decrease blood pressure.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Nebivolol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. To help you remember to take nebivolol, take it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take nebivolol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of nebivolol and gradually increase your dose not more than once every 2 weeks. </p>
<p>Nebivolol controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. It may take 2 weeks before the full benefit of nebivolol is seen in blood pressure readings. Continue to take nebivolol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking nebivolol without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking nebivolol it may cause angina (chest pain), heart attack, or irregular heartbeat. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually over 1 to 2 weeks.</p>
