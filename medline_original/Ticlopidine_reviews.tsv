<p>Ticlopidine may cause a decrease in white blood cells, which fight infection in the body. If you have fever, chills, sore throat, or other signs of an infection, call your doctor immediately.</p>
<p>Ticlopidine may also cause a potentially life-threatening decrease in platelets, which may occur as part of a syndrome that includes injury to red blood cells, causing anemia, kidney abnormalities, neurologic changes, and fever. This condition is called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).</p>
<p>Call your doctor immediately if you have yellowing of the skin or eyes, pinpoint dots (rash) on the skin, pale color, fever, difficulty speaking, seizures, weakness on a side of the body, or dark urine.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order lab tests, especially during the first 3 months of treatment, to check your response to ticlopidine.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ticlopidine is used to reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had a stroke or have had warning signs of a stroke and who cannot be treated with aspirin. Ticlopidine is also used along with aspirin to prevent blood clots from forming in coronary stents (metal tubes surgically placed in clogged blood vessels to improve blood flow). It works by preventing platelets (a type of blood cell) from collecting and forming clots.</p>

<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before taking ticlopidine,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ticlopidine,any other medications, or any of the ingredients in ticlopidine tablets.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: antacids, anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, cimetidine (Tagamet), clopidogrel (Plavix), digoxin (Lanoxin), and theophylline (Theo-Dur). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>if you also take antacids (Maalox, Mylanta) take them 1 hour before or 2 hours after taking ticlopidine.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease, bleeding disorders, bleeding ulcers, low blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, TTP), kidney disease, high blood cholesterol, or high blood fats (triglycerides).</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking ticlopidine, call your doctor.</li>
<geriatric-precaut>
<p>talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking ticlopidine if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should not usually take ticlopidine because it is not as safe or effective as other medications that can be used to treat the same condition.</p>
</geriatric-precaut>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking ticlopidine. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking ticlopidine 10 to 14 days before your procedure. Follow these directions.</li>
