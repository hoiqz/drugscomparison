<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Insulin glulisine is used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not make insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin glulisine is usually used with another type of insulin, unless it is used in an external insulin pump. In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin glulisine also may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin glulisine is a short-acting, man-made version of human insulin. Insulin glulisine works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Insulin glulisine comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected up to 15 minutes before a meal or within 20 minutes after starting a meal. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use insulin glulisine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Never use insulin glulisine when you have symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or if you have checked your blood sugar and found it to be low. Do not inject insulin into a skin area that is red, swollen, itchy, or thickened.</p>
<p>Insulin glulisine controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use insulin glulisine even if you feel well. Do not stop using insulin glulisine without talking to your doctor. Do not switch to another brand or type of insulin or change the dose of any type of insulin you are using without talking to your doctor. Always check the insulin label to make sure you received the right type of insulin from the pharmacy.</p>
<p>Insulin glulisine comes in vials and in dosing pens that contain cartridges of medication. Be sure you know what type of container your insulin glulisine comes in and what other supplies, such as needles, syringes, or pens, you will need to inject your medication.</p>
<p>If your insulin glulisine comes in vials, you will need to use syringes to inject your dose. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to inject insulin glulisine using a syringe. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the type of syringe you should use.</p>
<p>If your insulin glargine comes in pens, be sure to read and understand the manufacturer's instructions. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the pen. Follow the directions carefully, and always perform the safety test before use.</p>
<p>Never reuse needles or syringes and never share needles, syringes, or pens. If you are using an insulin pen, always remove the needle right after you inject your dose. Throw away needles and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture-resistant container.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to mix your insulin glulisine with another type of insulin (NPH insulin [Novolin N, Humulin N]) in the same syringe. Do not mix or dilute insulin glulisine with any other type of insulin. If you mix insulin glulisine with NPH insulin, draw insulin glulisine into the syringe first, then draw the NPH insulin into the syringe and inject the solution immediately after mixing.</p>
<p>You can inject your insulin glulisine in your thighs, stomach, or upper arms. Never inject insulin glulisine into a vein or muscle. Change (rotate) the injection site within the chosen area with each dose; try to avoid injecting the same site more often than once every 1 to 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Always look at your insulin glulisine before you inject it. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use your insulin glulisine if it is colored, cloudy, or contains solid particles, or if the expiration date on the bottle has passed.</p>
<p>Insulin glulisine also can be used with an external insulin pump. Before using insulin glulisine in a pump system, read the pump label to make sure the pump can be used for continuous delivery of fast-acting insulin. Read the pump manual for recommended reservoir and tubing sets, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the insulin pump. Do not dilute insulin glulisine or mix it with any other type of insulin when using it in an external insulin pump. Insulin glulisine used in an external insulin pump should be infused into your stomach area. When using insulin glulisine in an external insulin pump, replace the insulin in the reservoir and change the tubing, needle, and infusion site (spot where the pump is attached to the body) at least every 48 hours. If the infusion site is red, itchy, or thickened, tell your doctor and use a different infusion site.</p>
<p>When using insulin glulisine in an external insulin pump, high blood sugar may occur quickly if the pump stops working properly or if the insulin in the pump reservoir is exposed to direct sunlight or temperatures greater than 98.6°F (37°C). High blood sugar may also occur if the tubing leaks or becomes blocked, disconnected, or kinks. You may need to change the infusion set and insulin in the pump or infusion site if you have high blood sugar, the pump alarm sounds, or the insulin flow is blocked. If the problem cannot be found quickly and corrected, call your doctor right away. You may need to temporarily use insulin by subcutaneous injection (using syringes or an insulin pen). Make sure you have back-up insulin and any necessary supplies on hand, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use them.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

<h2>What other information should I know?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) should be checked regularly to determine your response to insulin glulisine.
