<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>The combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. Lisinopril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly. Hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.</p>

<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>The combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. To help you remember to take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide without talking to your doctor.</p>

<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), moexipril (Univasc), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace), trandolapril (Mavik), sulfa drugs, or any other medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have diabetes (high blood sugar) and you are taking aliskiren (Tekturna, in Amturnide, Tekamlo, Tekturna HCT). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide if you have diabetes and you are also taking aliskiren.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking. Be sure to mention any of the following: aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), indomethacin (Indocin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); barbiturates such as phenobarbital (Luminal, Solfoton); cholestyramine (Questran); colestipol (Colestid); digoxin (Lanoxin); insulin or oral medications for diabetes; lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid); oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Deltasone); other diuretics; other medications for high blood pressure; pain medications; and potassium supplements. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are on dialysis or are being treated with desensitization (a process to reduce your reaction to an allergen) and if you have or have ever had allergies; asthma; diabetes; gout; high cholesterol; collagen vascular disease such as lupus or scleroderma (a condition in which extra tissue grows on the skin and some organs); heart failure; any condition that causes you to urinate less than you normally do; a stroke or 'mini-stroke'; heart, kidney, or liver disease; or angioedema, a condition that causes difficulty swallowing or breathing and painful swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.</li>
<li>ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Alcohol can make the side effects from lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide worse.</li>
<li>you should know that diarrhea, vomiting, not drinking enough fluids, and sweating a lot can cause a drop in blood pressure, which may cause lightheadedness and fainting.</li>
<li>you should know that lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position. This is more common when you first start taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. To avoid this problem, get out of bed slowly, resting your feet on the floor for a few minutes before standing up.</li>
