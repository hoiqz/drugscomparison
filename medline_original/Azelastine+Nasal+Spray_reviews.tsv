<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Azelastine comes as a nasal spray. Azelastine usually is sprayed in each nostril two times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use azelastine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Before using azelastine for the first time, remove the child-resistant screw cap and replace with the pump unit. Prime the delivery system (pump unit) with four sprays or until a fine mist appears. If 3 days or more have elapsed since your last use of the nasal spray, reprime the pump with two sprays or until a fine mist appears.</p>
