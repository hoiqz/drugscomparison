<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Pitavastatin is used together with diet, weight-loss, exercise to reduce the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol'). Pitavastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.</p>
