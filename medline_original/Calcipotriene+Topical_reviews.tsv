<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Calcipotriene is used to treat psoriasis (a skin disease in which red, scaly patches form due to increased production of skin cells on some areas of the body). Calcipotriene is in a class of medications called synthetic vitamin D<sub>3</sub> derivatives. It works by slowing the excessive production of skin cells.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Calcipotriene comes as a cream to apply to the skin and as a solution (liquid) to apply to the scalp. The cream and solution are usually applied two times a day. Use calcipotriene at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use calcipotriene exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Calcipotriene controls psoriasis but does not cure it. You may see some improvement in your condition after 2 weeks, but it may take up to 8 weeks before you feel the full benefit of calcipotriene.</p>
<p>Do not apply calcipotriene cream to the face.</p>
<p>Calcipotriene solution may catch fire. Do not use this medication near heat or an open flame, such as a cigarette.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Rub the cream into the skin until it disappears.</p>
</li>
