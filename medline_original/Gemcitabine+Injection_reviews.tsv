<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Gemcitabine is used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer of the ovaries (cancer that begins in the female reproductive organs where eggs are formed) and breast cancer that has not improved or that has worsened after treatment with other medications. Gemcitabine is used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs to treat a type of lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer; NSCLC) that has spread to other parts of the body and cannot be treated with surgery. Gemcitabine is also used to treat cancer of the pancreas that has spread to other parts of the body and has not improved or worsened after treatment with another medication. Gemcitabine is in a class of medications called antimetabolites. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Gemcitabine comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected over 30 minutes intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility. When gemcitabine is used to treat ovarian or breast cancer, it is usually given on certain days every 3 weeks.  When gemcitabine is used to treat lung cancer it is usually given on certain days every 3 or 4 weeks. When gemcitabine is used to treat cancer of pancreas it may be injected once every week. The length of treatment depends on the types of drugs you are taking, how well your body responds to them, and the type of cancer or condition you have. Your doctor may need to stop or delay your treatment if you experience certain side effects.</p>
