<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ophthalmic sulfacetamide comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes, and an ointment to apply to the eyes. The eye drops usually are instilled every 2 to 3 hours during the day and less frequently at night; the ointment usually is applied four times a day and at bedtime. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use sulfacetamide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<h3>To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the dropper tip to make sure that it is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>To apply the eye ointment, follow these instructions:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the tip of the tube against your eye or anything else; the tube tip must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding the tube between your thumb and forefinger, place it as near to your eyelid as possible without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tilt your head backward slightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With your index finger, pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squeeze a 1/4- to 1/2-inch (0.6- to 1.25-centimeter) ribbon of ointment into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blink your eye slowly; then gently close your eye for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a tissue, wipe any excess ointment from the eyelids and lashes. With another clean tissue, wipe the tip of the tube clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap right away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
