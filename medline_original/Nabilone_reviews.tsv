<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Nabilone is used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy in people who have already taken other medications to treat this type of nausea and vomiting without good results. Nabilone is in a class of medications called cannabinoids. It works by affecting the area of the brain that controls nausea and vomiting.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Nabilone comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two to three times a day during a cycle of chemotherapy. Treatment with nabilone should begin 1 to 3 hours before the first dose of chemotherapy and may be continued for up to 48 hours after the end of the chemotherapy cycle. Take nabilone at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take nabilone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of nabilone and may gradually increase your dose if needed.</p>
<p>Nabilone helps control nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy when taken as directed. Always take nabilone according to the schedule prescribed by your doctor even if you are not experiencing nausea or vomiting.</p>
<p>Nabilone may be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor. Call your doctor if you find that you want to take extra medication.</p>

<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking nabilone.</li>
<li>you should know that nabilone may make you drowsy and may cause changes in your mood, thinking, memory, judgment, or behavior.
