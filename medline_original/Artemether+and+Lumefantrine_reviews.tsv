<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>The combination of artemether and lumefantrine is used to treat certain kinds of malaria infections (a serious infection that is spread by mosquitoes in certain parts of the world and can cause death). Artemether and lumefantrine should not be used to prevent malaria. Artemether and lumefantrine is in a class of medications called antimalarials. It works by killing the organisms that cause malaria.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>The combination of artemether and lumefantrine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day for 3 days as instructed by your doctor. Always take artemether and lumefantrine with food. If you are not able to eat, contact your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take artemether and lumefantrine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you have trouble swallowing the tablets, they may be crushed and mixed with 1 or 2 teaspoons (5 or 10 mL) of water in a clean container. Drink the mixture right away. Rinse the glass with more water and swallow the entire contents.</p>
<p>You may vomit soon after you take the medication. If you vomit less than 1 hour after you take artemether and lumefantrine, you should take another full dose of artemether and lumefantrine. If you vomit again after taking the extra dose, call your doctor.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with artemether and lumefantrine. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse, call your doctor. Also call your doctor if you have a fever, chills, muscle pain, or headache soon after you finish your treatment. This could be a sign that you still are infected with malaria.</p>
<p>Take artemether and lumefantrine until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking artemether and lumefantrine too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the organisms may become resistant to antimalarials.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
