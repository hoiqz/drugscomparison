<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Sulfasalazine is used to treat bowel inflammation, diarrhea (stool frequency), rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain in patients with ulcerative colitis, a condition in which the bowel is inflamed. Sulfasalazine delayed-release (Azulfidine EN-tabs) is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults and children whose disease has not responded well to other medications. Sulfasalazine is in a class of medications called anti-inflammatory drugs. It works by reducing inflammation (swelling) inside the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Sulfasalazine comes as regular and delayed-release (enteric-coated) tablets. It usually is taken four times a day in evenly spaced doses throughout the day so that no more than 8 hours separates any two doses, if possible. Take sulfasalazine after a meal or with a light snack, then drink a full glass of water. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sulfasalazine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow tablets whole; do not crush or chew them.</p>
<p>Drink plenty of fluids (at least six to eight glasses of water or other beverage per day) while taking sulfasalazine.</p>
<p>Continue to take sulfasalazine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking sulfasalazine without talking to your doctor.</p>
