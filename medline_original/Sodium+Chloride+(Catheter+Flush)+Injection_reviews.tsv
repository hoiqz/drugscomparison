<h2>About your treatment</h2>

<p>Your doctor has ordered sodium chloride flush to be used to keep your intravenous (IV) catheter from becoming blocked and to remove any medicine from the IV catheter site. It is used each time your IV catheter is used.</p>
<p>You will probably use a sodium chloride flush several times a day. Your health care provider will determine the number of sodium chloride flushes you will need a day.</p>

<p>Before you administer sodium chloride flush, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.</p>
<p>It is important that you use your medication exactly as directed. Do not administer it more often than or for longer periods than your doctor tells you. Do not change your dosing schedule without talking to your health care provider. Your health care provider may tell you to stop your infusion if you have a mechanical problem (such as blockage in the tubing, needle, or catheter); if you have to stop an infusion, call your health care provider immediately so your therapy can continue.</p>
