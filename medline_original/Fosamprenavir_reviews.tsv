<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Fosamprenavir is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Fosamprenavir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although fosamprenavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Fosamprenavir comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day. The tablets can be taken with or without food. In patients at least 18 years old, the suspension should be taken without food. In patients younger than 18 years old, the suspension should be taken with food. To help you remember to take fosamprenavir, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fosamprenavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you are taking the suspension, shake it well before each use to mix the medication evenly.</p>
<p>If you vomit less than 30 minutes after you take fosamprenavir, you should take another full dose of fosamprenavir.</p>
<p>Fosamprenavir controls HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take fosamprenavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking fosamprenavir without talking to your doctor. If you miss doses or stop taking fosamprenavir, your condition may become more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking fosamprenavir.</li>
<li>you should know that fosamprenavir may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (birth control pills). Talk to your doctor about other ways to prevent pregnancy while you are taking this medication.</li>
<li>you should know that your body fat may increase or move to different areas of your body such as your breasts and upper back.</li>

Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms while you are taking fosamprenavir: extreme thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, blurred vision, or weakness. It is very important to call your doctor as soon as you have any of these symptoms, because high blood sugar that is not treated can cause a serious condition called ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis may become life-threatening if it is not treated at an early stage. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include: dry mouth, nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, breath that smells fruity, and decreased consciousness.</li>
<li>you should know that while you are taking medications to treat HIV infection, your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight other infections that were already in your body. This may cause you to develop symptoms of those infections. If you have new or worsening symptoms at anytime during your treatment with fosamprenavir, be sure to tell your doctor.</li>
