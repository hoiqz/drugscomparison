<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Axitinib is used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC, a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the kidneys) in people who have not been treated successfully with another medication. Axitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Axitinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two times a day. Take axitinib at around the same times every day, about 12 hours apart. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take axitinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>If you vomit after taking axitinib, do not take another dose. Continue your regular dosing schedule.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of axitinib and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 weeks. This depends on how well the medication works for you and any side effects you might experience. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment. Continue to take axitinib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking axitinib without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
