<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Triamcinolone nasal spray is used to treat symptoms of seasonal (occurs only at certain times of year), and perennial (occurs all year round) allergic rhinitis and perennial nonallergic rhinitis. These symptoms include sneezing and stuffy, runny, or itchy nose. Triamcinolone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by decreasing inflammation (swelling that can cause other symptoms) in the nose.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Triamcinolone comes as a liquid to spray in the nose. It is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily.  Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use triamcinolone spray exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Triamcinolone nasal spray is only for use in the nose. Do not swallow the nasal spray and be careful not to spray it in your eyes.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a high dose of triamcinolone nasal spray and may decrease your dose after your symptoms are controlled.</p>
<p>Triamcinolone nasal spray controls the symptoms of rhinitis but does not cure them. It may take up to one week before you feel the full benefit of triamcinolone. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not get better within 3 weeks of treatment with triamcinolone. Continue to use triamcinolone even if you feel well. Do not stop using triamcinolone without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Before you use triamcinolone nasal spray the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you the proper way to use the nasal spray. Practice using the nasal spray with the help of a health care professional.</p>
<p>Each bottle of triamcinolone nasal spray is designed to provide 120 sprays. The bottle might not be empty after 120 sprays have been used, but after this point, each spray might not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of sprays you have used and throw away the bottle after you have used 120 sprays even if it still contains some liquid.</p>
<p>If this medication is prescribed for a child, an adult should help give this medication.</p>
<h3>To use the nasal spray, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Shake the bottle gently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the dust cover. If the top part of the spray pump comes off of the bottle while removing the cover, put the stem back into the pump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using the pump for the first time or have not used it for 2 weeks or more, you must prime it by following steps 4 to 5 below. If you have used the pump in the past 2 weeks, skip to step 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the pump with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom of the bottle resting on your thumb. Point the applicator away from your body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using the pump for the first time, press down and release the pump five times. If you have used the pump before, but not within the past week, press down once and release the pump until you see a fine spray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently blow your nose until nostrils are clear. For small children, help them gently blow their nose as much as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold one nostril closed with your finger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the pump with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger and the bottom resting on your thumb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the spray tip into one side of your nose. The tip should not reach far into the nose, and it should not touch or be pointed toward the side of your nose. Rest the side of your index finger against your upper lip. Tip your head forward a little and aim the spray toward the back of your nose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin to breathe in through your nose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While you are breathing in, use your forefinger and middle finger to press firmly down on the applicator and release a spray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe gently in through the nostril and breathe out through your mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your doctor told you to use two sprays in that nostril, repeat steps 7 to 12.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat steps 6 to 13 in the other nostril.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not blow your nose for 15 minutes after using the spray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe the applicator with a clean tissue and cover it with the dust cover.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>

<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before using triamcinolone nasal spray,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to triamcinolone, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in triamcinolone nasal spray. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention medications that suppress the immune system such as azathioprine (Imuran), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), methotrexate (Rheumatrex), sirolimus (Rapamune), tacrolimus (Prograf), and medications to treat cancer; and oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Deltasone).</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had tuberculosis (TB, a type of infection in your lungs), cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), or glaucoma (an eye disease), and if you now have sores in your nose, any type of untreated infection, or a herpes infection (a type of infection that causes a sore on the eyelid or eye surface) in your eye. Also tell your doctor if you have recently had surgery on your nose or injured your nose in any way.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using triamcinolone, call your doctor.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using triamcinolone.</li>
<li>if you have been taking oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), prednisolone (Pediapred, Prelone) or prednisone (Deltasone), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose after you begin using triamcinolone nasal spray. Special caution is needed for several months as your body adjusts to the change in medication. If you have any other medical conditions, such as arthritis, or eczema (a skin disease), they may worsen when your oral steroid dose is decreased. Tell your doctor if this happens or if you experience any of the following symptoms during this time: extreme tiredness, muscle weakness or pain; sudden pain in stomach, lower body or legs; loss of appetite; weight loss; upset stomach; vomiting; diarrhea; dizziness; fainting; depression; irritability; and darkening of the skin. Your body may be less able to cope with stress such as surgery, illness, severe asthma attack, or injury during this time. Call your doctor right away if you get sick and be sure that all healthcare providers who treat you know that you recently replaced your oral steroid with triamcinolone nasal spray. Carry a card or wear a medical identification bracelet to let emergency personnel know that you may need to be treated with steroids in an emergency.</li>
<li>you should know that triamcinolone may decrease your body's ability to fight infection. Stay away from people who are sick and wash your hands often. Be especially careful to stay away from people who have chicken pox or measles. Tell your doctor right away if you find out that you have been around someone who has one of these viruses.</li>
