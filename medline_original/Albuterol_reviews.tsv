<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Albuterol comes as a tablet, a syrup, and an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. The tablets and syrup are usually taken three or four times a day. The extended-release tablets are usually taken once every 12 hours. Take albuterol at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take albuterol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the extended-release tablets whole with plenty of water or other liquid. Do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of albuterol and gradually increase your dose.</p>
<p>Albuterol may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to take albuterol even if you feel well. Do not stop taking albuterol without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen or if you feel that albuterol no longer controls your symptoms.</p>
