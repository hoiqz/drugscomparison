<p>Do not take danazol if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. A method of birth control (contraception) other than oral contraceptives should be used while taking danazol. If you become pregnant, call your doctor immediately. Life-threatening strokes, increased pressure in the brain, and serious liver disease complicated by potentially life-threatening abdominal bleeding have been reported during therapy with danazol.

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Danazol is used to treat endometriosis, a disease that causes infertility, pain before and during menstrual periods, pain during and after sexual activity, and heavy or irregular bleeding. Danazol is also used in fibrocystic breast disease to reduce breast pain, tenderness, and nodules (lumps). Danazol is also used to prevent attacks of angioedema in both males and females.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Danazol comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It usually is taken twice a day. Women should take the first dose during a menstrual period and take it continuously thereafter. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take danazol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking danazol without talking to your doctor. If you have fibrocystic breast disease, breast pain and tenderness usually improve during the first month that you take danazol and go away in 2 to 3 months; nodules should improve in 4 to 6 months.</p>
