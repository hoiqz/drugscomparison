<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Etravirine is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Etravirine is in a class of medications called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. Although etravirine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other life-style changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Etravirine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken after a meal two times a day. Take etravirine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take etravirine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole with liquid, such as water; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>If you have trouble swallowing the tablets, they may be dissolved in water. To prepare, add the tablets to a glass of water, allow to stand for a few minutes, and then stir until a milky mixture occurs. Drink the etravirine-water mixture right away. Rinse the glass with water and swallow the entire contents. Repeat process of rinsing and swallowing the rinse mixture several times to make sure that the entire dose is taken.</p>
<p>Etravirine helps to control HIV infection, but does not cure it. Continue to take etravirine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking etravirine without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking etravirine or miss doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat. When your supply of etravirine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
