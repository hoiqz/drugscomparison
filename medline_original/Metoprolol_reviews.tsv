<p>Do not stop taking metoprolol without talking to your doctor. Suddenly stopping metoprolol may cause chest pain or heart attack. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Metoprolol is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It also is used to prevent angina (chest pain) and to improve survival after a heart attack. Extended-release (long-acting) metoprolol also is used in combination with other medications to treat heart failure. Metoprolol is in a class of medications called beta blockers. It works by relaxing blood vessels and slowing heart rate to improve blood flow and decrease blood pressure</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Metoprolol comes as a tablet and an extended-release tablet to take by mouth. The regular tablet is usually taken once or twice a day with meals or immediately after meals. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take metoprolol, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take metoprolol exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>The long-acting tablet may be split. Swallow the whole or half tablets whole; do not chew or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of metoprolol and gradually increase your dose.</p>
<p>Metoprolol controls high blood pressure and angina but does not cure them. Extended-release metoprolol controls heart failure but does not cure it. It may take a few weeks before you feel the full benefit of metoprolol. Continue to take metoprolol even if you feel well.</p>
