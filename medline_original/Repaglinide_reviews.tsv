<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Repaglinide is used to treat type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Repaglinide helps your body regulate the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. It decreases the amount of glucose by stimulating the pancreas to release insulin.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Repaglinide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. The tablets are taken before meals, any time from 30 minutes before a meal to just before the meal. If you skip a meal, you need to skip the dose of repaglinide. If you add an extra meal, you need to take an extra dose of repaglinide. Your doctor may gradually increase your dose, depending on your response to repaglinide. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take repaglinide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Continue to take repaglinide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking repaglinide without talking to your doctor.</p>
