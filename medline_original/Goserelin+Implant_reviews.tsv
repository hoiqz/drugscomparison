<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Goserelin implant is used in combination with radiation therapy and other medications to treat localized prostate cancer and is used alone to treat the symptoms associated with advanced prostate cancer. It is also used to treat advanced breast cancer in certain women. It is also used to manage endometriosis (a condition in which the type of tissue that lines the uterus [womb] grows in other areas of the body and causes pain, heavy or irregular menstruation [periods], and other symptoms) and to help with the treatment of abnormal bleeding of the uterus. Goserelin implant is in a class of medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. It works by decreasing the amount of certain hormones in the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

An implant with 3.6 mg of goserelin is usually inserted every 4 weeks. An implant with 10.8 mg of goserelin is usually inserted every 12 weeks. The length of your treatment depends on the condition being treated and your response to the medication. Your doctor will determine how long you should use goserelin implant.</p>
<p>Goserelin may cause an increase in certain hormones in the first few weeks after insertion of the implant. Your doctor will monitor you carefully for any new or worsening symptoms during this time.</p>
