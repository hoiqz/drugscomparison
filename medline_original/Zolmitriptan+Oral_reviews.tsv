<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Zolmitriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headache (severe throbbing headache that sometimes is experienced with other symptoms such as upset stomach and sensitivity to sound and light). Zolmitriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists. It works by reducing swelling of blood vessels around the brain and blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, upset stomach, and other symptoms of migraine. Zolmitriptan does not prevent migraine attacks.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Zolmitriptan comes as a tablet and an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth) to take by mouth. It is usually taken during a migraine attack. If your symptoms improve after you take zolmitriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second dose. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take zolmitriptan, do not take a second dose without calling your doctor. Your doctor will tell you the maximum number of tablets or orally disintegrating tablets you may take in a 24-hour period. Call your doctor if you need to take zolmitriptan to treat more than three headaches in 1 month. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take zolmitriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not take zolmitriptan to treat a headache that feels different than your usual migraine attacks. Call your doctor to find out what you should do.</p>
<p>If you have certain risk factors for heart disease, your doctor may ask you to take your first dose of zolmitriptan in the doctor's office or other medical facility where you can be monitored for serious reactions.</p>
<p>If your doctor has prescribed a dose lower than 2.5 mg, you may use your fingers to break the 2.5-mg tablet on the line that divides it in half. However, you should not break or split the orally disintegrating tablet.</p>
<p>To take the orally disintegrating tablet, use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging. Immediately take out the tablet and place it on your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets. Do not open the foil packaging or remove the orally disintegrating tablet until just before you are ready to take it.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
