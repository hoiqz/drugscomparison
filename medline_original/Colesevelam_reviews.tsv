<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Colesevelam is used along with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the amount of cholesterol and certain fatty substances in the blood. Colesevelam may be used alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications known as statins (atorvastatin [Lipitor], cerivastatin [Baycol], lovastatin [Mevacor], pravastatin [Pravachol], or simvastatin [Zocor]). Colesevelam is also used to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the body does not use insulin normally and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood). Colesevelam is in a class of medications called bile acid sequestrants. It works by binding bile acids in your intestines to form a product that is removed from the body.</p>
<p>Bile acids are made when cholesterol is broken down in your body. Removing these bile acids helps to lower your blood cholesterol. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats may help prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.</p>
