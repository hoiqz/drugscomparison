<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Malathion comes as a lotion to apply to the scalp and hair. It is usually applied to the scalp and hair in one or sometimes two treatments. If live lice are seen 7 to 9 days after the first treatment then apply a second treatment of malathion lotion. Follow the directions on your prescription label or the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use malathion lotion exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read these instructions carefully.</p>
<p>Malathion lotion should only be used on the hair and scalp. If you experience skin irritation, wash scalp and hair right away. If the irritation gets better, you can apply malathion lotion again. If you experience skin irritation again, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Avoid getting malathion lotion in your eyes. If malathion lotion gets in your eyes, flush them with water right away. If your eyes are still irritated after flushing with water, call your doctor or get medical help right away.</p>
<h3>To use the lotion, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be sure to keep your eyes closed during this treatment. You may need to have an adult help you apply the lotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply malathion lotion to dry hair and scalp area paying special attention to area behind your ears and at the back of your neck. Be sure to use enough lotion to cover the entire scalp area and hair thoroughly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow hair to air dry and to remain uncovered. Malathion lotion is flammable. The lotion and wet hair should not be exposed to open flames or electric heat sources, including hair dryers or curlers. Do not smoke while applying lotion or while hair is wet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the lotion on your hair and scalp for 8 to 12 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 8 to 12 hours have passed, shampoo your hair and scalp with warm water in a sink. You should not use a shower or bathtub to rinse the lotion away because you do not want to get the lotion over the rest of your body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You and anyone who helped you apply the lotion should wash your hands carefully after the application and rinsing steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a lice comb to remove the dead lice and nits (empty egg shells) after this treatment. You may also need to have an adult help you to do this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you see live lice on your head 7 to 9 days after treatment, repeat this entire process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After using malathion lotion, sanitize all the clothing, underwear, pajamas, hats, sheets, pillowcases, and towels you have used recently. These items should be washed in very hot water or dry-cleaned. You should also wash combs, brushes, hairs clips and other personal care items in hot water.</p>
