<p>Molindone is no longer available in the United States after June 30, 2010. If you are currently taking molindone, you should call your doctor to discuss switching to another treatment.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that older adults with dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and that may cause changes in mood and personality) who take antipsychotics (medications for mental illness) such as molindone have an increased chance of death during treatment.</p>
<p>Molindone is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior problems in older adults with dementia. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is taking molindone. For more information visit the FDA website: <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs</a>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Molindone is used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia (a mental illness that causes disturbed or unusual thinking, loss of interest in life, and strong or inappropriate emotions). Molindone is in a class of medications called conventional antipsychotics. It works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Molindone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day. Try to take molindone at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take molindone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of molindone and gradually increase your dose after 3 to 4 days. Later, your doctor may increase or decrease your dose, depending on your response to the medication and the side effects you experience. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with molindone.</p>
<p>Molindone may help to control your condition but will not cure it.  Continue to take molindone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking molindone without talking to your doctor. It may take several weeks or longer for you to feel the full benefit of molindone.</p>

<h3>Before taking molindone,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to molindone or any other medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: antidepressants; barbiturates such as pentobarbital (Nembutal), phenobarbital (Luminal), and secobarbital (Seconal); medications for anxiety, mental illness, or seizures; narcotic medications for pain; phenytoin (Dilantin); sedatives; sleeping pills; tetracycline antibiotics such as demeclocycline (Declomycin), doxycycline (Doryx, Monodox, Vibramycin), minocycline (Dynacin, Minocin, Solodyn), and tetracycline (Sumycin, Tetrex); and tranquilizers. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression or breast cancer. Also tell your doctor if you have ever had to stop taking a medication for mental illness due to severe side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, especially if you are in the last few months of your pregnancy, or if you plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking molindone, call your doctor. Molindone may cause problems in newborns following delivery if it is taken during the last months of pregnancy.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking molindone.</li>
<li>you should know that this medication may make you drowsy and may affect your thinking and movements. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.</li>
<li>ask your doctor about the safe use of alcohol while you are taking molindone. Alcohol can make the side effects of molindone worse.</li>
