<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Thyroid hormone should not be used to speed weight loss in people who are overweight but do not have a thyroid condition. Thyroid hormone will not help speed weight loss in people with normal thyroid glands, and it may cause serious or life-threatening side effects in these people. The risk of serious side effects is even higher if thyroid is also taken with amphetamines such as benzphetamine(Didrex), dextroamphetamine([Dexedrine, in Adderall), and methamphetamine (Desoxyn).</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking this medication.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Thyroid is used to treat the symptoms of hypothyroidism (a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone). Symptoms of hypothyroidism include lack of energy, depression, constipation, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, dry coarse hair, muscle cramps, decreased concentration, aches and pains, swelling of the legs, and increased sensitivity to cold. Thyroid is also used to treat goiter (enlarged thyroid gland). Thyroid is in a class of medications called thyroid agents. It works by supplying the thyroid hormone normally produced by the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Thyroid comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once a day before breakfast. Take thyroid at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take thyroid exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of thyroid and gradually increase your dose.</p>
<p>Thyroid helps control the symptoms of hypothyroidism, but does not cure this condition. It may take up to several weeks before you notice any change in your symptoms. To control the symptoms of hypothyroidism, you probably will need to take thyroid for the rest of your life. Continue to take thyroid even if you feel well. Do not stop taking thyroid without talking to your doctor.</p>

<div id=hgroup
<h2>What other information should I know?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your response to thyroid.</p>
<p>Before having any laboratory test, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are taking thyroid.</p>
<p>Thyroid tablets may have a strong odor. This does not mean that the medication is spoiled or that it cannot be used.</p>
<p>Learn the brand name and generic name of your medication. Check your medication each time you have your prescription refilled or receive a new prescription.
