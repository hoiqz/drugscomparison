<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Imiquimod cream is used to treat certain types of actinic keratoses (flat, scaly growths on the skin caused by too much sun exposure) on the face or scalp. Imiquimod cream is also used to treat superficial basal cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer) on the trunk, neck, arms, hands, legs, or feet and warts on the skin of the genital and anal areas. Imiquimod is in a class of medications called immune response modifiers. It treats genital and anal warts by increasing the activity of the body's immune system. It is not known exactly how imiquimod cream works to treat actinic keratoses or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>Imiquimod cream does not cure warts, and new warts may appear during treatment. It is not known whether imiquimod cream prevents the spread of warts to other people.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Imiquimod comes as a cream to apply to the skin.</p>
<p>If you are using imiquimod cream to treat actinic keratoses, you will probably apply it once a day for 2 days a week, 3 to 4 days apart (e.g., Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday). Do not apply the cream to an area larger than your forehead or cheek (about 2 inches by 2 inches). Imiquimod cream should be left on the skin for approximately 8 hours. Continue using imiquimod cream for a full 16 weeks, even if all the actinic keratoses are gone, unless you are told otherwise by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you are using imiquimod cream to treat superficial basal cell carcinoma, you will probably apply it once a day for 5 days a week (e.g., Monday through Friday). Apply the cream to the basal cell carcinoma and the immediate surrounding area. Imiquimod cream should be left on the skin for approximately 8 hours. Continue using imiquimod for a full 6 weeks, even if the superficial basal cell carcinoma appears to be gone, unless you are told otherwise by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you are using imiquimod cream to treat genital and anal warts, you will probably apply it once a day for 3 days a week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday). Imiquimod cream should be left on the skin for 6 to 10 hours. Continue using imiquimod until all of the warts are healed, up to a maximum of 16 weeks.</p>
<p>Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use imiquimod exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not cover the treated area with a tight bandage or dressing unless told to do so by your doctor. Cotton gauze dressings may be used if needed. Cotton underwear may be worn after treating the genital or anal areas.</p>
<p>If you are using imiquimod cream to treat genital or anal warts, you should avoid sexual (oral, anal, genital) contact while the cream is on your skin. Imiquimod cream may weaken condoms and vaginal diaphragms.</p>
<p>Uncircumcised men who are treating warts under the penis foreskin should pull the foreskin back and clean daily and before each treatment.</p>
<p>Imiquimod cream is only for use on the skin. Do not apply imiquimod cream in or near your eyes, lips, nostrils, vagina, or anus. If you get imiquimod cream in your mouth or eyes, rinse well with water right away.</p>
<p>Imiquimod cream comes in single-use packets. Throw away any open packets if you do not use all of the cream.</p>
