<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Lacosamide is used in combination with other medications to control certain types of seizures. Lacosamide is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Lacosamide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day (morning and night) with or without food. Take lacosamide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take lacosamide exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not chew or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of lacosamide and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week.</p>
<p>Lacosamide may help control your condition but will not cure it. It may take a few weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of lacosamide. Continue to take lacosamide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking lacosamide without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking lacosamide, your seizures may happen more often. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.</p>

<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before taking lacosamide,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to lacosamide, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in lacosamide tablets. Ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had an irregular heartbeat; a heart attack; heart failure; diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage caused by diabetes); or heart, liver, or kidney disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking lacosamide, call your doctor.</li>
<li>you should know that lacosamide may make you dizzy or drowsy and may cause blurred vision or problems with coordination and balance. Do not drive a car, operate machinery, or participate in activities requiring alertness or coordination until you know how this medication affects you.</li>
<li>you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking lacosamide. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants like lacosamide to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as 1 week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as lacosamide, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.</li>
<li>you should know that lacosamide may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, or irregular heartbeat, especially when you get up too quickly from a lying position. If you develop these symptoms, lie down with your legs raised until you feel better, and call your doctor right away.</li>
