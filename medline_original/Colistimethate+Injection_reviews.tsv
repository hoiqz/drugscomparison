<h2>About your treatment</h2>

<p>Your doctor has ordered colistimethate, an antibiotic, to help treat your infection. The drug will be either injected directly into a vein through a needle or catheter or added to an intravenous fluid that will drip through a needle or catheter into a vein. You will either receive a continuous dose of this medication through your intravenous fluids or receive it two to four times a day.</p>
<p>Colistimethate eliminates many kinds of bacterial infections. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.Your health care provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how you respond to the medication.</p>

<h2>Administering your medication</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Before you administer colistimethate, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks.</p>
<p>Do not use the solution if it is discolored or if it contains particles. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.</p>
<p>It is important that you use your medication exactly as directed. Do not stop your therapy on your own for any reason because your infection could worsen and result in hospitalization. Do not administer it more often than or for longer periods than your doctor tells you. Do not change your dosing schedule without talking to your health care provider. Your health care provider may tell you to stop your infusion if you have a mechanical problem (such as blockage in the tubing, needle, or catheter); if you have to stop an infusion, call your health care provider immediately so your therapy can continue.</p>
