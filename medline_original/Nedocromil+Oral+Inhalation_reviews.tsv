<p>Nedocromil oral inhalation will no longer be available in the U.S. after June 14, 2010. If you are currently using nedocromil, you should call your doctor to discuss switching to another treatment.</p>
</div><div id=hgroup
<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Nedocromil is used to prevent the wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness caused by asthma. It works by preventing the release of substances that cause inflammation (swelling) in the air passages of the lungs.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Nedocromil comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth. It usually is inhaled four times a day to prevent asthma attacks. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nedocromil exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>It may take up to 4 weeks for nedocromil to work. You should take it regularly for it to be effective. If your symptoms have not improved after 4 weeks, tell your doctor.</p>
<p>Nedocromil is used with a special inhaler. Before you use nedocromil inhalation for the first time, read the instructions for your device. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to demonstrate the proper technique. Practice using the inhalation device while in his or her presence.</p>
<h3>To use the inhaler, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Shake the inhaler well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the protective cap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exhale (breathe out) as completely as possible through your nose while keeping your mouth shut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Open Mouth Technique:</em> Open your mouth wide, and place the open end of the mouthpiece about 1 to 2 inches from your mouth.</p>
<p>
<em>Closed Mouth Technique:</em> Place the open end of the mouthpiece well into your mouth, past your front teeth. Close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a slow, deep breath through the mouthpiece and, at the same time, press down on the container to spray the medication into your mouth. Be sure that the mist goes into your throat and is not blocked by your teeth or tongue. Adults giving the treatment to young children may hold the child's nose closed to be sure that the medication goes into the child's throat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold your breath for 5 to 10 seconds, remove the inhaler, and exhale slowly through your nose or mouth. If you take 2 puffs, wait 2 minutes and shake the inhaler well before taking the second puff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the protective cap on the inhaler.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have difficulty getting the medication into your lungs, a spacer (a special device that attaches to the inhaler) may help; ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist.</p>

<h2>What other information should I know?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your response to nedocromil.</p>
<p>Do not use nedocromil to relieve an asthma attack that has already started; continue to use the medication prescribed for your acute attacks.</p>

<p>Inhalation devices require regular cleaning. Once a week, remove the drug container from the plastic mouthpiece, wash the mouthpiece with warm tap water, and dry it thoroughly. Follow the written instructions for care of other inhalation devices.</p>
<p>Do not let anyone else use your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.</p>
<p>It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.</p>
