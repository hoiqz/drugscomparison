<p>Quinine should not be used to treat or prevent nighttime leg cramps. Quinine has not been shown to be effective for this purpose, and may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, including severe bleeding problems, kidney damage, irregular heartbeat, and severe allergic reactions. </p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with quinine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Quinine is used alone or with other medications to treat malaria (a serious or life-threatening illness that is spread by mosquitos in certain parts of the world). Quinine should not be used to prevent malaria. Quinine is in a class of medications called antimalarials. It works by killing the organisms that cause malaria.</p>
<a name="how">
    </a>
</div>
<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Quinine comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It usually is taken with food three times a day (every 8 hours) for 3 to 7 days. Take quinine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take quinine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the capsules whole; do not open, chew, or crush them. Quinine has a bitter taste.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first 1-2 days of your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse. Also call your doctor if you have a fever soon after you finish your treatment. This could be a sign that you are experiencing a second episode of malaria.</p>
<p>Take quinine until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking quinine too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the organisms may become resistant to antimalarials.</p>

Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Many other medications may also interact with quinine, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list.</li>
<li>do not take antacids that contain magnesium or aluminum (Alternagel, Amphogel, Alu-cap, Alu-tab, Basaljel, Gaviscon, Maalox, Milk of Magnesia, or Mylanta) at the same time as you take quinine.Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about how long you should wait between taking this type of antacid and taking quinine.</li>

Also tell your doctor if you have ever had a serious reaction, especially a bleeding problem or problems with your blood after taking quinine in the past. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take quinine.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a slow or irregular heartbeat; low levels of potassium in your blood; or heart, kidney, or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking quinine, call your doctor.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking quinine.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you use tobacco products. Cigarette smoking may decrease the effectiveness of this medication.</li>
