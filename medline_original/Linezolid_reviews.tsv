<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Linezolid is used to treat infections, including pneumonia, and infections of the skin and blood. Linezolid is in a class of antibacterials called oxazolidinones. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics will not work for colds, flu, and other viral infections. </p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Linezolid comes as a tablet and oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day (every 12 hours) for 10 to 28 days. Children 11 years of age and younger usually take linezolid with or without food two to three times a day (every 8 to 12 hours) for 10 to 28 days.  The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take linezolid exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Before using the oral suspension, gently mix it by turning over the bottle three to five times. Do not shake the suspension.</p>
<p>Continue to take linezolid even if you feel well. Do not skip doses or stop taking linezolid without talking to your doctor. Take linezolid until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. Stopping linezolid too soon may cause bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
