<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Candesartan is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Candesartan is also used alone or in combination with other medications to treat congestive heart failure (a condition when your heart can not pump enough blood to the other parts of the body). Candesartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Candesartan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take candesartan, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take candesartan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of candesartan and gradually increase your dose not more than once every 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Candesartan controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Your blood pressure may decrease during the first 2 weeks of your treatment, but it may take 4 to 6 weeks for you to notice the full benefit of candesartan. Continue to take candesartan even if you feel well. Do not stop taking candesartan without talking to your doctor.</p>
