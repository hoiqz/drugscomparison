<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Alvimopan is used to help the bowel recover more quickly after bowel surgery, so that you can eat solid foods and have regular bowel movements. Alvimopan is in a class of medications called peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists. It works by protecting the bowel from the constipation effects of opioid (narcotic) medications that are used to treat pain after surgery.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Alvimopan comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once shortly before bowel surgery. After the surgery, it is usually taken twice a day for up to 7 days or until hospital discharge. Your nurse will bring your medication to you when it is time for you to receive each dose.</p>
