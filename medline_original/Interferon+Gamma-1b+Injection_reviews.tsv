<h2>About your treatment</h2>

<p>Your doctor has ordered interferon gamma-1b. This drug is a manmade version of a substance normally produced by your body's cells to help fight infections, and it is used to treat patients with chronic granulomatous disease. The drug will be injected under your skin three times a week. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
<p>Your healthcare provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how you respond to the medication.</p>

<p>Before you administer interferon gamma-1b, look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your healthcare provider.</p>
<p>It is important that you use your medication exactly as directed. Do not stop your therapy on your own for any reason. Do not change your dosing schedule without talking to your healthcare provider.</p>
