<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Betaine is used to treat homocystinuria (an inherited condition in which the body cannot break down a certain protein, causing build-up of homocysteine in the blood). Increased amounts of homocysteine in the body can cause symptoms such as extreme tiredness, seizures, dislocation of the lens of the eye, abnormal bone structure, osteoporosis (weak bones), blood clots, or decreased weight or rate of weight gain and slowed development in children. Betaine is in a class of medications called nutrients. It works by decreasing the amount of homocysteine in the blood.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Betaine comes as a powder to be mixed with food or drink and taken by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day. Take betaine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take betaine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of betaine and gradually increase your dose based on your body's response to the medication.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to take other medications such as vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (pyridoxine), vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin), and folic acid together with betaine.</p>
<p>Betaine controls homocystinuria but does not cure it. Continue to take betaine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking betaine without talking to your doctor.</p>
<h3>To use betaine powder, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Shake the bottle gently before removing the cap.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
