<div id="boxed-warning">
<p>Oxymorphone may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time or in a different way than prescribed by your doctor. Taking more oxymorphone than prescribed by your doctor may cause overdose and death, especially if you also overuse other prescription medications or use street drugs or alcohol. Tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs or have overused prescription medication.</p>
<p>Oxymorphone extended-release (long-acting) tablets should be used only by people who need regularly scheduled doses of pain medication to treat continuous pain for an extended period of time. Extended-release oxymorphone tablets should not be taken as needed or to treat occasional episodes of pain.</p>
<p>Swallow oxymorphone extended-release tablets whole; do not break, chew, dissolve, or crush them. If you take broken, chewed, dissolved, or crushed extended-release tablets, you will receive the entire dose of oxymorphone at once, instead of slowly over 12 hours. This may cause serious problems, including overdose and death. Tell your doctor if you are unable to swallow the tablets whole. Your doctor may prescribe a different medication.</p>
<p>Do not drink any drinks that contain alcohol or take any prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol while you are taking oxymorphone, especially while you are taking the extended-release tablets. Ask your doctor or pharmacist or check the list of ingredients if you do not know if a medication contains alcohol. Taking alcohol with extended-release oxymorphone tablets may cause an increased amount of oxymorphone in your body and could cause an overdose or death.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking oxymorphone.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Oxymorphone is used to relieve moderate to severe pain. Oxymorphone is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics. It works by changing the way the body responds to pain.</p>
<a name="how">
    </a>
</div>
<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Oxymorphone comes as a tablet and an extended-release tablet to take by mouth on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. The regular tablet is usually taken every 4 to 6 hours. The extended-release tablet is usually taken every 12 hours. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take oxymorphone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of oxymorphone and gradually increase your dose until your pain is controlled. Your doctor may adjust your dose at any time during your treatment if your pain is not controlled. If you feel that your pain is not controlled, call your doctor. Do not change the dose of your medication without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking oxymorphone without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking oxymorphone, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness; watery eyes; runny nose; yawning; sweating; chills; muscle, joint, or back pain; enlarged pupils (black circles in the centers of the eyes); irritability; anxiety; weakness; stomach cramps; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; loss of appetite; fast heartbeat; and fast breathing.</p>
