<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Fosfomycin comes as granules to be mixed with water and then taken by mouth. Do not take the dry granules by mouth without first diluting them in water. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fosfomycin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>To prepare a dose, pour the entire contents of a single-dose packet into a glass and add 3 to 4 ounces (90 to 120 milliliters) of cold water. Stir to dissolve. Do not use hot water. The dose should be taken by mouth as soon as it is prepared.</p>
