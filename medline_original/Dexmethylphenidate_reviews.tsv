<p>Dexmethylphenidate can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, take it for a longer time, or take it in a different way than prescribed by your doctor. If you take too much dexmethylphenidate, you may find that the medication no longer controls your symptoms, you may feel a need to take large amounts of the medication, and you may experience unusual changes in your behavior Tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking dexmethylphenidate without talking to your doctor, especially if you have overused the medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually and monitor you carefully during this time. You may develop severe depression if you suddenly stop taking dexmethylphenidate after overusing it. Your doctor may need to monitor you carefully after you stop taking dexmethylphenidate, even if you have not overused the medication, because your symptoms may worsen when treatment is stopped.</p>

Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Dexmethylphenidate is used as part of a treatment program to control symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) in adults and children. Dexmethylphenidate is in a class of medications called central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain.</p>

</div>
<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Dexmethylphenidate comes as a tablet and an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. The tablet is usually taken twice a day, at least 4 hours apart, with or without food. The extended-release capsule is usually taken once a day in the morning. It may be taken with or without food, but will start to work faster if it is taken without food . Take dexmethylphenidate at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.</p>
<p>Swallow the extended-release capsules whole; do not chew or crush them. If you are unable to swallow the extended-release capsule, you can carefully open the capsule and sprinkle the contents on a spoonful of applesauce. Swallow this mixture immediately, but do not chew it. Do not save this mixture to use at a later time.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of dexmethylphenidate and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week.</p>
<p>Your condition should improve during your treatment. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen at any time during your treatment or do not improve after one month.</p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to stop taking dexmethylphenidate from time to time to see if the medication is still needed. Follow these directions carefully.</p>
