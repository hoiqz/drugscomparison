<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Naratriptan is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound or light). Naratriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and stopping the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Naratriptan does not prevent migraine attacks.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Naratriptan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It should be taken at any time after a migraine headache starts. Usually only one tablet is needed. If you have no response to the first tablet, do not take a second tablet without consulting your doctor. If you have a partial response to the first tablet, or your headache returns, a second tablet may be taken 4 hours after the first tablet. Do not take more than two tablets of naratriptan in any 24-hour period. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take naratriptan exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Naratriptan should be taken with plenty of water or other fluids.</p>
