<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ciclesonide oral inhalation is used to prevent difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing and coughing caused by asthma. Ciclesonide is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ciclesonide comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth. Ciclesonide is usually inhaled twice a day. Try to use ciclesonide at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ciclesonide inhalation exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with ciclesonide inhalation. If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale ciclesonide inhalation. If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Deltasone), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least one week after you begin to use ciclesonide inhalation. Special care will be needed in certain situations for several months as your body adjusts to the change in medication. Ask your doctor for more information.</p>
<p>Ciclesonide inhalation helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use ciclesonide inhalation during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on an average dose of ciclesonide inhalation. Your doctor may increase it if your symptoms have not improved after at least 4 weeks and later may decrease your dose when your symptoms are controlled.</p>
<p>Ciclesonide inhalation controls asthma but does not cure it. It may take 4 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use ciclesonide inhalation even if you feel well. Do not stop using ciclesonide inhalation without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if your asthma worsens during your treatment. Call your doctor if you have an asthma attack that does not stop when you use your fast-acting asthma medication, or if you need to use more of your fast-acting medication than usual.</p>
<p>The inhaler that comes with ciclesonide aerosol is designed for use only with a canister of ciclesonide. Never use it to inhale any other medication, and never use any other inhaler to inhale ciclesonide.</p>
<p>Each canister of ciclesonide aerosol is designed to provide 60 or 120 inhalations, depending on its size. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. Your inhaler comes with an attached counter that will change as every 10 sprays are used. When the number that shows on the counter is 020, you should call your doctor or pharmacist to refill your prescription. When the number that shows on the counter is 000, you should not use that canister anymore. You should also keep track of the number of inhalations you use each day to know the exact amount of sprays that remain in your inhaler. Throw away the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. If your inhaler is dropped, do not use the number on the counter to predict the number of sprays left in your inhaler.</p>
<p>Before you use your ciclesonide aerosol inhaler the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Look at the diagrams carefully and be sure that you recognize all the parts of the inhaler. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use it.</p>
<p>Do not use your ciclesonide inhaler while you are near an open flame or a heat source. The inhaler may explode if it is exposed to very high temperatures.</p>
<h3>To use the aerosol, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be sure that the inhaler is at room temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the cap from the mouthpiece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be sure the canister is fully and firmly inserted in the actuator. You do not need to shake your inhaler before each use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using the inhaler for the first time or if you have not used the inhaler in more than 10 days, prime it by releasing 3 test sprays into the air, away from your face. Be careful not to spray the medication into your eyes or face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe out through your mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the inhaler facing you with the mouthpiece on the bottom. Place your thumb under the mouthpiece and your index finger on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it, keeping your tongue below it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe in deeply and slowly through your mouth. At the same time, press down firmly on the center of the dose indicator at the top of the canister with your index finger. Remove your index finger as soon as the spray is released.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have breathed in fully, remove the inhaler from your mouth and close your mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to hold your breath for about 10 seconds, then breathe out gently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the cap back on the mouthpiece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out. Do not swallow the water.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Clean your inhaler once a week. To clean your inhaler, use a clean, dry tissue or cloth. Do not wash or put any part of your inhaler in water.</p>

<h2>What special precautions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before using ciclesonide inhalation,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ciclesonide, or any other medications.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: oral steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron, Dexone), methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Deltasone); ketoconazole (Nizoral); and medications for seizures. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Many other medications may also interact with ciclesonide, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have been on bedrest or unable to move around for a long time, or if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had osteoporosis (a condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily). Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had tuberculosis (a type of infection) in your lungs, cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), or glaucoma (an eye disease).  Also tell your doctor if you have any type of untreated infection anywhere in your body or a herpes infection (a type of infection that causes a sore on the eyelid or eye surface) in your eye.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while using ciclesonide inhalation, call your doctor.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are using ciclesonide inhalation.</li>
<li>you should know that your body may be less able to cope with stress such as surgery, illness, severe asthma attack, or injury. Call your doctor right away if you get sick and be sure that all health care providers who treat you know that you are using ciclesonide inhalation.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have never had chickenpox or measles and you have not been vaccinated against these infections. Stay away from people who are sick, especially people who have chickenpox or measles. If you are exposed to one of these infections or if you develop symptoms of one of these infections, call your doctor right away. You may need treatment to protect you from these infections.</li>
<li>you should know that ciclesonide inhalation sometimes causes wheezing and difficulty breathing immediately after it is inhaled. If this happens, use your fast-acting (rescue) asthma medication right away and call your doctor. Do not use ciclesonide inhalation again unless your doctor tells you that you should.</li>
