<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Talc is used to prevent malignant pleural effusion (buildup of fluid in the chest cavity in people who have cancer or other serious illnesses) in people who have already had this condition. Talc is in a class of medications called sclerosing agents. It works by irritating the lining of the chest cavity so that the cavity closes and there is no space for fluid.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Talc comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid and placed in the chest cavity through a chest tube (plastic tube that is placed in the chest cavity through a cut in the skin), and as an aerosol to be sprayed through a tube into the chest cavity during surgery. Talc is given by a doctor in a hospital.</p>
<p>After your doctor places talc in your chest cavity, you may be asked to change positions every 20-30 minutes for several hours to allow the talc to spread through your chest cavity.</p>
