<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Rosuvastatin is used together with diet, weight-loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Rosuvastatin is also used to decrease the amount of cholesterol (a fat-like substance) and other fatty substances in the blood in adults and children at least 10 years of age. Rosuvastatin is in a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Rosuvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take rosuvastatin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take rosuvastatin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of rosuvastatin and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 to 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Continue to take rosuvastatin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking rosuvastatin without talking to your doctor.</p>

<h2>What special precautions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before taking rosuvastatin,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to rosuvastatin, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in rosuvastatin tablets. Ask your pharmacist or check the medication guide for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin); cimetidine (Tagamet); cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune); ketoconazole (Nizoral); other medications for high cholesterol such as clofibrate (Atromid-S), fenofibrate (Tricor), gemfibrozil (Lopid), and niacin (Niaspan, Niacor); certain HIV protease inhibitors including atazanavir (Reyataz), taken with ritonavir (Norvir) and lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra); and spironolactone (Aldactone). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>if you are taking aluminum and magnesium hydroxide antacids (Mylanta, Maalox), take them at least 2 hours after rosuvastatin.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have liver disease. Your doctor will order laboratory tests to see how well your liver is working even if you do not think you have liver disease. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take rosuvastatin if you have liver disease or if the tests show that you may be developing liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are Asian, if you drink more than 2 alcoholic beverages daily, if you have ever had liver disease, or if you have or have ever had seizures, low blood pressure, or kidney or thyroid disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while taking rosuvastatin, call your doctor immediately. Rosuvastatin may harm the fetus.</li>
<li>do not breastfeed while taking rosuvastatin.</li>
<geriatric-precaut>
<p>you should know that the risk that you will develop serious muscle and kidney problems during your treatment with rosuvastatin is higher if you are 65 years of age or older. Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking rosuvastatin.</p>
</geriatric-precaut>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking rosuvastatin. If you are hospitalized due to serious injury or infection, tell the doctor who treats you that you are taking rosuvastatin.</li>
<li>ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking rosuvastatin. Alcohol can increase the risk of serious side effects.</li>
