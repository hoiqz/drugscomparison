<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Mupirocin comes in an ointment that is applied to the skin. Mupirocin usually is applied three times a day for 1 to 2 weeks. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use mupirocin exactly as directed.
