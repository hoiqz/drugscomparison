<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Clioquinol comes as a cream, lotion, and ointment to apply to the skin. Clioquinol is usually used two to four times a day for 4 weeks (2 weeks for jock itch). Follow the directions on the label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use clioquinol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than indicated on the product label.</p>
<p>Thoroughly clean the infected area, allow it to dry, and then gently rub the medication in until most of it disappears. Use just enough medication to cover the affected area. You should wash your hands after applying the medication.</p>
