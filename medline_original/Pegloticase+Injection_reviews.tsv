<p>Pegloticase injection may cause serious or life-threatening reactions. These reactions are most common within 2 hours of receiving the infusion, but may occur at any time during treatment. The infusion should be given by a doctor or nurse in a healthcare setting where these reactions can be treated. You also may receive certain medications before your infusion of pegloticase to help to prevent a reaction. Your doctor or nurse will watch you carefully while you receive pegloticase injection and for some time afterwards. Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms during or after your infusion: difficulty swallowing or breathing; wheezing; hoarseness; swelling of the face, throat, tongue or lips; hives; sudden redness of the face, neck or upper chest; rash; itching; redness of the skin; fainting; dizziness; chest pain; or tightness of the chest. If you experience a reaction, your doctor may slow or stop the infusion.</p>
<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests to check your body's response to pegloticase injection and may stop your treatment if the medication is not working.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with pegloticase injection and each time you receive the medication. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Pegloticase injection is used to treat ongoing gout (sudden, severe pain, redness, and swelling in one or more joints caused by abnormally high levels of a substance called uric acid in the blood) in adults who cannot take or did not respond to other medications. Pegloticase injection is in a class of medications called PEGylated uric acid specific enzymes. It works by decreasing the amount of uric acid in the body. Pegloticase injection is used to prevent gout attacks, but not to treat them once they occur.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Pegloticase injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a medical office or clinic. It is usually given once every 2 weeks. It will take at least 2 hours for you to receive your dose of pegloticase injection.</p>
<p>It may take several months before pegloticase injection begins to prevent gout attacks. Pegloticase injection may increase the number of gout attacks during the first 3 months of your treatment. Your doctor may prescribe another medication such as colchicine or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to prevent gout attacks during the first six months of your treatment. Continue to receive pegloticase injection even if you have gout attacks during your treatment.</p>
<p>Pegloticase injection controls gout but does not cure it. Continue to receive pegloticase injections even if you feel well. Do not stop receiving pegloticase injections without talking to your doctor.</p>
