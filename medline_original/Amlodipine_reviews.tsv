<p>[Posted 04/20/2012] <strong>ISSUE:</strong> FDA notified healthcare professionals of possible risks when using blood pressure medicines containing aliskiren with other drugs called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with diabetes or kidney (renal) impairment. These drug combinations should not be used (are contraindicated) in patients with diabetes. In addition, avoid use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (i.e., where glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt; 60 mL/min). The labels for the aliskiren drugs are being updated based on preliminary data from a clinical trial, ''Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardio-Renal Endpoints (ALTITUDE).''</p>
<p>
<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) by lowering blood pressure.</p>
<p>
<strong>RECOMMENDATION:</strong> Concomitant use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs in patients with diabetes is contraindicated because of the risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Avoid use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs in patients with renal impairment where GFR &lt; 60 mL/min. Patients should not stop taking aliskiren without talking to your healthcare professional. Stopping aliskiren suddenly can cause problems if your high blood pressure (hypertension) is not treated.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Amlodipine is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure and chest pain (angina). Amlodipine is in a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard. It controls chest pain by increasing the supply of blood to the heart. If taken regularly, amlodipine controls chest pain, but it does not stop chest pain once it starts. Your doctor may prescribe a different medication to take when you have chest pain.</p>
<a name="how">

</div>
<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Amlodipine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take amlodipine, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take amlodipine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of amlodipine and gradually increase your dose.</p>
<p>Amlodipine controls high blood pressure and chest pain (angina) but does not cure them. Continue to take amlodipine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking amlodipine without talking to your doctor.</p>
