<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Selenium sulfide comes in a lotion and is usually applied as a shampoo. As a shampoo, selenium sulfide usually is used twice a week for the first 2 weeks and then once a week for 2, 3, or 4 weeks, depending on your response. For skin infections, selenium sulfide usually is applied once a day for 7 days. Follow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use selenium sulfide exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not use this medication if your scalp or the skin area to be treated is cut or scratched.</p>
<p>Avoid getting selenium sulfide in your eyes. If the medication gets into your eyes accidentally, rinse them with clear water for several minutes.</p>
<p>Do not leave selenium sulfide on your hair, scalp, or skin for long periods (e.g., overnight) because it is irritating. Rinse off all of the lotion.</p>
<p>Do not use this medication on children younger than 2 years of age without a doctor's permission.</p>
<h3>To use the lotion as a shampoo, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove all jewelry; selenium sulfide may damage it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hair with ordinary shampoo and rinse it well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shake the lotion well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Massage 1 to 2 teaspoonsful (5 to 10 mL) of the lotion into your wet scalp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the lotion on your scalp for 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rinse your scalp three or four times with clean water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat Steps 4, 5, and 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using selenium sulfide before or after bleaching, tinting, or permanent waving your hair, rinse your hair with cool water for at least 5 minutes after applying selenium sulfide to prevent discolored hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands well and clean under your nails to remove any lotion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If your doctor tells you to use the lotion on your skin, apply a small amount of water with the lotion to the affected area and massage it to form a lather. Leave the lotion on your skin for 10 minutes; then rinse it thoroughly.</p>
