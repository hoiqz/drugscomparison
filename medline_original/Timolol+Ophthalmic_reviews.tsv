<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ophthalmic timolol is used to treat glaucoma, a condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision. Timolol is in a class of medications called beta-blockers. It works by decreasing the pressure in the eye.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ophthalmic timolol comes as a solution (liquid) and an extended-release (long-acting) gel-forming solution (liquid that thickens to a gel when instilled in the eye). Timolol eye drops are usuallyinstilled once or twice a day, at evenly spaced intervals, until pressure in the eye is controlled (about 4 weeks). Then it may be instilled once a day. Timolol gel-forming solution is usually instilled once a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use timolol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Timolol eye drops and gel-forming solution control glaucoma but do not cure it. Continue to use timolol even if you feel well. Do not stop using the medication without talking to your doctor.</p>
<h3>To instill the eye drops or eye gel, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using the gel-forming solution, invert the container and shake it once. (There is no need to shake the eye-drops.) Make sure that the end of the dropper is not chipped or cracked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using the eye drops, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. If you are using the gel-forming solution, check the directions that came with your medication to see whether you should push the bottom of the bottle so that a single drop falls out or press a specially marked area on the side of the bottle. If you are using the type of bottle that must be pushed from the bottom, be careful not to squeeze the sides of the bottle. Remove your index finger from the lower eyelid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a finger on the tear duct and apply gentle pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe any excess liquid from your face with a tissue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are to use more than one drop in the same eye, wait at least 5 minutes before instilling the next drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace and tighten the cap on the dropper bottle. Do not wipe or rinse the dropper tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands to remove any medication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
