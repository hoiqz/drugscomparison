<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Daptomycin injection is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat certain blood infections or serious skin infections caused by bacteria. Daptomycin injection is in a class of medications called cyclic lipopeptide antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics will not work for treating colds, flu, or other viral infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Daptomycin injection comes as a powder to be added to fluid and injected into a vein by a doctor or nurse. It is usually given once a day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection being treated and your response to daptomycin treatment. You may receive daptomycin injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you are using daptomycin injection at home, use it at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use daptomycin injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You should begin to feel better during the first few days of treatment with daptomycin injection. If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor.</p>
<p>Use daptomycin injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using daptomycin injection too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
