<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Tiagabine is used in combination with other medications to treat partial seizures (a type of epilepsy). Tiagabine is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It is not known exactly how tiagabine works, but it increases the amount of natural chemicals in the brain that prevent seizure activity.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Tiagabine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken with food two to four times a day. However, for the first week of treatment you will only take tiagabine once a day. Your doctor will slowly increase your dose (not more often than once each week) until you reach the dose of tiagabine you are to take regularly. To help you remember to take tiagabine, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tiagabine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Continue to take tiagabine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking tiagabine without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. Abruptly stopping this medication can cause seizures. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with tiagabine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<li>tell your doctor what herbal products you are taking, especially St. John's wort.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you have or have ever had a severe rash caused by taking a medication; status epilepticus (seizures following one another without a break); or eye or liver disease.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking tiagabine, call your doctor immediately.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking tiagabine.</li>
<li>you should know that tiagabine may make you drowsy and may affect your ability to think clearly. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this drug will affect you.</li>
<li>remember that alcohol may add to the drowsiness caused by this medication. Ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking tiagabine.</li>
<li>you should know that seizures, including status epilepticus, have occurred in people without epilepsy who take tiagabine. These seizures usually occurred soon after beginning treatment with tiagabine or near the time of a dose increase, but also have also occurred at other times during treatment.</li>
<li>you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking tiagabine for the treatment of epilepsy, mental illness, or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as tiagabine to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as tiagabine, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; giving away prized possessions; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.</li>
