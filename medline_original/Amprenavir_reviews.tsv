<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Amprenavir is used in combination with other antiretroviral medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Amprenavir belongs to a class of drugs called protease inhibitors, which slow the spread of HIV infection in the body.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Amprenavir comes as a capsule and liquid to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day. Amprenavir may be taken with or without food. However, avoid taking amprenavir with high-fat foods or high-fat meals. The amount of drug in amprenavir capsules is not the same as the amount in amprenavir liquid. Do not switch between amprenavir capsules and amprenavir liquid unless your doctor tells you how many amprenavir capsules or how much amprenavir liquid you should take. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take amprenavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Amprenavir is not a cure and may not decrease the number of HIV-related illnesses. Amprenavir does not prevent the spread of HIV to other people. Continue to take amprenavir even if you feel well. Do not stop taking amprenavir without talking to your doctor.</p>
