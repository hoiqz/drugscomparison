<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Aprepitant is used with other medications to prevent nausea and vomiting that may occur within 24 hours after receiving cancer chemotherapy treatment. It is also used with other medications to prevent delayed nausea and vomiting that may occur several days after receiving certain chemotherapy medications. Aprepitant is also used alone to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by surgery. Aprepitant is not used to treat nausea and vomiting that you already have. Aprepitant is in a class of medications called antiemetics. It works by blocking the action of neurokinin, a natural substance in the brain that causes nausea and vomiting.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Aprepitant comes as a capsule to take by mouth. To prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy, aprepitant is usually taken once daily, with or without food, during the first few days of your cancer chemotherapy treatment. You will probably take aprepitant 1 hour before your first dose of chemotherapy, and then each morning for the next 2 days. To prevent nausea and vomiting caused by surgery, aprepitant is usually taken as one dose within 3 hours before the start of surgery. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take aprepitant exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Aprepitant capsules come in two different strengths. Your doctor may prescribe both of the strengths for you to take at different times. You should be careful to take the right strength at the right time as directed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Aprepitant only works to prevent nausea and vomiting. Call your doctor if you already have these symptoms and do not begin to take aprepitant. .</p>
<p>When used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy, aprepitant is usually used only during the first 3 days of the chemotherapy treatment cycles. Do not continue taking aprepitant longer than instructed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
