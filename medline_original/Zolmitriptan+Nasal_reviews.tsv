<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Zolmitriptan nasal spray is used to treat the symptoms of migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to sound and light). Zolmitriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels around the brain and stopping the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Zolmitriptan does not prevent migraine attacks.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Zolmitriptan comes as a spray to inhale through the nose. It is usually used during a migraine attack. If your symptoms improve after you use zolmitriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may use a second dose of zolmitriptan. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you use zolmitriptan, do not use a second dose without talking to your doctor. Do not use more than two sprays of zolmitriptan in a 24-hour period. Call your doctor if you need to use zolmitriptan nasal spray to treat more than four headaches in 1 month. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use zolmitriptan exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not use zolmitriptan nasal spray to treat a headache that feels different than your usual migraine attacks. Call your doctor to find out what you should do.</p>
<p>If you have certain risk factors for heart disease, your doctor may ask you to use your first dose of zolmitriptan nasal spray in the doctor's office or other medical facility where you can be monitored for serious reactions.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
