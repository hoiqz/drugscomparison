<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Bentoquatam lotion is used to prevent poison oak, poison ivy, and poison sumac rashes in people who may come in contact with these plants. Bentoquatam is in a class of medications called skin protectants. It works by forming a coating on the skin that protects it from the plant oils that may cause a rash. Bentoquatam will not soothe or heal a rash that has already developed from contact with poison oak, poison ivy, or poison sumac.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Bentoquatam comes as a lotion to apply to the skin. It is usually applied at least 15 minutes before possible contact with poison oak, poison ivy, or poison sumac, and reapplied at least once every 4 hours for as long as the risk of contact with these plants continues. Follow the directions on the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use bentoquatam exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Bentoquatam lotion is available without a prescription. However, you should ask a doctor before you apply bentoquatam lotion to a child who is younger than 6 years old.</p>
<p>Shake the lotion very well before each use to mix the medication evenly.</p>
<p>Bentoquatam lotion is only for use on the skin. Do not get bentoquatam lotion in your eyes and do not swallow the medication. If you do get bentoquatam lotion in your eyes, rinse them with plenty of water.</p>
<p>Do not apply bentoquatam lotion to an open rash.</p>
<p>Bentoquatam lotion may catch fire. Stay away from fires and open flames while applying the lotion and for as long as the lotion is on your skin.</p>
