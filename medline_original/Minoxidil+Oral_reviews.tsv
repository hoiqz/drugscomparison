<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Minoxidil comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once or twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take minoxidil exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Minoxidil controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take minoxidil even if you feel well. Do not stop taking minoxidil without talking to your doctor.</p>
