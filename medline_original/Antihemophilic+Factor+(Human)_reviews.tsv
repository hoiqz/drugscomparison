<h2>About your treatment</h2>

<p>Your doctor has ordered antihemophilic factor (human), an antihemophilic factor, to help your blood to clot. The drug will be either injected directly into your vein or added to an intravenous fluid that will drip through a needle or catheter placed in your vein for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. It will be given as often as your doctor determines you need it, possibly as often as every other day.</p>
<p>Antihemophilic factor (human), a substance naturally produced in your body, activates substances in your blood to form clots and decrease bleeding episodes. This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
<p>Your health care provider (doctor, nurse, or pharmacist) may measure the effectiveness and side effects of your treatment using laboratory tests and physical examinations. It is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. The length of treatment depends on how your symptoms respond to the medication.</p>

<h2>Precautions</h2>

<h3>Before administering antihemophilic factor (human),</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you have ever had a reaction to an antihemophilic factor or if you are allergic to any drugs.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, especially aminocaproic acid (Amicar), anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (Lovenox, Normiflo), interferon alfa (Roferon-A, Intron), vincristine (Oncovin), vitamin K, and other vitamins.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking antihemophilic factor (human), call your doctor.</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking antihemophilic factor (human), before any surgeries or procedures.</li>
<li>you should know antihemophilic factor (human) is prepared from human plasma. There is a risk that antihemophilic factor (human) may contain the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viruses that may cause hepatitis. Talk with your doctor about the potential risks of taking this medication.</li>

<h2>Administering your medication</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<p>Before you administer antihemophilic factor (human), look at the solution closely. It should be clear and free of floating material. Gently squeeze the bag or observe the solution container to make sure there are no leaks. Do not use the solution if it is discolored, if it contains particles, or if the bag or container leaks. Use a new solution, but show the damaged one to your health care provider.</p>
<p>It is important that you use your medication exactly as directed. Do not stop your therapy on your own for any reason. Do not change your dosing schedule without talking to your health care provider. Your health care provider may tell you to stop your infusion if you have a mechanical problem (such as a blockage in the tubing, needle, or catheter); if you have to stop an infusion, call your health care provider immediately so your therapy can continue.</p>
