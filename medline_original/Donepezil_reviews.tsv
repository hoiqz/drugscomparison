<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Donepezil is used to treat dementia (a brain disorder that affects the ability to remember, think clearly, communicate, and perform daily activities and may cause changes in mood and personality) associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD; a brain disease that slowly destroys the memory and the ability to think, learn, communicate and handle daily activities). Donepezil is in a class of medications called cholinesterase inhibitors. It improves mental function (such as memory, attention, social interaction, reasoning and language abilities, and ability to perform activities of daily living) by increasing the amount of a certain naturally occurring substance in the brain. Donepezil may improve the ability to think and remember or slow the loss of these abilities in people who have AD. However, donepezil will not cure AD or prevent the loss of mental abilities at some time in the future.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Donepezil comes as a tablet and an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day, in the evening at bedtime, with or without food. Take donepezil at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. It may take awhile before you experience the full benefits of donepezil. Take donepezil exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Donepezil helps control the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease but does not cure it. Continue to take donepezil even if you feel well. Do not stop taking donepezil without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of donepezil and increase your dose after 4 to 6 weeks.</p>
<p>To take the orally disintegrating tablet, place the tablet on your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be followed with a drink of water.</p>
