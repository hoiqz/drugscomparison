<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ferrous sulfate provides the iron needed by the body to produce red blood cells. It is used to treat or prevent iron-deficiency anemia, a condition that occurs when the body has too few red blood cells because of pregnancy, poor diet, excess bleeding, or other medical problems.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ferrous sulfate comes as regular, coated, and extended-release (long-acting) tablets; regular and extended-release capsules; and oral liquid (syrup, drops, and elixir) to take by mouth. Ferrous sulfate usually is taken three times a day between meals. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ferrous sulfate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Although symptoms of iron deficiency usually improve within a few days, you may have to take ferrous sulfate for 6 months if you have severe iron deficiency.</p>
<p>This medication should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating.</p>
<p>Ferrous sulfate drops come with a special dropper for measuring the dose. Ask your pharmacist to show you how to use it. The drops may be placed directly in the mouth or mixed with water or fruit juice (not with milk).</p>
<p>Do not crush or chew regular, coated, or extended-release tablets, and do not open regular or extended-release capsules; swallow them whole.</p>
