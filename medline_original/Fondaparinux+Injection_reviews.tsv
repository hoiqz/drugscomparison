<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Fondaparinux injection is used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT; a blood clot, usually in the leg), which can lead to pulmonary embolism (PE; a blood clot in the lung), in people who are having hip surgery, hip or knee replacement, or abdominal surgery. It is also used in along with warfarin (Coumadin) to treat deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Fondaparinux injection is in a class of medications called factor Xa inhibitors. It works by decreasing the clotting ability of the blood.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Fondaparinux injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected subcutaneously (just under the skin) in the lower stomach area,. It is usually given one time a day for 5 to 9 days or sometimes for up to about 1 month. You will probably begin using fondaparinux injection while you are in the hospital at least 6 to 8 hours after your surgery. Use fondaparinux injection at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fondaparinux injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>If you will continue to use fondaparinux after your hospital stay, you can inject fondaparinux yourself or have a friend or relative perform the injections. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it. Before you use fondaparinux injection yourself the first time, read the Patient Information that comes with it. This information includes directions for how to use and inject fondaparinux prefilled safety syringes. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to inject this medication.</p>
<p>Each syringe has enough medication in it for one shot. Do not use the syringe and needle more than one time. Your doctor, pharmacist, or healthcare provider will tell you how to throw away used needles and syringes safely.</p>
<p>Do not mix fondaparinux injection with other medications or solutions.</p>
