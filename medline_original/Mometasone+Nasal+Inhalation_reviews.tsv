<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Mometasone nasal inhalation is used for the treatment and prevention of nasal symptoms of seasonal and year-round allergies, including runny nose, sneezing, and itchy nose. Mometasone nasal inhalation is in a class of medications called topical steroids. It works by reducing inflammation (swelling) in the nasal passages.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Mometasone comes as a spray to inhale through the nose. It is usually sprayed once a day in each nostril. To help you remember to use mometasone nasal inhalation, use it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use mometasone nasal inhalation exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Shake the pump well before each use.</p>
<p>Do not spray mometasone nasal inhalation into the eyes.</p>
<p>For the prevention of nasal symptoms of seasonal allergies, begin using mometasone nasal inhalation 2 to 4 weeks before the beginning of the pollen season.</p>
<p>Mometasone nasal inhalation controls the nasal symptoms of allergies but does not cure them. You should begin to feel an improvement in your nasal allergies within 1 to 2 days of the first dose of mometasone nasal inhalation. It may take 1 to 2 weeks until you feel the full benefit of mometasone nasal inhalation. Continue to use mometasone nasal inhalation even if you feel well.</p>
<p>Before you use mometasone nasal inhalation the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use it. Practice using the inhaler while he or she watches.</p>
<h3>To use the nasal inhalation, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gently blow your nose to clear the nostrils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close one nostril. Tilt your head forward slightly and keep the bottle upright while inserting the nasal applicator into the other nostril.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each spray, press down firmly once on the shoulders of the white applicator using your forefinger and middle finger. Support the base of the bottle with your thumb. Breathe gently inward through the nostril.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breathe out through the mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat in the other nostril.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the plastic cap.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Before using a new pump of mometasone nasal inhalation for the first time, prime the pump by spraying ten times or until a fine spray appears. If you do not use the pump for more than 1 week, prime it again by spraying two times or until a fine spray appears.</p>
