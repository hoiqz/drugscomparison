<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ruxolitinib is used to treat myelofibrosis (a condition in which the bone marrow is replaced by scar tissue and causes decreased blood cell production). Ruxolitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking an enzyme that causes scar tissue to form in the bone marrow.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ruxolitinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two times a day. Take ruxolitinib at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ruxolitinib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor may start you on a low dose of ruxolitinib for the first four weeks of treatment, and gradually increase your dose after that time, not more than once every 2 weeks.</p>
<p>If you are unable to swallow, your doctor may tell you to take ruxolitinib through a nasogastric (NG) tube. If so, your doctor or pharmacist will explain how to prepare ruxolitinib to give through an NG tube.</p>
<p>Your doctor will order blood tests before and during your treatment to see how you are affected by this medication. Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose of ruxolitinib during your treatment, or may tell you to stop taking ruxolitinib for awhile. This depends on how well the medication works for you and if you experience side effects. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment. Continue to take ruxolitinib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ruxolitinib without talking to your doctor. If your treatment with ruxolitinib is stopped, your doctor may decrease your dose gradually.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
