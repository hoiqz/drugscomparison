<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Clobetasol comes in cream, gel, ointment, and spray for use on the skin and in foam, lotion, and shampoo to apply to the scalp. Clobetasol is used once or twice a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use clobetasol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Do not use clobetasol for longer than 14 days without your doctor's approval.</p>
<p>Thoroughly clean the affected area, allow it to dry, and then gently rub the medication in until most of it disappears. Use just enough medication to cover the affected area. You should wash your hands after applying the medication. The scalp lotion should be applied directly from the squeeze bottle to the affected area.</p>
<p>Clobetasol can be absorbed into your body if used in large amounts and can cause harmful effects.</p>
