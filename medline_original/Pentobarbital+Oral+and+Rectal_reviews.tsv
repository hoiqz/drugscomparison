<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Pentobarbital, a barbiturate, is used in the short-term treatment of insomnia (to help you fall asleep and stay asleep for a proper rest). It is also used as a sedative to relieve anxiety and induce sleep before surgery.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Pentobarbital comes as a capsule and liquid to take by mouth and as a suppository to be used rectally. The capsule or liquid is taken at bedtime as needed for insomnia or two to four times a day for anxiety. Take pentobarbital on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. The suppositories are inserted at bedtime as needed for insomnia or two to four times a day for anxiety. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take pentobarbital exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Pentobarbital can be habit-forming; do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer time than your doctor tells you to. Do not stop taking pentobarbital without talking to your doctor, especially if you have taken large doses for a long time. Your doctor probably will decrease your dose gradually.</p>
<h3>To insert a pentobarbital suppository, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the wrapper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dip the tip of the suppository in water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest. (A left-handed person should lie on the right side and raise the left knee.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using your finger, insert the suppository into the rectum, about 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 centimeters) in infants and children and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in adults. Hold it in place for a few moments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand up after about 15 minutes. Wash your hands thoroughly and resume your normal activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
