<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Tinidazole is used to treat trichomoniasis (a sexually transmitted disease that can affect men and women), giardiasis (an infection of the intestine that can cause diarrhea, gas, and stomach cramps), and amebiasis (an infection of the intestine that can cause diarrhea, gas, and stomach cramps and can spread to other organs such as the liver). Tinidazole is in a class of medications called antiprotozoal agents. It works by killing the organisms that can cause infection.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Tinidazole comes as a suspension (liquid) prepared by the pharmacist and a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food as a single dose or once a day for 3 to 5 days. To help you remember to take tinidazole (if you are to take it for more than one day), take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take tinidazole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Shake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.</p>
<p>Take tinidazole until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking tinidazole too soon or skip doses, your infection may not be completely cured and bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics</p>
