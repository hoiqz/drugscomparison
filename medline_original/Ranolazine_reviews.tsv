<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ranolazine comes as an extended-release (long-acting) tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food two times a day. Take ranolazine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ranolazine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not break, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of ranolazine and gradually increase your dose.</p>
<p>Do not take ranolazine to treat a sudden attack of angina. Your doctor will tell you what you should do if you experience an attack of angina. Make sure that you understand these directions.</p>
<p>Ranolazine may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take ranolazine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ranolazine without talking to your doctor.</p>
