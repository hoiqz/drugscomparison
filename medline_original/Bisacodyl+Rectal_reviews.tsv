<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Rectal bisacodyl is used on a short-term basis to treat constipation. It also is used to empty the bowels before surgery and certain medical procedures. Bisacodyl is in a class of medications called stimulant laxatives. It works by increasing activity of the intestines to cause a bowel movement.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Rectal bisacodyl comes as a suppository and enema to use rectally. It is usually used at the time that a bowel movement is desired. The suppositories usually cause a bowel movement within 15 to 60 minutes and the enema within 5 to 20 minutes. Do not use bisacodyl more than once a day or for more than 1 week without talking to your doctor. Follow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use rectal bisacodyl exactly as directed. Frequent or continued use of bisacodyl may make you dependent on laxatives and cause your bowels to lose their normal activity. If you do not have a regular bowel movement after using bisacodyl, do not use this medication again and talk to your doctor.</p>
<h3>If using a bisacodyl suppository, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the suppository is soft, hold it under cool water or place it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to harden it before removing the wrapper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the wrapper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you were told to use half of the suppository, cut it lengthwise with a clean, sharp knife or blade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using your finger, insert the suppository, pointed end first, into your rectum until it passes the muscular sphincter of the rectum, about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in adults. If not inserted past this sphincter, the suppository may pop out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold it in place for as long as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>If using a bisacodyl enema, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Shake the enema bottle well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the protective shield from the tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest or kneel and lean forward so that your head and chest are resting comfortably.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gently insert the enema bottle into the rectum with the tip pointing toward the navel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squeeze the bottle gently until the bottle is nearly empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the enema bottle from the rectum. Hold the enema contents in place as long as possible, for up to 10 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands thoroughly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
