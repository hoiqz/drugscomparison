<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ingenol mebutate comes as a 0.015% or 0.05% gel to apply to the skin. When ingenol mebutate gel is used to treat actinic keratosis on the face or scalp, the 0.015% gel is usually applied once a day for 3 days in a row. When ingenol mebutate gel is used to treat actinic keratosis on the trunk (torso), arms, hands, or legs, the 0.05% gel is usually applied once a day for 2 days in a row. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ingenol mebutate gel exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Ingenol mebutate gel should only be used on the skin. Do not apply ingenol mebutate gel in or near your eyes, mouth, or vagina. If you get ingenol mebutate gel in your eyes, flush them with large amounts of water right away, and get medical care as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Do not apply ingenol mebutate gel right after taking a shower or less than 2 hours before bedtime. After applying ingenol mebutate gel, avoid doing activities that cause a lot of sweating for at least 6 hours.</p>
<h3>To use ingenol mebutate gel, follow these steps: 

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the cap from a new tube of ingenol mebutate gel just before you are ready to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Squeeze the gel from the tube onto your fingertip. Use just enough gel to cover the area your doctor has instructed you to treat. One tube contains enough gel to cover a skin area of about 2 inches by 2 inches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spread the gel evenly over only the skin area you are treating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands right away after applying the gel. Be careful not to touch your eyes before you wash your hands. If the area you are treating is on your hands, wash only the fingertip you used to apply the gel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safely throw away the tube in the household trash after a single use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the treated area to dry for 15 minutes. Do not wash or touch the treated area for at least 6 hours. Be careful not to get the gel on the skin of another area of your body or to touch another person with the treated area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not cover the treated area with bandages or other dressings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 6 hours, the treated area can be washed with mild soap and water.</p>
</li>
</ol>
