<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Dalfampridine is used to improve walking in people who have multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and may cause weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control). Dalfampridine may be used alone or with other medications that control the symptoms of MS. Dalfampridine is in a class of medications called potassium channel blockers. It works by strengthening the signals sent by the brain through nerves that have been damaged by MS.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Dalfampridine comes as an extended-release tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food twice a day. Space your doses so that you take one dose approximately every 12 hours, and take dalfampridine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dalfampridine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, dissolve, or crush them.</p>
<p>Dalfampridine is not available in pharmacies. You can only get dalfampridine through the mail from a specialty pharmacy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about receiving your medication.</p>
<p>Dalfampridine may help improve your walking only as long as you continue to take it. It may take 6 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of dalfampridine. Continue to take dalfampridine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking dalfampridine without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with dalfampridine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
