<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Nicotine oral inhalation is used to help people stop smoking. Nicotine oral inhalation should be used together with a smoking cessation program, which may include support groups, counseling, or specific behavioral change techniques. Nicotine inhalation is in a class of medications called smoking cessation aids. It works by providing nicotine to your body to decrease the withdrawal symptoms experienced when smoking is stopped and to reduce the urge to smoke.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Nicotine oral inhalation comes as a cartridge to inhale by mouth using a special inhaler. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nicotine oral inhalation exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Follow your doctor's instructions about how many nicotine cartridges you should use each day. Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose depending on your urge to smoke. After you have used nicotine inhalation for 12 weeks and your body adjusts to not smoking, your doctor may decrease your dose gradually over the next 6 to 12 weeks until you are not using nicotine inhalation any more. Follow your doctor's instructions for how to decrease your nicotine dose.</p>
<p>The nicotine in the cartridges is released by frequent puffing over 20 minutes. You may use up a cartridge all at once or puff on it for a few minutes at a time until the nicotine is finished. You may want to try different schedules to see what works best for you.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient. Read the directions for how to use the inhaler and ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you the proper technique. Practice using the inhaler while in his or her presence.</p>
<p>If you have not stopped smoking at the end of 4 weeks, talk to your doctor. Your doctor can try to help you understand why you were not able to stop smoking and make plans to try again.</p>
