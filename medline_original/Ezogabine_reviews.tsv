<p>[POSTED: 04/26/2013] <strong>ISSUE:</strong> FDA is warning the public that the anti-seizure medication ezogabine (Potiga) can cause blue skin discoloration and eye abnormalities characterized by pigment changes in the retina. FDA does not currently know if these changes are reversible. FDA is working with the manufacturer to gather and evaluate all available information to better understand these events. FDA will update the public when more information is available.</p>
<p>
<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Ezogabine is approved as adjunctive (added on to other anti-seizure medications) treatment of partial-onset seizures in adult patients 18 years and older. The skin discoloration in the reported cases appeared as blue pigmentation, predominantly on or around the lips or in the nail beds of the fingers or toes, but more widespread involvement of the face and legs has also been reported. Scleral and conjunctival discoloration, on the white of the eye and inside eyelids, has been observed as well. The skin discoloration generally occurred after four years of treatment with ezogabine, but has appeared sooner in some patients. In some cases, retinal abnormalities have been observed in the absence of skin discoloration.</p>
<p>
<strong> RECOMMENDATION:</strong> All patients taking ezogabine should have a baseline eye exam and periodic eye exams that should include visual acuity testing and dilated fundus photography, and may include fluorescein angiograms (FA), ocular coherence tomography (OCT), perimetry, and electroretinograms (ERG). Patients who are taking ezogabine and develop any changes in your vision or any discoloration of your skin, including of your lips and nail beds should contact their health care professional right away. Patients should not stop taking ezogabine without talking to their health care professional. Stopping such treatment suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening medical problems such as recurrence of seizures.

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Ezogabine is used along with other medications to control partial onset seizures (seizures that involve only one part of the brain) in adults. Ezogabine is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by reducing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.</p>

<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Ezogabine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food 3 times a day. Take ezogabine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, dissolve, or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of ezogabine and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week.</p>
<p>Take ezogabine exactly as prescribed. Ezogabine may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Ezogabine may help control your condition but will not cure it. It may take a few weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of ezogabine. Continue to take ezogabine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking ezogabine without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking ezogabine, your seizures may happen more often. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually over at least 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with ezogabine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<h2>What special precautions should I follow?</h2>
<a href="#skip" class="return">Return to top</a>

<h3>Before taking ezogabine,</h3>
<ul>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ezogabine, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in ezogabine tablets. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients.</li>
<li>tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone); certain antibiotics such as azithromycin (Zithromax), clarithromycin (Biaxin), erythromycin (E.E.S., Erythrocin), or moxifloxacin (Avelox); chloroquine (Aralen); antihistamines; carbamazepine (Tegretol), chlorpromazine ; citalopram (Celexa); digoxin (Cardoxin, Digitek, Lanoxicaps, Lanoxin); disopyramide (Norpace); dofetilide (Tikosyn); droperidol (Inapsine); flecainide (Tambocor); haloperidol; ipratropium (Atrovent); medications for irritable bowel disease, motion sickness, Parkinson's disease, ulcers, or urinary problems; mesoridazine (Serentil); methadone (Dolophine); pentamidine (NebuPent, Pentam); phenytoin (Dilantin); pimozide (Orap); procainamide (Pronestyl); quinidine (in Nuedexta); sotalol (Betapace); thioridazine; and vandetanib (Caprelsa). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.</li>
<li>tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol and if you have or have ever had benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; enlarged prostate) or any other condition that causes difficulty urinating, heart failure or other heart problems, a long QT interval (a heart problem that may cause irregular heartbeat, fainting, or sudden death), low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood, or kidney or liver disease.</li>
<li>
<pregnancy>
<p>tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking ezogabine, call your doctor.</p>
</pregnancy>
</li>
<li>if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking ezogabine.</li>
<li>you should know that ezogabine may make you dizzy, drowsy, confused, or unable to concentrate. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.</li>
<li>ask your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages while you are taking ezogabine. Alcohol can make the dizziness and drowsiness caused by ezogabine worse.</li>
<li>you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways and you may become suicidal (thinking about harming or killing yourself or planning or trying to do so) while you are taking ezogabine for the treatment of epilepsy or other conditions. A small number of adults and children 5 years of age and older (about 1 in 500 people) who took anticonvulsants such as ezogabine to treat various conditions during clinical studies became suicidal during their treatment. Some of these people developed suicidal thoughts and behavior as early as one week after they started taking the medication. There is a risk that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take an anticonvulsant medication such as ezogabine, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated. You and your doctor will decide whether the risks of taking an anticonvulsant medication are greater than the risks of not taking the medication. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood); talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life; withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying; giving away prized possessions; or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.</li>
