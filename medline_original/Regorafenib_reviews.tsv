<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Regorafenib is used to treat colon and rectal cancer (cancer that begins in the large intestine or the rectum) that has spread to other parts of the body in people who have not been treated successfully with certain other medications. Regorafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Regorafenib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with a low-fat breakfast once a day for 3 weeks and then skipped for 1 week. This treatment period is called a cycle, and the cycle may be repeated for as long as your doctor recommends. Take regorafenib at the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take regorafenib exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Take regorafenib with a low-fat breakfast that contains less than 30% of calories from fat (each gram of fat contains 9 calories). Examples of a low-fat breakfast include 2 slices of white toast with 1 tablespoon of low-fat margarine and 1 tablespoon of jelly, and 8 ounces of skim milk (about 320 calories and 8 grams of fat); or 1 cup of cereal, 8 ounces of skim milk, 1 slice of toast with jam, apple juice, and 1 cup of coffee or tea (about 520 calories and 2 grams of fat). Talk to your doctor about other low-fat breakfasts to eat with regorafenib.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>Your doctor may decrease your dose of regorafenib or tell you to stop taking regorafenib for a period of time during your treatment. This will depend on how well the medication works for you and any side effects you may experience. Continue to take regorafenib even if you feel well. Do not stop taking regorafenib without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Regorafenib is not available at retail pharmacies. Your medication will be mailed to you or to your doctor from a specialty pharmacy. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how you will receive your medication.</p>
<p>Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.</p>
