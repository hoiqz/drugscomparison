<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Adapalene comes as a gel, a solution (liquid), and a cream to apply to the skin. The solution comes in a glass bottle with an applicator and as individual pledgets (medicated wipes for one time use). It is usually applied once a day at bedtime. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Apply adapalene exactly as directed. Do not apply more or less of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Applying more adapalene or applying adaplene more often than recommended will not speed up or improve results, but it may irritate your skin.</p>
<p>Adapalene controls acne but does not cure it. Your acne may get worse during the first few weeks of treatment, and it may take 8 to 12 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of adapalene. Pimples can take 6 to 8 weeks to form under the skin, and during the first weeks of your treatment, adapalene may bring these pimples to the skin surface. Continue to use adapalene even if your acne worsens or you do not see much improvement at first. Do not stop using adapalene without talking to your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not apply adapalene to skin that is sunburned, broken, or covered with eczema (a skin disease). If you have any of these conditions, do not apply adapalene until your skin has healed.</p>
<p>Be careful not to get adapalene in your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you do get adapalene in your eyes, wash them with plenty of water and call your doctor. Your eyes may become irritated, swollen, or infected.</p>
<h3>To use the cream, gel, or solution, follow these steps:

</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gently wash the affected skin with a mild soap or soapless cleanser and pat dry with a soft towel. Do not use harsh or abrasive cleansers, and do not scrub your skin vigorously. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to recommend a gentle cleanser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using the gel or cream, use your fingers to spread a thin film of medication over the affected area. If you are using a pledget, remove it from the foil pouch and gently wipe the entire affected area. If you are using the glass bottle of solution, apply a thin layer to the affected area using the applicator provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may feel a slight warmth or stinging in the place where you applied adapalene. This feeling is normal and should go away by itself in a short time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you used a pledget, throw it away after use. Do not save it to use again.</p>
</li>
</ol>
