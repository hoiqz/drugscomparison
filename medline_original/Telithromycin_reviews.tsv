<p>Telithromycin may cause worsening of symptoms, including breathing problems, when taken by people with myasthenia gravis (a disease that causes muscle weakness). These breathing problems may be severe or life-threatening and may cause death.  Tell your doctor if you have myasthenia gravis. You should not take telithromycin if you have this condition.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with telithromycin and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.  You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Telithromycin is used to treat certain types of pneumonia (an infection of the lungs) that is caused by bacteria. Telithromycin is in a class of medications called ketolide antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Antibiotics will not kill viruses that can cause colds, flu, or other infections.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Telithromycin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day for 7 to 10 days. To help you remember to take telithromycin, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take telithromycin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.</p>
<p>You should start to feel better early in your treatment. Call your doctor if your condition does not improve while you are taking telithromycin. Take telithromycin until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking telithromycin too soon or if you skip doses of telithromycin, your infection may not be cured and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.</p>
