<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Diazepam rectal gel is used in emergency situations to stop cluster seizures (episodes of increased seizure activity) in people who are taking other medications to treat epilepsy (seizures). Diazepam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by calming abnormal overactivity in the brain.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Diazepam comes as a gel to instill rectally using a prefilled syringe with a special plastic tip. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.</p>
<p>Before diazepam rectal gel is prescribed, the doctor will talk to your caregiver about how to recognize signs of the type of seizure activity that should be treated with this medication. Your caregiver will also be taught how to administer the rectal gel.</p>
<p>If used regularly, diazepam may be habit forming. Do not use a larger dose than your doctor tells you to. Diazepam rectal gel is not meant to be used on a daily basis. Diazepam rectal gel should not be used more than 5 times a month or more often than every 5 days. If you or your caregiver think that you need diazepam rectal gel more often than this, talk to your doctor.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put the person having seizures on his/her side in a place where he/she cannot fall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the protective cover from the syringe by pushing it up with your thumb and then pulling it off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put lubricating jelly on the rectal tip.</p>
</li>

<p>Turn the person on his/her side facing you, bend his/her upper leg forward, and separate his/her buttocks to expose the rectum.</p>

</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Slowly count to 3 again, and then remove the syringe from the rectum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold the buttocks together so the gel doesn't leak from the rectum, and slowly count to 3 before letting go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the person on his/her side. Take note of what time diazepam rectal gel was given, and continue to watch the person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
