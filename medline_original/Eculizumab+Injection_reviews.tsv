<p>Receiving eculizumab injection may increase the risk that you will develop a meningococcal infection (an infection that may affect the covering of the brain and spinal cord and/or may spread through the bloodstream) during your treatment or for some time afterward. Meningococcal infections may cause death in a short period of time. You will need to receive a meningococcal vaccine at least 2 weeks before you begin your treatment with eculizumab injection to decrease the risk that you will develop this type of infection. If you have received this vaccine in the past, you may need to receive a booster dose before you begin your treatment. If your doctor feels that you need to begin treatment with eculizumab injection right away, you will receive your meningococcal vaccine as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Even if you receive the meningococcal vaccine, there is still a risk that you may develop meningococcal disease during or after your treatment with eculizumab injection. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical help: headache that comes along with nausea or vomiting, fever, a stiff neck, or a stiff back; fever of 103°F (39.4°C) or higher; rash and fever; confusion; muscle aches and other flu-like symptoms; or if your eyes are sensitive to light.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor if you have fever or other signs of infection before you begin your treatment with eculizumab injection. Your doctor will not give you eculizumab injection if you already have a meningococcal infection.</p>
<p>Your doctor will give you a patient safety card with information about the risk of developing meningococcal disease during or for a period of time after your treatment. Carry this card with you at all times during your treatment and for 3 months after your treatment. Show the card to all healthcare providers who treat you so that they will know about your risk.</p>
<p>A program called Soliris REMS has been set up to decrease the risks of receiving eculizumab injection. You can only receive eculizumab injection from a doctor who has enrolled in this program, has talked to you about the risks of meningococcal disease, has given you a patient safety card, and has made sure that you received a meningococcal vaccine. </p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with eculizumab injection and each time you receive an injection. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm</a>) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about the risks of receiving eculizumab injection.</p>

<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Eculizumab injection is used to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH: a type of anemia in which too many red blood cells are broken down in the body, so there are not enough healthy cells to bring oxygen to all parts of the body). Eculizumab injection is also used to treat atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS; an inherited condition in which small blood clots form in the body and may cause damage to the blood vessels, blood cells, kidneys, and other parts of the body). Eculizumab injection is in a group of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by blocking the activity of the part of the immune system that may damage blood cells in people with PNH or cause clots to form in people aHUS.</p>
<a name="how">

<div id=hgroup
<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Eculizumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over at least 35 minutes by a doctor or nurse in a medical office. It is usually given to adults once a week for 5 weeks and then once every other week. Children may receive eculizumab injection on a different schedule, depending on their age and body weight. Extra doses of eculizumab injection are also given before or after certain other treatments for PNH or aHUS.</p>
<p>Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of eculizumab injection and increase your dose after 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Eculizumab injection may cause serious allergic reactions. Your doctor will watch you carefully while you are receiving eculizumab injection and for one hour after you receive the medication. Your doctor may slow or stop your infusion if you have an allergic reaction. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately: chest pain; feeling faint; rash; hives; swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, or throat; hoarseness; or difficulty breathing or swallowing.</p>
<p>Eculizumab injection may help control your condition but will not cure it. Do not stop receiving eculizumab injection without talking to your doctor.</p>
