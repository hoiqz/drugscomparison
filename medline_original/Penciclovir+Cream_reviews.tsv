<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Penciclovir is used on the lips and faces of adults to treat cold sores caused by herpes simplex virus. Penciclovir does not cure herpes infections but decreases pain and itching if applied when the earliest symptoms first appear.</p>
<p>This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Penciclovir comes as a cream. It is usually used externally every 2 hours while you are awake for 4 days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist or doctor to explain any part you do not understand. Use penciclovir exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Use this medication as soon as possible after symptoms appear.</p>
<p>Clean and dry the area before applying the cream to avoid spreading the infection. Rub the cream in gently, using enough cream to cover all sores completely.</p>
<p>Continue to use penciclovir even if you feel well. Do not stop using penciclovir without talking to your doctor.</p>

<p>Keep all appointments with your doctor. Penciclovir should only be used on the lips and face. Avoid getting it in your eyes. Keep the infected area clean and dry.</p>
