<h2>Why is this medication prescribed?</h2>

<p>Buprenorphine (Subutex) and buprenorphine and naloxone (Suboxone) are used to treat opioid dependence (addiction to opioid drugs, including heroin and narcotic painkillers). Buprenorphine is in a class of medications called opioid partial agonist-antagonists, and naloxone is in a class of medications called opioid antagonists. Buprenorphine alone and the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone prevent withdrawal symptoms when someone stops taking opioid drugs by producing similar effects to these drugs.</p>

<h2>How should this medicine be used?</h2>

<p>Buprenorphine and the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone come as sublingual tablets to taken under the tongue. They are usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>You will start your treatment with buprenorphine, which you will take in the doctor's office. Your doctor will start you on a low dose of buprenorphine and will increase your dose for several days before switching you to buprenorphine and naloxone. Your doctor may increase or decrease your buprenorphine and naloxone dose until the medication works properly.</p>
<p>Place the tablets under your tongue until they melt. This should take 2 to 10 minutes. If you are taking more than two tablets, either place them all under your tongue at the same time or place them under your tongue 2 at a time. Do not chew the tablets or swallow them whole.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking buprenorphine and naloxone without talking to your doctor. Stopping buprenorphine and naloxone too quickly can cause withdrawal symptoms. Your doctor will tell you when and how to stop taking buprenorphine and naloxone.</p>
