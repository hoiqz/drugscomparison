It has greatly improved my moods but also Reaching orgasm has become hard during intercourse. The drug is generally good but I found the higher doses (above 10mg), tended to numb all feelings. It also seems difficult to  taper off from, this is despite being told b my doctor that it shouldnt have been an issue.

I noticed relief after 2-3 days.  Side effects include difficulty having orgasm but that has gone away in time.  My testosterone level is low (216) but my doctor doesn't want to give me testosterone replacement therapy because of the compulsive s*xual history.  So now I have next to no s*x drive at all, which is leading to more depression.

I take 10mg. at night. I have reaped the benefits of help with the fibro pain, but however, my head/neck hurt severely  all the time since taking it for 6 months. I also have issues with the muscles of my eyes, pain and tenderness and the feeling that my eyes can't keep up with my movements. It is much worse in the mornings.I can't categorize my head pain as head aches, my head hurts as if my brain is ready to explode. I am going to try to wean myself off after my drs. visit this week. I am disappointed that I found relief from the fibro pain at the cost of other major pain. I simply cannot function with the pain in my head.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	cn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	8/23/2012 10:15:56 AM	I've only been taking the generic Lexapro for a week, but have been waking at 3-4 am and not able to go back to sleep, but this got better every night. Last night I slept through the night. The problem is, I've been having headaches daily now.(I have chronic migraines, but they are treated &amp; I haven't had one in months.) I thought I would wait it out &amp; see if it got better as the sleep problems were improving, but this morning was much worse. I called my doctor &amp; spoke with the nurse. She wants me to wait it out more &amp; said it's a common side-effect, or it may be my normal daily caffeine. I asked that she have my doctor call me. I'd rather go on something else that doesn't mess with my headaches. I think there are many other options to have to try and function with my head pounding.

My body reacted very badly and it got to a stage it could not function and was in fight or flight state ALL the time though I was not  depressed. She put me on 10mg of lexapro for the PTSD, initial side effects were jaw clenching (subsided after maybe 2 months) and yawning excessively.  I did get some headaches and occassional nausea.  I have not gained weight.  Take it morning time. My body has relaxed and I've been calmer then ever I can remember.  Just completed 6 months on it and have decided today to come off it (cold turkey as no more pills and will see what happens). If bad withdrawal will go back to GP for new perscription for same 10 mg dosage.  I have been very fatigued last couple of weeks and I'm not sure this is any way related to the lexapro.  Been under a lot of financially related stress and I put my exhaustion and brainfog down to that.

Had the most horrible nausea, headaches, dizziness, increased anxiety, heart palpitations, shortness of breath. Week two, decreased to 7.5 mg. No improvement in side effects. Since I am very sensitive to medications my doctor instructed me to cut to 5 mg. Did so and no improvement. Can barely lift my head without excruciating pain! needless to say it has been almost a month of pure torture and suffering. Everyone reacts differently to meds, so this is just my personal experience. Works for some, obviously not all. Read these posts with caution and see what works for you, but if you experience the side effects like I did, don't wait. Contact your health care provider and find an alternative. It will get better. Lexapro just didn't work for me.

I have cut my dosage in half, and if I know I am going to have a stress filled day, I take the entire dosage.  I have to take it mid-day because I have found if taken in the morning, then mid afternoon I feel exhausted to the point I can't keep my eyes open.  If I take it at night, I don't seem to wakeup in the morning.  So about 3pm is working best for me. Sexually I had issues for about 6 weeks, but those have resolved.

I started taking Lexapro about 6 months ago for anxiety and depression.  It helped for that, but I had a lot of short-term memory problems while using it.  I would forget what I was going to do constantly.  I discovered a lot of other people on-line also had this problem, and many of them had long-term memory problems even after quitting the drug.  I have quit taking it, because it is just not worth losing my memory over.  I have started taking natural supplements called &quot;True Calm&quot; which contain GABA, Glycine, Taurine, Inositol, and Valerian.  It works like a charm.  I am so glad I found it.  Also am looking into taking Passionflower, which have good reviews for anxiety.

Anxiety while driving, can't catch my breath, palpitations. My doctor prescribed lexapro 10mg once a day and xanax 0.25 when needed to get through the transition. I have been on Zoloft for several years but have beeen off since 2003. So I knew what to expect as far as starting and possible side effects. I took one dose of Lexapro and had a pretty much sleepless night, hot flashing, anxious. Felt like crap the next day and slept on and off for most of it. Needless to say, since I am not totally debilitated by the anxiety at this point, I decided to not continue with the lexapro and only take the xanax if the heart palpitations get out of control. I think I'll stick to the accupuncture I started, regular excercise and eating healthier and see if that works :)This is just my experience and maybe I didn't give it a fair shot but its hard to deaal with side effects of starting a med when you have a fulltime job and you're the bread and butter of the household.

He became extremely irratable, mean, aggressive and miserable towards everyone.  This drug was like a miracle drug at first within 2 weeks he seemed happy again. One of my big concerns is that 3 times he forgot to get the lexapro at the pharmacy for 1 day and his mood swings were so severe! He was so annoyed, aggrevated, miserable, nasty and mean all 3 times that he missed his dose for  1 night each.  3 nights ago he missed his dose and i actually stayed at a hotel yesterday thats how bad he was.  I cant believe that missing one dose can change his personality, mood and attitude so quickly but it did! Also he still dosnt want to leave the house, still sleeps excessivly but although his personality (when he takes it every day) is so much better along with his general mood he still has alot of symptoms of depression.  We are going to ask the Dr. to wein him off this, I cant be staying at a hotel everytime he forgets or misses 1 dose for 1 day...thats rediculous I dont think any medication should have that kind of severe effect if you miss it just one time.

I feel free and more like my old self then I can remember and it's amazing. My family is so happy to have 'me' back. So far,I have lost weight on this drug since it seems I'm never hungry but I hear to opposite of so many others. Also I fear the w/d when the day comes that I don't need it anymore. But right now, it's a God send and I'm thankful for it!

Now that I have made some decisions and changes in my life, I have decided to quite the Lexapro &quot;cold turkey&quot;.  I have been off a week now, and the vertigo is pretty bad.

The generic is cheaper but i heard alot of reports that people didnt like the generic and went back to brand name.

My Dr. put me on Lexapro - 10mg daily, and it really evened me out.  The problems were still there, but I could think rationally about them.  I've tried several times to leave Lexapro behind as my life is much better now, but when I decrease it to less than .5 mg, my family notices a change in my moods and energy within about a week.  Long story short, I'll probably be on it to a minimal extent forever.  Take care.

I'm diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder/depressive type and psychotic depression. I was going to have ECT but decided to give the meds one more chance. Lexapro seems to work the best. However, being male, I'm have severe erectile dysfunction and no libido. The doctor said this was most likely caused by the med. So it simply was a decision I had to make. I'm single and I'm more concerned with my illness and its treatment than being sexually active. My depression if not treated often caused severe delusions that would place me in a dangerous situation. However, after all this time including a commitment to a state hospital for over two years, I was always taught by my treatment providers that depression doesn't have to be treated by a only a drug. Finding a type of therapy such as CBT, DBT, or finding a support group is very beneficial. After years of seeing only my failures and problems my therapist made look back and remember good things and write them down. Self affirmations are nice also, and a little ice cream is good too.

I will write more later, my ratings might change. I have had Generalized panic and anxiety for a long time, off and on. But somethings have happened to our family and financial problems had put me in a tailspin since Nov. Even tho, I have found some relief with Xanax (half tab of low dosage as needed) anxiety was still coming back. Shaking feeling, sick to stomach, aches and pains, headaches, heart beating fast. I did find out I have a gall bladder that is not working,so that was part of stomach problem. Anyway, I started on 5 mg. of generic to work way up to 10, which I will take tonight. I started taking pill in am. First day hour later, dizzy and thumb twitching (it did stop) and felt sick all day. Next couple of days, burst of engery then a let down feeling. Sick to stomach. Went to work, I cut hair, but felt off. Lots of leg and arm, shoulder pain. I walked a couple of days, felt ok. Then Sunday and Monday, sick, sick, stomach, pain in joints. Called Dr. We think I take Crestor for Chelstrol, that might be causing some joint pain that is making me worry and anxious, too. She said to stop Crestor, and pain is less. I took 5 mg. last night, slept ok, then this am, little light headed and sick, sick to stomach barely could eat. I take Zantac for stomach. Went to work, by afternoon, felt better. Some reason, on this pill I am sick in am, but better in pm. Tonight I am going to take the 10 mg. Wish me luck! I switch from Day to night, bc last few days, felt so tired and yawning. If the 10 mg. makes me jittery at first, will switch to am again. I am also trying to do relax techniques, reading postive things, trying to stay busy and rest also. No sleep problems on this pill. Mostly stomach acid and pain is biggest complaint. Also at times feeling more anxious. I am going to try and give this a months try to see if it helps. I do have slight muscle jerk in knees and finger. Just now and then. I pray it helps me

Lexapro+Oral	Major Depressive Disorder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/15/2012 7:14:05 AM	I went on Lexapro for depression and severe anxiety.  Effexor did not help the anxiety symptoms which I have had all my life.  It is a miracle for me to feel normal in the mornings, not anxious for the first three hours after waking, and my depression is great as well.  I literally wanted to kill myself as well as all the other symptoms of depression.I would suggest giving this the full 6 weeks before deciding.  My symptoms got worse for the first 2-3 weeks and I had to increase the dose from 10mg to 15 to 20 and 20 is working so be willing to increase if necessary, as well as waiting the 6 weeks before making a judgment call.  And don't throw in the towel if symptoms appear worse before better because your brain has a lot of adjusting to do.I cannot say enough about this.  It has literally saved my life and given me my life and myself back.  I love it so much.  I feel normal, not happier or high or anything, just normal and balanced.  Still feel happy and sad when I should which I'm glad about.  Having the serotonin and norepinephrine (sp?) balanced makes such a difference in my life and I hope it will in yours too.  Don't give up!!  And if this doesn't work for you there are plenty of others that may be the one you need, but this has more than worked for me!

This is my third month on Lexapro...am now weening myself off. Weight gain, no/low energy, have an I don't care kind of attitute. It may have helped with my anxiety and have been able to take less klonopin. Personally I do not like that I have gained weight and have an I don't care attitude with regards to just about everything! I'm sure this drug is for some ppl but definately not for me! So back to my PCP to &quot;try&quot; something else!

The only problem is that I become unable to take care of my little girl who has just turned 4 years old, 4 months ago. At one time I was sleeping on the couch and my daughter went out the back door which is enclosed and she's unable to get out into public but when I woke I was so angry that I went outside, grabbed a switch off of a tree and I ended up putting two large welts across her lower back and my Father had her taken away from me for 30days until I purgerred myself in court so I could keep her!

The drug was prescribed by my family doctor.I started at 10mg once per day for two months and increased to 20 mg per day for the remainder of the time.I stayed on the medication for 6 months and decided to come off of it because of the side effects. The side effects included low sex drive and an increase in appetite (weight gain of about 13 pounds). I did consult my doctor about ending the medication. I had to gradually decrease the dose and then stop all together. The withdrawal from the medication was really bad, I actually felt worse then before I took the medication. The withdrawal lasted about 2 weeks for me. I believe Lexipro worked well for me but the side effects were too much. I did switch to Wellbutrin XL and it seemed to work great and i had no side effects that i could identify. Just a little info for nursing mothers alway use caution while nursing and using medication. I had one doctor tell me Wellbutrin XL was ok and another told me not to use it. I did choose to come off of it altogether just recently. Also, be aware of what your doctor prescribes for you. I had a pharmacy give me the wrong dosage of medication, I did not know it was wrong because i never seen the actual prescription, it was called in for me. Hope this helps someone out there. Just remember medications will effect everyone in differant ways, so what happens to one person may not happen to another:)

Nothing bothers me too much.My discontinuing this drug was a difficult decision. I generally lost most of my feelings and since I am creatively active, I felt it deprived me from creative thoughts and I lost my desire or urgency/enthusiasm to work on my projects.Doing nothing became OK.

I did stop using it for a few months and the withdrawals were not fun.. even when tapering. However the depression came back full force so I went back on the Lex. I did try the generic by Mylan for about a month and although it is effective it is not as strong for sure! I noticed the depression slowly creeping back. Also I've had bad diarhhea and nausea while on the generic. It costs about 10 bucks less than the name brand so in my opinion it's just not worth it. I might as well take Lexapro which helps more without the side effects.

I can say one thing for sure and that is do not combine with Abilify.  Those two drugs do not work well together for me.  I'm just glad to have some relief for my bipolar though....

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	3	3	2	Male	25-34	4/8/2012 4:32:08 AM	I've had two major depressive episodes and decided to take Lexapro for the last one. I have also tried Zoloft and Prozac in the past and generally do not take medication between episodes. Lexapro worked quickly and well--I felt improvements within a week and completely recovered after about two months. It's clearly effective. I do have some complaints, however: 1. First and foremost, Lexapro has a nasty withdrawal. I have never had a problem coming off SSRIs in the past but had significant trouble with this one. Tons of &quot;brain zaps,&quot; irritability, mood swings, etc. It's a real pain to taper off. Make sure to do it very carefully, slowly, and under supervision. If you taper off too quickly, you could end up depressed all over again. 2. Sexual side effects were the worst of any SSRI I've taken. In my case, much lower libido and difficulty reaching orgasm. Most SSRIs have these extremely unfortunate side effects, but this one gave me the most trouble. 3. Dosing is a bit awkward. 10mg didn't work quite well enough for me and 20mg worked but made me feel like a spaced-out zombie. I was too frustrated by the end to try 15, admittedly, but there isn't much room for finding an ideal dosage. 4. Extremely expensive if insurance doesn't cover it. It's set to go generic this year, although I don't have the latest news on this. Every medication works different for everybody, and this was only my experience. I would first and foremost say that if you feel depressed or anxious, make sure you see a therapist and make appropriate lifestyle changes. If you need an antidepressant, I would recommend Prozac--very cheap, works for me at the minimal dose (20mg) and no withdrawal. Maybe this will work for you, but I won't be taking it again.

Imagne 3 antidreressants! BTW these two physicians were in Specialized field's. My husband noticed how bizzar I was. So late on a Friday nite I discontinued the zoloft and paxil...YIKES. Hand ringing,shaking and twisting. Brain  popping, unable to sleep or sit,etc. I had palpations,irregulart beat and I itched all over..now those were just some of the out side reactions. I was high anxious,fearful and truly though I might die.  I left mesages at the doc's office. saying I will be Monday morning if I am still alive. The 1st MD was rightfully upset at me. I also read afterward that some patients &quot;never fully de-compensate(?).As in the hell you are going through by 'cold turkeying' the meds may never go away! Folks we have got be aware by reading and applying the little words on the label stickers. I am 63 yrs/young now. I recall about 25 years ago to you two teenage boys took some laced drugs and now they were locked up,monitored 24/7, they are unable to care for themselves and may do great harm to others and themselves.

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Gentleman415, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	3/24/2012 6:15:21 PM	I have General Anxiety Disorder and was prescribed Lexapro 10mg after I suffered a panic attack trading stocks during the market meltdown of 08. I have never been depressed in my life but was prescribed primarily an antidepressant.  SSRIs like Lexapro are like old phone cameras. Yes they can take pictures (treat anxiety), but their primary use is making phone calls (treating depression). Benzodiazepines on the other hand are your true high quality 5, 10, 15 megapixels dedicated digital cameras (only for anxiety).  For nearly 4 years I have taken Lexapro with little to no benefit.  I have gained 25lbs despite being healthy and active and my sex drive has diminished substantially.  About 3 weeks ago I decided to quit Lexapro and my doctor put me on .5mg of Clonazipam 2x per day.  WOW I have regained my sanity and nerves.  It really calms me down in just about 20-35 min and relaxes me for about 8hrs.  Oh yeah the sex is much better already too. I am still working on the extra weight. Bottom line is if your problem is anxiety, take the dedicated medication for it. Benzos will work in minutes, not like SSRIs that work in weeks if at all. This with therapy and counseling should do the trick. Hope this helps and good luck to all!

It made my head feel like whenever I had any emotion, it was being blocked. I tried to cry, laugh, get angry, etc., and my brain would just build a brick wall. I would rather learn to deal with it than having it blocked altogether, so Lexapro is a no-go for me. I actually became more depressed because of the 'zombie effect'.

I tried it for ~ 8 months. Although it relieved my symptoms for a while every day, it did not stay in my system long enough (has a short half-life my GP told me), even on 150% of &quot;recommended&quot; max dosage. I had no energy and got ill all the time (low immune system). So I went back to Zoloft and, within a week, it was like waking up from a zombie state!

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	mikec, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	45-54	3/5/2012 3:13:47 PM	Drug was prescribed for presumed acute depression to me by GP doctor and no information of warning to any side effects were discussed with me or spouse. I was told that this drug should just make me feel better in terms of missing energy. I was provided 10 boxes containing 10 (10)mg tablets by his office along with a prescription for 90 tablets.Timeline:1-	Visited Doctor on about 3rd week of February 2011 and began prescription of one 10mg tablet of Lexapro a day.2-	Consumed the initial office provided tablets by which a prescription was filled for 90 tablets on May 26 20113-	59 tablets were consumed and prescription stopped (cold turkey) on or around July 24 20114-	 Unbeknown to us  due to the absence of any discussion, pamphlet, ect. I was launched into state of mania shortly after discontinuing Lexapro medication.5-	On August 3rd I submitted my resignation to my employer after 21 year 6 months of service with a fictitious place of employment going forward as I was in a manic state.6-	During the remainder of time I acted in words only (email) in a very hostile manner to many layers of upper management essentially black balling myself.7-	Over the month of August I found myself reacting in a hostile manner with three individuals in public with no reason and only due to the manic state I incurred from Lexapro. None of these encounters turned physical.8-	I entered into a sales agreement for 150k to acquire a new boat. Grandiose spending.9-	After the surrender of my Company provided car on August 29th I proceeded to purchase a new BMW lease car (500.00 per month) without an income. Grandiose spending.10-	This manic state persisted until end of October where a very deep depression ensued.In trying to recollect this occurrence I have found the FDA issued materials in regard to consuming Lexapro. None of the items within this material were at any  point ever outlined of discussed with me. None of the screening questions for this medication were ever discus

For me, it also numbed my other emmotions (including happiness and sexual response). When I had children the joy was lessened by about 50%. I could have felt more happy for myself but I was too numb (10mg per day).  At the same time, the trade off can be worth it for some people (20mg per day and the anxiety was blessedly gone).  Effectiveness was quick (within one or two weeks), however has decreased over time but is still effective (probably 60-70% as effective at 7 years compared to first few months).  Lexapro also helps with the times I am angry or impatient toward my children and husband.

The only side effect from this drug is mild weight gain, of which I have learned to control by a healthy diet and control of sweets. Having developed MS in my mid 40's,this drug has helped me survive all the new situations and pain I have to live with now I am in my early 50's. No bad side effects to this drug, however did up dosage from 10mg to 20mg this past year, after 8 yrs on the med. Very rarely have panic attacts even with pain these days, wish it came cheaper. There is still not a generic to Lexapro!

I am at 40 mg a day, the highest possible dose, and I'm just here to warn you all, the effects WEAR OFF. I was put on this antidepressant at age 11, due to my issue of dwelling on every little thing I heard (i.e. scary story told at summer camp) and a tendency to repeat phrases in my head. However, I was only 11 years old, and I have been dependent on the drug since. I got off of it for a year and was put back on it after trying several other antidepressants. This drug has helped my personality and thoughts remain stable and it is a nightmare when I forget to take it because I become very irritable and angry with everything, two symptoms I did not suffer from before taking this med. It has been a blessing but I know I would've been better off never taking it in the first place. I have mixed feelings for it because now it is my sanity pill. I am writing this as a warning to worried mothers looking to &quot;help&quot; their children, do not resort to prescription drugs. It has set me up for a life of dependency and seems to have caused more problems than not, as I am taking it for more reasons than I started with. If your child is suffering from weird thoughts or depression take him to a therapist, as putting him/her on meds may help temporarily but will undoubtedly interfere with their quality of life and the ability to live a fulfilled one without depending on a drug/drugs. Please take my advice. The only benefits I notice from this drug are when I haven't taken it for awhile and then resume to take it, because it helps with the side effects of withdrawal, i.e. anger, mood swings, etc.

I started a new job right out of college and I became very stressed. My anger would sometime get out of control, so my Doc suggested Lexapro. It has helped me tremendously! Also, I had my baby boy in December 2010, I had to up my Lexapro mg fro 10 - 20. I had PPD after my baby and it helped me feel so much better and it brought back my feelings/emotions! If you've dealt with PPD (post pardum depression), you know what it does to you after having a baby. It's not a great feeling. Lexapro worked greated! I'm not sure if I will ever get off Lexapro. It keeps me in check, and I've never experienced any major side effects from it.

Took this drug for 2 months last year and had horrible results. It made me much more nervous and very angry but the doctor I was seeing insisted I stick it out. After suffering for 2 months I decided to change doctors. This was a wonderful decision. I was taken off the drug slowly and put on actual anxiety meds. What still bothers me about the whole situation is that the first doctor would not listen to me and her office was covered in lexapro swag. She was benefiting from my misery. My insurance didn't even cover it.

Although it supposedly takes time to build in your system, I felt that I was more relaxed almost immediately.  I had been experiencing fighT or flight nightmares that stopped once I started lexapro and it helped me cope with annoying, anxiety-provoking coworkers.   My insurance company suggested I try a different ssri that caused me to have an angry emotional outburst so I immediately switched back with doctor's paperwork required.  We have to pay more and my insurance makes me get 20 mg pills that I have to cut in half, but all this and it is so worth it!  It's so nice being able to sleep well and have less anxiety and irritability.
Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	25-34	2/13/2012 11:50:01 PM	I took Lexapro for my anxiety disorder Feb. 2008-July 2010. The only noticable side effect was fatigue which was mitigated by taking it after dinner. Otherwise the anxiety became manageable.Over time I noticed that my attention suffered, it became harder to feel emotions, and my sex drive was definitely lowered. All of this was a willing tradeoff to anxiety.Keep in mind, this drug does not cure anxiety. Like it or not, it's something we will always live with. I used my time on Lexapro to learn coping mechanisms and better stress management. I decided myself to stop taking Lexapro summer 2010. If a doctor told you this medication is not habit forming (like mine did) then they weren't entirely honest. If I tried to quit cold-turkey I had moderate withdrawal symptoms. I had to gradually lower the dosage over two months, but even then I would have mild dizzy spells and developed a strange nervous tick for a month. After the withdrawal period I was fine. I then moved 1000 miles, started graduate school, and entered into one of the most stressful years of my life. The coping mechanisms work like a charm and I haven't had major anxiety issues since. However, the attention problems remain, though it's another thing I just learned to live with.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	 (Patient) 	1	1	1			2/13/2012 11:46:38 PM	The manufacturers who market this drug have gotten in trouble for unethical marketing practices. This is the most potent of the SSRIs inhibiting serotonin re-uptake far more than other SSRIs. This causes a higher incidence of serotonin syndrome with this drug. It also causes increased side effects like aggression, apathy, and sexual dysfunction. Overall this drug is not healthy. Celexa is a far better alternative to Lexapro, which is far too potent.

I became very depressed.  I didn't feel depressed but, after 3 visits to the doctor I finally admitted that I was.  He put me on Lexapro and this medication has helped me greatly.  It made all the difference in my world.  I have been on Lexapro for several years now and on my doctor's suggestion, I have tried cutting back by using this medication every other day, but I found that cutting back does not work for me. I know I am willing to try cutting back again.  As I said earlier, this medication made all the difference to me.

My doctor increased the dosage; it's been a week now, and the side effects are descreasing. I feel better about life; I'm laughing again and friends are noticing the difference in me. My advice for those experiencing side effects is to give the drug a chance. I hate what I call the &quot;psychotropic nightmare&quot; of changing anti-depressants, but it's unavoidable when you have acute, incurable depression. When it's time to change meds you just have to bear with it and give the med a chance to take effect completely, make any changes as needed, and stick with it. Good luck to you all. Depression is an ugly and frustrating disease to work with, but persevere and you will win. A good psychologist is a good idea as well. When you find a good one - talk! Get it out, get over it and go on with living your life as you never have before!

Got me through the extensive  menopausal symptoms.  Now, post menopause 2 years and trying to wean off.  Trouble falling asleep, light headed, tired but toughing it out.  Weaning very slowly.  20 mg to 15 mg over 2 1/2 months. Now 10 mg and will remain until comfortable and then 5 mg.Wish the lightheadedness would cease, but remember that was symptom when first decreased to 15 from 20 mg. Secret is to have patience.

This would include having hot flashes, blushing.. and headaches. The first two weeks of taking lexapro I was nauseated, dizzy, couldnt sleep and no appetite. I was constantly yawning.. it does something to that area of your brain.. I wasnt tired.. but still couldnt stop yawning all the time. The medication worked well for turning off the voices and the over analyzing I was doing. I decided to go off the med in December deciding it wasnt worth being on when I go to have a baby. I had a horrible experience: really nauseas, headaches.. really bad anxiety.. irritable. . then I ended up having a cronic migraine and went to the ER not beging able to talk or see. SCARY! If you plan on going off lexapro before any big event in your life.. i.e pregnancy.. give yourself a lot of time to wean off.. its AWFUL! I was at my wits end with the way I was feeling.. and contimplated going back on just to make it stop.. Im so glad I'm not off the drug and feeling back to normal.. anxiety free!  If you plan on taking this medication for a long period of time thats fine...but for the short-term.. think twice.. I would suggest seeking therapy instead!

It wasn't bothersome just a feeling of the jitters. The sexual side effects are less pronounced then when I was on celexa so that is great! Also has worked for my anxiety level-my heart palpatations have stopped since starting this :D!!! I wish i didn't have to resort to an antidepressant but I can't deny how it has improved my feeling of self worth. And my hubby isn't getting snapped at every other time he turns around either.

The medication has helped me tremendously but it has some undesirable side effects. I have had weight gain and a low sex drive since taking it (starting after month 2). I began the medication for post-postpartum depression. I will be consulting my doctor about a change in medication due to the side effects.

I felt that I was able to let go of the negative voice in my head that was making me have feelings of unnecessary guilt, worry and sadness.  I smile more and am able to relax and not feel so irritable all the time.  I have had Hashimoto's thyroiditis for 5 years and have noticed that having this hypothyroid condition has made my moods more unstable.  I am so happy that I started Lexapro.  I haven't gained any weight or had any side effects on this medicine (besides nausea and feeling of fullness in ears in the first week. My whole outlook on life is positive now and I plan on staying on this medicine for at least a year.

It did work for treating my depression. I often wonder if I didn't go to the doctor when I did if I would even be alive today.  Geez, looking back it was that bad. It took me 2 attempts to quit taking the lexapro both within a 6 month period. The withdrawals were unpleasant. Today- 4-5 months later, my depression has left me, I sorted out my personal problems in my head and feel stable. Unfortunately, almost tooo stable minded, as if nothing even phases me anymore. Somewhat emotionless  lately. Also, I am experiencing sexual issues as well. Difficulty maintaining ejaculating during sex and difficulty sharing emotions with partners. This was one of the side effects that brought me to quit taking Lexapro, yet I still am experiencing the same side effects. Without a doubt it makes my relationships strange. Conclusion, I do believe lexapro treated my depression, but now I have side effects that are good reason to be depressed yet I feel nothing. Ha...how bout that!?

I'm not as angry when I take them. And it's been about 6 yrs or so now. But going threw withdrawls while you're pregnate has been a nightmare. I'm 35 and wasn't planning on getting pregnate. The hormone impalance and withdrawl from lexapro. OMG!! Working full time and having severe rushes from the lexapro withdrawl. I still get rushes and it's been two weeks since I took my last dose. After learning the hard way DO NOT TRY TO QUIT COLD TURKEY!!!!! And for me the main side effect was diariaha.

I felt like I had complete control of my emotions, and a far more extensive range than other antidepressants had allowed me, e.g. Zoloft and Paxil. However, I am five foot three and always weighed under one hundred and five pounds, and have been very active and proud of my toned stature. In the first year I started lexapro, went from less than one hundred and ten pounds to just under one hundred and sixty. Not only was the sudden, SIXTY POUND, weight gain  enormous (despite my seven day a week intensive martial arts exercise and healthy eating) a shock), but it  happened over six months, which caused serious pressure on my muscles, skin, and general energy level. I was an extremely fit, athletic person who suddenly lost all physical confidence despite feeling emotionally great. I switched to Wellbutrin XL three months ago and have already lost over thirty pounds without any exercise, so I am in no doubt that this horrible medicine ruined my confidence, relationship, and sex life. Lexapro made exercise and diet useless, and the mere switch, even eating whatever I wanted and exercising a minimal level, led to an extreme change.

I dont cry about things I can't control and I am happier. Before Lexapro, I used to cry everyday, lost my job over it. Lexapro has really allowed me to react differently to stressful situations.

Not long after taking it, my depression got worse. I turned to being suicidal. It also changed my sex drive to non existent. I was in my early 20's and I knew this wasn't normal. After the last and final time of attempting suicide, I finally talked to my doctor about it and she quickly took me off the lexapro. Since then, I have done better. I have personally decided to deal with my disorders without medication, which has been rough but lexapro has scared me into this decision. My 13 year old suffers from manic depression and ADHD. They are also considering that he may be bipolar. His doctor is switching him from zoloft and vyvance to lexapro and adderall. I am now afraid that this medicine will have the same affect on my child as it did me. The fact that he already has suicidal thoughts prier to lexapro make it worse. If any of you have a child like mine, I'd really love your feedback on these medications. my email is misty.bertrand@gmail.com

After a month I not only saw no results but I experienced more symptoms.  It definitely made me dizzy and my appetite changed from eating to much to not eating enough.  I started having panic attacks and drastic mood swings.  This was definitely not the meds for me.  I am being weaned off of it and hopefully the next kind will work.

After stoping the lithium, due to it causing kidney insufficiency, I stopped everything for a few weeks.  Upon starting the lexapro again, after only one week I felt wonderful.  Optimistic, energetic, sleeping well,it is such a strange combination of good feelings for me because I've been bipolar with anxiety disorder and OCD for most of my 55 years of my life.  I pray this isn't just a coincidence, that it is a true and accurate depiction of what my life can be like now.  My two adult sons deserve a better  mother than I have been for all of their lives.  My husband deserves a sane wife and partner that he doesn't have to tiptoe around on egg shells wondering what is going to &quot;set me off&quot; the next time.  Will holidays with relatives turn into nightmares from bipolar world.  I sincerely hope and pray that the kidney disease that the lithium and hypertension caused will not change for the worse to keep me from being unable to take my lexapro.  It seems like finally, at 55 years of age I have a chance to actually be happy, and my wonderful family be able to enjoy being around. Me now, instead of waiting and wondering what I'm going to do next.

It helps me think and makes it easier to breathe. The only thing I don't like about it... And I guess it's really about taking pills in general the amount and size.... But generally I really like lexapro.

I found that the Lexapro helped me to cope, HOWEVER, the Lexapro SIGNIFICANTLY increased my appetite.  (Note:  I did not have a problem with loss of appetite before taking Lexapro. I was at a healthy weight.)  I gained 25 lbs. in about 6 months which increased my pre-diabetic symptoms----The dry mouth was not a pleasant side effect....used Biotene products, small amount of relief.  Then, some months after the weight gain, I developed high blood pressure.  I tried coming off the Lexapro after taking it for 2 plus years per Dr.'s recommendations.  Did not do well. Felt like I was going to 'jump out of my skin'.  I very gradually came off the drug over a 3 month period which worked fairly well, but it was a pain.  The constipation was a very unpleasant side effect which led to hemorhoids (which I never had in my 50 plus years, not even pregnancy!) in spite of increasing fiber.  Almost NO libido, which my husband did not understand and had no empathy, but that was more his self-centered character. It definately had a negative impact on reconciling our marriage.  So, I should have tried another medication(s)...I had so much chaos at the time, I did was overwhelmed &amp;/or did not care.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	hmf, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	0-2	11/9/2011 2:49:10 PM	I began going to the church in my community when I was 3 years old. I attended there for 17 years. For 5 years I taught at VBS and after graduating high school I began teaching Sunday school, Wednesday nite classes, and I directed the Christmas play. I became so passionate about my church and I loved the children I taught. They were my best friend. Them and God became my world. In September 2010, a huge fight broke out between members of the church and I decided it was in my best interest to resign from my positions. I lost my church family, a lot of my family, and my boyfriend at the time(the &quot;one&quot;). I became completely depressed. I turned to food to help me feel better and I became so angry and bitter about everything. I didn't feel like going to school and ended up dropping out of all my classes Spring and Summer of 2011. I gained over 60 pounds. When I went to the doctor, my orginal request was only to check my thyroid because I no longer had any energy at all. My doctor begin to break the surface on my past and prescribed me lexapro(10mg). I am no longer depressed. I am so happy and the little things that have always bugged me, upset me, no longer does. I felt like I could move on from the things that happened. Since I have been on lexapro, I have lost 6lbs and began attending another church. I am now in the process of moving my membership there. I really feel God has allowed me this lexapro to pick me back up. I really feel it's saved my life!

I was on 25mg Paxil Cr for a great 10 years then all of a sudden it stopped working for me.  Instead of uping my dose of Paxil a doctor put me on Cipralex.  Started at 10mg, felt good for a week then anxiety hit me, went up to 15mg and I felt terribly sick, after another week my GP put me on 20mg,  I lasted 3 weeks at the 20mg and I just couldn't take it no more.  I was so sick.  I didn't eat for weeks, stomach upset, nausea,headaches, jitters, crying fits, more anxiety.  I was scared to be alone.  It was effecting my home life drastically. I ended up in emergency because of extreme dizzyness and throwing up.  The emerg doc said go back down to 10mg.  He thought it was to strong.  I got a couple shots in the arse.  One for nausea and other for stomach upset.  I was advised to see my regular GP.  The next day I seen my GP (Crying the whole time)  He basically said he didn't know what to do with me.  He put me back on a low dose of Paxil (12.5) and put a requisition in for me to see a psyciatrist (which will take 2 months to be able to see one)  So now I am dosing myself out with Clonozapam (1mg twice a day)..not driving...not working.  Keeping my child home from school to look after me (not fair!) and my husband gets home as soon as he can after work at each  night. I have never felt this bad/depressed and down right scared like this before.  Hoping the paxil cr will kick in quick so my family can stop worrying about me.  Never will I take Cipralex again!

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Harness your Mind, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	10/28/2011 6:32:54 PM	I have chronic pain that I was first prescribed antidepressants for 1st was effexor I would not recommend too strong and not mentally alert.  2nd was Celexa and I did fine on it with no bad side effects just seemed to not do much for extra pain releif.  Then went to Lexapro 10mg then up to 20 mgs and have done much better on this. After years of Chronic pain I have now developed some depression and I suppose it does have some effect in controlling it but I still get times of deep depression, only beacause of the state of my life and limitations put on me not being able to life like a normal person and do all the activities I used to do and have interest in.  But you have to pull your mind together and thank God that you are not in worse shape like some others have to suffer through or live and Rubuke those thoughts of feeling sorry for yourself or cheated out of life!  Your still living right?  So live life to the fullest way that YOU can is what I have learned.  Ultimately you are in control of your mind, medication can help but it is not a cure at least for me.  But I am not suffering any mental illness like really brain chemistry imbalance where you have a brain impairment.  So I'm in the middle of the road wish I felt happier but don't know if Lexapro will do that for me.

Last summer I fell asleep while driving, nearly killing us both. I gained 45 lbs and am on a constant diet but can't get rid of weight. Forgetful and unmotivated. Now I seem to be losing my hearing. Weaning off it today.

It was very effective and I used it for about four years.  During that four years, I gained 110 pounds and did not even care--in fact, I cared about nothi8ng at all, or even doing anything at all.  Libdo went to absolutely zero.  Zombiefied.  Stopped taking the drug and developed severe anxiety attacks requiring another medication.  Additional negative side effects were slow but continual increasing nerve pain in feet and along the side of left leg.  Pain also began in right leg after experienceing it in left for several months. These pains totally disappeared in about two weeks after stopping Lexapro.  Evaluation is the drug does counteract depression but it can have severe side effects.  Be very careful and watch for adverse effects.  I would NOT recommend it to anyone.
Lexapro+Oral	Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	10/26/2011 10:15:23 PM	I am 40 year old fit male.  I've been on 10mg of Lexapro for 2 years for anxiety due to loss of a very high income Wall Street job.  It took the edge off and allowed me to make very rational career, financial, and family decisions without unnecessary anxiety.  I have never been depressed.   Over two years, the side effects were 20-30 lbs of increased weight, and annoying decreased libido. Last week I've decided to transition to Wellbutrin XL and stop taking Lexapro.  The half-life of Lexapro is 27 hours, so I decided to taper Lexapro with the following schedule: Day0 10mg, Day1 5mg, Day2 5mg, Day3 2.5 mg, Day4 2.5mg, Day5 0mg, Day6 0mg.  Today is the end of Day6.  Ive only had two withdrawal symptoms that are minor: slight dizziness and elevated tinnitus.  Tomorrow I will begin Wellbutrin XL 100mg.  I am hopeful that Wellbutrin will have the same calming effects  and completely reverse the weight gain and decreased libido.

I am currently taking 20 mg, even though that seems a lot but 10 mg didn't work basically at all. It works for me, but because of my age, it's best for teenagers to be unmedicated  in my opinion because of the extreme possible side effects it can have just taking it not only initially but if you forget to take it. Since Lexapro, I don't cry as much over small things, but big issues are still no use. I haven't had as many nightmares, but I did notice (since in the past i've missed taking it a few nights) I would get terrible nightmares, and feel so jittery  the next day that I almost had to leave school, since even though I have more of depression. Anxiety hyped me up to  an uncontrollable level. Be careful, guys. I not completely happy with Lexapro, but it does help a little more than halway so my opinion is that it is &quot;good&quot; but indeed no miracle drug.

For me, it is absolutely wonderful.  I don't suffer from depression or anything so I can't speak to its antidepressant effects, but for my anxiety, this has been sent from Heaven.  I take 20 mgs a day.  I stay active and eat well and was blessed with my daddy's metabolism so I never experienced any weight gain or any other side effects with Lexapro.  It's simply been smooth sailing.  This drug is a good match for me :-)

Lexapro+Oral	Depression		1	1	1			9/21/2011 1:22:00 PM	This drug triggered ocd. I was afraid that I was going to hurt myself or someone else. Prior to taking this medication I had no thoughts whatsoever along those lines. After taking just a few days worth of pills I spiraled into pure ocd and intrusive thoughts. I have obviously since stopped taking it and gotten help for OCD, but the OCD that this medication triggered has not gone away. I continue to suffer everyday because of my experience with this medication.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression		1	2	1			9/21/2011 1:16:35 PM	Lexapro caused personality changes, aggression and changes in levels of energy. It also caused health problems such as weight gain and caused an increased craving for alcohol. Overall it was a terrible experience for not only the person taking it but for family members who witnessed and had to endure the negative changes.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I would get anxiety just from trying a new medication.  Which is why, since 200,7 I have been taking Ativan to keep my panic at bay. I was not happy with this at all because of it's addictive properties and it only worked for a period of time. I needed something that took the edge of the anxiety. I felt the Lexapro (10mg) work after about 7 days. I had an upset stomach for maybe the first 3 days. It has now been  1 1/2 months since I started Lexapro and I went from taking 3 mg of Ativan to .5 mg! In another few weeks I am going to STOP taking it all together! The only lingering side effect is a small amount of weight gain, maybe 5 lbs. It is totally worth it though to feel &quot;normal&quot;. I can go a whole day with out feeling anxious! It really is a tremendous drug and can change your life if you give it the chance!

Music, dancing and being around people. When I reached my late 30's the joy of all that started to fade. Of course responsibilities and stress crept up  and the change of Life came early. Loss of a parent due to Cancer etc. By the time I reached 48 it was full blown depression. The doctor was treating me for Menopause with Lexapro 10ml once a day and as soon as that week, symptons faded and my depression started to take a back seat to life. I have been on the Lexapro for 3.5 yrs and can say I feel Happy again. Music is sweet to my ears and life means living again.

If you taper off over 10 months time, you will experience &quot;head zaps&quot;, an electrical impulse in your brain that feels like zapped with a taser. I have tapered down to 1/8 of a 10mg and still have problems. I have heard Paxil does the same problems. DON&quot;T use this drug...the side affects do not justify the gains !!! Ron in AZ

BUT, be aware that you can and WILL eventually gain weight! I gained so much weight I had to be taken off of it. It did improve my mood, I was happy and felt like skipping through a field of flowers. But, it's hard to do that when your heavy. Just saying.

I have been diagnosed with Bipolar DO.  I feel like myself when I take this med.  My only complaint is that I tried to ween myself off a few times and always got withdrawal symptoms.  Once the withdrawal symptoms faded (less than 5 days) I realized I still needed the med for depressive episodes (I'm always hopeful).  This is definitly the best anti-depressant for me.

I have been on lexapro twice now (for a few months each time) and love it.I take 10 mg every morning. Initial symptoms (increased anxiety, irritability, sleepiness and sweating) have disappeared after a week. I can feel my anxiety subsiding after 5 days, and I feel &quot;normal&quot; after two weeks of being on the medication. The first time I took this was after the birth of my daughter (I was breastfeeding, and the doctor determined it was safe). I weaned off after four months (from 10 to 5 to 2.5) and had no issues. I am taking it again because of some stress in my life that triggered panic attacks.The initial side effects are difficult to go through, and sometimes it feels like it's not working (or you want to give up) but I encourage you to stick it out. Once it starts to work, you will be so glad you did. I really love lexapro. It's given me my life back.

I take 10mg in the morning and another 10mg at night. I have not had any side effects (wight gain, insomnia, etc) It took about 3 wks to kick in, but once it did, I have never looked back. If your doctor reccomends this drug to you, plz give it a chance.

Before Leapro, I was agitated, angry, and nervous OR very low. 5 weeks after 20 mg of Leapro, I think I know what &quot;normal&quot; feels like. I miss my highly productive &quot;ups&quot; but I don't miss the axiety that often accompanied it. My &quot;lows&quot; are much milder. THis is a miracle drug!

It has helped with all of the symptoms of depression, but has been most effective for irritability and 'edguness' that I experience when depressed.  I have also not expereinced any changes in sexual desire as I had on other SSRIs.

I yelled and screamed a lot about little things and couldn't explain why.  My doctor put me on 10mg of Lexapro a little over a year ago and it is the best thing that ever happened to me.  My family says I am like a different person.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	5	Male	55-64	8/3/2011 4:54:24 AM	Went from serious depression with very severe anxiety syndrome to normal virtually overnight on 0.5 gm dose.  Now after one year reduced to 0.33 gm dose. This may be more placebo effect than pharmaceutical bit, hey, I don't care. This is a magic drug!  I keep using it as I am too concerned at the thought of going back to the suicidal state I was in...and 0.33 gm which is hard to measure, a mere bite of a tablet each day is a small price to pay for what great benefits I have achieved. A true wonder drug!

It gave me the most anxiety I have ever had in my life. It made me violently ill for a few days. I couldn't get out of bed and I was vomiting and felt like I was going insane. It was the scariest experience I've ever had in my life. I guess it just doesn't work for some... very disappointed.

Lack of sleep caused performance anxieties leading to depression. Pediatrician prescribed Lexapro. Coaches reported he seemed more relaxed but at home he seemed to no longer care about anything, or anyone. Personality change, lost all empathy,became mean, agressive, and violent. Side effects included extreme fatigue, which made anxiety and depression worse, weight gain, agitation, dizziness, light-headed, tingling. Couldn't get up for school, confrontational with teachers, GPA drop from 3.989 to 2.929. Weaned off over 1 month, immediate improvement but personality changes still remain to some degree. Devastating effects on entire family and almost destroyed our business at same time. Drs should not prescribe to youth and should be more aware of physical and mental side-affects and provide more warnings. We force our kids to keep taking when they complain because Dr says to. I'm thankful we didn't end up with violent or suicidal actions. I'd rather deal with the original problems vs just covering them up and dealing with the even worse side-affects.

Generic Prozac DID NOT WORK and the doctor put me on Lexapro.  That was 10 years ago and 20 mg. a day works fine for me.  I am normal with typical highs and lows based on the circumstances in my life, but no living under a black cloud under all circumstances as I have known.  I am normal with Lexapro.

With that said, this medicine was to treat me for depression. But instead it made me have very vivid terrible dreams. It also made me have really messed up thoughts, it was like something had taken over my ability to think and had weird outlandish thoughts, creepy and psychotic as well. Dealing with depression was better than what this drug did to me. Needless to say I got off of it and am now taking generic Zoloft. Way better. I have had no side effects with gen. Zoloft. I know each drug effects different people differently..but wanted to post what I went through. Scary Stuff..hope no one ever goes through what I did on that drug. If I'd have stayed on it no doubt I could have had some major psychotic issues.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	4	4	Male	19-24	7/7/2011 1:23:22 PM	I took lexapro for 6 years and just switched medicine this week. It takes a few weeks to kick in but once you get your dosage figured out it really does help. It does not completely take away all of your symptoms but it comes pretty close to getting rid of them. I did not experience side affects except for when I did not take the medicine for a few days. I would get extremely nauseous and sometimes it resulted in vomiting. My doctor decided to change my medicine because after 6 years it seems that the medicine is no longer working which is to be expected after being on it for so long.

I no longer have panic attacks nor have I suffered any side effects to date.

It made me feel relaxed, just mellow with no other side effects.  More recent, I was given this again by another healthcare provider to manage the strees and anxiety that I was experiencing which may be contributer to my recent high blood pressure.  I took it for three days at first.  It was horrendous.  I couldn't sleep and awful dreams as well as irritable.  I left them alone for two months.  I believe that the formula has been changed drastically.  It is just different.  Recently, I've felt like I needed something, so started back taking them again, this time everyday. I makes me feel better.  Heck I'm basically loopy for the first couple of hours after I take it and off and on for the rest of the night.  I wouldn't advise taking this in the daytime.  I'd wait for bedtime or when you knew you weren't going out anywhere.  It will make you dizzy, loopy and sleepy.    It helps me, but just be cautious as with any drug.

Was it effective? Yes, I had no depression. Was it easy to use? Yes, just a pill a day. Was I satisfied. No - it was SO effective, that I forgot everything - I had to write down where I was going when I got in my car, because I forgot once I sat down. It was very strong. I had to come off of it after a month.

At first, I felt some improvement with my moods but the longer I took it, my depression symptoms returned-sometimes worse than when I first started it.  The sexual side affects were horrible, the night sweats were terrible, and the weight gain was unbelievable.  Today, I will start weening myself off of Lexapro and start taking Welbutrin.

Initial sexual side effects but subsided after a few weeks.4. VERY VIVID and LONG dreams (they are actually quite enjoyable)5.

It has a bad taste but it helps to get better so I guess it is worth it. I took it for two or three months when I noticed that I am becoming very dumb as a consequence of taking it. So I started taking half pill instead of a full pill for a while, and then started taking it per necessity. Now I have a box of Lexapro in my nightstand and I don't use them anymore but it's good to know that they're there.

It has definitely helped with my depression, anxiety, and mood swings. It has killed my sex drive though, which is a major bummer to me. However, I used to fantasize about death and dying young but now I feel okay with living to be old(er). I am only 20. I have also experienced weight gain - about 10-15lbs. Overall the benefits outweigh the side effects of this med. Lexapro has helped me greatly.

My quality of life improved one billion percent. I no longer dwell on anything, no anxiety, I am now very patient, calm, even tempered, happy, happy, happy, and my confidence is stronger than ever. FYI - I made the mistake of buying a generic from oversees and relapsed...oh my God that horrible, horrible nightmare returned until I reestablished on the brand Lexapro. I shed a tear for myself and others who know how little help we receive from our family and friends at our most critical time of need. my love is with all of you. OCD and anxiety...I rather have someone break both my arms rather than have another OCD relapse. Lexapro allows me keep on living - - a fully passionate, compassionate, and happy life!!!

After two days I had trouble breathing. I was told this would go away but it got worse. I was taken off the drug and still have breathing problems. My doctor says it effects the hypothalamus and it may take some time for my brain to reprogram. It's been very scary and I have found out that all these drugs can cause breathing problems.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	blabber 151, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/13/2011 9:45:04 PM	26 year old female diagnosed with GAD. After 2 years of talk therapy and no improvement in my constant high anxiety, I agreed to see a psychiatrist. I thought he'd give me something like Xanax. He recommended Lexapro and I was initially extremely reluctant to get on a long-term drug. I finally agreed and am SO glad that I did. After only about 2 weeks, I already began to feel so much better. It's as if the background noise in my brain stopped and I could think clearly again. I took it for 9 months and was feeling so much better I decided to stop (without consulting my doc). Bad choice. Within 5 months I was an anxious, irritable mess again and went back on. Also upped my dosage from 20 mg to 30 mg. I've been back on for 4 months and am again feeling amazing, able to cope with daily life, keep things in perspective and I feel happy! I would highly recommend Lexapro to anyone who is suffering with anxiety that interferes with your daily life.

The only thing that I have bad to say is the tiredness that I feel all the time, which is impacting my ability to work. Sex drive could be affected however it was already affected before I started the medication anyways. Talk to your physician, not all medications are going to work for all people. Period.

Lexapro+Oral	Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	exParaeducator, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	55-64	6/10/2011 4:48:35 AM	I was originally prescribed Lexapro during cancer treatment while working in a warzone called middle school. I was told it would help with symptoms of sudden menopause brought on by my cancer treatment. It didnt. To my detriment, it enabled me to remain in a dangerous work environment for longer than I could have withstood it otherwise. I experienced many of the main complaints that others report including massive weight gain, total loss of libido, suicidal ideation, screaming nightmares, hypervigilance, and rages.  I also experienced severe withdrawal on two occasions. Once I could not get my medication on time through the mail order program I was forced to use. And once I left town without my medication. I became ill within hours of missing a dose and for three days was too ill to get myself back home. My symptoms included nausea, vomiting, the shakes, cold sweats, loss of coordination, and diminished cognition. I was given Lexapro in combination with other drugs, first one and then another, but Lexapro was the main one for an extended period. At one point, I was given dosing instructions for extended release capsules on a prescription of short acting tablets of Effexor. I had severe problems while on these drugs, ending up in the ER twice with symptoms of cardiomyopathy brought on by severe anxiety. Its a wonder I lived through it. Im not sure I will ever fully recover from it. My career ended as a result as did my sex life and my enjoyment of many activities I used to love. I am living a diminished life due to depression and anxiety and a new doctor wants me to try Lexapro again. I have decided not to risk revisiting that awful experience. For me, depression and anxiety are preferable to being driven stark raving mad due to having my brain chemistry altered, perhaps irreversibly, on drugs the effects of which are poorly understood at best and have the potential to cause irreversible harm at worst.

I went from 10mg to 20mg a day on Lexapro with no good effects. told him i was getting very close to a breakdown and he only increased the dosage. i do not have insurance so i cannot switch doctors.

Although I do have diminished sex drive it is a small price to pay for being able to function normal again.  I have an amazing family that supports me and that has made a difference also.  I would take lexapro again.

After Prozac, Effexor, and the worst of them all - Zoloft, I hope this will be the one. I had mild euphoria on the first week on it. Psychiatrist said people have reported that. He said it is most likely due to extremely low serotonin levels. No other side effects so far.

Prescribed for depression and PTSD.  It does help.  I am meeting with my doctor as I have developed dizziness, confusion, and both are getting worse.  Easy to use.  How did it affect my sex drive?  What sex drive?  It is gone and has been since I started taking Lexapro.  If sex is important to you, talk to your doctor about another medication.

Insomnia is so severe, I am nonfunctional day and night I am seeing a neurologist at the UCSF MS Clinic and the add on antiinsomnia medicine doesn't work...so it's been 5 weeks of NONfunctional sleep cycles. Activating meds are not tolerated well. Insurance requires a sleep med trial I'd tried over 10 years ago, this is prolonging the insomnia. See a nurse practictioner this AM instead of the neuro--this is negligent patient care at UCSF. Exhausted and nonfunctioning in California.

After a while the dose was doubled to 40 mg a day becuase i was no longer getting the same effect. After about 8 months of taking 40 mg a day, my body has developed a strong dependence for it. i can deffinately feel if i miss a dose, it drives me nuts. This is the highest dose my doctor wants to put me on as im a relatively small teenaye girl.  the drug effect has worn off and i find myself taking extra pills becuase the withdrawl symptoms are terrible. My doctor has chosen to take me off lexapro becuase of the fear of possible addiction.

Afterwards the medication worked very well for me. I started out at 10mg and am now taking 20mg. I went from having an anxiety attack every other day to about once a month. A few side effects, is insomnia, I had issues with sleeping before, but now its next to impossible to get a full nights sleep. I also have a decrease in my sex drive. All together I would much rather have those issues than have attacks! My depression is also well managed, Lexapro is really giving me a helping hand in getting back to a &quot;normal&quot; life.

I've had good luck with prozac in the past. After months of severe anxiety (years without meds), I finally went to the doctor. I told him I wanted prozac though he recommended lexapro. I started with 10mg daily, in the evening. My anxiety level was higher than ever. 10 days later I went to 20mg with no positive results. After a month with lexapro, I have now switched to prozac. As soon as I weened myself off of lexapro (no prozac), my anxiety went away completely. I am also going through counseling, to rid myself of the anxiety for good. These drugs are like putting a band-aid on a gaping wound. Therapy is the best way to learn to deal with things, hands down. The biggest reason I wanted to go with prozac is the price and how it worked for me in the past. A 30 day supply of lexapro is $35, while a 90 day supply of prozac is $10. Still, lexapro did nothing positive for me at all, even though my dosage was too low for anxiety. I also have a supply of xanax (.5mg)and use it sparingly. Get counseling!!!

Your healthcare professional chose Lexapro for a reason. There is no available generic substitute for Lexapro.

Only problem I ever had was dull headache for first couple week. Small price for my sanity.

It has also helped with the &quot;short fuse&quot; I had with anything that may set me off. My kids noticed right away that mom wasn't so quick to yell alot. My husband said that I am the person he married years ago.  Happier and easier going.  I did gain some weight, but watch my diet and exercise to keep it in check.  I do know that once I ran out and the withdrawl was bad.  Sweats, severe dizziness even when driving and instant irritability.  I can miss a day and be okay though. The first 2 weeks were tough with insomnia, but after that sleeping is much more restful with less vivid dreams.  I can think clearly and organize much better, since I multi-task at everything I do.  Reccomended to my friend and she stopped because of the weight gain and now uses herbal remedies. For me the benefits outweigh the negatives.

I am currently upset about my weight and trying to get off these pills slowly or else i get these horrible dizzy spells and my body feels horrible. I would not recommend these to anyone unless your wanting to gain weight or at least dont mind to. :/

At first, I thought it was working only because it didn't give me the nasty physical side effects that Effexor did (severe nausea, debilitating diziness).   I did experience the typical nightsweats and lower sex drive (it severely hurt my relationship at the time), but the most alarming side effect was that I was throwing serious tantrums and fits.  This was absolutley not characteristic of me and made others around me nervous, so after almost a year I discontinued the meds.

I was very resistant to the idea of meds, but I felt like I was dragging myself through quicksand every day. I was apathetic about life, did not want any physical touch from anyone, and I was tired all the time. I started with a 20 mg dose, but I felt AWFUL the first few days. Upon the advice of my dr. and pharmacist, I tried halving it. I found the 10 mg. dose effective with limited side effects. I did have stomach pain for the first few days. It has worked for me- it keeps me on a relatively even keel, but I don't feel like a zombie or sleepy.

I started having panic attacks at a very young age...perhaps 13. I didn't get on medication until I was 38.  It was hell having to deal with the panic attacks.  Now I can lead a normal productive life.  I made the mistake of weanning myself off the medication because I felt so good... BIG BIG MISTAKE!!! I started experiencing anxiety again!!! I'm back on LEXAPRO and will never get off again.

It is too much for my budget.  I take it every 2-3 days unless I feel I need it sooner.  It seems to calm my Panic Disorder/Anxiety along with taking a .5 dose of Xanax but I cannot take them together as they are too sedating.  The two together work fairly well for me.

These changes in behavior has been caused by menapause along with the decrease in the effectivness of herbal remedies.  Within a weeks time I realized I did not have any crying spells.  There were side effects, and after 6 weeks there still are some, but they totally outway how I was feeling before.  I've read a lot of comments here and realize that each persons makeup is different.  For me, Lexapro seems to work.
Lexapro+Oral	Major Depressive Disorder	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	4/17/2011 10:20:52 PM	I would never have believed it but Lexapro has changed my life. I no longer want to beat up every male I come in contact with; military especially. I do want revenge, however. Coming from the DoD (civilian) career field, I find that psychological warfare is very effective. Military males can't &quot;handle the truth&quot; so pushing their buttons is a very effective psychological ploy. Your &quot;hero's&quot; are willing to volunteer for peacekeeping missions and other non-lethal ops. NATO, of course.

I tried and after a few months it did help with lots of syptoms (depression, anxiety, hot flashes, etc.). I decided I  needed to get off and start feeling life again. The drug just masks a lot of problems. Getting off after almost 7 years was HELL! I have been sick with flu-like symptoms for 9 weeks. I have to force myself to eat a little several times a day. The nausea has subsided but the anxiety, sweats, diareah, lightheadedness, and depression and wanting to end it all has not gone away. Thank God for my family and His help as I continue to reach full mental and physical health. I would never recommend this to anyone! It is just too hard to get off of as I am sure the company making it knows. It is also very expensive so they want us to be addicted to it. I am trying to gain knowledge of what foods and nutrients I need to overcome this. Oh, and I did gain about 40 pounds over the 7 years. Over 20 of it has gone in two months, but I feel like a starved animal that can't eat. I wonder if this is what anorexia feels like?

But the results were immediate.  I have been taking it a few years now, and I have taken dosages from 10mg to 40mg.  I am back down to 20mg a day and holding.  I have gained weight while taking it.  I have come off lexapro twice for about a month each time only to recognize that life is better with it.  My doctor switched me to prozac in the beginning, but I quickly knew that wasn't a good fit, and he put me back on lexapro with a dose increase.  Life has been great after that.  To those who say that lexapro caused personality changes, I would say keep trying other meds.  I had that reaction to prozac.  Everyone's system is slightly different and will respond to a different med.  Keep trying meds until you can look back and say, yeah, life is definitely better with ---.  For me, life is better with lexapro.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	 (Caregiver) 	1	1	1			4/2/2011 8:58:19 AM	This drug caused my relative's personality to change. He went from a sweet, loving person, to a mean crazy ogre when he took this. Not only did this drug cause him to gain weight and completely change his appearance, but it also caused his to act like a completely different person. This really hurt his kids and family. He would constantly get angry about everything, randomly shun people. It was disturbing. His personality did a complete 180. This drug also cause him to start drinking later on to cope with the stress this drug made him feel. Overall it was a terrible experience. The kids are traumatized and so is everyone else in the family. Oh, and these were given to him as a sample from the doctor.

Went and got a pg test then realized that it's the Lexapro.  The belly never went away and was more depressing that the original depression.  I stopped the meds and am very cautious about taking anything now.  It's like it actually altered my body shape permanently.  Going into menapause did not help either.  It's there for the duration.  I call it the Lexapro belly.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression		1	1	1			3/24/2011 10:41:54 AM	My father was given this after my grandmother died. It completely changed his personality. Before he took it he was a sweet, loving person. This drug made him into an aggressive, &quot;zombie&quot;. (Along with many other terrible effects.) Please stay away from this drug! There are better, more effective, older drug alternatives that the pharmaceutical companies aren't pushing, This is because the pharmaceutical companies can no longer make money off of the old drugs so they invent or slightly modify other drugs and market them as more expensive. Lexapro is an extremely horrible drug. It makes people aggressive and changes personalities for the worse. Stay away. There are multiple lawsuits against the makers of the drug &quot;Lexapro&quot; (Forest Laboratories) for deceptive marketing and others for horrible, negative effects of this substance.

I felt really strange and got angry about everything. It was very, very unpleasant. I know someone else who tried this medication and had the same negative effects. I don't think this is a good medication. From what I've read many people experience horrible effects like I did. I also know that there are multiple legal cases against the company that makes this drug.

My Dr. prescribed Lexapro and for the first 3-4 days I felt a little &quot;drugged&quot;  This went away and since I have noticed a HUGE difference in my anxiety.  It has truly helped me.  I only take a small dose and that seems to be all I need.  I feel like myself again!  The only negatives to Lexapro for me is a very low sex drive, a little more tired than before and vivid dreams.  I've gotten use to the dreams and overall the good outweighs the bad. (Maybe not to my husband though)

I use this primarily for anxiety, and secondarily for depression. As I went off to college and began my life on my own, I realized how much anxiety I have and how difficult it makes life. I dropped out of college twice due to my anxiety. I had such terrible social anxiety that if I missed a class, I would be too afraid to even ask my teacher about what I missed. This would lead to an endless cycle of missing class and being to afraid to attend again. It also would lead to a helpless depression. I never went out or made new friends. It sounds stupid to be &quot;afraid&quot; of social situations, but it was ruining my life. Until I tried Lexapro, I had no idea how much anxiety I really had. I discovered that my life was being controlled by my anxiety. I couldn't even make phone calls to talk to people I didn't know or approach people, even in a professional setting. I couldn't get a job because I was to anxious to even go into a facility and ask for an application, let alone have a interview. I am now working full-time and going to college full-time, and have not had anxiety since I've been taking Lexapro. This medication has really been the best thing I have ever taken. The best way I can describe this medication is if you imagine having a light switch in your brain for anxiety/fear, and this just switches it off. I haven't had any negative side-effects from this, and only have good things to say.

I was having a hard time concentrating on the LSAT, so the doctor prescribed Lexapro for test anxiety. That didn't help. The only think I noticed was that it was easier to get to sleep at night, but then I would became too sleepy and have a hard time waking up. I was also prescribed Adderall for concentration, which has been the only thing that really helps. Unfortunately, the anxiety was still there. It did help with my moodiness, and I even took an extra dose during my period to help with my PMDD. I don't recommend this for people with high anxiety, but it did seem to help balance out my mood levels.

I can fly, I can now drive over tall bridges, drive in the fast lanes on the Houston Freeways and drive in downtown Houston.  Truly a miracle drug. It did keep me up at night when taking 10 mgs., cut back to 5 mgs., and now feel that is the right dose for me.  I do not deel a dependency for the drug, and I just feel normal while taking it

I had such horrible panic, I knew that I could not live my life like that.  I have been on 10 mg for eight years, and I have gained 30 lbs.  I would like to lose the weight, but I cannot go back to the panic.  I guess I will just have to deal.  I am 66 years old and now I am fat and happy - if I die tomorrow, I will be grateful for the life that lexapro gave back to me.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	k, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	2/22/2011 1:02:20 PM	I have been on this for a month now. I started taking it because I am going through a divorce and it was hard for me to deal with. It has definelty helped me be more upbeat, able to deal with life, make rational decisions and deal with the divorce. I have lost 15 pounds in a month, can't fall asleep, have no sex drive, difficuly orgasming, sometimes feel spacey and am nervous about going off of it eventually after reading the withdrawl symptoms. Part of me wishes i didn't need to start taking it but i think i am better off with it then without it at least at this point in my life.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	2/22/2011 6:31:29 AM	I was put on Lexapro for depression and anxiey about two months ago. I'd always been a nervous person but i'd never had major depression and anxiety until the past year. My doctor put me on 5mg and then bumped to 10mg after a week. It took about a month to feel like myself again but these past few weeks have been great. The month of adjustment time was well worth it. I'm able to live again.

I don't feel like i see two people looking at me in the mirror.  One of them I know and the other I don't.  Today we stood there together.  It is the first day of the rest of my life and I have a lot of live to look forward to.  A 1 year old grandson that is the apple of my eye, his mother and my son in law that i love and adore.  A new grandson coming in June and a son and daughter and in law I adore and love them.  I told my son, this is the first day of the rest of my life and I know it.  There father and I are divorcing, which we really don't want to to.  I have 2 months to fix that.  But my top priority is to get right with my kids, kid in law and granchildren.  The are my life and together with there help we will make it.  I have a 50/50 chance with there dad - 50% we can make it work and 50% chance I won't want him back.  I feel better today after only taking it for 1 week than I have felt for a very very long time.  I am on the road to recovery and it is leading me to greener pastures.

I have had no problems with Lexapro.  I take a lot of medications because I Multiple Sclerosis, sleep APNEA, Heat Problems, High Blood Pressure and numerous other medical problems.  My Primary Care Doctor tried taking me off of Lexapro and put me on Venlafaxine, but I had so many problems with it that I went back on Lexapro.  I am completely satisfied with it for my depression.  It is not a wonder drug and there are no wonder drugs.  Some people will have problems and some won't, but it works for me.

I was VERY reluctant to go on an antidepressant, but I got to a point where I would try just about anything.  My symptoms were:  sleeplessness, loss of weight, loss of interest in just about everything, nausea.  I was a mess.  I have been on Lexapro for eight months now and feel better than I did thirty years ago.

When i was hospitalizedi was on zoloft (horribe drug) then they put me on lexapro 10 mg 1 time a day. I find that i need to take my medicine the exact same time everyday for it to be effective. I experienced nausea for the first week but it went away. Eating the medicine with food helped as well. I was taking 4 other medications and the hospital took me off of them and started lexapro a day after my admission. After being on lexapro for a month i feel that tired, i wanna sleep all day type of thing, i get upset very easily, but i have had a very tramatic 2010 so hopefully i can pull it together here and keep on truckin! I plan on asking my dr. if i should go up maybe to 15 or 20 mgs so i can get some energy. i sleep all day and stay up all night because of anxiety,and when i sleep during the day its always in and out, never a deep comfortable sleep. The medicine has kept my weight at a stand still which is beneficial because when i was on all of the other meds i was gaining between 5-7 lbs a month. Overall i plan to give the drug more time to work, and hopefully when i get some energy to get a job again and live that normal life that everyone with depression would give up their arm for. The winter blues don't help the depression situation either. Hope this was helpful to all of you.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	2/9/2011 3:45:44 PM	This is an excellent medication for treating depression.  I have experienced depression for over 20 years.  This is the only one that finally made me feel &quot;normal&quot;.  I stopped getting angry over every little thing, I stopped worrying about minor things, I was very happy.  I have since weaned myself off of this drug, it has taken over 9 months.  It is VERY hard to get off and you need to be committed to weaning yourself very slowly.  It will make you crazy if you don't.  The reason I am weaning myself off of this medication is for two reasons.  The first being that I have gained over 10 pounds on the 5 years that I taken it.  I CANNOT lose weight no matter how I eat or exercise. It has affected my metabolism in some way.  The second reason is that it has affected my libido in a negative way.  I have very little interest in sex.  It has not affected my ability to climax, but just the &quot;getting going&quot; part.  I am now realizing that I still need medication, my irritability and anxieties have returned.  I need to find something that will help me without the negative side effects.

Around this time a year ago, I was in an ambulance on my way to the hospital for an overdose and alcohol poisoning. I had to leave college, and entered a period of several weeks during which I could not even bring myself to leave my bed. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder, put on suicide watch, and prescribed Lexapro. Today, I am happy to report that I have found myself again. I work at a job several days a week, I go out with friends, and I am applying to transfer to a new college. I haven't felt the hopelessness that I used to feel in many months, and I consider myself a content person. This was by no means an easy or short road. Lexapro is not a magic pill that will have you waking up the next day smiling like Vanna White. It took several difficult months of adjustment, and it's not a pill that works for everyone. I still have sadness and depression occasionally, like any person will. It doesn't interfere with my ability to live a happy, successful life anymore, though. I know that I will also face difficult when weening off the medication, but I am prepared for that. The most important thing that I have learned from this is that there is never a reason to give up. Depression doesn't define you, and it isn't forever. Your life isn't blanketed in nighttime like you might think, it is actually just a cloud obscuring your sunlight, and it's ok if you need a little help moving out from behind that cloud.

I started on 10 mg for 5 years, and although , i was relulctant to increase dose to 20 mg in 2008 I did so , due to increased anxiety, It took a while to get adjusted to the 20 mg , but once I did , its seemed to help reduce the amount of anxiety and worry.  I seem to have ADD also, but that could also be caused from the Anxiety. I hate to be on Lexparo for the rest of my life, but it seems that might be the case. As others have said, its seems to be about the best SRRI out there.  Any one gone above the 20 mg dose?

I started on 10mg and felt spacey so dropped to 5mg. I have been at this dose for 2.5 years. I have been pleasantly surprised at the result - I know I am &quot;on&quot; something but it does not get in the way of my daily activity. I am able to let go of hostile situations more easily. I am able to &quot;choose my battles&quot; easier. It gives me a bit of a pause button so I am not so quick to become overwhelmed, sad, upset, angry. I still do feel these emotions, just have more control of them. I once forgot my medication on a week long trip and the withdrawal was tolerable, but I would not recommend it! Several times throughout the day I would get some flashes behind my eyes and the world would seem to vibrate for a few seconds, then it would pass. As far as starting the drug or changing the dose, &quot;they&quot; say that the drug takes 2 weeks to take effect. Maybe in most patients but not this one! No kidding, I increase my dosage to 10mg and I feel it within hours. Now I increase my dose to 10mg for a few days around my cycle and it helps with the severe PMS/PMDD I experience. Maybe all in my head? I chart my cycle and there are many more PMS-induced arguments when I don't take the increased dose! The only bummer I can tell is low libido. Yeah, BUMMER. Well, the price of the drug is another bummer. As a cost savings I tried something similar - a generic called citalopram - it was AWFUL! It made me feel more than spacey - very messed up and more emotional. Good luck!

I was given Lexapro and Seroquel.  The latter was a horrible experience, but the Lexapro has been quite helpful.  I take 10 mg daily and it seems to really keep me in line.  I have noticed I have extremely low libido however (as in I have to be reminded bc I don't ever even think of it) and I'm only 24 so it shouldn't be a natural problem.  But the good outweighs the bad and I'm sticking with it.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	1/10/2011 1:21:52 PM	I first took Lexapro from 2004 - 2007 due to physical reactions to extreme stress.  I probably shouldn't have taken it then, but my Dr wanted to try it and see if chest tightness, panic attacks, and thumpy heartbeat went away.  I did notice very vivid dreams during the first 2 weeks on it.  The dreams weren't scary, just very very vivid.I stopped Lexapro in 2008 and experienced some withdrawl symptoms, the worst being the &quot;brain zaps&quot;, feeling like electrical jolts were running through my brain.  That lasted about a week and then went away.I recently went on Lexapro again in 2010 for anxiety and depression and the return of physical symptoms (thought I was having a heart attack, but it was anxiety).  Upon starting Lexapro again, I didn't have any vivid dreams but my physical symptoms went away.Now I take 10 Mg/day and, while the physical symptoms are gone, my mood is rather neutral, rather than happy or sad.  Also, libido is very low.  Weight gain has occured, even though I don't really feel hungry most of the time.However, while some of the side effects annoying and bothersome, not to mention the cost of the drug, Lexapro has been very helpful in getting me out of the hole I was stuck in.

It worked great until about a year ago.  My symptoms came back so my doctor upped my dosage to 20 mg.  That worked for a while, but now my symptoms are back again...  I'm wondering if your body can develop an immunity to it?  Regardless, this drug has been great in helping me feel normal again.

It helped almost immediatly with my depression and mood changes. After a few months the dose didn't seem strong enough so they increased the dosage. The increased dosage has taken a little longer for my body to get used to. Only complaints I had are the common side effects of dizziness and drowsiness.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	NeeNee0131, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	1/4/2011 11:50:22 AM	I have been dealing with anxiet/depression in secret since I was aged 14..at 25 I had my first anxiety/panic attack. I've been going through so many life changes and I felt out of control. I knew that night I needed to see a Dr right away. They prescribed me Lexapro. Week 1 I was nautious and couldnt eat much...mornings were harder, however I was sortof feeling like their was some hope. It helped reading positive reviews online and forcing myself to do something outside of the house. Day 3 I started feeling more productive and it was a little easier to wake up in the morning. By day 6 I was already feeling &quot;myself&quot; again...i was happier...still nautious and nervous about leaving home but I could really see the change in my mood. I am now on week 5 and I feel like myself again. No real side affects thank goodness - I do get aggitated and yawn more for some reason (but thats something I can put up with. I'm satisfied with Lexapro...it definatly has worked for me and let me feel my normal self. Best wishes

I have no side effects and it helps my anxious feelings. I highly recommend it for people with anxiety.

I am a police officer and see a lot of things that most people would not want to see. Therefore, my anxiety has gone up because of my exposures. About a week or two after taking Lexapro I noticed a great change in my attitude and Anxiety. Couldnt be happier!

Lexapro+Oral	Major Depressive Disorder	F'ed Up on SSRIs, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	19-24	12/30/2010 8:24:26 PM	I was struggling more with anxiety than depression at the time, and on that note, lexapro seemed to work pretty well for a while. However, my depression eventually relapsed, and despite continually upping the dose until it was past the range of tested clinical efficacy (40 mg), I was still depressed nearly every day for two months, characterized by low energy and motivation, as well as occasional, fleeting suicidal ideations. I was prescribed bupropion to take in conjunction with the lexapro, giving me substantial increases in energy and motivation which I felt that lexapro had sapped from me. However, bupropion did nothing to fix lexapro's sexual side effects, which had once been mild but were now approaching borderline-impotence. I decided that I'd enough of this; thus, I tapered off the lexapro over the course of a month, during which I experienced persistent &quot;brain zaps&quot;, increased agitation, lowered energy, lowered concentration, suicidal ideations, and derealization.  However, once the influence of this horrible substance had completely left my system, I began feeling back on track with the bupropion. I still suffer from depression but I'm much more functional, focused, and motivated than before.  In conclusion, Lexapro did nothing but potentiate my depression.  I will never put another SSRI in my system again.

My Doctor gave me Lexapro and it took about 3 weeks to start working but the results were wonderful, I am no longer suicidal or thoughts and I am  able to deal with life again. I had many losses this year and I felt like I just wanted to check out, with the help of a doctor that listened and this medication I feel like I am back to the old me.

With the help of a shrink and a medical Dr. agreeing Lexapro should be tried I took it and was helped by shrink and meds very quickly.  I remained ok till Oct. when SAD set in but an increase in dosage helped that, tho not as quickly.

I'm pretty happy with it for depression, but it doesn't help with anxiety, for which I take Xanax.

Day 2-14, I took only a 1/4 tab (3mg) and then increased to a 1/2 tab (5mg). Not sure if I need to increase to 10mg since the 5 mg seems to be working well. I am married, work full time and have a 5 year old. Life can be stressful so I hope the Lexapro will help.

Never had a need to take any meds prior to 2 years ago, but &quot;mid-life&quot; brought with it an almost-debilitating level of anxiety. Lexapro worked quickly and efficaciously. I did gain about 25 pounds, but this might be related to my naturally-slowing metabolism at this stage of my life...hard to say. Have been watching my calories and getting moderate exercise, and have dropped 10 of the 25 pounds. Really great med for anxiety.

However within a week of trying this medication I noticed a significant increase in my appetite, which was unacceptable. It was actually difficult for me to feel full, even if I ate more than my body needed. If I stayed on Lexapro I would have been very upset by the weight gain, so although the drug might be helpful to others it was very unaffective for me. I also wasn't on it long enough to see any changes in my depression.

This has really helped keep my emotions in control and also not get upset at my husband and kids so easily. I was given 10mg but I take half of my pill since I am really sleepy on 10mg. Some people take it at night but I take mine in the morning. I turned 40 and it seems that without lexapro I am crying and/or upset all the time. I have gained maybe 5-10 lbs since being on this but I try to exercise and not eat huge meals in the evening. I recommend this for women who are crying a lot and are easily upset. PS.Side effects are sleepiness, and decreased sex drive, also increased appetite, trouble concentrating

I noticed change in my mood right away but I'm still having some difficulty when my period is approaching. I am considering asking my doctor to increase the dose. I do have more energy, I have been sleeping better and I seem to handle every day tasks (and my 2 small children) much better. I have experienced very vivid and realistic dreams but that doesn't bother me. The only downside for me is difficulty having orgasm, however, I wouldn't consider discontinuing it. With my insurance, it costs $25 per months, othrwise, it would be quite expensive.

When I first started, I noticed an almost immediate &quot;lifting of the clouds&quot;. I felt more like myself and it alleviated the crying bouts I was having.  I started at 10 mg and went up to 20 mg (the medication became less effective over time) and then back to 10mg when I felt I could lower it. I have recently come off of Lexapro and am contemplating going back on it.  The side effects I experienced were minimal but sexually related. This drug worked very well for me.

But after awhile it lost its effectiveness, and I began to re-experience recurring crying bouts and very severe depression, some of which resulted in potential suicidal thoughts -- at least once I almost checked into the hospital for fear for my life. Also, it is extremely expensive!!  I changed to citalopram and it seems to be working.

I am only using 5mg instead of the usual does of 10.  However, I am very happy with it.  I find myself to be a more positive person and less reactive, edgy or upset about situations.  I also think what helps me is reading self-help books and continous awareness of every emotions I feel.  I also do not experience any side effects, which is a plus.

I started at 10mg and found that my mind was racing and nothing was fast enough to keep it occupied. I just spoke with my doctor and we reduced it to 5mg. Feeling much calmer now, and was told that this medication can sometimes increase anxiety in some people. So it just takes time to figure out the right dose. Hang in there!

You are crippled in random extreme crying, headaches/migraines and more. I started taking Lexapro in January 2010 at 5mg. after 4 months I had to move up to 10mg because 5mg wasn't enough. 5 months later I started taking 20mg and I've been on 20mg ever since and it's working very well. Next week I am moving up a dose to help me deal with my recent surgery pain and anxiety. The withdrawal symptoms are horrible. You get weird brain buzzes, and my hands and feet go numb, and I get dizzy. But that's if I miss 3 doses or more in a row. Overall Lexapro works very well if you remember to take it correctly and if you are honest with your doctor on how effective your dosage is. I hope I helped!

With my new doctor, I was prescribed Lexapro 20 mg.  After going from Zoloft 200 mg...I was worried that there was no way Lexapro could compare.  I'd have to say the change in medicine has been amazing.  I feel better on 20 mg than I EVER felt on 200 mg.  If you are sick of your dosages getting higher everytime you go to the doctor--give Lexapro a try!  I'm VERY happy with the outcome!

I feel like I can function now. It did make me sleepy, so I take it at night, I'm on 10mg, I also experience crazy realistic dreams now, sometimes making it hard to sleep. But the good out weighs the bad and being able to function normally finally takes the cake.

I tried the lexapro and I can't believe how much better I feel and my performance at work shows. I've been on 20 mg a couple weeks now, a few jitters but feel like i'm adjusting to the new dosage.

Also helps with depression.  If I end up not taking it for - say three days because I'm out - I slowly can feel my obsessive thoughts coming back and have anxiety and panic attacks.  I also take clonazepam with the lexapro and the combination has worked well for me.

I moved from 2.5 mg to 5 mg two days ago and I was crying/angry/severely depressed within a few hours.  Nausea, too.  I'm used to this side effect because I felt the same increased anger/anxiety with both Zoloft and Wellbutrin after about 4-5 days, so I'm really going to try to stick with it to see if symptoms improve.  I'm frustrated that I don't seem to respond to these meds well.  I just need something to work.  I could barely leave the house the past few days.  I'll give it another 2 weeks (maybe) and if symptoms of anxiety and anger don't improve, I'm giving up on Lexapro, too.  I'm willing to put up with this very temporarily, but I was honestly doing better BEFORE starting Lex than I am now.  This med is still better than Zoloft, which was a nightmare for me.  The best drug I've been on so far (for me) was Pristiq.

I fell easily agitated, and bitchy. I just want to yell at my kids for the smallest things. I have been on zoloft and that did nothing, paxil worked for a few months then stopped. Also, I have noticed that I have absolutely NO sex drive at all.... I am going to talk to my doctor about changing my meds again!

I am an RN and it concerns me to add more medications to what I am currently taking. I have adverse side effects from many medications and with this mostly all of the antidepressive/anxiety medications that my physician has tried over the last 11 years.  I am currently taking only adderal and clonazepam for my depression and anxiety; the adderal I know is not a conventional tx, but due to my sensitivities to it has proved to be a good option. I have developed increasing episodes of anxiety and difficulty with concentration when I am anywhere but at work. I've resisted adding any further medications for quite sometime, but can no longer do that as I don't want s/s to manifest themselves when I am at work. I agreed to try Lexapro as it is 1 that I had not tried yet.  I have only been taking 5mg at bedtime for about 2 weeks now. I don't think that there has been any changes yet. I know that a true trial will require more time on the medication. So far, I have noticed no side effects. Why can a person not regain the seratonin that is reportedly lost with depression?? If your blood count is low or blood chemistry is off it can be replaced.  Why not seratonin?? I would like to not be taking any medications at some time in my life. What is on the horizon in the treatment of depression?? I want to get off medications.  I am otherwise healthy.  Technical and rock climb, back country backpack, hike, and other outdoor activities.  I do have phototherapy at times during the year.

This drug made it possible for me to carry on--no more shaking or uncontrollable crying.  The doctor says I need to be on it 9 months total then try to get off it.  Side effects like being tired all the time were bad in the first few weeks but then tapered off.  Once the very stressful times were gone, I was tired again and had short term memory loss.  The doctor says I could probably decrease my dosage now but he wants to leave things alone through the holidays.  To me the benefits of this med outweigh the costs.

I took it the first night and the next morning I had pins and needles.  I suspected I had a reaction to other medications.  However, I continued taking Lexapro for a week before stopping.  After another week, I returned to my doctor and reported the problems.  He told me there should be no problem with other medications and to start it again.  I did, but with the same results...pins and needles.  I stopped again but then started a month or so later only to have pins and needles again.  I stayed on Lexapro for about another 2-3 months.  I used Percocet to help control the pins and needles.  Those two drugs became my daily ritual.  However, I moved from Lexapro to Xanax and found a lot more relief while still using the Percocet.  Later, I also developed burning sensations.  I now have all three--pins, needles, and burning sensations (PNBS), a new acronym.  I have tried incessantly to get rid of these problems, but still have them.  I basically live on oxycodone (Percocet without the Tylenol) at least 3-5 times a week with an occasional Xanax.  I've tried every herbal known to man with little success.  I contacted the makers of Lexapro to ask for a solution, but their cop-out was that my doctor would have to treat me and that they could do nothing.  Now I see why people sue pharmaceutical companies.  Good luck on Lexapro.  But, if you experience PNBA right away, my advice is to stop it immediately and never return.  The PNBA is horrible!

This medicine has made my moods much more stable, and I am much more calm- I still get anxious, but I feel on lexapro I am better able to cope with it. I feel happier, and I have little more energy. Also an unexpected result, I suffer from chronic neck pain, but it's been completely gone since taking lexapro! I've read studies on antidepressants treating pain, and I guess that's what happened!

I am also an alcoholic. My Dr wanted me to start with 5 mg and after a few weeks move up to 10. At first it was great but when I went up to 10 mg I had the side effects of sweating at night, vivid dreams and heavy menstrual periods. I felt zoned out too. I even had a major panic attack so I stopped taking it. Well the feelings of anxiety and despair came creeping back and I started drinking again. A few months ago I decided to quit drinking for good and I started 5 mg of Lex again. No symptoms this time! After a month I went up to 10 mg and still no side effects! I feel great.. no social anxiety! I am finally able to live, for myself and my children. And I am proud to say that I am 3 months sober and I believe the Lexapro has helped. The only downside is that I have heard the withdrawals are terrible. Someday I hope to be able to wean off of the meds but for now I am enjoying life again!
Lexapro+Oral	Other	J.R. , 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Female		10/9/2010 12:25:07 PM	Do not use for elderly patients especially if they cant have blood thinners or have problem with bleeding ever.  My mom is 87 yrs old and had to have blood transfusions twice with the total of 12 pts first time and 8 the second time a month later. Since being off the medicine totally she has not had one bleeding espisode not even a drop of blood in GI track/rectum. This drug is dangerous and should be given a better warning lable than is on there now.  I almost lost my mom in Nov 2009 and Jan 2010 before I took her off meds and told doctors I was 100% sure that was the problem.  I am not saying it is not going to help for some but not for seniors who have possible underlying conditions.  I would not want anyone to go through what I and my families have gone thru because of this. It also effected her brain function and now her memory and able to talk (slurring her words) and her gait is off really badly.  Pain mgmt dr presecribed it to her for pain not for depression.  It did take some of pain away but damaged her brain in the course of treatment.

Lexapro has, for all intents and purposes, given me my life back. It isn't 100%, I still have intrusive thoughts from time to time, but they are much easier to manage and have minimal impact on my day to day activities.The side effects were minimal and didn't last more then a month or so.

I was having major panic attacks and was prescribed Paxil.  After 2 yrs on Paxil I was dead inside.  I felt like a zombie and had sexual side effects.  I decided to stop taking it and after a few months I was feeling those old feelings creep up again.  My new Dr. started me on Lexapro 10mg.  What a difference.  I had no sexual side effects and actually lost a few pounds.  I evenutally moved up to 20 mg but have recently been taking biodentical hormones and that has enabled me to go back to 10 and hopefully to 5 soon.  I believe that middle age women should have their hormone levels checked because I never experienced these symptoms till the &quot;change&quot; started.

Lexapro+Oral	Major Depressive Disorder	XMLXtreme,  Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female		10/3/2010 6:02:28 PM	I was given this medication for major depression when my life and my marriage started to fall apart as my ex did the trade in for the younger model...and I wanted to die. The Lexapro is a great help. I did sleep for nearly 3 weeks while adjusting, putting up with quick dizzy feelings shooting through my head but that did subside.I have moved on with my life and I am naturally happy and no longer wish for death so I went off the drug. I am having a serious withdrawl problem when I was told there were no side effects or dependency problems So I started the &quot;weaning&quot; steps. I fall over, I have shooting dizziness again and it makes me feel very ill. I hope that &quot;it&quot; will stop within 3 weeks. I also had to stop this medication as my ex took my insurance away from me and I am 100% uninsurable due to 2 declineable diseases and I cannot afford this drug. If there were a generic, I would stay on it only because of being so sick trying not to take it anymore. Great Pro's to this drug, but a huge price to pay coming off of the drug thus explaining the satisfaction rating.

I can function fully (no more staying in bed all day),hold a job, and actually enjoy interacting with others. Of course I still have certain times when events cause depression, but the difference is, with Lexapro, I can deal with it and move on, whereas before, I couldn't.  I never want to feel the horrible, hopelessness that used to be part of my everyday living.
Lexapro+Oral	Major Depressive Disorder	antzrus, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	9/30/2010 10:25:13 PM	I've used 20mg daily since its introduction in '02. It continues working just fine w/out pooping out nor needing a dosage increase. I started at 20mg because when Forrest introduced Celexa they said 20mg was the average dose-it was later proven that 40mg was the average effective dose. Over the years Lexapro has also shown that 20mg is the average effective dose. Sex drive can be an issue if your relationship is based on same. On the other hand, the love drive on this med increases significantly. If you were severely depressed and unable to eat/losing weight-you will regain your appetite-weight. If you were moderately depressed and over eating you may slow down and lose weight or not sometimes. Aerobic exercise will help w/the depression and the weight-but you have to &quot;Just do it!&quot; Yeah, procrastination is a big part of being depressed... Oh yeah, don't use ANY depressants (i.e. opiates, cannabis, benzos, alcohol) at all-at all (!!!) if you expect the stuff to work.

I found it helpful after a couple of weeks then not so much.  The dr increased the dosage, it helped some.  The sleeplessness almost defeats the benefits.  Also, tremors, weight gain, nightmares and I seem to have lost a lot of motivation.  I see the dr again in a couple of weeks, maybe I need to change to something else.  I'm not looking forward to the withdrawls.

I'm not motivated like I used to be. Also, I lose alot of hair from Lexapro. I mean, in the shower my hair comes out in clumps. Im thinking of maybe switching to pristiq to see if My hair falls out with it and if I can get my energy back. Oh of course, with my lack of energy, I'm not exercising so the weight is piling on.

I gained over 50 pounds in 2 1/2 years. Tried to wean myself off but my moods were way off balance. I need my sanity so I will deal with the weight.

The drug seemed to work well for the depression but I could not tolerate the sweating. It was publicaly humiliating and very uncomfortable.
Lexapro+Oral	&amp;quot;Change of Life&amp;quot; Signs	Becca, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/21/2010 1:27:09 AM	I have been treated for panic ddisorder, depression, OCD, since I was 28. Now 53. Same Dr. for all this time. He tried everything. The ones that worked really well had side effects such aas too agressive, (Iwas very sensitive before), weight gain on another, prozac did not do much. Dr. put me on Lexepro and it has worked much faster and worked great. I only have problems when I go off of it due to thinking I am o.k. now, sometimes can't afford it, no insurance,ect. This drug has worked better than any without side effects. If I stop taking it I get weepy and anger easily. I would reccomend this to anyone who see's that it is helping them. It worked pretty much right away for me. I also have been on xanax for 25 years for panic disorder. If it works, don't try going off of it unless Dr. tells you to. I maake that mistake a lot, and it has caused problems. Cheemical imbalance runs in my family, and I will always be on meds. Before Lexepro I had 3 suicide aattempts, last one they brought me back twice. No probleems or even thoughts since Lexepro. Hope this will help someone.

I've gained 40 pounds but its worth it to have my sanity.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/16/2010 5:53:55 PM	Situational Depression brought on extreme weight loss, no sleep, not eating, not able to properly or effectively deal with issues along with frequent bouts of tears. Dr prescribed Lexapro as a trial since I've never taken meds before. Took it for 4 weeks and was happy with the results but paranoid that the Lexapro was just a placebo as I had no side effects whatsoever. Went off Lexapro and within 2 days had reverted to Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde behaviour. After a week of that I went back on Lexapro for sanity's sake.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	9/16/2010 5:30:53 PM	I took this med for about 3 1/2 years in varying doses according to my doctor's recommendation.  I gained about 30 pounds over that time period.  I finally decided to go off of it, because of the weight gain, it was not helping at all, and it was in fact making things worse.  I weaned myself off slowly.  The withdrawal effects ARE TERRIBLE.  Weird head 'zapping', dizziness, nausea...I could go on and on.  After almost 3 weeks off of Lexapro, I am starting to feel normal again, and have lost 11 pounds.  I would NOT recommend taking this drug.  The side effects while on the drug, as well as the withdrawal symptoms, made taking Lexapro a bad experience.  I am sad I wasted over 3 years of my life on this medication.

Used Zoloft, worked good, weaned myself off when I felt better. Using Lexapro now to control debilitating anxiety, immediate relief. Sometimes you just have to try different anti depressants to find the right one.

Lexapro has greatly helped me to manage my OCD : has made many of the obsessions go away, and has made stopping the compulsions easier. The only problem I have with Lexapro is sleeplessness and really awful nightmares - however, I have found that if I take a Zyrtec at bedtime I don't have this problem at all! I would definitely recommend this medication to anyone with OCD!!

So far she has stated that she is feeling much calmer, while still upset w/ me for her hospitalization. She is able to talk w/ me rather than scream &amp; attempt to bully me. So far the only complication that is observed is she is having trouble sleeping &amp; her physician has now prescribed her another antidepressant as a sleeping pill to use together. She has another 5 days of observation before retuning home, but hopefully this w/ her quality psychiatric team I will eventually have my awesome sweet girl again!

I rarely ever take antibiotics and cant stand people that medicate every little problem they have.  But, after a devestating divorce I found myself severely depressed and for the first time asked my doctor for help for what he called &quot;situational depression.&quot;  Initially, it made me feel horrible, panicky and unable to sleep, but was told to at least give my body a month to get used to it.  Within a couple of weeks, I felt calmer, happier and less stress.  As my body got used to the drug, I was able to sleep better and actually lost weight on this drug!  I would absolutely recommend trying it.  AFter about 8 mos., I decided to get off of it and found it very difficult!  Severe dizziness, crying spells and sadness.  I tapered slowly and side effects are gone, however I feel depressed again and debating about going back on this med.

Lexapro+Oral	Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	9/2/2010 8:34:22 PM	I have taken a variety of dosages with this medicine, depending on what situations are affecting my life.  Very low during pregnancy to very high after pregnancy to a moderate dosage during other times of life.  I have found very few side effects with this medicine.  One I think might be related to this medicine is low sexual libido and the inability to orgasm.  However, it might not be this medicine, it could be the anti-anxiety medicine I am currently taking.

I visited him for several days before he died.  I had to have a security officer standing behind me.  Because of the stress I developed severe heart attack symtoms.  Since I was in the hospital already I went to the ER to be checked out.  After every test available the doctors determined this was an anxiety attack.  I have been taking 10 mg of Lexapro and 10 years later I have worked as a hospice chaplain and addiction counselor and have not had another attack. I think it helps me feel more calm.  My daughter who is a social worker in child protective services also takes Lexapro and we feel it has helped us cope with our tough jobs and not feel anxious.

This is the third drug I have tried (zoloft and Celexa first) but the first two didn't work and made me so tired I couldn't continue to take them.  This is the last drug for me, none of them seem to work and it is scary waiting for the side effects.

I got a check up a week ago and I told her that I wasn't feeling any better over all but she said I had to keep at it to feel any better. (she also added clonazapam...which doesn't do anything! they chould be sugar pills for all they do)...  About 45 min after I take the lexapro I feel really out of it &quot;trippy&quot;. That is the best part to look forward to. I can just space out and not worry.  I take it at night before I go to bed so I don't have to worry about functioning. But the next day, 12 hours later I still get really nervous driving to work because I have a hard time paying attention to the road.  My anger, and anxiety are the same if not worse at times. I have noticed that sometimes I am more obsessed with organizing things and stressing if things aren't in there place which isn't normal. I have to wait another month and go back to the doc.  I hope it either starts working or I can switch to something that actually works. Maybe my expectations are unrealistic.  But feeling alittle better would be better than nothing.

I became very forgetful and could not function. I went off and then went back on slowly increasing my dosage. I have had no ill feelings, no anxiety and can function 100%. Okay sounds great huh, one major drawback, you sex drive becomes nonexistent. If you do decide to have sex you cannot orgasm which is so frustrating. I did discuss with my doctor and she said to plan ahead and go off medication for two days. This does work for me but not might be safe or effective for everyone.

I was nervous about taking medication at first, but I'm glad I did.  I had tried a lot of non-pharmaceutical things and they didn't have much impact.Side effects I've experienced are mainly slight nausea, indigestion, and bloating/gas.  Positive effects include improved mood, not feeling so irritable, not crying so much, and becoming interested in things again.  Medication hasn't instantly fixed all my problems, but at least it's giving me the energy and motivation to do more things to help myself.

I don't feel the sense of panic in certain situations where I did before. I don't have as many negative thoughts &amp; as strong as a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach. I generally feel more positive. However, while I was having sex last night it was dramatically different. I have been very sexually active &amp; usually enjoy it very much, but last night I felt nothing other than the tactile sensations. I felt like there was no way I would even come close to orgasming. &amp; my boyfriend was doing the same things he has always been doing which previously had been very successful. Also, I have noticed that I've gained a couple pounds. I do kind of feel like a zombie but I'm not complaining because I function even better &amp; it's a lot better than chronic panic &amp; despair. I just feel a lot more apathetic about things.

After about two weeks I noticed a difference in anxiety and mood.  I have been on this medication for a year straight now and I have not gained any weight. Don't get off the medication if you gain weight, possibly the weigh gain is due to a change in metabolism or diet and/or exercise.  This drug may have saved my life.  I tried Effexor first and it made me aggressive and hostile.  Lexapro affects less neurotransmitters so I think people should try it for depression first before trying Effexor.

Within 2 weeks of being on Lexapro I noticed a difference. No more crying, mood swings and trouble sleeping. I've been on it for 6 months now. Yes, I've gained weight on it, but since food is a reward to me I can't blame it on the meds. Lexapro has made a huge difference!

I have only been taking 1/4 a pill now for about 3 years and felt like that was all that I needed. However, I weigh more now then I have ever weighed. Now my blood pressure is very high and my heart races all the time and I have no energy, I don't sleep well at night. I am going to start weaning myself off starting today. This is the only prescription that I have been on for a long time. The Dr. has just put me on something for high blood pressure this week. I am going to hold off taking it until I get the lexapro out of my system and see if this is my whole problem.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	35-44	8/17/2010 11:00:33 PM	I started taking Lexapro a few years back for both depression and anxiety during a really tough and stressful time (sick parent, job transition, dating issues). I was in a really bad place at that point and Lexapro was a last resort (never thought I'd ever need a pill). The initial symptoms of dizziness and increased anxiety were a real pain and it took almost a month before I started to feel better. To make matters worse, it hurt my libido too. But I stuck with it and it eventually did have a very positive effect on my life. The only easy part was actually when I stopped taking it cold turkey after a year and felt zero side effects. Score!Once again I've been going through some moderate depression/anxiety and am starting to take it again. My overall depression and anxiety are milder this time and I'm noticing the benefits almost immediately with only mild dizziness right after I take it. i hate the idea of taking these pills but I'm getting over it because they definitely help.

I wanted to first kill all my enemies and then just go on a random killing spree for fun. I have never had any thoughts like this before. I got off it according to doctor's instructions and I experienced horrible side effects for months. What a nightmare.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Katie2650, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/12/2010 5:08:52 PM	I took Lexapro (10mg daily) for almost 2 years.  It helped me control my depression and anxiety.  I knew that I had to ween off this medication slowly; I had taken other SSRIs in the past (Paxil, Zoloft) and it is NOT a good idea to stop all at once, you need a plan to ween off these meds.  I started to ween myself off and had terrible side affects - dizziness, a strange head zapping feeling and increased anxiety.  I decided to stay on Lexapro awhile longer as I was busy with work and travel for my job and couldn't deal with a dizzy head.  A few months ago, I slowly started to ween off again.  My doctor told me to cut the pill in half and take 5mg each day, then after 1 week take 5mg every other day, then every 2 days.  I took it even slower and took 5mg every other day for 1 month until I felt I was ready to stop completely.  I had the same side affects - dizzy head, zapping feeling in my brain, weird body aches.  I stuck with my plan and after 2 weeks, the side affects completely disappeared and I felt completely normal.  I have not had any issues since.  My advice is to ween off slowly and stick it out if you have some mild side affects from withdrawl, because they will go away.

Lexapro finally give me a new view on life.  I do not worry over everything and all my suicidal thoughts have gone away.  But, I ran out of this drug for a few months and the withdrawl systoms were terrible.  My legs felt like they were running all the time, I constantly had spasms when I would go to bed, this lasted for a couple of months.

I will never get on any kind of antidepressant again.

When I tried getting off of it the depression would return to the point that I couldn't concentrate and couldn't get the simplest work items completed on time. Started working out on weights and then was able to get off without depression returning.  Now prescribed again for depression dealing with marriage issues but 10mg isn't working - Dr suggested 20mg so I will see how that works to improve my ability to work through issues.

I would feel like I wasn't in control of my body and would put myself into many panic attacks. I had to go to the emergency room several times thinking that I couldnt breath and eventually put myself into a depression. I wouldnt leave my house for 2 weeks and if I did I just felt abnormal and like I was walking on clouds. I new something was wrong and my doctor prescribed me lexapro 10mg. It only took about 1 week to kick in and I felt a little zombie like at first put a couple weeks after that I have never felt so great! Lexapro is a life saver haha :) !! P.s It's a little on the expensive side so my doctor prescribes me 20mg's which you can cut in half and it will last you 2 months instead of just one.

I was about to drop out of school because going made me anxious, I couldn't talk to people, and I couldn't do my homework. After the first day on Lexapro I felt a difference and was able to get back on track. However, I will warn that a higher dose does not always equal a better effect. I switched from 5mg to 10mg and my depression returned. After going back to 5mg, I feel better than I have in years!

I started at 10mg and went up to 20. I tried to lower the dose at one point and noticed that my emotions were getting out of control and the anxiety was returning. I went back to taking 10mg and feeling great. I also take 150mg of Wellbutrin to counteract the sexual side effects that Lexapro causes. Great combination and it works well for me.

I was never one to think that I needed a pill for mood swings. After having two children 14 months apart, I needed a pill! I was feeling depressed, anxious, and crazy. I went on 15mg. I feel normal. I do agree with the loss in sexual appetite and I have gained 25lbs over 3 years. I weaned off last year and the mood swings came flooding back. I am now on 10mg with no plan to stop taking Lexapro.

And was eventually put on lexapro about 3 yrs ago. While this drug subsides attacks it gives you an &quot;I don't care&quot; attitude. I'm pretty active, work out every day, and still gained almost over 30 lbs. I'm working on finding other ways to deal with my stress now. They don't scare me anymore and if I need to take a xanex I will. but ideally I want off this drug!!

It dramatically reduced the attacks, but the sideaffects included a &quot;fuzziness&quot; in my thinking, and really reduced any feelings of joy.   After taking it for 3 years, I weaned myself off it, and had horrible withdrawl symptoms.  If my doctor hadn't warned me that the major problem with stopping was serious thoughts of suicides, I'm sure I would have not survived.

However, this medication loses its effects very soon.  I would definitely not recommend this medication for Panic Disorder and for longterm use.  This medication also caused me severe nausea and weight gain, which was not worth it for me.

I don't have many side effects and it works for me all day. I had to switch up from the 10mg to the 20mg simply because my body was burning thru it in less than 6 hours. That was really the only problem I had with it! I've found my body takes better to it the earlier in my day I take it. Around 7 a.m. is the best time.

I suffered from Post Partum Depression. It has helped with that condition, however I am tired all the time as well as gaining weight. I am currently in my last month of having to take it, so I am hoping to drop the pounds I have gained. I stay active and walk and exercise on a daily basis but for some reason the weight is still there.

I then stopped for another year and started taking Lexapro.  This drug was very effective.  The doctor prescribed 10mg but I did my research and decided to start with the lowest dose which is 5mg, and have been taking that dosage for 3yrs.  The first 2 weeks showed increased symptoms but it gradually lessened and now I'm fine.  Only side effect is a dramatic decrease in libido, I can ejaculate but it's not nearly powerful as it was.  Otherwise, the drug is good.  The initial 10mg is definitely not necessary (for me).  It was much healthier (and easier) to bump up the dosage when seems fit than to start off on a real high dosage.

It totally changed my life for the best. But, like an idiot I thought that I needed to come off it to prove that I could overcome the anxiety and did it right after I got laid off. Bad idea, because it rebounded hard and threw me back into a tailspin. Fortunately, the initial relief comes within a week or so for me and I had a leftover bottle from March that I started myself back on. It's a good thing too because I could definitely feel things starting to slip away again. I can honestly say I'm going to be on it and stay on it for a while now while I work on handling stress better and not worrying about the great unknown.

I started taking Lexapro in January.  At first it was wonderful!  But over time I started noticing things.  The major one is loss of sex drive!(my husband can verify).  The other two are weight gain and having a hard time losing it(Jenny Craig can attest to that)! Also I'm starting to expierience bouts of depression.  I&quot;m going back to my doctors to get back on Wellbutrin XL.

It took a few weeks for the medication to take effect but once it did, everyday life became much easier and I felt hopeful about the day instead of dreadful.  I did experience side effects - dizziness, nauseous, easy bruising, and difficulty losing the baby weight no matter how much I exercised.  Now I am weaning off the drug and I feel irritated and tired all the time.  I am hoping this will begin to pass as my body adjusts.  Overall it was a good medication for what I needed, I just hope I am ready to stop taking it, it's hard to know until it's completely out of the body.

I took the medication at 6pm after eating dinner and almost immediately felt ill. Went to bed to sleep through side effects, but woke up at 11pm to the room spinning. It was so bad I had to crawl to the bathroom to throw up. The entire next day I was sick to my stomach and unable to keep any food down, extreamly dizzy, and I had a horrible headache and could not take pain reliever due to drug interaction warning. I thought my body would get used to it by the next day, so again at 6pm I took the 10mg dose and tried to quickly go to bed. I had difficulty getting to sleep, staying asleep, and night sweats both nights. Woke up for work at 3am vomiting again, the same headache and inability to keep food down, but now I had developed shivers (teeth chattering) and excessive sweating. I feel like I have had the worst flu of my life for three days and am terrified to take another dose. That said, I was involved in several stressful situations at work that would normally have me totally anxious, and in a ball crying at home, if not at work, but i haven't broken down at all since taking it.

Lexapro takes care of these symptoms for me. I have tried getting off of it, but my symptoms come right back, so for me, it is a lifesaver! I have experienced no side effects.

Word of advice do all you can without having to resort to taking meds. these meds mess with the chemical composition of your brain and in my opinion are not safe to use. tried several other meds and the same results the side effects are unbearable in my opinion and worse then just dealing with anxiety. seek help elsewhere believe me drugs are not the answer

When being on the medication for two weeks I suddenly became very dizzy and went to ER vomiting.  ER doctor decided it was due to the medication and said to quit taking Lexapro and the dizziness should go away in a few days.  Medication for nausea and dizziness given but did no good.  The next day the vomiting stopped, but the dizziness continued and I had to stay in bed with my eyes closed to tolerate it.  On the third day I went to my regular doctor who agreed that it was from the Lexapro and I should be back to normal in a couple more days.  So far, not the case.  The dizziness is a little better and I am no longer vomiting, but I am unable to focus on things for very long.  I am too dizzy to drive and am not sure if I can work tomorrow.  This has been a terrible experience.  I have taken quite a few different anti-depressants with no reactions at all.  This is very scary.

A slight prolonging of sexual climax on certain occasions is all really. I have used this off and on for five years now and it increases my focus and elevates my mood. Reduces my anxiety as well, even when I do get anxiety while taking this drug, it is not nearly as severe as without. I have used alcohol moderately with this drug as well and seen no real problem. I only have between 2-4 drinks a few times a week though. All in all it's a useful drug in my opinion. I have seen the wieght gain but it is only moderate and can be avoided with exercise.

Side effects I initially experienced was shaky hands and a dullness to my short term memory. One of the unusual things that happened was when an anxiety would hit I could feel the release from my brain down my arms like a tingling sensation. Very trippy experience and definitely snapped me out of the anxiety. I have been on this drug for a year and a half. Just recently weened off of it and feel pretty good. Definitely recommended. Did gain a bit of weight and slight dip in my sexual apetite. but all manageable and worth it.

I took 10 mg once daily for 4 months.  I kept hoping it would help me more.  I developed very dry and itchy skin, blurred vision in one eye, nose bleeds, and feeling more anxious than before I started taking it.   My doctor switched me to another medication and I feel much better now.  This medication was not for me I guess.

I have been on the minimum dose and while it hasn't completely eliminated any feelings of depression, I no longer think about dying all the time and don't feel as if my feelings are at the surface and ready to spill over at any moment. It's made it possible for me to function at an acceptable level.

Panic attacks were less frequent but still got the occasional one at least once a week.

Didnt realize it was lexapro. I stopped lexapro 2 weeks ago. trying low dose hormone. Hopefully, will have weight loss now. Realationship may be over due to no sex drive for 2 years-also didnt realize might be lexapro. Not taking, now having major dizzyness. Know due to lack of lexapro.

I had limited success with each one until I began taking Lexapro 20mg daily about 7 years ago.  The medication, along with EMDR therapy, literally gave me my life back.  For the first time in many years, I feel like what I would consider &quot;normal&quot;.  I have appropriate responses to life situations, without becoming paralyzed or anxious. I am told my personality has become a little &quot;flat&quot; ... but that could be because I was always running at warp speed before.  My only complaint would be with the high cost ... can hardly wait for the generic.

Death throw's an extra challenge in there.  I'm trying to stay strong, w/o my med's i believe i'd be dead.  Death is hard to deal with when you're depressed.

I have tried other medications to control my anxiety and depression, but had a lot of trouble with side effects.  Lexipro is the first medicine of this kind that I have taken and NOT had side effects with.  The only problem I have with this medicine is the cost.  Since I am uninsured now and there isn't a generic version available, it is very difficult to afford my medication.

And now that I'm weening off of it, I'm experiencing some very bad headaches and mood swings.  Overall, it works... but be prepared for a few side effects.

Wondered if anyone else has had this prescribed as well.

I had multiple fainting spells the first week I was on it. It makes me dehydrated to the point that my limbs tremble uncontrollably. I was drinking 4 liters of water a day and was constantly thirsty with a dry mouth. I went several weeks where I had INTENSE panic attacks, worse than I'd ever had before, upon waking up. I was constantly tired, often sleeping 18+ hours per day. My doctor was convinced I had mono, that it wasn't the Lexapro that was making me so exhausted, and refused to take me off until I had been on it for 6 months. Now I'm switching to Celexa, and I'm terrified of the side effects. My experience with Lexapro was the worst 6 months of my life.

The disconnect with society only lasted 10 days (similar to doing 3 shots of tequilla in a row) Second week was uncontrolable yawning and dry mouth. Sleep and drink lots of water. Third week was abdominal cramping. Milk of magnesia took care of that. Now I just have very vivid and bizzare dreams. Most are associated with Anxiety like being late or misplacing something. Every night is an adventure.

Add to that, A car accident a year ago. I don't know what I would do without Lexapro. The only problem I have is that I don't have insurance and its very difficult for me to afford my monthly prescriptions.

I have not had any side effects that I know of.  Very happy with this drug.  I tried to get off it a while back but I just couldn't do it.  So glad this drug helps me so much.

I have been taking this medication for 5+ years and it has helped tremendously. I have noticed my O.C.D creeping back in more and more recently. I ahve a feeling I am becoming immune to it. DO NOT MISS A DOSE. The migraines caused by missing a dose are unbearable. All and all a good medication for me.

Before that I was all stressed out and had high anxiety.  At first the doctor prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro.  While Lexapro didn't totally eliminate my anxeity it made it very manageable.  It allowed me to function well at work and school. I no longer had panic attacks, heart palpatations, eye twitching, insomnia or a general fear I was going to die.  After a few years I did up my dosage to 20 mg because of more stress.  The main thing was keeping my anxiety manageable, which Lexapro does for me.  This drug turned out to be a miracle for me and my family.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		2	5	1			5/13/2010 4:46:00 PM	I have been taking 10 mg for around 4 months.  I am having trouble with bloody noses and severly dry skin and being itchy from the dryness.  In my opinion this medication has not helped as much as I was hoping.  Sometimes I feel like it may have actually increased my anxiety some.  These are just my opinions.
Lexapro+Oral	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder		1	5	1			5/13/2010 4:33:00 PM	In my opinion I was hoping this medication would help me more.  When I first started taking it I noticed a cold/burning sensation in my nose and eyes, slight headache, and some stomach upset.  My axiety seemed to increase some, too.  After a few weeks this seemed to go away.  Now I am having very very dry and itchy skin.  I have also started having a bloody nose.  I cannot tell that it has helped much with my hand washing ocd.  I am taking 10 mg once a day and now I am not sure if I need to increase my dose or change to something else.

Started Lexapro with 20 mg and after a year went on 40 mg. Has never helped me like the Prozac did but I was on Prozac so long I guess I became &quot;immune&quot; to it. My doctor just today is weaning me off Lexapro and going to try me on Cymbalta. One bad side effect was loss of sexual desire. I could care less if I never had sex again. (My husband hasn't been very happy. Maybe HE needs Lexapro.)Other than that, I had no side effects; it just has not helped me. I've lost interest in everything that has ever meant anything to me - from my job to my personal life. I want to be the carefree, fun-loving person I have always been until the last few years.

Starting with a disconnect with society (like you just did 3 shots of Tequilla). Then, the uncontrollable yawning. Followed up by stomach cramping from constipation but, nothing that couldn't be handled with milk of magnesia.  My dreams at night are very vivid and most bizzare. Every night is an adventure that leaves me waking up saying, &quot;OK, what the heck was that all about?&quot; But nonetheless refreshed. By week 4 it was smooth sailing and worth it. Two thumbs up.

However, in the last 4 months or so I have been experiencing very odd bruising.  I know this is a side effect, but what can be done?  Should I have my regular doctor draw some coagulation studies?  Is there another medication I can take.? I dread going back to my &quot;old life&quot;!

I am finally again trying to be somebody instead of doubting myself and to top it all off I have been exercising so that also helps with making me feel so much better! Plus my husband has been noticing a great change in me. I think the whole thing about anti depressant you have to want to not be depressed in order for it to fully take affect you have to be the change within yourself! Because only you can make yourself truly happy.

I found out thru counseling that I have minor A/D/D issues also. Although I don't anyone claiming Lexapro helps with it, I feel it helped me.  I took the medication until my counselor and I agreed that I &quot;may not need it any longer&quot;. Gradual weening off of it was recommended but we misplaced the refill right before I deployed and had no choice but to go cold-turkey.  I was ok, with minor, if any, adverse side effects.  I would recommend giving this one a try if your Dr and/or counselor says so...

For three years my mother suffered from a fever of unknown origin. Tylenol,ibuprofin nothing could brak the fever. i took her to multiple doctors specialists. and talked her into several procedures including bone marrow biopsies and polyp removal in her sinuses to try and get rid of this debilitating fever,malaise, fatigue and weakness.she lost 30 punds and nearly died of dehydration.After the 20th dr said he coulnt help and she told me she was ready to pass and couldnt live like this anymore i looked lexapro up in a drug book and the symptoms she had were listed. she stopped taking lexapro and the fevers and other symptoms went away. no dr bothered to look up side effects of this med and my mother almost left us. this is not a common side effect. lexapro was the miracle drug for my own depression,i wouldnt be here now without it. just please be aware of what you are taking and possible side effects. we cant leave it all to the drs we must be our own advocates in our healthcare.  Lexapro is an effective treatment for most people. This message is out there in case anyone is suffering like my mother did and is searching for answers because the drs have let them down.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/4/2010 11:14:27 AM	I have been suffering from Anxiety/Depression all my life. It was impossible for me to feel happy even when nothing was going 'badly' in my life. Finally, I sought help and was prescribed Lexapro. The first week I would wake up with dry mouth, migraines, and felt nauseous. I stuck it out though, and the side effects subsided within a week. Now, I have been able to function and reason through my problems without all the anxiety that I previously attached to them. Instead of going through the motions of being 'normal', I actually feel good. It's not a wonder drug in that it takes away your problems, but it gives you the boost you need to rationalize and work through issues. I can honestly say this is one of the best decisions I've made for myself, and I will continue my treatment.

I was first perscribed Zoloft and was experiencing some side effects (headache, upset stomach) and I didn't know if it was working to help with my anxiety and depressive sypmtoms. Maybe a little I thought, but I just really wanted to stop feeling down and hard on myself.     So I switched to 20mg of Lexapro and it was something completely different.  It is amazing to understand what happens when you find the right medication that works for you.  I am feeling so much better and am thankful to be a happy person again.

Lexapro has completly changed my life for the good!I take 10mg each day. Upon starting the medication, I did vomit the first day and then felt nauseous each morning for about the first week. After that all nausea feelings went away.The 2 major side effects that I suffer most from with this medication are increased persperation and problems ejaculating. I sometimes have twitches, but usually right after I wake up. Sometimes concentrating is hard, especially when multi-tasking. Occasionally, I experience forgetfullness like walking into a room to get something and not remembering what it was when I get there.I have not experienced any issues with weiht gain, regular nausea, or night sweats. I actually feel that I get a better nights sleep since I have been using Lexapro. As mentioned, my persperation level has increased especially when I am active. (sports, exercising, etc.). Ejaculation has been prolonged and sometimes never, since I have started usage.It does not seem that alcohol consumption  intensifies the effect, but I only drink socially. My doctor said this would be the best medication for a person in my age group with the least amount of side effects and referred to it as a &quot;chill pill&quot;. Things that use to irritate me, seem to not bother me at all now. It just rolls right down my back.Prior to taking my first dose I read the reviews here on Web Md, and was a little hesitant and even scared about taking it. After the nausea and sick feeling I wanted to stop after the first few days and stuck it out. Give it time to get into your system and start working. It only took a week for me. Everyone around me that knows I take it can see a differnce in my personality. I went for about 3 years before I spoke with my doctor about anxiety issues. I could not imagine living like I previously did. Lexapro is the best!!! Highly recommend!

Have tried to stop (hoping to stop the weight gain) but the anxiety comes back within a week. So decided to be happy-fat over skinny bridezilla.

I have felt better than probably any time in my life.  I had a several year bout with anxiety and finally settled in with Lexapro after many years of trying to find good answers.  After settling into 5 mg per day about 3 years ago my life is great with one exception.  I have trouble with ejaculation during intercouse.  It is like I have trouble with concentration and when I think things couldn't get any better it just doesn't happen.  Of course, this is very frustrating for me.

I used to go to a &quot;dark place&quot; very frequently during my adult life.  Whenever I was happy, I was the life of the party.  I could always be social and entertaining if alcohol was used.  Now I can have fun without it.  My days are so much more under control. My marriage was threatened because of my unpredictable behaviors.  I would be gleeful one day, and overspend, then be withdrawn and silent for the next week.  I really believe that there is a chemical reason for the behaviors that lexapro controls.  The only negative is that since I have been taking the drug, I have been drinking beer more heavily than ever--almost daily.  Once I get started I cannot stop until bedtime.  I have a bit of a sexual dysfunction as well.  Sometimes it is difficult to maintain an erection.  I'm not sure if it is from the medication or the drinking.  I wonder if the medication enhances the addictive behavior regarding the alcohol, and if so, would another SSRI possibly work as well with less side effects?  I know I should talk to my physician about this, but I am ashamed to talk about the addiction. Even so, my days are so much better, I feel contented. Little things that used to bother me, just don't now.  It's funny, but if I forget to take the lexapro, I can really feel a difference in my mood and interactions with others.

Side effects were: headaches, sweating, nausea (take with food),short term memory loss (felt like scatterbrain sometimes), insomnia if taken at night, and sleepiness if taken early in the morning. So, mid day worked a little better but still with the other side effects.

I feel &quot;lighter,&quot; less anxious, more relaxed and in control of my emotions, thoughts, and actions.  No unpleasant side effects for me; although I find that taking Lexapro upon rising in the morning is most effective for me.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	4/14/2010 2:45:39 PM	I havent been on this med in 2 years, and i only took it for about a week (i was prescribed it at the hospital right after I had my son for post partium depression). Anyways, they started me out taking 1/2, once everyother day for 4 days, then take 1 a day (to build it up in my system). Well, two days after i started taking a whole pill, i guess it built up enough in my system because i had a MAJOR reaction to it. My husband thought that i was high or something (and i felt it), i couldn't take care of my week old son, i felt terrible and just wanted to die. We couldn't figure out what was wrong with me, but luckily my mother-in-law was also on it and had kept the paper explaining the effects of an allergic reaction. I was shaking uncontrolably, felt as though i couldn't breath, wasn't able to hold myself up, it was bad. Anyways, my hasband took me to the hospital, they left me in the waiting room for 2 hours and i just got worse. We ended up leaving to go to another hospital, and on the way drop our son of to his sister. She called the ambulance to meet us at her house, and when we pulled up, i got out of the car and ended up falling on the ground (basically blacked out). The ambulance showed up right after and put me in and gave me that epie pen shot. It helped instantly. Anyways, i'm not writing this to say that it's a bad med (it worked wonders for my mother-in-law), I'm just writing this to warn people to watch out for a reaction and to get to the hospital immediatally if you feel off like that. I hope no one has to go thru that pain, but i do know that it happens, so be careful. I hope this helps at least one person.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Dee, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/14/2010 10:59:39 AM	This medication was so effective and eased my stress level along with decreasing my anxiety.  I have social anxiety and panic attacks although I no longer use this medication because I do not need it.  If I start to feel anxiety coming on I will request to be put back on this medication.  When I am on this medication it is for a few months out of a year then I no longer need it but another reason I dont stay on it is because it is very expensive and I already take enough medication.

This medicine has been great in helping me deal with them. Of course, like with any other medication, you have to take it for a while before it gets into your system and starts to work for you. Take it as recommended by your doctor and be patient and you will see results.

I have been on it for 6 years. My doctor diagnosed me with a seratonin deficiency. She suggested that I take 1/2 a pill for the first week as it could cause nausea. That worked for me. I never have had sexual side effects either and I think it's because I take it at night. 10mg dose made me tired all the time, so I asked my doctor if I could just take 1/2 a pill. It controls my depression and I am not tired from it. The one thing I do notice is that I am not as motivated to do things as I used to be. I don't know if it's my age or the pills. All I know is I used to cry about everything and now I'm a much happier, easy-going person. It's a great medicine.

Wonderful at first!, I was way more easy-going. got along better with my husband, no longer got upset over all the little things or brooding over bullshit. The BEST part was I was no longer screaming at my 6 and 4 yr old kids(still hate myself about that), i stopped losing my temper over nothing, slowed down to enjoy them and stop demanding perfection   and precision  from my children. Then I also stopped having orgasms and no longer wanted sex at all really. Still loved the intimacy but could care less about intercourse. My husband said,&quot;oh, come on, its a small price to pay to be happier&quot; (he wanted me to continue)&quot;your so much easier to get along with, its been great!&quot; Yeah great for him, but it sucked for me to have my head in the clouds yet dead from the waist down at 40. I dont know I still wrestle with going back on to be a better mom, thats my real only goal. Yet my marriage was like living with a buddy cute, but NO interest in sex. Husband complained I was so &quot;asexual, its sad&quot; yet pushed me to stay on drug anyway to be &quot;happier&quot; Im disapointed it didnt seem a fair trade off, im too young to not want to feel sexual, but my kids are growing fast and I dont want them to only remember an uptight mean mommy. Still contemplating going back on. BTW had no bad side effects going off, I tapered well.

It put strain on all my relationships and life in general. The first week of taking Lexapro I had problems with being extremely tired and just sluggish but now, just a week later, I feel GREAT! Obviously these kinds of medications work differently with each person, but I would strongly recommend it. Everyone who knows I am on can tell a huge difference, and I can too. Another great thing about it is that despite common rumors, it doesn't turn you into an emotionless zombie. It just returns you to how you would feel when you're happy and full of life. I'm really please with Lexapro and hope that everyone who tries it has similar results to mine. Good luck.

It is thus far the only AD/PD med I would consider trying again if warranted, simply because it had almost no untoward side effects.

It helped til I could not function sexually.  Which meant a lot to me.  Went off it, and then kept pushing doctor and they did a blood test found out had low testosterone level.  Started injections of testosterone and still depressed and down,  went back on lexapro only at 10 mg instead of the previous 20 mg.  Feeling so much better and actually getting sexually active again!   Still trying to figure best time to take lexapro,  night or am?  Have insomia problems at night.

This stuff worked great until I couldn't orgasm (are you kidding me?), had severe short-term memory problems, vicious headaches related to any protein I ate, intense homicidal thoughts, GERD, hernia, osteoporosis and soft, mushy, girly skin. So I got off of it and then my head felt like it almost exploded. Literally I had this horrible, intense pressure inside my head and I got numerous dilated blood vessels and red dots all over my body but especially on my face and left side of my neck. I also got intense chest pains and burning skin (pure torture). My left leg wouldnt stop shaking. My left eye muscles kept twitching continuously. I spoke rapidly. I couldnt concentrate on the simplest things and make any healthy decisions. I had severe insomnia, paranoia, severe inner tension, severe restlessness, severe fatigue and my depression and anxiety were now 10 times worse than before I ever took this stuff. I have never had any of these symptoms before I took this drug. I followed exactly my doctors instructions about how to take it and how to get off of it but it didnt make any difference. When I told him about all the withdrawal symptoms he gave me the usual stupid doctor CYA response, it must be something else and I have never heard of this. What a moron. I just got off this stuff and two days later my head explodes and his idiotic logic is that something else out of the blue descended on me to cause these problems. Is this the best doctors have? You cant be serious!!! I am better off taking cocaine than this stuff.

I was prompted by a marriage counselor to go to my doctor and request drugs for my OCD symptoms (checking, intrusive sad thoughts, previous eating disorders as a teen and heavy drinking-probably perpetuated by my fathers suicide in 1981 while he was on imipramine and numerous other psych meds)  I went to my husbands pcp who never met me before.  He gave me a depression self-test and diagnosed me with depression and anxiety, and then prescribed me Lexapro and Rozerem since I had a terrible insomnia problem.  He also decided it was a good idea to start kissing me and grabbing me in his office.    The Lexapro did such a good job getting me up and doing things, lots of things, but unfortunately, I believe it also may have made me nervous because it raised my blood pressure from its usual 120/80 to 145/110.  I was really up, up, up.   I could drink twelve shots of straight liquor and still be walking around for hours.  This was the busiest year of my life.  I managed to get 2 DUIs  4 drunk in publics and an involuntary commit for suicide, attend 2 rehabs, a hypnotherapist, weekly ASAP programs, all while working full time.  During the course of my medical treatment,  I was seen by 3 psychiatrists, 4 doctors, and numerous counselors.  Most of the follow up treatment involved numerous more drugs, anti-buse, campral, and Buspar.  All of which I had to stop taking  due to side effects such as full body tremors and falling down.   Finally, after the second DUI which I was also charged with a felony for pinching a police officers butt, I decided maybe I should stop taking the Lexapro b/c I seemed to have developed some obsession with alcohol and I could see I was also becoming delusional.  So, while in jail, I requested no more medication for 1 week and was able to fully withdraw from Lexapro, although the depression side effects of the withdrawal lasted about three months.  I met

Then I shuffle my way through the day and come home, to take a nap. Wake up for dinner, then sleep. And repeat. It's shortened my days into mostly sleep and eating. I rarely do what I need to do, anymore. I've have to change the dosage numerous times, and still ineffective.

And short term memory loss.  I have been taking this drug for over 3 years.  I needed it to survive severe grief.  My son and daughter-in-law decided to never let me and my husband see our grandchild again.  I was unable to perform tasks, couldn't be around happy people, and I couldn't look or go anywhere my grandchild would like. The grief was unbelievable.  I was taking care of him 24/7. My daughter-in-law is a borderline personality. And my son did anything to make her happy.Lexapro helped me function.  However, now I am experiencing inability to focus normaly and my memory scares me. I wake up in the middle of the night regularly.  Sex is history.  I can't wait to get off it now that I am coming back to life.I have gone to court and won in 2 states and have been visiting my grandson in Texas.

I had an episode where my heart was pounding and I was twitching and experiencing black outs and having to use the restroom frequently.  Before this all started I thought the drug was helping. I know these side effects are rare but for someone who is taking this for anxiety and have this happen increases anxiety issues greatly, and now makes me afraid to take any other medications.  I hope this medication helps you and you do not have a bad reaction, I just advise you to know all of the possible side effects before taking this drug.

I was also told that it would make me a happy camper.  Instead, it reduced my nightly sleep from a solid 3 - 4 hour stretch to maybe 1 - 2 hours a night!  After a week, the total loss of appetite and inability to eat or drink ANYTHING (everything tasted like cardboard and the smell of food repulsed me), along with the hand tremor that developed, forced me to stop taking it!  My life had quickly become worse that I could have imagined.  I had NO ability to focus on ANYTHING.  I had no emotions.  The sleep deprivation was killing me.  It took over a week for my body to fully recover from the side effects.  Then I was told to try Celexa.  That produced increased insomnia, only now instead of feeling on a caffeine high, like I had with Lexapro, I felt like when you have a stomach flu.  I tossed and turned and was unable to even rest in bed.  Now the doctor wants me to try Zoloft.  I am losing patience!  These drugs are making me think that my &quot;normal&quot; depression is better than all the side effects of using medication!

I never knew that it wasn't normal to worry so much.  I thought I was just a worry wart and that not sleeping due to worry about money and health and what-if's was normal.  Finally, when my son became very ill, I mentioned it to my doctor and he put me on Lexapro.  My life changed.  I still worry about things from time to time but the difference is I worry when it is appropriate, not for no reason.

It has been a HUGE help with the anxiety and i have no depression anymore! I was taking effexor which helped some but after a year of use, the Effexor no longer helped! I have been on Lexapro for 2 yr.s now and it still has the same effect! I have had some symptoms though. A huge decrease in sexual drive is interfering with my relationship! I'm torn on what is more important, my sanity or my relationship! Its 50/50. I am not able to funtion properly with out it!

I started taking it 3 months ago when I was diagnosed with depression since then my life has drastically improved. It took 2-3 weeks to get the full benefits of Lexapro but it was worth the wait.

I found it works very well to relieve anxiety however, I was not expecting the significant weight gain that came with it...I gain 25-30 lbs. without significantly changing my diet. I did not know that the Lexapro was causing my weigth gain and would exercise and practically starve myself to lose the weight.  I could not understand why it was not working until my doctor said that it was a long term side effect that impacts 25% of patients.  I wish I had known because for 4 years I have attributed my weight gain to laziness or lack of discipline (even though I maintained a healthy diet and exercised regularly).  I am looking forward to either stopping Lexapro or switching to another anti-depressant.  The weight gain has affected my self esteem significantly!! I am not comfortable in my skin.

After a week I could tell a significalt difference. All the above had left. I was &quot;out of the basement&quot;. After three weeks I now realise this condition has been on and off with me for many years. I'm BEGINNING TO LAUGH AND ENJOY things I haven't in a long time. If I do not improve any further I can live with where i an at. For me, the anxiety and depression are gone.

I'm also on Vicodin, Valium, and Abilify. Don't know which one is causing me to lose the words I want to say so easily. I just feel really stupid on this stuff.

First of all, it makes my heart race really fast which just cant be good. It gives me an overall feeling of being more anxious not less. No weight gain, decrease in sex drive and difficulty having orgasms have been some of the side effects that I have experienced. I also had some really vivid strange dreams and typically I don't remember my dreams at all. I take 5mg once a day.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Zoloft Fan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	3/17/2010 4:18:43 PM	It made me deathly ill and worsened all the depression symptoms.  The nausea and inability to get off the couch or out of bed was unbearable.  Had to even stuggle to force myself to complete a routine task, like brush my teeth.  I had a horrible chemical smell in my nose and down my throat.  Also had wierd vivid dreams and burning feeling on hands and feet.  I live in a prone position and was sleeping about 16 hours per day.  Let's don't forget to mention the diahrea. Dr. started me on 5 mgs. daily and then was to increase to 10 mgs. after one week.  The day I was to increase to the 10 mgs. I wanted to die, not due to depression, but due to being so sick and getting physically sicker every day.  I instead went to the emergency doctor on call (it was during the 2009 holiday season) and he placed me on Zoloft.  I did not continue to get sicker each day, but a tiny better.  It took over three weeks for all of the Laxapro side effects to subside.  Seems my body is allergic to it and taking it made me feel as if I was slowly poisioning myself.  Even when someone says the name of the medicine, I get nauseated.  Doing way way way better on the Zoloft for the present.

The only side affect that concerns me is the loss of sex drive, it is putting a terrible strain on my relationship with my long-term boyfriend. He finally understands that it is the medicine that is killing my libido, however I still feel bad, which is making my depression spike up again.

I felt very numb during sex, as if I were under novacaine and a dentist was working on me. It regulated my moods a little too well as I was not even able to cry during a sad movie or be excited over anything. I am switched to Remeron, but don't like that either. I got my orgasms back, but gained over 10 pounds. Trying something else now.

I would worry about deadlines for bills and worry if my kids were ok at school. It was driving me literally crazy. My doctor changed me over from Celexa to Lexapro and I can see a huge difference. I am happy and not worrying about little things anymore. I will never fully be cured, but it is nice to know there is a medication out there that makes it alittle less painful.

But I began have anxiety and panic attacks after starting the drug. I became increasingly paranoid and manic. Didn't help me at all. All those symptoms are in the warnings so I guess I'm not the first, but I would research on your own very thouroughly before staring this one.

I took the first dose at night before going to bed and immediately felt calmness. The next morning I awoke refreshed and went through the entire day with extreme calmness. I forgot what it is like to feel this calm! Even went through my first career-oriented interview (I'm a soon-to-be college grad) and was EXTREMELY calm and content. My mood has gone from gloomy to neutral/happy in  just two days. Side effects for me were nausea and (embarrassing to admit) a tingly sensation in my penis. Other than that, thus far it is working and I am hoping it will continue to do so!

I had to do something and had a panic attack in front of everyone. I remember thinking &quot;How do you breath and speak at the same time.&quot; Every time I had to do this task, I got scared. Three weeks ago, I thought I was dying. I went to doctor and told me it as panic disorder. They gave me Lexapro (5mg) and Xanax. I took it and fell asleep for 14 hours. I took Xanax (0.5mg) all weekend and the task was normal. I started taking Lexapro on a Friday and Tuesday realized could not climax. Frustrating. I stopped. Doctor gave me Paxil (10mg). I took it 3 days and stopped. It is now a week later and still can't climax. Is this normal? Hopefully this side effect will go away. I hope it is not permanent. Once I get rid of all side effects, I will try just the Xanax for the few times I need it and hopefully there will be no side effects on this. I can't believe taking a drug for such a short time frame could do this.

I would say that the only negative is that I think about food alot and am unable to control my eating sometimes. I was very thin but have gained 10-12 pounds and I can't seem to get it off.

I was diagnosed and treated with Lexapro in 2003. It has changed my life. I was only able to hold down a job for the most three years...mood swings would effect my preformance at work relationships as well as my personal relationships. Lexapro helped me think clearer and with less emotion. My life would have been profoundly different if I had been given Lexapro earlier in my life. I feel calm level headed and never agonize over how I have acted. The only side effects that might be going on is that I am much quieter. I feel my short term memory could be effected as well as a slowed response to recalling information.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	3/4/2010 9:20:33 PM	Have been taking this medicine for 4 months now and I am extremely satisfied with the results. I was having severe stress with my job and was having a hard time coping with every day events. My temper was quick and I always seemed to be mad or in a bad mood. After taking this medicine for 1 week I noticed a complete change. I was not irritated by all life's little problems. My mood was much better also. My wife has noticed a great change in my demeanor also and doesn't want me to get off the medicine ever. The only side effect I have noticed was a decrease in libido. I have a difficult time reaching orgasm during sex and my sex drive seems to be way down, which my wife is enjoying. Overall, this has been a wonderful drug that has helped me cope with my job and life again. The side effects were worth the peace of mind I have now.

I began to have them almost everyday when I was in my teen years and I was afraid to tell anyone because I thought I was dying. I finally worked up the nerve to go to the doctor and tell him my symptoms and frustrations. After a number of test I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and given Lexapro. Thank God for this drug, it has worked so well I rarely get attacks and when I do they are extremely mild. I take 10mg daily and I finally can function normally.

My doctor prescribed it for repeated anxiety attacks. The first night I felt fine for awhile. Somewhere around five hours after taking the medication I had a strange sensation in my head followed by a hot flash and shaking. The second night I had repeat hot flashes, nausea, and was unable to fall asleep until 5 a.m. The third night I felt awful--almost constant hot flashes, severe nausea (I literally just laid down on the floor), muscle spasms,headaches, and I felt close to passing out. During the days on this medication I couldn't go without a nap. I was almost constantly yawning and couldn't focus on anything. I was only on it for three days and still had withdrawl symptoms (muscle spasms, headaches).

I can concentrate more on a current situation rather than worrying about something that is to happen next week. It's helped me in my day-to-day lifestyle and I feel happier and more carefree. During the three weeks that it took to adjust, I felt dizzy and had insomnia, but my doctor told me to lower the dosage and continue taking it. Once I was adjusted to it I was very pleased with the medication. It's made my life a whole lot better.

I have a family history of mental illness, so my doctor believed wholeheartedly that my serotonin levels were imbalanced in my brain.  I was skeptical initially in taking Lexapro, but I began taking the 10 mg tablet daily by taking half a pill at first then the complete pill.  After a month of taking Lexapro 10 mg tablets, I FEEL ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!!  I have always been a woman of faith, but joy is restored and I have a clear outlook.  My psychiatrist has practiced medicine 35 years, and she knows her field extremely well.  With God, therapy, a loving support system, and my medicine, I will be okay.

This drug has helped me immensely.  I am not as edgy and my mood has improved beautifully. I could not go on throughout my day without this drug. Huge improvement, my family is also pleased with the change in me.

It nearly put me out of my mind! I am a nervous person that worries too much, muscle tension and occasional anxiety. First day I shook horribly, diareah, confusion, cloudy, same the second day, third day I felt irritable with fits of &quot;rage&quot; and fourth I nearly lost my mind. I hallucinated and felt like I had snapped, severe confusion and disorientation - had to go emergently to the Dr. and she gave me a shot of valium to put me out. Had to take off the next day from work to recover. Horrible drug - remember everyone had different body chemistry - listen to your instincts, I wish I had!

After my hip rebroke from the original battery in my middle years I became non-functioning. I have taken Wellbutrin, which killed my sex drive and made my heart pound. Prozac made me loopy. Wellbutrin began to help within days with a 10 mg dose. I now sustain on 30, and have a GOOD life! While I ended up partially handicapped from a botched hip replacement. my attitude is very good, I am happy and cheerful, and enjoy everything. I did not gain weight. It does make me sleepy and not quite as alert, but I take that over panicking any day. I am kind and play with my children, able to deliniate issues FAR more quickly instead of being floored by them and take a plan of action. My short term memory has taken a hit, so I work on that. I am 49 and a mother of 4, including a toddler. I can remain calm when things get stressful, and as a result can move myself into a healthier place mentally or physically if need be. I can quell the panic before it begins. If someone needs IMMEDIATE results, I recommend this med highly. I could work again, and enjoy life. Sex is affected some, but again - it's way better than panic attacks, and I can rein in my thoughts and feelings so that I don't over=react.

This medication left me feeling very over stimulated.  I actually went to the emergency room, knowing full well that I was having a panic attack but unable to make it stop.  The ER doc said that I had a reaction to the medication that made me hypersensitive.  I know a lot of people on it and it works wonders for them, it just didn't suite me.  I'm on a low dose of Zoloft now and feel great!

He diagnosed me as functionally depressed and told me if I was his brother he would have already been shoving this down my throat quite awhile back as I had been trying to deal with matters on my own.Told me it would be about 5-7 days to get the full benefits from Lexapro and my wife would probably notice its effects first. That was incorrect, after about 3 days my mood greatly lightened up, no detrimental side effects noticed.  I am now functioning as I used to, calmly with plans meshing in my head as they should, getting more than 2-3 hours of sleep at night from not being able to shut down my thoughts as to everything going on in our lives at the current time.

Also helped alot with my constant aches and pains all over.  However, I have gained 50lbs in a year while taking this (not good) and have no libido. I also want to sleep more, and sometimes have trouble sleeping through the night.

I've been on it for about four months now and it's worked wonders for me. The only thing I had trouble with was the nausea in the first few days of taking the pill, and insomnia within the first week but the side affects subsided and the medication has definitely done its job.

I take this at night and some nights I have sweated so badly that I have puddles of sweat dripping from around my eyes.  As a 38 yr old woman who has had a partial hysterectomy I thought it was early menopause but I now know the sweating is from this medication. My dr originally put me on anti-depressants to help with my pain as I have arthritis in my spine and fybromialgia. I have been taking Lexapro for 1 1/2 yrs. It worked well to help battle the depression, but I dont see that its doing much to break the cycle of my pain. I am also not happy with the total lack of sexual desire. I hope this helps anyone who may be suffering as I am.

It made me feel &quot;nothing instead of pain&quot;  I would come right and out and say to my husband, I don't care.  It didn't matter what time he got home, I wasn't worried about where he was or whether he was with someone else, I just didn't care.  And I liked not caring instead of hurting all the time.  BUT THEN I WOKE UP:   40LBS HEAVIER!!! That I did care about.  You talk about depression.  HELLOOOOO!!  So now I am on wellburtrin sr (the generic) and it's working great.  I lost and didn't care that I lost my &quot;sex-drive&quot; with Lexapro also, and that is back with wellbutrin sr.  If you like not feeling and you need to gain some weight, this is the one.

The Doc increased my dose to 30mg because the anxiety level was increasing after one month. I absolutely LOVE this medicine. It has made me feel so much happier and laid back about everything. No more anxiety or panic attacks and I sleep very well. I feel very calm. In the beginning I yawned a lot, felt tired,and had zero ability to have an orgasim. But after the first month I no longer have these side effects. It does take more effort to have an orgasim but it's worth it to have the peace in my life. I highly recommend this medicine

I feel great.  A little cloudy at first but I can handle a lot more that life throws at me now! I feel like it hasn't taken away from my personality and has made me a lot more patient and calm. Just hang in there the first few weeks. It will work!

I had been depressed for as long as I can remember. Suicide was part of my daily life, literaly. I saw doctor after doctor before actually being diagnosed properly. I am a firm believer in prayer and natural remedy's, but as the year's passed the depression worsened, so I contiued to seek help. I was told so many times, &quot;There is nothing wrong with you&quot;.  I finally was diagnosed and started on Lexapro 10mg. It took 3 to 4 weeks before my depression started to subside. I have tried to go off of it on my own, and the emotional roller coaster would start again. I have my life back, and I am very greatful and thankful. I can't believe it took so long to be diagnosed and be able to be happy and enjoy life. It litarally saved my life.

It can cause bruising and bleeding.  I think that's what happened with the Excedrin - you may have had some stomach bleeding.

My doctor prescribed Lexapro and I'm feeling like myself again! My energy is back as well as my motivation! My anxiety is down so i've been able to rely less on my lorazepam. The only side effect I've experienced from this medication was i felt lightheaded the first week i took it, but that faded. Now i just have a muscle tightening in my jaw (similar to lock jaw but less severe) This lasts anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or so. But I'll take that any day compared to the symptoms of SAD!

You should slowly come off of this med as it effects the chemical levels in the brain. This is probably the reason you are feeling the way you do. Each person is different and has different feelings of w/drwls. Talk with your Doctor.

After being on the drug for 8 months with no results, it took over 5 months to get off the stuff. It caused major veritgo when I would go without a dose. This made it really hard when I was trying to stop taking it. I had to gradually step down but the vertigo didn't stop until 3 weeks after my final dose.

I am not really a depressed person, just anxious, so I can't say if it does anything for depression or not. I will say that it caused me to have depression because of the side effects. I gained 40 lbs in less than 3 months, I lost all my sex drive and ability to climax and I was always tired....all the time. Not just sleepy, but exhausted feeling. I went off the Lexapro and it took nearly a year for my sex drive to return and it has returned, but not to what it was before I took it. I still have not been able to lose the weight even though I exercise an hour a day and jog 5 miles a day. It just will not come off and I do not eat that much. My shrink says it changed the make up of my motabolism and I may not get it back again. Great! I have gotten energy back again. I am not tired anymore and I require only about 5 hours of sleep a night now and I feel fine. One really good thing for me was that Lexapro had no ill effects coming off of it. I just weened myself off by taking a pill every other day, then one every few days then one a week and then none. I could not even tell a difference at all. I am on no medication now. I had gone on the generic brand of Wellbutrin and that was a horror story. Worse drug ever. So I am winging it alone now and doing fine. I do keep Xanax on hand in case of emergencies, but so far so good.All in all, Lexapro is probably a good drug for a lot of people, just be aware that you may gain weight, you may experience loss of libido and you may feel tired all the time. But that was just what happen to me and we are all different.

Went from 10mg-30mg. Last Friday, I decided to stop. 1st couple of days weren't bad. Today, I had to come home because my body was &quot;tingling&quot; all over. I feel queasy for 15 mins in the morning right around the time I would take the meds. Did anyone else go through this?  How long did it last? I'm not depressed anymore &amp; I don't want to go back on but the w/drawing has been horrible.

I feel that this product would have worked good for me. Except: While on it for less than 10 days, I had a Migraine and took Excedrine. Within 2hrs felt a sharp throbing/pulsing pain in my stomach between the Breast-Bone and Navel. The pain felt like someone was ringing out a towel (but my stomach was the towel). It would hurt for about 5-15 seconds, then it would completely stop for 10-15 minutes. Made worse by eating.I've never felt anything like this before.Since I've stopped it, it took about 3 days and now I have no pain at all.Not sure if it was the Lexapro or the Excedrine Mixed with it.

Felt ok most of the time over the first few months but it's been hell ever since. Constant feeling of being on edge, severe anxiety, brain fog, tremors 24/7, mood swings, zaps, fatigue, irritability, the works. Tried to taper off this summer but went way too quickly. The month I was off was like something I've never experienced in my life. Never before contemplated suicide before this drug experience. Unbearable anxiety and depressive spells came harder than ever. Felt absolutely poisened. Went back on 10mg and am currently taking a break from weaning which I plan on doing over a long period of time. This drug has at times totally stolen everything I ever knew about myself away from me. No emotion, no sense of humor, no personality. Absolutely hell. These drugs should only be used as a last resort, and even then, it's sketchy. There are FAAAAAAAR better ways to combat anxiety and depression that are side effect free and actually cure the problems. These drugs only mask, and they are handed out like candy.Reconsider your approach to these pills guys! You're not solving anything and you're setting yourself for hell down the road. Societies &quot;pill popping&quot; approach to treating has to stop, because not only is it bankrupting this country, it's putting thousands and thousands of people through hell.

Lexapro+Oral	Major Depressive Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/8/2010 9:25:00 AM	Was skeptical about going on an antidepressant to begin with as I am a sufferer of panic disorder and everything seems to freak me out, but once I stuck with it I was greatly benefitted. The benefits outweigh any side effects (which were almost none at all) and I am so happy that I have stuck with it! Has seriously changed my life. I'm no longer a prisoner of my own home and a lot of my anxiousness about situations has subsided. My relationship with family/friends/boyfriend has improved ten-fold as I am not constantly in a state of fear and can be more relaxed and happy around them. I recommend this drug to anyone suffering from depression, ocd, panic disorder, or any anxiety related disorders! Lexapro is truly a lifesaver.
Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	2/7/2010 7:44:26 PM	I was on Lexapro for about a year for anxiety attacks. It worked very well while I was on it and my panic attacks have yet to come back. I will warn those trying this drug: this is habit forming. Ask your doctor to ween you off slowly. Do not skip taking these pills, you will definitely feel the withdrawal. I forgot to pick up my prescription once and was manic depressive and suffered dizziness and headaches from missing doses.
Lexapro+Oral	Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	2/7/2010 2:25:06 AM	Took it for PMDD.  Worked alright in the beginning, then started to not work as well.  Started getting Hives nightly, my blood pressure went up, I've been dealing with extreme dizziness for 4 weeks to the point that I've missed school for multiple days, and can't study when I'm dizzy!  I also am tired, but can't sleep!  That is a really annoying combination, to be exaughsted and completely unable to sleep.

And I had alot of the side effects such as nausea, weights loss, and dizziness. Overall, though its worth being on it.

I went from 10mg to 15mg with 150mg of Wellbutrin - Lex makes me sleepy (I could sleep for 17 hrs at a time AND go back to bed an hr later &amp; sleep for another 17hrs no problem!) so my Doc put me on the Wellbutrin which has counteracted the sleepiness. My sex drive is almost entirely gone, I have severe hoarseness but that is it - I haven't gained any weight - I also can't have even a sip of alcohol - beer, wine, vodka - nothing at all w/o throwing up. After not knowing what was wrong for almost half my life the almost total loss of my sex drive is a very small price to pay for happiness. I would recommend.

Within the first month of starting Lexapro, I felt a million times better. I highly recommend this medicine! The only side effect I've experienced is insomnia, but I now take sleeping pills which helped stop the insomnia. I feel great!

Stopped each because of head zaps and dizzyness. I've been on Lexapro 10 mg for almost 5 months.  The only side effect is insominia.  I turn out the light at 11:00 at lay awake until 1 or 2 - which is a distraction at work.  also have night sweats but that could be due to menopause.  I would recomment Lexapro above Zoloft and Paxil but i'm really not certain that it is helping be that much.  I feel okay - but still have anxiety at the thought of traveling, vacations or doing anything out of my routine.  I'm still not thrilled over anything in life and don't have any great highs - but no great lows either.  All and all - i don't know what i think.  I know before taking Lexapro i decided that once i started, i would not stop.  The withdrawls from Paxil and Zoloft were both very debilitating and i'm afraid to go through that again.   I will stay with Lexapro - and hope i continue to do better and feel more interested and excited about life.  Good luck to you too.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/29/2010 9:45:10 PM	Worked great for me and had to slowly wean myself off due to a pregnancy. Even though I gradually got off of it the effects were dramatic.I would love to go back on it because it's been hard to be happy about my life even with the first baby on the way. Although some say they have gained weight while taking Lexapro I have experienced the opposite and actually lost weight. The only problem was it made me exhausted. But the extra sleep didn't hurt .:-)

It took time to work on my brain.  Anxiety decreased (had quit smoking at the same time). Brief suicidal thoughts in the beginning. Continued taking for months (10Mg). Felt much better over time. Made the mistake of not taking.  Had severe headaches, nights sweats, nausea. Am back taking it again, just renewed prescription. I am in therapy, for anxiety (highly recomend). No coffee, cutting back on sugar. Its been a year without the cigs, and taking the drug. It works for me, but need to take it daily (an hour or two before bedtime).side effects: occasional night sweats, some nausea, loose stool, occasional headaches when dosage is changed.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/28/2010 10:10:10 PM	Lexapro has been wondeful for me. It's helped with me with depression (why I started taking it), mood swings, anxiety, and panic attacks. I still have some issues with my ocd, but it's a whole lot better than it used to be. The only side effect I have is that it makes me sleepy and yawn a lot for about an hour after taking it, then I'm fine.

I took the first pill and threw up a few hours later.Felt really weak and loopy. Then my anxiety level shot up and I had diarrhea all day, felt so depressed and couldn't get off the couch for days. I had to take 2 Klonopins just to keep my body from trembling from anxiety. Stopped it immediatly. Then I went back a few days later and started with 1/4 of the 10mg, and had major anxiety and diarrhea again. This pill is no good to me. I'm gonna try to go back to Celexa.
Lexapro+Oral	Other	MizerbleFuqtard, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	35-44	1/26/2010 8:07:31 PM	Started at 5mg in AM for social anxiety &amp; minor depression.  Within 1.5 hours I was feeling euphoric, which lasted a few days.  For about 10 weeks I felt like I had an armor and could deal with any social situation, then the armor started deteriorating.  A couple of triggers later I spiraled into a major I DONT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING depression.  I felt I would rather die than deal with the holidays and my birthday.  Doctor increased the dose to 10mg two weeks ago.  That combined with a long over-due visit with my therapist snapped me out the funk.Now I'm back on track and more in touch with my needs and desires, healthier (increased) sense of entitlement, and the anti-criticism armor is back defending me against both internal and external, real and imagined, criticism. ...and yes I do take credit for making positive changes in my life.  A little medical help doesn't hurt!Side effects - euphoria, slight intestinal discomfort (couldn't tell when I was actually hungry), facial muscle tension, hot flashes, delayed orgasm (actually a good thing), increased physical endurance (probably a result of sleeping better and eliminating self doubt)

I have been on it for 3 years due to anxiety disorder.  I didn't gain any weight from it and I went off of it with no side effects when I got pregnant.  I used to have a nervous tick in my right eye when I spoke to people I didn't know.  That was gone within a month. I don't get antsy and fidgety anymore and I can relax in a crowd. My subconscious yelling at me for what I did 10 years ago finally subsided. I was borderline anti-social.  I love this medication it has change my life for the best and I don't ever plan on going off of it unless my insurance makes me. My insurance would not cover this drug for about 6 months and I went off and changed to Zoloft and another drug that were totally ineffective. That time I had no real side effects either that I could blame on Lexapro.

I have what has only recently been categorized as Bipolar Depression. I am bipolar but my main symptoms are depression. I have brief bouts of mania but overall am mostly depressed. This medicine works rather well for the depression; however, my mania/rage is not very well contained. I have made diet/behavoiral/lifestyle changes to compensate for this and my life is now pretty well balanced. It does take some time before you are adjusted and see satisfactory results(6 months-1 year). After so many years on it, I am noticing that I have gotten &quot;ditzy&quot; and forgetful, but that is still better than constant suicide attempts and crying nonstop. I was an extremely detailed and almost ocd person before and now my standards of organization and scheduling are more lax. Still, better than the alternatives...

He works with a doctor who treats women for breast cancer and she says the first thing patients do when they come into her office is to throw away their Premarin or any and all female hormones and start on Lexapro for their menopausal symptoms.  She says, &quot;female hormomes cause breast cancer&quot;.  I tried 10 mg first and felt this was too much.  My doctor said, &quot;half it&quot; so I did and I am one happy camper.  I was flashing all day long before.   I mentioned this to my OB/GYN doc the other day and I could tell he thinks this is for depression but when I tried to explain, he cut me off.  So sad for those taking cancer causing female hormones because this is the greatest remedy for hot flashes that ever came down the pike!  Spread the word, save your girlfriends!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Maria, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/24/2010 9:42:25 AM	I started Lexipro at 10 mg few weeks ago. The first week  I had pretty severe headaches, trouble sleeping, dry mouth and a 'loopy' feeling. A colleague of mine, who was also on this medication, told me to hang in. I listened and am now feeling  great. Lexipro has  taken the edge off. It has not changed my basic personality but I feel better able to cope and deal with tough situations. I have a significant family history of depression. My father committed suicide and my grandfather suffered from what they called back in the day a nervous breakdown. I was resistant in the past to taking medication but when I was hit recently with depression where all I wanted to do was sleep and had to drag myself to work, I knew I couldn't just snap out of it. So far so good.

We had tried Celexa and Prozac before this. I had no beginning side-effects with this medication and for the last two years it had helped calm me down and it helped greatly reduce my levels of anxiety, which were through the roof before I started taking medication. The only two things I hate about this medication are these: One, it is ridiculously expensive. $90.00 for a months supply. And two, I have been severely affected by the side-affect known as Anorgasma. I have had no interest in sex while I have been on this medication. It has  helped calm me down, but it has also calmed everything else, which is not something I can live with for the rest of my life. Especially since my husband and I have only been married for 1 1/2 years.

The only problem I have had with this drug is taking it with other medications. I take fioricets almost daily due to severe migraines and along with the lexapro i begin to feel very dizzy, lightheaded, and I easily feel my heartbeat. Also it makes it difficult to breathe. The depression is gone, but now its difficult to maintain my migraines. But... the depression is gone at least.

Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/19/2010 4:16:45 PM	I am 25 &amp; have had bad panic attacks &amp; anxiety my whole life. I have seen therapists and been on a couple medicines that made me sleepy when I was younger. I have also had a problem with concentration &amp; mild depression. Recently I have had a string of really stressful situations come up and anxiety, panic,&amp; depression combined with OCD &amp; ADD &amp; really bad mood swings (screaming, breaking &amp; throwing anything I could get my hands on).  I was ready for something! I didn't feel like I needed to see a therapist, I kinda know whats wrong with me, so I saw a doctor that deals with depression &amp; ADD/OCD. I just wanted try something! She explained that while medicine doesn't change who you are it changes how you react to things. I am on Lexapro 20 mg and the only side effect seems to be I wake up in the middle of the night dripping in sweat! I am generally happier, calmer, relaxed, donn't let the small things bother me. I have had a few bouts of depression here and there but it goes away &amp; its nothing I'd consider abnormal. I can finally &amp; my OCD is alot calmer. My advice to anyone just starting on it is the first week,you feel like your flying! I loved it, but some may have a stronger reaction, just give it some time and it should level out.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	beans, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	4	Female	19-24	1/18/2010 4:38:19 PM	Lexapro really was almost like a miracle pill for me. I was given a 4 week supply sample originally to help me with a sleeping problem (as the doctor had asked if i also felt anxiety or depression). In that time, my depression had diminished (and i had EXTREMELY difficult family situations that started 2 weeks after i took it...great timing...I would have been completely depressed and beside myself, but I felt great.)I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, overweight/obesity, cholesterol issues) a few months earlier. Lexapro lowered my high blood pressure to a perfect score, acted as an appetite suppressant, and i lost weight because of it. obviously this wont be the case with everyone. the only side effects i experienced were moderate nausea and occasional headaches when first incorporating the drug into my system (first week or two).I've had varying levels of depression since i was 13. I'm now going on 22 so i still have a while to go. i was off it for 2 months and i just bought my first prescription for it. 2nd day: nausea and headache. hopefully it will just go away like it did before.

I was having deep thoughts of suicide and anxiety attacks all the time. It got to the point where I did try suicide. I was placed on this drug and after about two weeks I was back to my normal self. No thoughts of suicide, no anxiety, nothing like that. I was ablre to smile, laugh and joke again with friends and family. I have been on it for about 6 years now. if I miss a dose, I get headahces and weird dizzyness. My doctor wants to try me on Celexa, but I don't think it works as well for me. Lexapro is a drug you need to work with. You have to police yourself. It's not a miracle drug some people try to say it is.

I was prescribed the drug for severe anxiety and mild depression. The first time I was on it, I took it for about 3 months in the morning and I had the sexual side effects, loss of libido and I could not have an orgasm to save my life!! I stopped taking it because I could not handle the sexual side effects. Then when my doctor prescribed it again he told me that it should ALWAYS be taken at night!!! It helps with the drowsiness, which was my 1st problem because I felt like a zombie in the morning when I took it. So when I started taking it at night, I noticed that I STARTED TO HAVE ORGASMS RIGHT AWAY!! Now I take it before bed every night, and I have orgasms all the time! I want everyone to know to talk to your doctor about taking Lexapro at night!! The side effects are non-existent! It saved my life, TAKE IT AT NIGHT!!

I ended up switching because it completely erased my libido and even caused a loss of sexual sensation.  As a newlywed, this was unacceptable for me.  Switching to Zoloft resolved this to some extent.

Had forgotten how good I used to feel.  Beginning to feel like my old self again, laughing, highly patient, positive...but there's a problem; I have had nausea and diarrhea since day 3. Last two weeks have been tapering off.  Waiting to go back to the doctor this week for an alternative.  Really hate to change since I mentally feel so good again, but physically I can't deal.

After having suffered with depression for most of my life, my PCP prescribed it to me and the results were instantly positive. My mood and emotions are stable and I am no longer high-strung. I actually laugh and feel true happiness. Nothing gets me down. I have not experienced any negative side effects (i.e. weight gain, nausea, increased symptoms of depression) either. It may cause drowsiness in the beginning, but this will subside after continued use. I've had the most amusing dreams, too! I would recommend Lexapro to one and all. It changed my life.

After a week on Lexapro I felt a change in my mood, and after two weeks I felt almost back to &quot;normal.&quot; The past two weeks I've started experiencing the negative side effect of constant sleepiness. I had insomnia one night, but other than that I've gotten plenty of sleep, but I'm tired all day long every day and feel like I could fall asleep at a moment's notice. The sleepiness has caused a lack of focus/concentration.

Lost libido for quite a while but that's improved within the last year. Combination depression &amp; anxiety which I didn't realize the depth of until the Lex really kicked in. If my current state is what it's like to live normally, I couldn't go back to being without it.

Side effects include difficulty in reaching orgasm, weight gain of 5 lbs., and fatigue. Would recommend taking a night if fatigue is a side effect.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	HappyGoYucky, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	2	4	1	Female	45-54	1/6/2010 7:15:53 PM	Terrible side effects for me. Hot flashes, night sweats, complete loss of sex drive and the fatigue was horrible. I stayed exhausted. I did not see any help at all with my depression and I also gained over 40 lbs in 6 months. Enough to depress someone without depression! It did help with my anxiety disorder that I have about driving on highways and fear of green lights and intersections, but all the other side effects were far worse than those. I am still suffering from depression and I will probably go back on something, but it will not be Lexapro. Some people have had amazing results. It was nothing short of a nightmare for me. Now I look like a prime candidate for The Biggest Loser.

I went to see a therapist and my PCP for help because I was really scared for my mental health.  I felt like I was loosing my mind. Lexapro has been a miracle for me. I'm no longer angry all the time, I don't have days where I feel like doing nothing but crying or feel like I'm completely empty and it's a struggle to even get out of bed.  I haven't had any suicide thoughts since about the fifth week of being on it.  My mind is a lot more active but it's with positive thoughts instead of angry &amp; sad ones. I feel normal and truly happy for the first time in my life.  Thank goodness for Lexapro.

Been on many drugs but Lex. works great for me. Recommend it, especially war Veterans! (do yourselves a favour guys!) Gained only a little weight so far. Lost all sex drive, but wife hasn't any so that's worked out well (and she does not take Lex :) I take half a tab before bed so good sleep is a problem. But I can nap anytime, anywhere during the day, which is good. I keep active. The tinnitis I have has got 10 times worse and is constant and louder. But the benefits of Lex outweigh the side-effects. Occasionally I additionally take a little Xanax or Serapax at night to ensure a good night's sleep.

But I have had issues with weight gain and lethargy which aren't going away. I will be weaning off this drug soon.

My doctor increased the dosage to 20 milligrams per day because I was still having some issues focusing. The drug is amazing. I re-enrolled in college and am about to graduate. My doctor took me down to 10 milligrams per day about three months ago, and I still feel great. I highly recommend Lexapro.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/17/2009 7:28:11 PM	I was prescribed this medication becuase I was displaying signs of depression and anxiety. After taking 2 doses I felt very calm and relaxed. However, the 3rd dose made me horribly anxious and increased my symptoms by at least 50%. I felt an immediate difference after 24 hours off the medication. I understand that everyone reacts differently to medication. However, my expirience has made me extremely catious of this type of medication and I have opted to go to therapy to work out my problems instead of using medication.

I'm a person who never takes medication but found myself severely depressed after the death of my mother and needed something to bring me out of the black cloud I found myself in. I was first prescribed Wellbutrin and Effexor both increased my heart rate and blood pressure. I guess third times a charm because Lexapro worked great it was like someone turned a light switch on in my head, I noticed a change within the first week of taking this medicine. I now think more clearly, I have more energy, I don't get upset over the little things, my anger and mood has mellowed out, Co-workers have even commented that I'm friendlier now.I find that lexapro works better for me when I take it around the same time every day after I've eaten usually around 9:30am after breakfast. Lexapro will make you nauseated if you do not eat before taking. But as for not sleeping or gaining weight as mentioned in other reviews I have actually lost weight because I do more in the day, I don't go home and just sit on the couch any more after work. This is the benefit of taking this medicine early in the morning I accomplish more during the day and when I go to bed I'm naturally tired and fall asleep. I don't plan on being on this medicine for very long but it is working for me when I'm needing it the most.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Mojoron, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Male	55-64	12/16/2009 9:50:56 AM	I had post cardiac bypass depression that was effecting my work and my family.  I tried Lexapro samples for four weeks and while it was effective in the beginning, I became more depressed to the point of crying and sleeping during the day which I never did before.  I immediately got off the drug and feel pretty much OK now.  I believe that I had a Serotonin Storm which is a common problem with taking these types of drugs.  If at all possible, when suffering from clinical depression, try other non-perscription alternatives first.  Try to get more active, exercise more and seek mental support from a mental health professional. Major depression may require this and other drugs for depression

Lexapro has worked very effectively but I've had side effects which have caused me to stop the drug twice. On Lexapro mood is very even with feelings  of just not being bothered about anything - this &quot;lack&quot; of emotion means sadness/anxiety is gone but I sometimes missed &quot;feeling&quot; things. Also found it difficult to motivate myself for work as the stress went.Worst side effect for me was weight gain (20-30lbs)- I probably started eating more but didn't really notice at the time. For me Lexapro becomes effective within a few days and the two times I've stopped sad and anxious feelings have come back within a few weeks. The drug has been most effective and if it wasn't for the weight gain I'd probably still be taking it.

I tried everything else (Zoloft,Paxil,etc) and they all made me feel like I was floatin outside myself. Lexapro has been amazing. Rarely do I have a panic attack and no side effects. I would recommend that you at least try it.

I lost my job due to untrue accusations.  Experienced a major depressive episode.  The med helped eleviate most symptoms within weeks.  I have found it very effective.  BUT each person's body chemmistry is different.  Keep trying if one med does not work another anti-dpressent will.  I am very happy with Lexapro and only 10 mlgrams.

It made me hypomanic and did not alleviate my depression symptoms. For the whole 8 months I was on Lexapro, I was very lethargic and didn't care about anything. I also gained 15 pounds. If you are medication sensitive, I do not recommend this drug.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	45-54	12/12/2009 3:01:51 PM	I was on Lexapro at 10mg per day and found it helped somewhat at the blood levels stabilized, then I became more easily angered and began having trouble sleeping on a more and more regular basis. After about three months of regular use, I found myself becoming more easily upset and reactive, with greater tendancy toward flying off the handle. About one month ago, I began tapering off the meds by 1/4 of final dosage per week and found I was sleeping significantly more than while on the meds and oversleeping my alarm more than once.

I don't get overwhelmed all the time like I used to.  I have not gained weight, though I work out a lot anyway. Actually I didn't realize that I was that depressed until I started taking it and felt a difference.

You need to read over ALL the reviews and rule out a few that don't seem to jive with all the others.  There's always a few out there who are dissatisfied. That doesn't mean those same things will happen to you.  Do your research and remember, everyone is different and react to drugs differently.  Don't be scared the first time you see a reviewer mention weight gain or decreased libido.  It's more important that you get to feeling better and you can deal with those things later. I've had depression for 30 years and Prozac 20mg worked for me up until I hit 50. Perhaps it was because I'm pre-menopausal or because I'd taken the same drug, at the same dose for so many years.  I went to the doctor and tried several other drugs. At first, I wasn't satisfied with any of them, so I got on Effexor XR.  Wow!  Please read about the withdrawl symptoms when going off of Effexor, because they are severe. Try all the other meds first. Something will work for you.Bottom line, I'm going back on Lexapro.  I don't think I gave it enough of a chance and it was working pretty well for me. Be patient and don't try to change meds or get off of something without a doctor's advice.  Been there, done that, and it was terrible.  I believe that Lexapro is a wonderful drug. It is sure the best I've tried so far. I believe our bodies get used to something and it finally stops working. That's what happened to me with Prozac, although it was my wonder drug for 20+ years. I'm going to ask my doctor if perhaps I should rotate between Lexapro and Prozac every few years. That may be the answer for me.DON'T GIVE UP. Antidepressants will help you get your life back, but you have to be patient. Also exercise, eat right, and talk to someone who cares. God bless you all and best wishes in your recovery.There is light at the end of the tunnel, I promise.

I had been taking 20 Mg for almost 1 1/2 years and it worked great. Sex drive tanks but not as much as with other meds of this type. Very difficult to get an erection and very delayed orgasm (which helped in some cases). I stopped taking lexapro one week ago and just yesterday experienced light-headedness and dizziness after walking up stairs. I also experienced it this morning, which caused me to check out this site. This never occurred while on Lexapro- could be withdrawal symptom as I am finding out now. I am tired of the sexual side effect of decreased drive, orgasm, and erection. Otherwise this is a great med.

Then you mellow out. Helped me level out my moods. My endurance went down. Stopped running and became more thoughtful. In fact it helped me think more even. The arguements with myself ended. Yes, I was probably a little psycho when I started. I was just fired from my job and it was done by people who were malicious about it. Basically, Lexapro calmed me down and I'm getting on with my life. After extensive consultation with your doctor and therapist I would recommend trying it for three months.

I loved it, and now they put me on cymbalta, I wish I was just on the Lexapro again! (and I don't understand why the don't have the 40mg (maybe it was 50mg) anymore, 40mgs really does help alot...manufacturers don't think it does but, it really does. Anyways, Lexapro is a great medication to take if you need to take an antidpressive! I might just go back to it, I trust it, I know it...and that means everything to me!

I took it every day, in the morning, and after a few weeks I started feeling less irritable, angry, frustrated and upset; but I still didn't feel better. I felt less like me, and more like a shell of what I was. Instead of making me feel better, it made me feel nothing, which was depressing in itself, only I was incapable of feeling depressed. The drug worked, don't get me wrong, it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I just didn't like how it made me feel, I lost who I was and was happy to switch prescriptions.

My anger was out of control!! After the first the world slowed down and everthing just became &quot;no big deal&quot;. I would rather not care that be so angry all the time.

It does have side effect but better than suffering the feeling of depression. It was very hard in the beginning because the drug made you like a zombie. It took about 1 to 2 weeks to work. I'm on it for over 2 years and went as high as 20mg. This work best with consultation with a doctor. Side effect include weight gain and low sex drive.

I switched doctors because the doc that prescribed me it wouldn't change the medication, even though I was so sick from it!

I got a little nauseous as I increased the dosage.  I'm now taking 40mg in the morning and have been on this dosage for about 3 months.  Sexual sides lasted a few weeks.  Now sex is even better than before.  Complete control.  The reason I only gave it a 3 in effectiveness is that I still have intrusive thoughts that can bother me sometimes for a few days, before it was weeks.  I was able to quit checking my car/apt/and hand washing most of the time.  and i rarely apologize unless I am truely wrong. I still battle with fear of obsessing about a bad obsession.  lol.  but its never really that bad!!  The spike doesn't make me miserable.  Some of the other SSRI's gave me a burning sensation in my body/neck/shoulder. Lexapro gave me a milder burning sensation for the first week at 5mg.  I took it at night to cope.  After it got in my system the burning sensation went away.  This took about a week and was well worth it.  I feel it is a much cleaner SSRI.  I do eat healthy and work out a few times a week.  I also do CBT with my shrink every few weeks.  I was literally living in fear 80 percent of the day before Lexapro. Now i would say its around 20-30 percent.  I can concentrate and enjoy relationships again.  Sleep is better too!  I do find it makes me a little tired some days and manic others, but nothing extreme. Give lex a try if you are sensitive to other SSRI's.

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	AnxiousNurse, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/1/2009 3:03:21 PM	When I first started taking this med I didn't know if I could tolerate it.  I was VERY anxious for the first few weeks, probably more so than why I even got on it.  My pdoc wanted me to take ativan 2-3 times daily to get thru the early period of adjusting to this med, and I am really glad I weathered the storm.  I am more level headed, can handle the day-to-day more easily, do not jump the gun and start yelling at people for no reason, and no longer suffer from random anxiety attacks on a daily basis.  My PMS is almost non-existent, whereas before my husband would take cover for 7-10 days before my period.  I truly would have headed for the hills far away from this med had my doctor not warned me about the start-up side effects.  Some people may not have them, but if you are like me and notice EVERY LITTLE THING that changes in you body and mind, you may be more sensitive to these types of meds and it may just freak you out.  Nothing a little scheduled ativan can't handle.  Thankfully my doc trusted me to take this, as I know other docs won't prescribe it for their patients.  I don't know how else I would have made it through the first 2-3 weeks.  Now I almost never have to take the ativan, because when I do get anxiety it is mild and I can talk myself off the edge of insanity pretty easily unlike before when I would just freak out immediately.  I do have a decreased libido but Lexapro comes with a built-in &quot;I don't give a crap&quot; mentality for so many things, including your reaction to the minor side effects you may have to live with.  And it's not &quot;I don't care I'm a zombie&quot; it's &quot;I'm not going to take that too seriously&quot;.  BTW I only take 7.5 mg because 10 mg made my muscles twitch for some reason, but it seems to still work great.  Good luck!

I have tried other antidepressants. All they gave me was nausea, bad stomach upset feeling and that's is. Lexapro gave me zero side effect and now I can be myself again, happy and enjoy life.

She had terrible mood swings, and increased discomfort during her menstral cycle. She took it every day and eventally decided that it wasnt working for her, but didnt ween herself off. She had terrible withdrawls and she felt terrible. A few days later things went back to normal. NOTE: EVEN at 5 mg. You must ween yourself off by taking it every other day, then 1ce every 3 days, in order to keep from withdrawls.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	11/25/2009 12:16:43 AM	My doctor prescribed this for anxiety and depression. I was to start with 5 mg and after 2 weeks take 10 mg. It worked good at first. I was very zoned and yawned all the time. I had bad night sweats and weird dreams. But I was much happier.. not crying all the time and not as anxious. When I switched to 10 mg I was fine all day a little hyper(I take it in the morning) but at night I woke up having a panic attack and tremors. I immediately went back to 5 mg. Another side effect I had was a terrible menstrual cycle. I bled heavily with large clots.. not sure if that is related to the medication or not. Don't think this is worth taking due to the side effects. But everyone's different.

I have been on it for at least six years and going. Great med! Otherwise. You must stay one it everyday at the same time or you will return to the way you were before taking it. I used to cry for no reason 24/7. Now nothing! The only thing I don't care for is the large hunger and weight gain that came with it.

I took one dose before bed and thought I was losing my mind! I was up several times with night sweats could not focus a very zoned out kind of feeling. When I woke the next morning I ran for a glass of water and some coffee as I still felt out of it being a mother of two this was not working for me. I could not sit still! I grabbed my kids and we took off walking,calling grandma to come get my kids on the way out the door knowing I was not able to focus.I just walked, I couldn't even focus on words to speak. I walked for 5 hours non stop until I got my husband to take me to the er. Turns out I was having a panic attack which is a side effect of this med. they had to give me a shot of Ativan just to get me to calm down. When I finally dropped on the bed in the er my thighs were on fire and I was ready to pass out..still that night having strange feelings and trouble sleeping. I would not take this again nor would I suggest it for anyone else.

Next checkup asked him if there was something I can take that would make me more &quot;balanced&quot; and he prescribed Lexapro.  Best thing that I could have done.  Have really had no side effects, take it at night cause it does make me tired.  I did stop taking for a few months due to being laid off/no money and I was miserable, started taking it again and much better.

I just got a perscription for Citalopram and im hoping it will be more effective. The Lexapro made me always feel bloated, i was gaining weight and couldn't put it off, my insomnia came back, and i was still having panic attacks and depression. For a while i loved it and it was effective, but then it stopped working for me.

I'm on 10mg for 15 months now. Don't be afraid to try it, being afraid is one of the problems with anxiety. I fought it for over a year and could have saved myself a lot of grief by just taking the medication. I have had occasional night sweats and some lack of libido, but much of the libido came back after a few months.

I take 10mg a day and have for three years.  It works wonders for me and the litte things are'nt such big things anymore.  I do notice a little bit of sexual desire decrease as well as some increased fatigue.  But both are just minor and easy to work through for me.  I will say if I happen to miss taking them for two days or more I get dizzy spells.

I have fought off the sugar cravings, though I have gained about 8 lbs.  I went through the sweats, sleepless nights the first week and mania during the day for the first several days.  Some days I do have to double my dose.  I take this for post menopausal symptoms, including feeling grouchy for no reason.  It really helps with that.  I find it helps a lot with getting motivated throughout my day and staying &quot;on track&quot;, which is something I've always had trouble with, lol!  So, in some respects, I'm getting a double bonus!  I eat much less now, one meal a day.  It seems to work much better with lots of fluids and less food.  No deserts for me either, just fresh fruits.  Healthier and happier.

I had crazy side effects when I first started but stuck with it.  I haven't had a full blown panic attack in over 2 yrs.  I'm not saying i'm completely cured but now I would rather take lexapro for the rest of my life than go back to having panic attacks and living the way I was.  Before lexapro I couldn't function and wasn't really living.  I started at 5mg then went to 20mg, about a year ago I cut it down to half of that,10mg.  I still have mood swings and anxiety during my pms time but i'm working on that.

I've been medicated via different drugs/drug coctails for more than 30 years.  I currently take Lexapro (a fairly high dose due to long-term use), clonazapam, Lamotrigne, Topamax, and Trazadone.  The combination has kept me on this side of the asylum walls, and I'm grateful.  The depression was bad, but the manic rage was unbearable, both for me and those around me.  The support of an excellent therapist, a fantastic circle of friends, the most supportive family one could have, and being blessed with the kindest and most loving husband the Deity ever put on this earth are also reasons I'm certifiable yet still at large.  :-)

I was feeling more calm and able to handle things.  However, I started having the sexual side effects so I talked to my doctor.  He cut the dose in half and that took care of that problem.  Then I started having severe nausea and dizziness where I felt like the room was spinning.  It would last for about 4 hours every day.  After a few weeks I just couldn't take it anymore.  So I talked to my doctor again and changed meds completely.  I did not gain any weight on Lexapro but I wasn't able to lose any, either even when working out and cutting calories.  While Lexapro helped my depression/anxiety, the side effects were just not worth it.  For those of you having side effects be sure to talk to the doctor.  It may just be a matter of changing the dosage.

I didn't want to take any meds at all, I never have before.  But I was at the point where I couldn't function anymore; I could barely take care of my kids.  I was scared to start any anti-depressant b/c my sister had a bad reaction to one.  This one has been great, but now the positive changes are fizzling out.  My doctor and I may need to play with the dose.  When I take too much, I feel a little manic. But now I'm holding at 10 mg, and while I can get through the day without crying, I'm still sad and lack energy.  Overall I DO recommend this drug.  I've had very few bad side effects.

I never wanted to be one of those 'statistics'. I didnt want to be on medication every day. But i also couldnt live with the constant (what I call) heart dropping feeling. It was taking over my life. The first few weeks def. took some getting used to. But after being on Lexapro for over 4 months I feel like my old self (which has been soo long since i've seen).

The side effects were so extreme I couldn't even make it in to work today. How odd I've been counting down the minutes until the Lexapro gets out of my system and I can go back to my old, normal nervous wreck. Took dose one last night with dinner. Within an hour felt drugged and nauseous. Fell into a coma-like sleep for about 4 hours and woke up around 7am. Layed in bed in a for a while before I realized the side effects. Heart racing in my chest like it was about to burst, hot and sweaty. Got up out of bed to test the waters and the dizzyness and trembling hands began to set in. Basically it took my anxiety attacks, turned them up to full volume and added a myriad of other side effects. And I could feel the numb, zombielike state blanketing it all. No thanks. This drug made me realize I need to master this disorder through more natural methods. Today scared the shit out of me. I assume a lot of people posting here are young and in school by saying they sleep all day or take 3 naps a day. I have to work full time and couldn't do it taking this drug judging how I felt today.

I have trouble sleeping anyway and so this isn't helping me at all.  I woke up very confused after sleeping only about an hour.  Not very happy with this medication at all.  Will be talking to my doctor in the morning.
Lexapro+Oral	Major Depressive Disorder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	11/9/2009 5:05:55 PM	When I started taking Lexipro, it was like night and day.  I was diagnosed with MDD when I was 10, and have struggled to find treatment that would work ever since.  The first day I took Lexipro, I felt like getting out and socalizing, something that has never happened to me before.  People around me noticed a difference (my grandpa commented that I had more sparkle).  The downside is if I don't take my pill at the same time every day, I get diarrhea.  I also have trouble sleeping, and as a result am tired all the time. Lexipro also does not manage my anxiety as well as my previous medication, and I have had a sharp increase in panic attacks. Overall, though, Lexipro does such a good job managing my mood, I'm willing to over-look the side effects (which do seem to be getting better as time goes on.)
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	11/9/2009 2:39:22 PM	Let me first say that for the first 2 weeks, I wanted OFF this, but after a lifetime of no med working 4 my depression/anxiety, I'm SO glad I didn't! I haven't been able to work out of the home for the last 3 years because of my depression/anxiety/add/pmdd) so was able to take the time to adjust. The 1st couple of days I thought I was losing my mind. I'd be crying for ten minutes, then extremely agitated for ten, then ok for ten - press repeat.  Essentially, 1st two weeks didn't feel at all like myself &amp; had severe nausea, sleep problems, you name it including suicidal thoughts (try not to be alone, although I had to). But after having tried no kidding EVERY other drug out there just about with no luck, I was desperate &amp; hung in there, just hoping. 2-3 months into taking 10mg I WAS noticing some improvement but not enough with my anxiety, so my doctor upped me to 20mg. So I had a repeat of the two weeks of hell - after a couple of weeks it was bearable but still wasn't myself for a couple more. Now, while I do still have to fight the depression, at least I feel I can. I can actually usually choose my reactions to stress instead of my reactions choosing me, have spent more time out of bed and actually able to function when my PMDD isn't kicking my butt ten days a month around my period (any suggestions for this?), &amp; have been able to cope MUCH better. BTW, just some of the other drugs I tried (and yes, did give them at least a month or two - didn't have the severe side effects as with the Lexapro, just zombied out): Paxil (never again!), Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor ... there were more I can't remember off-hand, including ones for anxiety/panic attacks.  It had gotten to where I didn't believe in the meds at all before trying the Lex.  Now I wish I'd hung in there before &amp; kept trying until I found one that worked for me. Could have maybe saved me years of grief and a messed-up life. Anyway, REALLY grateful for this drug! Hang in there all &amp; keep trying!

So I had a repeat of the two weeks of hell - after a couple of weeks it was bearable but still wasn't myself for a couple more. Now, while I do still have to fight the depression, at least I feel I can. I can actually usually choose my reactions to stress instead of my reactions choosing me, have spent more time out of bed and actually able to function when my PMDD isn't kicking my butt ten days a month around my period (any suggestions for this?), &amp; have been able to cope MUCH better. BTW, just some of the other drugs I tried (and yes, did give them at least a month or two - didn't have the severe side effects as with the Lexapro, just zombied out): Paxil (never again!), Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor ... there were more I can't remember off-hand, including ones for anxiety/panic attacks.  It had gotten to where I didn't believe in the meds at all before trying the Lex.  Now I wish I'd hung in there before &amp; kept trying until I found one that worked for me. Could have maybe saved me years of grief and a messed-up life. Anyway, REALLY grateful for this drug! Hang in there all &amp; keep trying!

The Lexapro has been excellent.  Also, I cannot overstate the benefit of two supportive, fabulous doctors and an insightful, supportive and caring religious leader.

I haven't been able to work out of the home for the last 3 years because of my depression/add/pmdd (hopefully that will change) so was able to take the time to adjust. The 1st couple of days I thought I was losing my mind. I'd be crying for ten minutes, then extremely agitated for ten, then ok for ten - press repeat.  Essentially, 1st two weeks didn't feel at all like myself &amp; had severe nausea, sleep problems, you name it including suicidal thoughts (try not to be alone, although I had to). But after having tried no kidding EVERY other drug out there just about with no luck, I was desperate &amp; hung in there, just hoping. 2-3 months into taking 10mg I WAS noticing some improvement but not enough with my anxiety, so my doctor upped me to 20mg.

I stopped taking Lexapro for a year and during that ime I lost close to 30lbs. I've been taking it again now for a year and have been gaining weight again.

Although, my severe mood swings and anxiety had all but vanished, I was very unhappy with the weight gain. After almost a year of taking the drug, I wanted off. I quit taking it on my own. The first day was okay. The second day was a nightmare. I got a painful cramp in my upper back and arm. It felt like what I thought a heart attack might feel like, and then the shocks or the buzz. I had moments of staring and not being able to break my gaze. I was lucky I didn't throw them away. I started taking them again and all the withdrawal episodes went away. I had to have medical guidance from my Internal Medicine Doctor to get off the med. After all that, I still think using the Lexapro was worth it, because it did help me. I just couldn't live with the weight gain. I guess I would rather be moody and anxiety ridden then overweight.

I noticed a bit of nausea and headache for one week, a relatively minor annoyance. I am feeling better and able to cope with work, less emotional for sure, more energy and less appitite. I am an RN and work with some real bak stabbing nurses so this drug is a life saver. My eyelids do feel a bit heavy at times, but that is something I'm willing to deal with. I did make the mistake of taking a few sips (3)of a margarita and felt some &quot;zingers&quot; in my head (difficult to explain)...that was scary, but I'm not a drinker so won't be doing that again.

Huge appetite came with it. No interest in sex. Sweating became an issue. I would be sweating and no one else was even hot or warm! Finally decided to go off the drug. I reduced the 5 mg every other day to 1/2 of that every week for about five weeks, now i havent had any for three weeks. I no longer have too much sweating, still no sex drive, tired all day. Can sleep a little bit at night. Lots of tics, thoughts of suicide etc. I am still in withdrawls now. Reading the other comments is helping as many of the reviews are similar. Getting off is very challenging.

For the first few weeks there was little positive about the medicine. I was very nauseated and had severe headaches. I talked to my doctor and he told me to keep at it. I did and got over the symptoms within a few weeks. After that I quickly noticed positive changes. However, I have gained over 20lbs and have a very tired feeling throughoit the day. Rarely do I have trouble sleeping. When I do not take my medicine for a few days, I become much more irritable and in a bad mood. I also feel quite nauseated, dizzy and these zap like pulses through my body that arent necessarily painful but uncomfortable and dissorienting. My Dad passed away a few months after i started taking this medication and that was quite a test. I felt like I was in control of myself and able to still properly grieve.  Overall, I am quite happy with the results thus far and it is important to keep with it and take it as prescribed.

To say it felt better but boy was I sleepy, i found myself sleeping at my desk &amp; waking up like I just slept all day...weird.  I thought there were pills to fix everything but overall just changing my diet &amp; staying away from alcohol &amp; crazy broads was the answer.  My suggestion stay away from any pills they'll only cause sometype of long term disorder or problem, srew the pharma companies...

Once the headache went away, I could tell an AMAZING difference in attitude and feelings.  Husband says I'm finally the &quot;girl he married&quot; again.  I'm much happier and things just seem easier. Only problem is that I do notice that if I wait until later in the day to take it (at bedtime), I get irritable in the evenings.  Works better for me if I take it around mid-day.

I worried that this would make me not act like myself. Then the next day, I felt much better.  Things were clearer and I felt less anxiety. Other people have mentioned being tired and having their vision impacted, I did slightly the first few days...give it time. I am only on my first week but my vision is fine and I dont feel spacey anymore. My appetite is less, but I am okay with that. I dont know about sexual side effects, but my Dr. told me that she is on it and the first month she had difficulty reaching climax, but then after the first month, it was better!  I will keep waiting for the medication to get into my system fully, which can take 30-45 days.

Made me really tired all of the time and I gained 25lbs that I cannot get rid of. I came off it and md put me on Wellbutrin SR, worse ever. Had terrible headaches everyday. My consider coming back to Lexapro, but so scared of the weight gain which makes me more depressed.

It has changed our lives! Wonderful. The kids arent affraid of him anymore and our marriage has been great for 6 months since hes been it. He has had anger issues for 20 years and now he is a different man. The only bad side effects are insomnia and low sex drive. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone that has a bad temper!

If you expereince this please know that it may be this drug.

I feel like &quot;me&quot; but without the edge and anxiety I always felt. My husband and kids noticed right away that I wasnt snippy, didn't yell as much, was calmer and smiled more. I feel like I enjoy life again without stressing so much. I began taking Lexapro due to my father dying, then my cousin and then my husband being deployed all within a few months. It has helped me calm down and cope with life, rather than being so angry. Only negative side affects is loss of appetite (which I'm okay with!) some strange dreams, but sleep ok so far and sometimes tiredness about 2-hours after taking my pill (10mg) but then I'm fine after that. I am excited to have my life back again and am hopeful to feel even better over time. I've been on this now for only a week so results for me were almost immediate!

I found it to have little side-effects, but the two most bothersome to me were tinnitus and weight gain.  I gained 20 lbs in 2 yrs.  It really helped with both depression and anxiety.  It helped with focusing and concentration.  I am now trying to slowly decrease my dosage and gradually get off the drug.  However, I have found this to be difficult due to increasing tinnitus and sleepiness.  I would use this drug again for depression and anxiety.

After about 4 months it started not to work so docter said to take 10mg,same thing,work for little while then stopped. Docter keeps upping the dose every couple months,now I have rapid weight gain and still anxiety,20lbs in a couple months.I feel the doc does not listen to me and just ups the dose so he can get on to the next patient.So I tapered off slowely over a week,and I am losing the weight and taking zantac for my chest hurting. I am worndering if I even had anxiety or just heartburn.

Felt like my head was in the clouds and couldn't focus.  Doc backed me down to 5 mg and that was not enough.  Found a welcome relief at 10 mg.  Anxiety has reduced significantly and can focus, concentrate and remember more.  It took some time to find the right dose, but it was worth it.

The bad effects that I couldn't stand were soooo tired barely able to work, gained about 15 lbs, and felt like I was having hot flashes quite often. I guess if you can stand all those bad effects, it is definitely effective for the depression.

Some symptoms have become worse and there is a corrolation to daily function &amp; how severe symptoms may be on a given day.  Even with CBT (long-term) my overhwelming sadness is a prevailing, predominant symptom.  The fatigue, lack of interest, etc., I truly try to &quot;manage&quot; by just dealing with it trying to move on. Day-by-day, just attempting to get out of &quot;myself&quot; more &amp; into the world &amp; change the focus from my feelings to attempting to contribute to the world &amp; others, as I can, day by day.  It's boring to be depressed &amp; until I die (which I truly look forward to) I better attempt to life as much as possible in spite of myself.

It worked for me great all through college, but it seemed like the longer I was on it the less effective it was. Getting off the drug was horrible everytime I did. It gave me zaps, dizziness, and an overall awful feeling.

I had been in the dumps at home and work  for 2  1/2 years and became a &quot;functioning&quot; alcholic. This is the first time I have taken meds and can honestly say that the only side effect so far is lasting longer in bed... not all that bad when you're rebuilding your relationship. Additionally, I have not felt a desire to drink even when I'm around it with friends. Keep ya' posted...
Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	13-18	10/16/2009 10:07:44 PM	I started taking Lexapro about a month ago because my panic was just out of control. I absolutely hate Lexapro. I feel disconnected from the world, and have no emotions at all. The burning sensation associated with panic attacks has disappeared, but I still have great anxiety all the time. I feel worse than I did before I started. I feel depressed and don't care about anything, which I didn't feel before taking Lexapro. I also have headaches all the time and feel tired way more than I used to. I have strange and unpleasant dreams almost every night. It's negatively affecting my relationship with my boyfriend and my family. I understand this has worked wonders for some people, but it is definitely not the drug for me. I hope to get off of it soon.

I would recommend talking to your doctor about taking the lowest dose possible. 10mg &amp; 5mg made me sleepy. 2.5mg worked well so did 1.25mg (cut 5mg pill in 1/4).Absolute WORST part about this medication is when you stop taking it you will get horrible 'brain zaps'. They are not painful per-say but it is like your brain being electrocuted with the slightest stimuli (light, noise, moving your eyes, turning your head, etc.) Tapering-off lessens the severity of the 'brain zaps' but they will still occur.  I've been off for approx 1yr and will still get these 'brain zaps' once in a while if its really quiet, dark, and I'm tired.With my husband deploying I've started to take them again but only 1.25mg, just enough to dull the extreme emotions without making me spacey.

It worked for me for a few months and noticed I was still getting anxiety, he then prescribed to me a higher dose of 20mg.  I only take 15mg and find it working better for me. I also noticed a little weight gain with this medication.  Overall, I call Lexapro my &quot;miracle pill&quot;.

I suffered from terrible anxiety/obsessive thoughts/panic attacks for two years, and finally decided to give Lexapro a try.  A year later, I'm feeling great!  The only side effect I've encountered is that I'm hungry ALL of the time, so I've gained some weight.  However, it's well worth how happy I am now!

None of the previous worked as immediately or as well for me as Lexapro. (My advice: DO NOT JUDGE THIS OR ANY MEDICINE BY SIDE EFFECTS IN FIRST FEW DAYS. If I had stopped any of these medicines based on first couple of days, I would never have taken any anti-depressants and life would not be good. Or really, I might not be here anymore.) BACK TO SUBJECT: On Lexapro, my anxiety was improved, as well as my depression. I used 10 mg for about a year, then upped to 20 mg when it seemed necessary. I will say that I have been more sleepy, less energetic and have an increased appetite (translation: I gained 30 lbs. and I am a skinny person). I also have had increased problems with memory and concentration, and have trouble finding words when I am speaking. I am not sure whether the focus/memory is due to the Lexapro or not. But it doesn't help those areas, so I added Wellbutrin to the Lexapro for a time in order to see if focus/appetite/energy could be improved. I may still do that again at some point. My dr. said that using an SSRI for a long time can lead to less dopamine, which you need for concentration, energy and other things. For now, I am switching to a drug that acts on more than one neurotransmitter (norepinephrine and serotinin) just like the combo of Wellbutrin and Lexapro to see if that helps with fatigue, focus and memory. But I would not change a thing about my experience with Lexapro. It was the right drug for me at the time. If you are anxious and depressed, it is an especially good option. Realize that you may have to revisit whether it's the best option from time to time.

So I might ask him to change it if I don;t think I can deal with tthat. But other than that it's great.  \

I love it and it has helped me in so many ways. I no longer am as obsessive and compulsive about things and am back to feeling happy and outgoing again. The past few years have been very tough for me in life that I reached my end point in July and started taking Lexapro. The side effects at first were hard - stomach upset, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue. After a few weeks it went away and my body adjusted. Best of all it helped me gain weight finally. Stress in my life the past few years made it impossible for me to want to eat or anything or gain weight. I am not sure what is normal bc everyone's bodies are different and will react to every drug different, but lately I have felt a bit more agitated more than usual since I started taking Lexapro. The doctor recommended me going up to 15mg but I am hesitant.

It helped me in a very profound way. I have not had a panic attack or any real anxiety related issues since about a week after starting. I expirenced very few side effects. Mainly just drowsiness (granted it was pretty difficult to stay away) for the first two weeks. I was on the fence about taking an SSRI but I am very glad that I did. I have suggested this medication to a friend of mine and they are having positive feelings about it too. My only real worry about Lexapro is I may be &quot;mentally&quot; addicted to it. I don't know if that is possible, but I do worry about how I will do if I ever do stop taking it.

But it's been 3 weeks I've discontinued the Lisinopril now and the cough and sore throat has worstened.  I just wanted to find out if the Lexapro 10mg, might be a cause for the respiratory problems I've incurred.

If I only would have known that what was wrong with me was depression and anxiety I would have done something about it years ago!

Lexapro has truly been a life-saver for me. I have tried going off of it but haven't had much luck. I'm currently looking into trying a generic drug for both the depression and anxiety since there is no generic form of Lexapro and without health insurance I just simply can't afford it anymore. This has been my only complaint...the cost. Other than that, I have benefited from taking it.

I've been on lexapro for just over 1 yr.  It has certainly &quot;evened me out&quot; and I feel that I deal w/ stressful situations on a much more even kiel, but I am tired ALL THE TIME and still have an &quot;I don't give a crap&quot; attitude.  I could sleep everyday, all day if I didn't have to work.  I take naps whenever I can.  I definitely have to really pep talk myself to get out of bed everyday.  I'm not nearly as motivated as I used to be to get things done and I have trouble really focusing on things since taking lexapro.  I'm also constantly yawning and have gained at least 15 lbs.  I've also noticed that I have difficulty finding words when I'm talking to people, which never happened prior to taking this drug.  So, I decided to take myself off of it since I'm tired of being tired.  I guess it's withdrawl, but in the few days after I stopped taking it, I get these weird sensations in my head, like shocks or zaps and I find it hard for my eyes to focus when this occurs.  Also, my ears are ringing non-stop.  I really don't want to take this drug anymore, but am affraid the withdrawls are only going to get worse.

It started very strong and it kept me incredibly entergetic for the first month or so. After that the effect started to die down. It still works, but not as well as when I started taking it.

I started with the 10mg dosage and then after 2 weeks, increased to 20mg. I noticed steady improvement in my attitude, and it significantly reduced my level of stress and anxiety, to the point I was very normal. The only problem I had was I couldn't have an orgasm - big problem! After 90 days, I quit Lexapro and am now giving Wellbutrin a try.

Lexapro works great.  I've had my symptoms re-emerge twice but talking to my therapist and a simple increase in my dosage really helps.  I would recommend Lexapro along with therapy to anyone with depression.  When my dosage is increased I feel a little sleepy for a week or two but after that I feel better.  I haven't experienced any other side effects.

Lexapro has the least amount of side effects.  I can function while taking it is my biggest relief.  Other drugs made me sleepy and dopey and I was like a mushroom.  I too have side effects of head and neck sweating at night; gained a lot of weight and have seriously tried to lose it and can't.  My legs and body twitch and jerk as I began to relax (particulary at night, but not always).  My head flips from one side to the other.  I can hear my family if they approach me, but not always able to acknowledge them.

I was suffering from repeated panic attacks and free-floating anxiety that I had lost control of.  It took a few weeks to get used to it but after 2-3 months I really started to notice improvement.  I still have anxiety once in awhile but my panic attacks have diminished and I feel normal again.

It started with St. John's Wart from just about birth, Prozac at 11, and then I went through Valium, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and probably a few others that I don't remember. With the exception of the Prozac, everything seemed to work for a time but then I would need to up the dosage or combine it with another drug. It always felt so ridiculous to watch the commercials for whatever I was taking and hear them say that, because I was under 18, I shouldn't be taking it. Lexapro has been great so far, though as I said everything worked in the beginning. I haven't had any noticeable side effects and though getting my insurance to pay for it has been hell I hope to continue seeing the same improvement in my mood.

I was constantly tired to the point of not being able to keep my eyes open. When I was awake I was yawning. Also I think I had the most severe of sexual side effects...I was numb. Nothing we tried worked. I haven't been able to orgasm and it just got to be to much so now I'm on wellbutrin. I'm hopeful and keeping my fingers crossed for some relief

It is a wonder drug for me. I was able to socially interact and was the calmest person ever. I felt like myself. But it also numbed some of my feelings and when trying to get off of it, I quickly became depressed. Reading all of the reviews, I realize too that I have gained and been unable to shed 40lbs even with dieting. It made me tired and less energetic some days but I always slept great at night. When I tried to wean and was unsuccessful a yr ago, my doc added Wellbutrin XL 300mg which lifted my mood, energy and libido. Now he wants me to wean off the Lexapro and try to be on as little meds as possible (goal). I'm concerned about the difficulty in weaning that Im' reading on the net, so please even though this drug worked EXCELLENT for my life, I may have a hard time getting off of it (brain zaps, irritability, insomnia, depression, stomach issues, etc).

I am trying to wean off of it because of excessive weight gain. I have been taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg now for a while and love it....but I am still taking the lexapro every other day or so with it...to maintain...each time I try to stop the lexapro (like this week, I tried not taking it for 3 days) I go NUTS! EVERYTHING irritates me and I just want to scream at the top of my lungs or hit something?! I can't take it! So of course I took another lexapro this morning....But I really want to stop using it. I gained so much weight on it and don't want to continue. My husband tells me I'm fat and that I should stop using it and just exercise, but I don't think I can handle the irritability I get from stopping it....Any suggestions from anyone??? HELP!

Always has some issues with general anxiety (GAD) but never too bad. GAD got much worse all of a sudden for no apparent reason. MD recommended Lexapro. On 10mg for a month. Did not work so well. Upped dose to 20mg the 2nd month. Works great after 6 weeks and has eliminated all anxiety, however, totally killed libido and ability to perform. Went from twice a week with wife to nothing at all. This &quot;side effect&quot; jhas not gone away at all after now 10 weeks. So, I'm not sure I can stay on this drug. I also feel it clouds thinking and memory about 10%. No other side effects other than what I listed. No weight gain, no appetite change, no sleep pattern change. Hope this helps!!! Emjay

The drug has worked tremendously to keep my anxiety under control.  However last week I started a new job for the first time in 28 years and my anxiety returned with a vengeance.  Lexapro is more of a preventitive medication and it did not control my increased anxiety because of the new job.  My doctor prescribed .5mg of Xanax to try and get the anxiety under control.  The Xanax seems to be working however my concern now is if the anxiety will continue to return when starting a new job.  I had to be let go from this recent new job because if was a computer programmin contractor's job and the client did not want to have to deal with my anxiety issues.  So now I will again be looking for a new job and my fear is that the anxiety will return in spite of now taking Xanax.  Has anyone out there experienced this same situation?

My friend was on lexapro and said she loved it; I on the other hand had other problems. It didnt make me depressed, but it made me into a horrible person to be around. I would get mad at my boyfriend for no reason really and was just all over an angry person. I stopped taking it as soon as I realized what I was doing. I wouldn't recomend this to anyone.

I have experienced bouts of severe suicidal depression intermittently throughout my life.  They are usually related to a combination of external stressors, not taking care of myself and feeling like I have no control over my future. I'm a professional who has been able to &quot;hide&quot; my depression.  within 2 weeks, the suicidal thoughts almost disappeared, I was able to laugh, and didn't have the severe mood swings I have in the evening.  I have become a little &quot;lazy&quot; though.  I miss the anxiety that often motivates me to accommplish tasks.  Minimal weight gain which I've managed to control by giving up junk food.  I'm not as articulate.  sometimes, I have to search for words. Overall, its been a positive experience.  when life stress subsides, I plan to stop, but for now, its been a life saver.

I was in ER yesterday for major pain in my abdomen and come to find out it was pancreatitis and the Dr.'s couldnt figure out why I had this, dont drink or smoke and there were no problems with gullbladder. I am doing major research on this drug and have found that a possible side effect is pancreatitis I guess long term.

Makes for a steady happy/melow well being.  I actually started working out 1 month ago, which I have not done in years.  Feel Great!!

After 8 weeks, I am doing very well.  The only side effects I have noticed are an increase of sugar cravings and an increase in libido.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/2/2009 1:55:48 PM	One of the best things I've ever done for myself.  I was angry, removed from my own life, couldn't get out of my own way.  This has been a lifesaver for me.As regards weight gain:  The Lexapro, in and of itself, does NOT cause weight gain.  It can, however, increase your appetite, and it lowers your basic resistance, so where once you might have said &quot;no&quot;... you may very well say &quot;yes&quot;.

When I went to my doctor she had me try Lexapro Oral. Within a few days I had more energy and life seemed brighter.  I suffered no side effects from this medication.

Lexapro+Oral	Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	9/1/2009 3:09:09 PM	I have been married for going on 5 years, have had severe &quot;mood disorders&quot; and my marriage as well as other relationships were suffering...finally decided to get medical help. I will never regret that decision. I became pregneant and took Lexapro during the whole time, baby us healthy and going on 8 mnths. I only wish I would have dicovered this medication sooner.I have not experienced a problem with weight gain from what I can tell, but I am pretty active, so maybe that counter acts it. I would recommend this product to a friend/family member in fact...I have.If you are looking for a more fullfilled life, definetly try this stuff! I hope it works as well for you as it has for me. God Bless!

I could not function afterwards but had to because I have a young daughter.  It worked great for the first 8 months, it relieved my anxiety, I was able to get through my day.  Around month 9 my appetite increased tremendously, I could not get myself away from the kitchen so I gained about 10 pounds which for my small frame is bad.  I immediately stopped taking it and my appetite returned to normal and I did loose some of the weight.  Also I noticed it was no longer doing anything to help, my system was used to it.  So moral of the story, good for short time use not for long term, at lease not for me.

It has helped a lot with the depression, I am still getting anxious but probably not as much. They gave me xantax for that. Fell a lot better on the drug!

It is amazing for my depression, but it does make you gain weight.Sex drive has diminished as well.

I feel that it evens me out and I no longer worry about the small stuff.  You need to give this medicine at least 6 weeks to give your body time to adjust.  I felt a little weird at first.  I experienced several side effects the first month (mainly waking up in the middle of the night with a rapid heart rate), but it gradually became less frequent &amp; disappeared.  It also makes you a little tired at times if you cut your sleep short.  If I get a good 7-8 hours of sleep each night, I feel energized most days.  I resisted the urge to stop taking this medicine during the first month with the support of my wife and lots of prayers and the payoff was well worthwhile to me.  I am very glad I stuck with it through the initial body adjustment, though it was tough at times.  I finally feel like my normal self again.

I was really giving up on life and I had been depressed for as long as I can remember.  Looking back, I was depressed even in childhood.  I have been taking this drug for approx. 4 years and I can't imagine my life without it.  It is expensive but my life is worth it.

I have started horseback riding and walking again.

First week severely increased anxiety, wake up with heart pounding. Felt foggy, tired and unable to concentrate. Started to feel calmer and more positive into week 2. Felt like my old self with no depression and little anxiety. Into the 6th week negative thinking and anxiety began to creep back in. Doc recommended I go from 10mg to 20mg and consider anxiety medication. We'll see how it works.

Normal day to day trials no longer are blown out of proportion;  I can deal with things as they come and not worry too much about things that may or may not happen.  One major benefit that contradicts other reviewers reports are that my monthly migraines have subsided substantially.  I no longer need to take anything for them.  I do sleep much better than before lexapro and sometimes have trouble shaking the cobwebs from my head in the morning.  Sexual side effects are gone, libido is back.  I am grateful for this medication - as my husband is too.  I am back to the person I used to be!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	del295, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	3	Male	25-34	8/25/2009 10:37:36 PM	A lot of these reviews are suspicious so I decided to write one.I've been taking Lexapro for over 4 years now, I originally started at 10mg, once per day, I shortened my dose to half a pill every other day due to severe anger problems while taking this medication. I can say it definitely helps with depression, however for me it was very ineffective at helping with OCD issues -- I still have my routines, merely in spurts now.I do not recommend this medication to anyone unless all other medications for lighter symptoms fail. This drug is very powerful and should not be taken simply because you had a bad day at work, etc. I can vouch for anger issues associated with taking this medication daily, as well as bi-polar behavior and loss of mental focus, lack of feeling real/alive mentally &amp; visually, etc.I've tried kicking this medication and it is not difficult to get off of, very few withdrawals -- however I suggest cutting the dose gradually rather than going cold turkey.This medication does not seem to conflict with Propranolol.Side effects I have experienced are dry mouth, constipation, jittery eyes and erection problems but they are tolerable in comparison to depression.It is also very expensive, at least $90 without insurance.If you're on this medication, make sure it works for you and you feel it helps, otherwise find one that actually helps you and do not force yourself to adapt mentally to it.

I was told that I would not gain weight but I've gained 20 lbs..  The depression is gone and I've not had any menopause symptoms like hot flashes, not able to sleep, etc.

I've been on it for almost a year and for the most part i love it.  But, lately i have been gaining weight and having a hard time sleeping.  also, i am constantly in a fog, never can stay focused, and only hear half of what people are saying.  So i talked to my doctor and he said i can stop taking it but go every other day down to once a week.  i did this and COULD NOT STAND IT!!! not because of depression and anziety but the insense withdrawls my body was going through! it was as if electric shocks were going through my body.  at times i thought i would have a seiziure or faint...very scary.  i hope this helped some.

Lexapro sent me into this cloudy, nauseated fog with tremendous headaches and the desire to be reclusive.  I HATED it!!!  The side effects were so severe that I begged for a change in medicine.  Now I am trying Wellbutrin and we will see how that goes.

Then after I noticed I was like it was not working well almost kept thinking that it was a bad batch of Lexapro.  Then I started to get really depressed like it would work one day and not the next.  Then a little bit more than the last 2 weeks I took it I started to get suicidial thoughts kept popping in my head just randomly more when I was by myself but the even when I would be at work and I would just start thinking about it.  Just before I quit and got onto something else I almost commited suicide and I have never had problems like that before so just be very careful and let your doctor know of any little change.  If I would have had a gun I would be not telling anyone who is reading this now.  Good Luck.

I can talk to people now without shaking and my worklife is better.It also helps tremendously with my pms. I highly reccommend this to anyone to try.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	8/20/2009 11:09:31 AM	I was prescribed Lexapro to treat my depression, and was only on the drug for one week. During that week, my energy level dropped significantly, I could barely stay awake throughout the day and my brain was in a complete fog. I was spaced out and loopy and felt exhausted. It didn't matter whether I took it in the morning or at night, with our without food, the results were the same. I could barely function through a work day, and I probably shouldn't have been driving a car in this state. I didn't cry or feel depressed during the week, but I can't say that I felt much of anything, except strange. I have been off it for 24 hours now, and the difference is amazing. I have my energy back, I'm not loopy and I'm not physically exhausted. I can focus on work tasks again. My doctor has prescribed Cymbalta as the next drug for me to try for treating the depression, which I have not started yet.I read many positive reviews about Lexapro, and I guess the point of me writing this review is so that people can see that in some cases, this drug is clearly not for everyone. And if you are immediately experiencing some of the less common side effects, talk to your doctor immediately.

I would say I am better on lexapro than on other antidepressants I have tried. Dr. then added Strattera 60mg to see if it would increase antidepressant effect of lexapro.  Staterra has helped in off-setting weight gain and shakiness I was experiencing on lexapro.
Lexapro+Oral	Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	tinabug1982, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/19/2009 1:12:31 PM	I really would suggest this medication for anyone that has depression/anxiety issues. I tried at least 10 different meds before I found Lexapro and it was the ONLY medicine like this that has ever worked for me and many other people have told me the same thing. Side effects are very minimal, it's funny someone on here said their wrists hurt now-- I've noticed my arm (only when I try to get comfortable going to sleep at night) will NOT relax, it kind of aches... Only my left arm, never the right. I don't know if that has anything to do with the Lexapro but I have never hurt it and it didn't do that before, and it only bothers me for a minute. Otherwise I sleep great at night, I handle situations GREAT, I can prioritize things at work, I stay calm at all times, I don't feel like I did for years-- that feeling that I was just worthless... I actually feel important again, and I like who I am for the first time in many many years. I would definitely recommend it to others with anxiety and depression!

Saved my life! If you are not on this drug you should be, even if you are not suffering from depression. I never imagined life could be this amazing, this fantastic. I'm on 20 mg and have been on it for 6 years. Lexapro should be put into the water supply and given to babies from birth. All food should be fortified with it and it should be vaporised and put into the air from the con trails of air planes! This drug is soul and brain food of the highest order-ambrosia and panacea extraordinaire. Thank you science gods! Lexapro is god.

Lexapro works so well that I can't even cry anymore.  That is NOT a good thing.  The sweating is constant.  It is as if I am constantly working out sweat.  Icky!  I prefer hot flashes! I gained weight &amp; can't lose.  I am getting off Lexapro now.  The side effects of that makes me.... anxious!  Works well, but willfeel better when off.

It was a hard road and I was very ill: I am very satisfied.

Although i did not have mood swings, I took it and found that it helped me with rage episdoes. At times, I would find myself in an uncontrolled temper throughing things around the room, bfor no apprent reason. Lexapro has all but stopped this in me, so i feel normal.After being on it for 5 years now, I have an outbreak on my arms and the Dermatologist thinks it is my lexapro or my Crestor...awaiting results.

Lexapro has been the last drug of choice for the past 5 years or so. I have tried just about every antidepressant out there and they usually do what my doctor calls the &quot;poop out syndrume&quot; on me. Lexapro was fairly easy to trasition over to from my last drug, Prozac. However, I have never taken a medication that has taken me back to the way that I once felt years ago. Lexapro just helps me get by and there are times when it lags, such as when a sickness is coming on. In general, the side effects to this drug have been the same as any other antidepressant...fatigue, sleepiness, worsening of mood, when starting the medication. They went away for me in approximately a month. The one thing that I do like about this medicine is that it is easy to mix with other medications that may be prescribed by my other Doctors. Overall for me, it keeps me going, but still doesn't have the end results that I long to have.

I have been taking just over a month now and I can relax easier and most chest stess pain is gone. Worst side effect that I get is that is very difficult to achieve orgasm . So as long as my doctor will only have me on this med for 4-6 mo I can live with that

It has been somewhat helpful in lifting my mood, but I still experience break-through crying spells.  My doctor added drug Strattera which although indicated for ADHD is similiar in composition to Welbutrin.  Stattera has offset the increased appetite experienced with lexapro.

It takes about 3-4 weeks to get over the side effects and my depression is improving daily.I would suggest this product to anyone who has tried in vain with other nuances.  Usually 10mg is more than enough, you need to give it time. I was told 10mg of Lexapro is equal to 40mg of Celexa. Lexapro is a much better, cleaner solution with far less long-term side effects than other antipsychotics and SSRIs.

I was prescribed Lexapro at 10mg until recently my doctor upped the dosage to 20mg.  It has worked wonders for me.  I feel like my normal, perky, sassy self again.  What ever you do, do not stop taking this on your own!

One minute it's &quot;I love you, etc.&quot; 10 min later...&quot;I HATE you, you're destroying my life, you (blank, blank blank)!!!Since he taken this, his obsessive mood, and mood swings have diminished greatly. He doesn't see it as I do, but he takes it for me. For I WILL leave him, if he doesn't. It got that bad. It's a miracle drug. It does everything is says, and more. Celexa and Lexapro are chemically similar. Both work well in the same catagory.

My doctor said the anxiety attacks was my body's way of telling me something was wrong. He first tried me on venlafaxine(generic Celexa) but they made me so sick with just one dose that I couldn't take them. He switched me to Lexapro and at first I was still having problems but what I didn't realize was that you have to give these medicines time to work. It's been a couple of weeks and I'm definetly feeling better. I would recommend Lexapro for it's ease of use and it's lack of side effects. For me anyway there where no side effects.

I began at 5 mg and then slowly worked my way to 20 mg which is what I have taken for more than two years now.  The medication has little if any side effects and has helped me recover to the point of travelling again - a major factor in my anxiety.  I would recommend starting slow and working your way to the level that best fits.

My dr prescribed it to me after signs of depression.  He started me out on 10mg and after two weeks I will begin taking 20mg.  I can already feel the difference.  I already feel like the &quot;old me&quot;. I am smiling and laughing again.  I'm not crying everyday and getting aggravated with everything and everyone.  I read where people were having problems sleeping and with weight gain.  I haven't noticed any side effects so far.  The only thing I have noticed is I don't have the appetite I used to have (and I'm not complaining), if this leads to weight loss, that would be great and I have noticed increased sweating but again that seems to me like it will lead to weight loss so I'm not complaining.

I have gained a little weight while on this medication, but not enough to worry about.  It seems to work very well for the depression, but only mediocre for the anxiety.

I work with the same people I used to go to church with and even the same person he had an affair with so I was a wreck. I took this medicine only being 22 and the first day I felt high as a kite. There after I just felt really loopy and couldnt get my thoughts straight. Once I had been on it for a week, I couldnt sleep at night and then it stopped working. It's like my depression got worst and I was crying non stop all day long. I was really better off without it. I stopped taking it and feel much better without it. I was only taking 10 mg, but I felt out of my body almost. I will never touch those pills again.

I am also weaning off hormone replacement and am 54. I had been taking Xanax for the moments that were off the chart and the doctor recommended Lexapro. Started on Lexapro 4 weeks ago. Side effect of nausea was for 4 solid days and it passed. Now I'm suffering from insomnia and decreased libido much to the chagrin of my new husband. Would welcome info from others if the insomnia and decreased libido will cease and desist like the nausea did.

It did help my concentration/focus to stay on task.  I wasn't aware that my frustration had become anxiety.  I started at 10mg and lowered to 5mg.  I am going off of Lexapro and back to Zoloft as I experienced bouts of anger which are uncommon for me and I occasionally got teary. I was a bit more focused with Lexapro but overall was more even on Zoloft.

Why is that the knee jerk reaction from Dr's?  Here... take this drug that is going to make you so exhausted, and then suggest increasing the dose.  I was then sent to a Neurologist who prescribed anti-siezure meds.  Yeah, kick-backs! As long as we show up and keep paying they will keep taking us for that ride!  I am stopping by the grace of God!  What about life balance, why don't Dr's talk about that?

It seemed like it helped take the edge off of my anxiety for a while, but it seemed like the depression symptoms increased.  Overall, I am not a fan.

My doctor okayed it but after a while I wanted to go back on again and ended up in the emergency room as my body from head to neck (thankfully not my face) was one big rash).  I was told when you stop Lexapro and then begin agsin you become allergic to it.  Who knew?

For the first two months I was taking 10 mg and found myself to be very lethargic.  The doctor reduced my scrip to half a pill, 5mg a day and soon got my energy back.  Since then 5 mg a day has worked for me. I am 4' 11 at 124 lbs and 35 years old.  I was told I wouldn't gain weight on this script and I find that to be true. I have no other side effects except for what it feels like, muscle spasm. Nothing severe and tollerable vs PMS issues I had.  I am happy to have found something that works for me! But, please be patient and tolerate the first 6 weeks of side effects, I found that to be the norm and subsides as soon as your body adjusts. Coming from my experience of course.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/29/2009 3:38:03 AM	I started taking Lexapro about 3 months ago and I have found this medication to be wonderful. I no longer feel such intense anxiety. Several people mentioned drowsiness as a side effect. I began taking the med at night since I also cannot tolerate the drowsiness during the day. The only drawback is difficulty reaching orgasm and decreased libido. Other than that the drug has proven extremely beneficial.

I have bad stomach cramps and I have trouble focusing on what I am doing, not so good if you are driving.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/27/2009 4:49:58 PM	I have tried other antidepressants in the past (effexor, zoloft, wellbutrin) and was dissatisfied with the results. Effexor took away the &quot;lows&quot; but is also took away the &quot;highs&quot; so that I felt emotionally &quot;neutral&quot; all the time. I now take Lexapro 20mg daily and I finally feel like I'm back to my normal self (and I haven't noticed any side effects). It's like I've found the right &quot;key&quot; to fit the receptors in my brain. I've been taking Lexapro for 5 yrs and I never want to stop! I consider it a maintenance medication. My advice is keep trying different antidepressants if one doesn't work for you; you just might find the &quot;key&quot; to fit your brain receptors.

I hated it.  I am a busy body and am not usually the type to sleep all day and Lexapro made me sick and tired all of the time.  I had headaches, stomach pains, drowsiness, and body aches all the time.  I would not suggest it to anyone.

Not acceptable. The lethargy probably to blame for upped weight, but I work out daily and have spent years getting healthy. I need to function at full speed, and this is just not the one. Is it possible to have it all? Anxiety has plagued me my whole life with much detriment to my career, marriage and well-being. Other drugs I've taken helped with anxiety, but not like Lex. Any suggestions? Doc did mention Wellbutrin, but I've seen the same issues mentioned with regard to se.

I take it at night and do not experience any of the side effects.  I was hesitant about taking medication for anxiety but I'm very glad I did (so is the rest of my family).  My insurance doesn't cover it...it's pricey but worth it!
Lexapro+Oral	Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	19-24	7/25/2009 10:58:49 PM	I took Lexapro for a little over two years mostly to help with anxiety and OCD. It worked extremely well for the first two years. Then I rapidly gained almost 20 pounds and could barely get out of bed, and I also started feeling depressed for the first time in my life. I don't know what happened--it's like my body just decided to stop tolerating it. I was slowly weened off of it and then went another 2 years without taking anything because this experience was so bad. Now I'm back in therapy due to more anxiety issues but am starting Prozac. Bottom line: everyone's body reacts differently to antidepressants, and this drug was effective for a while. I must admit having negative feelings about it due to a friend's brother that died while on it. If you are concerned about weight gain, try something else. My new doctor says people typically gain at least 5-8 pounds on Lexapro.

It has been very effective preventing anymore panic attacks and somewhat effective treating my anxiety disorder. It has not been very effective treating my depression.The side effects for me have been constant difficulty getting, maintaing an erection and ejaculating. It also has made getting to sleep a little difficult and made me kind of sluggish.Oerall I'm grateful because it stopped the panic attacks cold and they are a horroe to live through so I will continue to take it until I can find something as effective w/o the side affects.

The nausea was horrible.  It felt like someone was holding a hot poker to the inside of my stomach.  I was spaced out all the time and could not concentrate or focus on anything.  I was tired all the time too.  I think it actually made my depression worse.  My doctor switched me to Effexor and it has made a world of difference.

I had severe suiside thoughts, and came very close to doing it, I'd spend hours and hours thinking about how to do it.  I thought about it befor, but never seriously.  It was so bad, I stoped it about half a year ago and I can't believe I really thought about doing that.  I cried all the time, it was worse than just the depression I was having.  It just drove me so deep.  So for me, it didn't work.

Im off of it now and miss how it helped me rationalize

I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for about 10 years. I have had a multitude of heath problems that were caused by the axiety such as sinus and ear problems, headaches and dizzines, that are all cured now since going on this medication. I can't even believe the difference. It was getting so bad at one point that I started to not be able to go out to grocery stores, church, my son's school concerts etc. Now that's all changed. The only negative side effect is the weight gain I went from about 125 to about 132 because it makes you starving all the time, but I am dieting now and doing well. I hope this helps someone out there!

It greatly diminished my anxiety. I'm only taking 10 mg / day, which I think is perfect. It didn't change my personality at all; it just made me able to express my personality without fear of its social scrutiny. In addition, my libido is greater than or equal to what it was before I started taking it six weeks ago.

I was astounded at the improvement in my mental state within the first 10-14 days.  I realize now how much anxiety and depression was impacting my life.  I no longer feel 'bedeviled' by negative thoughts, anger, helplessness or other repetitive thoughts which really controlled my ability to function optimally.  During this time I also passed thru menopause; and either that or the lexapro may be to blame for decreased memory (short term) and slight weight gain.  Regardless, the improvement on Lexapro has been significant enough (as noted by my family as well) to be well worth memory loss or wt. gain; if indeed it is to blame.  I should also say the anxiety issues are genetic; my mothers family displaying the same type of behaviors I have personally experienced throughout my adolescence and adult life.  I am now 54 and retired from 32 years full time healthcare management (originally RN).

Lexapro along with xanax has helped alot.  This drug also helps me sleep and controls any racing thoughts or fears I may fixate on. I recommend this drug to anyone who has anxiety and/or panic attacks for sure. I take 20mg once a day with 2 mgs total of xanax per day.

If I missed one dose I would become manic for three days to a week afterwards. I gained at least 20 lbs. 5 mgs started to lose its effectivness after a year so my md increased the lexapro to 10mg.After about two weeks I did not want to leave my bed, had suicidal thoughts, memory loss, and had numbness in my face - I thought I was having a stroke!6 hours in the er and an mri with no real conclusions -I am meeting with my doctor in the morning to get me off of this drug!

Im on 20mlg, and was actually thinking about upping the dose.  Plus Im talking to a therapist.  I dont know if thats good either.  I just dont know.  I have issues!  no answers!  Last time Lexapro seemed to help, this time I hate life. maybe its the pill, maybe its the therapy.

I switched to lexapro and I have enjoyed it alot with no side effects at all other than 10 pounds of weight loss the first month. Have only been on lexapro for 2 months no but I am really pleased with it so far. Helps my anxiety alot and my general mood my wife says has improved tremendously.

It totally works for me. My weight has been up and down but nothing drastic.When I feel good I eat more and when I'm upset I don't eat. As far as my Libedo goes, since menopause it hasn't been the same so I don't really attribute it to the lexapro.

The medicine is working well to as far as dealing with the anxiety, but I am a newlywed who is completely in love with my beautiful wife, and yet I suddenly have no sexual desire and it is nearly impossible to reach an orgasm.  What other options are available that do not cause these sexual side effects?

I was on this medicine for the severe depression for months taking the highest dose prescribed, and the only thing I got out of it was a whole lot of sleep. When I mean a whole lot of sleep I mean I did not have the will or the drive to get out of bed. Good thing I was always asleep because my suicidal thoughts and feelings of unworthiness were worse off on the medicine then off. I never experienced any weight gain because I never got out of bed to eat.

I was having anxiety issues at the same time.  Tried Celexa, but didn't work too well.  Now on Lexapro 20 mg day and seems to be working well.  Am tired sometimes and have put on a few pounds, but I can deal with that compared to being anxious and miserable all the time.  I take it at night so I sleep through some of the side effects.  Have some periods of fog, but don't seem to last too long.  Had a glass of wine the other night and it sent me for a loop.  Overall, I am much happier and can tolerate things in my daily life much better.  My whole family has noticed a difference.  No interest in sex though. Have to work harder at it.

No major side effects, just a little memory problems sometimes (minor) and nausea in the a.m. Its not a magic bullet, still have some dysthymia but am afraid to go off since Ive had major depressions since childhood.Ive tried a bunch of things, Prozac worked best but stopped working after a number of years. As for the weight gain, its not that ive gained weight but with all of the exersize I do I should be thinner than I am. Makes it harder to lose weight.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	iJane, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/7/2009 6:17:46 PM	Meds made me sick as a dog, morning sickess is more enjoyable. I was on it for just over a month. I didn't get out of bed, had the &quot;I dont give a crap&quot; attitude. My teens noticed it made me worse too. Made me more depressed and felt 'wonky' all the time, spaced out. It gave me 'memory holes' and still have trouble with recall ever since. My ability to orgasm was ruined by this drug and 9 mos later still no orgasmic ability. Before the drug I was multi-orgasmic. During the drug course no desire for sex at all. I gained about 5 lbs yet my appetite had died and I was not eating. Drank a lot of water when I was awake though! Majorly dehydrated. Argued with dr &quot;I'd rather be aware of my surroundings than sick as a dog.&quot; He told me I should stay on it--me think &quot;KICK BACKS&quot;.Changed physican and no longer depressed. Imagine that!

It didn't help the depression. My Dr raised the dose and it still didn't help. Soon later I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I never had a problem w/ it before and it was before stopping treatment w/ the lexapro so it wasn't just withdrawl. I have known other people as well who had the same side effects which aren't noted on the drug facts. Now after 7 months of no help I am going to have to remain on thyroid medications for the remainder of my life and continue having blood work done every 3 to 4 months to test my thyroid hormone levels thanks to this drug. I was diagnosed 5 years ago with hypothyroidism. As a teenager, to hear I'd have to be on medicine for the rest of my life because of a medication that didn't present all the facts, I was horrified.

I am back to normal again after trying a for a few months to just gut it out without meds. Only real side effect I feel is I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, but once I get going I am fine. Overall it is definitely worth it.

This medicine make me feel disconnected, don't care or worry about anything. I start having memory lost, swing mood, and I really wasn't my self anymore, I was like a robot (no feelings) I even think about suicide. Life have up and down, we need to feel it by, laughing, crying, worring, etc.and work with it.  I been drug free for 2 months, and I feel better off.  The days I want to cry (trust me I have my reasons) I just cry!!!, but mostly I don't want a pill to control my emotions any more, I just deal and work with them. I'm a human been, Some days I'm sad, but most days I'm happy and feel my self again.

Lexapro, in addition to therapy, helped me get out of bed and live again! I have not experienced any negative side effects... oh, I did miss 2-3 days of 20mg and found myself to be emotional intolerant of things I can tolerate when I am taking the meds!  It took me a few days after I started my regimine again to &quot;shake&quot; the blues.  I am very pleased with the impact it has made in my life!

Depression lifted. Day 2 I noticed a funny tingling in my cheek. day 3 I noticed the tingling in my leg and arm. By day 4 I had severe pain in my hand. I stopped taking Lexapro, and each day i felt the tingling, pain and numbness decrease. Also by day 4 I noticed excessive sweating, nausia and diarea. These also resolved after I stopped taking the med.

Still have days when I'm &quot;down&quot; but mostly only after a poor night's sleep.  Mild side effects at first, but they have resolved and were still easier to deal with than depression. Didn't know I could actually ENJOY life!  Highly recommend trying this medication.

It works great, I take 10mg every other day.  Side effects included immediate 15 lb weight gain, increased appetite and decreased libido.  Since my Dr. warned me of the weight gain I'm able to tell myself I'm not really hungry, it is the medicine.  I exercise 5 days a week and am back to my original weight.

I started with a 10mg dose and after 6 weeks of still feeling constantly depressed, I was increased to 20mg. What a difference! The only side effects I had was severe dizziness and feeling &quot;spaced out&quot; the first week or so, but that went away. I have experieced NO weight gain like others have said. I have tried other medications in the past and this by far has had the best results with the least amount of side effects. I reccomend it highly!

My doctor put me on Lexapro, and it was like a miracle drug for about 6 months. I gained some weight, lost my libido, and was unable to attain orgasm.  Decided I'd had enough &amp; wanted to know if I could live without.  No one  told me about SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome (aka withdrawal symptoms).  I got brain zaps in my head which were annoying; they have mostly gone away after a month, and I feel myself again.

Lexapro+Oral	Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	6/29/2009 6:27:23 PM	I have been on this med for about a year.  Up until I got on it, I was unaware that I suffered from anxiety.  I just thought that was how people are supposed to feel.  When I got this drug, my life changed for the better.  I felt better than I ever had before and I was only on the 10 mg dose.  I really liked it, but after a few months this     great feeling was starting to subside.  I asked my dr to put me on the 20 mg so that i could maintain my great feeling.  After taking the 20 mg for a while, I never got that great feeling back.  I think my body started to get used to it.  I still take it and went back to the 10 mg dosage.  I am not as anxious as I once was, but I have not been able to get back to that great feeling that I had in the beginning.  Overall, I like it.  I think that euphoric feeling is normal at the beginning.  Additionally, I had some insomnia at the beginning, but that has subsided also.  I recommend this drug.

I always said I was moody but then my doctor prescribed Lexpro. I am happy, don't worry nearly as much and I don't have the up and downs with my moods.

I started out with 10mg,three months later uped to 20mg, now I'm on 30mg. daily. I thought I was doing better, but then A started gaining weight, almost three dress size. That just made me more depressed, besause I have been trying so hard to lose weight. Then I ran out for over a month. I tought I was lossing myself all over again.I didn't even want to get out of bed. I am a single mother with three kids so you can just imagine how hard it was for me, just to sturggle to get moving. Then on top of everything I showed symptoms of Insomnia. I now take 100mg Trazidone nightly just to go to sleep. There has to be something better out there.

I liked the effect it had on my anxiety and that it made me more mellow, but I could barely stay awake. Other side effect was weight gain.  I forgot to take it many times and never had any withdrawal symptoms.

After seeking help in 2008 was diagnosed with GAD and prescribed Lexipro. It completely erased my previous fears and anxiety and allowed me once again to enjoy travel and extensive 24/7 time with people I cared about. No side effects at all in my case and only hope it assists others and can make the same difference in their lives as it did in mine.

I get samples from my doctor because the perscription is too much. I ran out of meds and the doctor was not in and my apt was 4 days after the weekend so I just thought, 7 days without it, i will be okay!!!! Wrong, I have been going through sheer agony. Terrible withdraw symptopms, Horrofic vivid dreams/nighmares. I have brain feezes, cant even remember my own husbands name, or why i walked into a room. I woke up this morning just crawling out of my skin, shivering and had intense thoughts of suicide. I read on several forums this could last a few weeks!!! I am supposed to go get more of the drug today, But I refuse to risk my life to a drug that can have this kind of effect on me if I ever go off of it, even for a few days. I am in HELL!!!!

It may help otherwise, but I have had not-good symptoms while getting off it: dizziness, confusion, so I am grateful for the comments others have had will getting off this. Sex issues? Gosh, I did not think they may come from this drug, but it's another reason to try getting off it (no pun intended).

(Took 10mg daily.) I was having some moderate depression and anxiety associated with worry about kids and parents and getting older and did feel better after a month or two.  Was also working with a therapist.  I might have had some sexual side effects and mild weight gain but it's really hard to know whether those were from the drug or the mental condition.  I went off cold turkey four months later as I was feeling better and didn't have any withdrawal effects.  Was it the meds?  Therapy?  Onset of the cheery spring season?  Bad thoughts just coming and going?  Impossible to say.  Might need to go back on if symptoms return. Would rather just take Xanax as I know that works but can't be on that long term.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	35-44	6/23/2009 12:07:14 AM	This drug worked well for treating depression with very few side effects (mild loss of libido), however, if you EVER have a doctor tell you to quit this cold turkey (or want to do so yourself) - DON'T!!!I followed my Dr's advice to go cold turkey, and I ended up in the ER with a BP of 190/124 and a horrible crawling sensation all over my body like I had to keep moving and couldn't hold still. I was stuck in the median on the freeway and it was all I could do to drive to the hospital. I threw up all over my car and was sweating profusely.  The only thing that made the symptoms subside was to go back on it.  I had to taper my dose for 2 weeks to get off it.  My Dr. thought I was full of it and didn't believe that I had an adverse reaction to quitting cold turkey. I would strongly advise against that, despite what your Dr. might tell you.
Lexapro+Oral	Major Depressive Disorder	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	6/22/2009 10:47:15 PM	For the past two years, I've gone from being slightly depressed to being majorly depressed. I couldn't sleep but when I did, I never could make myself get up and around the next day. I would cry at the drop of a hat and my moods were insane. My doctor tried me on Celexa, which was the worst drug ever for me. I never had a problem with anxiety until I started that drug &amp;&amp; once I did, it just added to my problem. She then decided to start me on Lexapro 10mg and I've been on it for a little over a month and I think it is amazing. I can deal with things so much easier than I used to, my whole outlook on everything is just so much better.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	axlerose, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	25-34	6/22/2009 8:36:21 PM	WARNING. Lexapro has been know to unmask bipolar that would otherwise remain hidden. I was prescribed Lexapro 10MG after a move to a new city and promotion. At first it was great and I felt better than I every had before I started on the medication. After 3 or 4 months, I started to feel too good and started displaying signs of hypomania (high part of bipolar). This effected every relationship, both personal and professional in my life, but I didn't care at the time and I stayed on the medication. After I realized that Lexapro had uncovered a hidden hypomania activity, I weened off of it, taking 5MG a day for two weeks then 5MG everyother day. After I was off Lexapro for a month, I returned to major depression that was way worse than the original episode. The good feelings associated with Lexapro are artifical and it commonly will &quot;unmask&quot; bipolar activities. I was never aware of this risk and no doctor talked about it untill it was too late. Use with caution, Lexapro had large negative long term effects in my life.

It was the longest period I've had without a major depressive episode. 3 months ago I decided to go off it and see how i did. Unfortunately I did it on my own, with working with my doc, and went off cold turkey. Several weeks later I had a major crash and have been in a depression ever since. I went right back on the lexapro, but unfortunately it no longer works for my depression, even at a higher dose. I had heard that a small percentage of people experience this when going off and back on an anti depressant. So, now I'm going to try a different AD, pristiq and see how that goes.

Side effects were wird. Sexually could not finish but that goes away after about 1 month.

I didn't want sex. I was so tired of feeling so blaah. So I went to my Dr and told her I couldn't deal with Zoloft any more. She perscribed Lexapro and within a week I was joking around and going places. I am so glad I asked for another antidepssant. I feel a million times better not to mention my relationship has improved dramatically. During my years on Zoloft, I tried a number of other meds like Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Paxil,and one or two more but always had to go back to Zoloft because they either didn't control my depression or made me feel very angry. I love my new med!!!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	6/17/2009 3:12:01 PM	I have been on Lexapro for one year. I am afraid to stop taking it becaue of scary withdrawal stories and from fear that the depression/ anxiety will return. I used to not be able to ride in an elevator without holding my breath and sweating. I found after a few weeks on Lexapro, I can pretty much handle anything without anxiety. My moods are much more stable now also. I am down to taking 5 mg every other day and I think its the perfect dose for me. But if I miss that dose, I get a terrible headache. Negatives- strange dreams, 15 lb weight gain that might have been due to my previous depression. I noticed that when I was taking Lexapro everyday, my resting heart rate was in the 40's! Almost the same as hypothyroidism! That would explain the weight gain. Overall , it seems to be working

The only drawback to the drug are the withdrawal symptoms if you miss a dose or have to stop taking it. These can be severe and last for weeks.

Doctor didn't believe that was the issue so left me on until all had been exhausted. Definitely the Lexapro. Unfortunately, it's the best thing in the world! I felt so good all the time. For the past year I've been on Cymbalta and now switching to Prozac.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	6/16/2009 12:24:08 PM	I have been on Lexapro for depression for 1 year.  After starting Lamictal, my doctor and I decided to take me off of the drug, Lexapro.  He had me take half pills for a week and then stop.  That was a bad idea!  I became extremely dizzy and sleepy! EXTREME, no driving, nothing.  I went to urgent care to see what was wrong and they told me I was having withdrawls.  I went back on Lexapro and I was perfectly fine in 2 days.  My doctor said next time we try taking me off it might be over months, not weeks.  Think about this if you decide to get off.

Didn't like that feeling.  And as someone else posted in having bizaar thoughts, so was I.  Not only bizaar, but bad thoughts.  This was not me at all.  So I weaned myself off, but the blues came back so back to the doctor to get on something else, which I am now on Effexor XR.  She did say something that I thought to be unprofessional which was &quot;Our grandmothers didn't seem to be having all these problems and just shook it off&quot;.  I'm sorry, yes our grandmothers worked physically harder than we do today, but people in this day and time have a lot more social issues to deal with than our grandparents ever had to.  We are living in a world that keeps going faster and we are trying to keep up with it.  We are a stressed out nation, sad to say.  I do remember a time in my life when LIFE was much simpler than it is today.

I was having anxiety and was unable to sleep.  Now most nights I can fall asleep- but not every night.  Before taking lexapro it wouldn't take much for me to cry- and now I feel less affected by little things that normally shouldn't make someone cry.  It's helped my relationship- I'm much more relaxed.  I read that some people have gained weight, before going on lexapro I had dropped from 125 to 110 1bs... and now I've been steady at 110 lbs.

Felt better after a few days but this did not last. I've gone right back to where I was before taking the drug with just a few exceptions: 1. I feel nauseated all of the time 2. Achieving an orgasim is impossible 3. on the up-side my thought process has cleared somewhat. I have been reading other reviews about the &quot;zapped&quot; feeling you get when you try to quit taking Lexapro. I went through the same thing with Paxil and MY GOD IT WAS HELL!! I am getting off this stuff right now. I DO NOT want to go through that again. I suggest to anyone considering Lexapro to think seriously first.

However, Im on the brink of stopping due to feeling sleepy all the time (on 10 hrs sleep) and sexual side effects.. low desire, inability to FINISH in a timely fashion!

I later found out that I had been misdiagnosed and am bipolar.  The Lexapro made me gain quite a bit of weight &amp; it made me forget things ALOT!  I would be in the middle of a conversation &amp; completely forget what I was talking about.  This drug did not help me at all and ended up making me feel worse.  I am on a combination of Zoloft &amp; Carbamazapine now &amp; feel great.  Everyone, be careful taking Lexapro &amp; make sure to tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the side effects, in the long run they are so not worth it.

I can't tell if my weight gain is from the medication or hormones since I am almost 41.  He doubled my dosage last week but I honestly am considering going back on wellebutrin....i felt much better on it.  I  have no energy and nap every chance I get.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	really lost it!, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	6/8/2009 6:27:03 PM	I had a devastating reaction to this drug which I reported to the FDA. The side effects grew worse as time went on. On the third week of taking it, I began to experience bizzare thoughts, memory loss (forgot how to use my windshield wipers), lightheaded out-of-body sensations, increased insomnia, compulsiveness and weight gain. By the fourth week, I became psychotic...I made crisis phone calls to strangers, ended friendships, became violent and broke neighbor's windows in addition to trashing my own house, and actually contemplated suicide.  These behaviors are/were totally out-of-character for me and I am absolutely certain the Lexapro caused the behaviors. I really 'lost my mind' on this drug.  It took almost three weeks to wean off this drug, and I was an emotional and mental mess throughout it all. It took a long time for my brain to recover from it, and it added to my depression....

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	leary, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	6/7/2009 7:20:00 PM	I have only taken Lexapro for one day and am very concerned about taking it any more based on the MANY reviews I've read on multiple websites.I have been under sustained stress (i.e., sickness, death, post-menopause, having to care for disabled family members, finances, etc., etc.) and finally realize that I just can't do it all.  So, I went to my doctor who prescribed 10mg./day.Took the first one yesterday - and while I was okay for the most part, I just felt strange -- probably a bit anxious.  I also take Xanax (particularly for headaches since it's the only thing that works), and the doctor said to take 2/day along with the lexapro.Stress and increased post-menopausal symptoms are my primary issues right now.  Based on everything I've ready, I'm very leary about taking Lexapro.  In fact, I did not take it today.  Unfortunately, I transferred into a department where I thought opportunities would be better and a healthier work environment, but it's the total opposite.  So, it's multiple issues that have accumulated over time, and everyone has their limit.I will call the doctor tomorrow and see if 5mg a day (or every other day) would be worth a try.  Maybe the 10mg is just too much for me.I'm a very active person and must be able to function at work every day -- not so sure this stuff will improve my ability to do the things I need to do...

Then I had the misfortune of stepping on a scale, boy was I surprised to find that I had gained 20 lbs on this medicine...which made no sense considering I walk a minimum of 4 miles each day.  I have since been switched to Zoloft &amp; it is working great (without the weight gain).  I hope Lexapro works for some of you, just be careful not to let the weight get as out of control as I did.

I have been on it now for 2 weeks, and I do not get nearly as tired anymore.  I am still exhausted but I think thats from my stress.  If anyone wants to talk to me, feel free to email me, or IM me at br0kenheartxcore@aol.com

Genetic background had history of depression in family. Lexapro cleared up everything and gave me a refreshed out look on life. If worked well and is still working for me. I do not experience depression and find I can enjoy life again. No more straying thoughts of paranoia either. I feel like a different person. Did experience stress when first taking it and nerves seemed a bit frayed yet after a few weeks I adapted and the nerves relaxed.

I am on 5mg of Abilify and 10mg of Lexapro. Sometimes less is more. This combo for major depression has worked. I have been on Lexapro for 4 weeks and on Abilify for 6 months. For the 1st week I felt worse but stuck with it. The only adverse side effect now from Lexapro is the anorgasmia. My doctor has prescribed 150 MG of Wellbutrin XL (Eon Labs-Buproprion XL 150mg) to counter the anorgasmia but I have only been on it for 1 day so we will see if it helps. I am praying it helps without adverse side effects.

Been taking Lexapro for at least 6-7 years.  I have gained 50 lbs. but I am sane.  I cannot exist without medication.  I see in these blogs that people give up too easily.  What's more important to you?  A few side effects, weight gain, loss of sex drive OR death by suicide?  Life in a mental facility.  Some of you might not need these medications at all.  Some seem to be using it because you're unhappy.  Do any of you realize what it means to be truly mentally ill.  Lexapro is my lifesaver.  I take 40mg daily plus 150mg Wellbutrin, plusTrazodone at bedtime.  Please give the meds a chance to work no matter what you're on.  Sometimes it takes 3-4 weeks to have an affect.

After only an hour of being on this medication it had made my anxiety so severe that I was literally trying to scratch my spine out of my neck. It seems like I am one of the very few people who have an adverse reaction to this drug but I never have and doubt I ever will feel as bad as I did when I took it.

It DID NOT help with any of my symptoms. Worse of all it made me tired ALL THE TIME!!!!!! There was not a moment i was not tired and working a full time job and taking care of three kids on my own it was unbearable. I was worse off than before!!! I would advise to look at symptoms and think seriously of them before starting this med. i have switched to Zoloft and am a better person....no more tiredness. Good luck with all starting out with lexapro. It may work for you but sure did not work for me.

I was a lunatic and a completely different person. It totally altered my personality and it wasn't pretty. Two people I know experienced some of the same issues as I did on this medication.

The first day was easy going for never being on medication like this before. No side effects other then dry mouth and slightly lightened colors (that was confusing). Although, about a week or two later, I started to get very extreme dreams,something like being Ironman. Anyways, The first day was like a miracle compared to the day before ridden with full of anxiety, and nervous moments. I'm not 100% sure if I personally want to continue with this just because of the dreams,and inability to orgasm easily anymore. I do recommend that it is taken at night, it totally knocks me out, sleep fairly well till the dreams. But over all, after hearing things about other drugs of this type, This has been a very good experience for a first-timer such as myself  :)

It worked ok, but the side effects can be horrible. Even after this long, I still have memory problems and sometimes pretty severe headaches, on top of other issues. It controlled my panic attacks pretty well, but the side effects are getting to me. The withdrawal from this medication isn't pleasant either with nausea, more headaches and the occassional crying fits, but worth it in my eyes to be free of this medication and easier to manage with behavior mod therapy. I know it's worked wonders for others, but it's just not for me.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	5/31/2009 6:02:28 PM	Before I was put on a lexapro- nine months before I had had a miscarriage. it was devestating of course, but I somehow convienced myself I was fine. Months later, I had moved in with my boyfriend, and would constantly find new girls he was talking to in his phone. I eventually got to the point where I wouldnt want to leave the house, doing fun things was like a chore I had to make myself do. I was contantly anxious and would think up any worse case scenerio I could. I eventually had a breakdown, and had gotten physical with loved ones. Which is extremely outside of my character. I broke down and decided I couldn't live with myself and push any more friends and family away from me anymore. The dr. diagnosed me with severe depression- with mild anxiety. I began on 10mg and three weeks later I was switched to 20mg (because I would still get a little irritated at nite when the meds when begin to ware off). I noticed right away I was beginning to feel better, I started talking to my friends more and just began &quot;loving&quot; everyone like I used to. I enjoy going out and being social again. A huge weight lifted off my shoulders. Which is good when you're only 22. I don't dwell on the past anymore and I'm not so in my head and not as angry. I'm more independent. This drug is very expensive and has made me very tired. I could sleep all day everyday if I wanted to. But anyway- I didnt realise how bad I used to be until now, it's no way to live.

I have started taking it again working my way up to a higher dose, but I can tell the diffrence it has made in just the 3 weeks I have been back on it.  It will make me space out from time to time when I am alone I relize I have no random thoughts and my mind is at peace.  A stange feeling for someone who is always thinking 2 days ahead. I am hoping to have the same reaction to treatment as last time but I think I will be on it longer than the 8 months this time around. Dealing with my fathers illnes and moving back home to tend to him has put me in a state of depression that I have not felt in many many years, but with the help of this med and other treatment I know I will be out of this depression sooner then I think.

I was at the point where I wouldn't even leave my house. I wouldn't drive and wouldn't go anywhere because I feared having a panic attack.  That also led to depression.  I started taking Lexapro and within a month felt extremely better.  The only side effects I had were yawning all the time and trouble sleeping during the first two weeks.  I also gained about 25 pounds in a years time.  I tapered off the Lexapro after being on it for a year because I felt I was &quot;Fixed&quot;  now it's about 6 months later and my anxiety has come back worse.  Doc tried putting me back on Lexapro and it didn't work this time, made my anxiety worse.  I've tried Pristiq, Zoloft, and am now trying Cymbalta.  I wish I would have never stopped taking Lexapro.  It really was working wonders for me and gave me my life back.

However, I have weaned myself off of it under doctor's care and find myself very weepy.  I'm not depressed but I feel like all the tears I hadn't cried were stored up and now being released.  That does not change my evaluation of the med, though.

After 3 days I felt as if someone had pressed a reset button and I was back to my normal self.  Every little thing dealing with teenagers no longer makes me crazy. Yawning and headaches disappeared after the first week.  Do do still have a stiff neck, and most disappointing is the inability to reach orgasm, something that was always rather easy to do before.  I will talk to my doctor about this.  Now that I have read many of these reviews I am concerned about stopping lexapro and wonder what I have started.

The only side effect I have had is being tired most of the time, which is a fair trade off in my opinion for the benefits it has given me.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	5/26/2009 12:58:14 AM	I have been taking 30 mg of lexapro and 300 of wellbutrin for almost 3 years, and how I wish that I had not resisted this for so long--my whole life could have been different.  I finally gave in because I could not get out of bed and when I did, my anger always sent me back to bed.  These meds don't make you indifferent to problems--as my 25 year old son is afraid--they honestly help your true self come out, you know the person you can't believe that others don't see in you.

I resisted meds until I became absolutely suicidal.  I felt an immediate change within three days of starting Lexapro.  I was very drowsy, nauseous, and my vision was impaired, but that gave way quickly.  However, two weeks later, the beneficial effects disappeared and I experienced a rough drop back into depression, sadness, and anxiety.  Another week later, everything was stabilized, and each month on Lexapro has given me a gradually better quality of mental health.  It does, however, play havoc with your memory and sex drive.  I still feel unmotivated, but the initial sluggishness I felt at the beginning is slowly evaporating.  I made the proper choice. Skipping a dose isn't a problem for a day or two, but withdrawal is very unpleasant.  I recommend very gradual titration if you want to stop taking it for whatever reason.

I don't contemplate suicide but am depressed a lot, seemingly without reason.  Seven months ago my doctor prescribed Lexapro so I tried the 10mg dose.  It took a week or two to feel a change but it definitely works for me.  My wife tells me I'm a lot easier to live with and frankly I feel more comfortable most of the time.  I'm certainly much less depressed than before.  I recommend it for those that reap its benefits.  Like any drug, it's probably not for everyone.  However there are some negative considerations as well.  It's harder to wake up in the morning.  I take naps when I can.  Sometimes I fall asleep reading a book, where I never used to.  Sexual desire is down but not gone.  I don't feel it has inhibited an erection but sometimes reaching orgasm can be difficult.  I guess that's why they make Viagra.  Another thing to consider is, don't miss a dose.  I failed to take it one morning and noticed I was a bit more grouchy than usual that day.  I took it the following day and was so spaced out at work that I hope I never forget to take it again.  I was forgetting people's names I had known for a while.  Familiar things were unfamiliar.  It was scary.  The following days were fine as long as I stay on the drug.  I've heard it was hard discontinuing usage of Lexapro now I believe it.  The positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me.

I have taken just about every anti-depressant there is and hated the way they made me feel and LOOK. When I was on Paxil, I gained about 15-20 lbs and I am a slim, small-boned person. I was not eating more, so I could not figure out why this was happening. Anyway, I weaned off Paxil and was on nothing for a while. I was going through a very difficult time personally. Then the flu-like symptoms of fibro returned as well as depression and anxiety. I discussed this with a psychiatrist and asked to be put on Lexapro (recommended to me). She said that would be a good choice for me as it is &quot;weight neutral.&quot; I have been on Lexapro 40mg for about 3 years and it has been a good choice for me. After reading some of the reviews, I wonder if I should be taking Lexapro at night instead of in the morning. My fatigue level is high most of the time. Now I am thinking it may be due, in part, to the Lexapro.
Lexapro+Oral	Other	mskeen25, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	5/22/2009 1:17:08 PM	At age 25 I had a full hysterectomy. I started with hot flashes and everything else. I started hormone treatment for those symptoms, but my mood swings were still there, and my IBS and acid reflux starting going through the roof. Taking lexapro has made my symptoms so much better. I have gained about 20 lbs but it can be taken care of. I have since lost 12 pounds so it just takes time to get used of. As a mother of 3 small children, lexapro helps me to deal with their yelling and fighting. IT just relaxes me more a lot more than without it.

Scared regarding the side effects on Pristiq.  I lowered my dose of Lexapro to 10mg but the anxiety started to come back.

Don't know if Depression label fits me, more aggitated and tired. I think it is more likely i am just getting to a different stage in my life (pre-menopausal). Going to give this a go once i am off my anti-bidics for a chest infection. i will keep you posted. :-)

I suffered from anxiety, racing thoughts, agitation, etc.  I am now quite stable, but I do not like the sexual side effects.  I find it extremely difficult to reach orgasm which was once easy for me to do.  It feels as though I'm &quot;numb&quot; down there which has caused my husband a great deal of concern.  I am going to talk to my doctor about reducing my dose from 10 mg to 5 mg.
Lexapro+Oral	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	sunny423, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/19/2009 4:41:12 PM	I was diagnosed with Pure O in September which is a form of OCD more focused on obsessive thoughts.  I had constant thought of hurting people which it not me at all.  I am a very loving thoughtful person.  I went through a period of numbness where I didn't feel much once I started taking Lexapro which I did not like at all.  I couldn't feel love, happiness, or joy.....but I also could leave the house and not feel terrified.  After about 3 months of being on Lexapro I am very happy to say that I am a much happier person.  I am back to myself.  Like everyone I have my good days and my bad, but it is no where close to how I was before.  I have not had much weight gain.  A small amount but I chalk that up to the fact that I had lost almost 20lbs when I had my sever OCD.  I would rather have a few extra lbs than not be able to leave my house.  I highly recommend giving this drug a try if suggested.  Like every medication, different things work for different people. Oh and also.....you have got to exercise.  That is no lie when your doctor says that it will help and I imagine that it keeps the weight gain at bay as well.

It did make me stop crying but that was it. I still felt sad and angry. My doctor gave me Effexor to take with it and that made me more manageable but wasn't fully effective. I no longer take those and recently started taking Zoloft due to a worsening in my condition and more frequent panic attacks. I hope that works.

My dr put me on lexapro, and it worked immediately! I had some tingling the first time I took it, which was weird, so I cut it in half and took 5mg instead of 10. It is May, and I started taking it November 5, and I have had 1 panic attack since. There is a downfall...in these 6 months I have gained 22lbs without changing any of my eating habits and I cannot get it off. I've been on a 1200 calorie low fat diet for about three weeks with exercise and NO CHEATING. I have gained 2 lbs. Now I am more miserable than I was before. I would definitely advise you to try something else first. Only use lexapro as your last resort. I am currently weaning off of it, and I have been dizzy, irritable, and had lots of headaches. This is from only taking 5mg!! Please be careful, and check out all these medications before you start taking them.

Lexapro is the only ad that works for me. It instantly lifts my mood and ocd, social anxiety and worrying lessons within one week.Also helps tremendously well for my pmdd. I love this medication, it has saved my life. Side effects are flatulence (hee hee) mild sexual disfunction ( orgasm very mild) and occational stomach pain especailly with mensruation. I sleep much better which is great for me since because of anxiety I suffered from insomnia. No weight changes but notice a card craving I try to ignore.

Strange feeling at times in my head, neck and jaw (an almost tightening/tension/tiredness) and it is usually accompanied by a feeling of nausea - at times  feel I could vomit but never do. I understand side effects could fade away as I adjust, so I hope these will not last. I could not deal with them on a constant basis. I took lexapro back in college with amazing results and little to no side effects over time.

I also experienced some of the lesser side affects but I think you get the idea. Ill take the anxiety attacks over the way I feel on Lexapro any day. (haven't used it since)

I noticed a positive change almost immediately.  It smoothed my emotions out.  I have noticed constipation since the beginning and sleep disturbance.  I have gained weight without explanation.  I have noticed that if I go without it for several weeks or a month that I become tense and feel more anxiety.  I'm weighing my options.

After unsuccessfully trying a number of other common drugs, I was amazed at how lexapro had absolutely no side effects (except for a little sleepiness, which was quite welcome as I had been having difficulty sleeping). Really a simple, effective, low-side-effect drug in my experience of two years.

I no longer suffer form crippling depression or the manic mood swings that would keep me from sleeping for days on end. What used to be a slingshot rollercoaster ride of emotion has become a leisurely drive through the country. For the most part I average 8 hours of sleep a night now instead of 10-12. I can also get to sleep very easily compared to the nights of laying awake for 3-4 hours because my mind wouldn't shut off. I haven't noticed any side affects. I am an artist and haven't noted any lack of creativity or &quot;passion&quot; for my work. In fact quite the opposite. Now that I am for the most part in control of myself, I can tap into that creativity and passion whenever I want. No weight gain, lose or increase of appetite, loss of sex drive, or even any nausea. I control my emotions now, not the other way around. I have just recently moved back to the city where I went to college 10 years ago and reconnected with some old friends who noticed immediately the change in my demeanor and composure, commenting that I seemed to be much happier and in control.

I had always thought of myself as very positive, but I couldn't shake this off and had been depressed for a long time. Three days into taking low dosages I felt like a new person! It was like a burden had been lifted from my shoulders and I felt like my old self. My husband noticed a change immediately. I continue to take them and it has been a year. I was not a believer in anti-depressants before, but I am now!

The my breathing would would turn into hypervenilation. This medication relieved all the symptoms for about 36 hours per dose. One could easily become dependent on this drug. Once you no longer have a need for these pills, get rid of them.

WRONG. Lexapro has helped me to even out my furious mood swings, my extreme anger and rage, and with the constant crying. The only downfalls to the drug would be the sickness and shakiness if taken on an empty stomach. Otherwise its a miracle.

I got put on it for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I would get anxious and constantly worry about EVERYTHING. I would have a panic attack every other day and it was controlling my life. I couldn't control my worrying anymore, when at one time I thought I could. Even though it's only been 2 weeks, I feel a difference. I'm not getting stressed over the small stuff or even yelling at someone for no reason, and I have not had a panic attack -YAY!!!. I feel more like myself again with no side effects. When I first started taking it, I had a loss of appetite, I felt nauseated, and I felt really zoned out, but these passed within a couple of days.

This medication WILL work for you, but you have to give it time.  In the beginning, I experienced chills, increased anxiety, and nausia.  These side effects will go away after the first few weeks.  It is worth it to ride through the rough few weeks because this medication has especially helped me with anxiety.  I would say that after 3 months, you will really begin to see the full benefit of the medication.  I gained a few pounds, but with exercise and diet, you can maintain normal weight.  Having a good support system around is a very crucial part to feeling better as well.  Hope this helps you and, feel better!!

I couldnt sleep, screamed at my kids over little things, stressed out over everything and just didnt enjoy what a good life I have. Talked to my female doctor who understood exactly what I was going through and had me try this. I can sleep, I dont scream at the kids and I can relax and enjoy life.  I have noticed some weight gain which I am NOT happy about, but otherwise I am happy with it.

I have tried probably all the anti-depressant drugs and none of them helped me except Prozac to a certain extent, but Lexapro by far is the best.  However all anti-depressants make me sleepy, so I'm prescribed adderal to keep me awake.

I came to this site today because I ran out of Lexapro and without taking it for 3 days feel great...and was pondering just stopping it and seeing how I feel over a short period of time. I see my psychologist tomorrow and will discuss if it's ok to stay off it or if I need to resume

Now I have been on Lexapro for a little over a month and I love it. I couldn't imagine going a day without it. It doesn't make me happy all the time but it certainly levels me out. I feel much more upbeat and positive then I have ever been before in my life. In the beginning, I started taking it at night before bed and I wasn't sleeping well at all. I seemed to have insomnia so I switched to taking it in the morning. It definitely works much better for me to take it in the morning and I sleep well at night now. Overall, it has worked wonders on me. It's not for everybody but it is a trial and error process. If it works for you, stick to it. If it doesn't work for you, try something different.

After I hit 40 the hormones and moods really started to hit with my cycle. So I mainly on it for pms. I also found that prior to med. I was agitated and couldn't seem to sit still and enjoy life.  Things are 100% better and no sex drive side effects or major weight gain. I wouldn't live without it.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	cbwdancer@comcast.net, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/28/2009 4:24:09 PM	I've been on Lexapro for almost 5 years now and I can't imagine life without. Well I can and its awful. My best friend was killed by a drunk driver when I was in 7th grade and my freshmen year of high school I was diagnosed with depression. I'm now a sophomore in college and life without lexapro is awful. My roomates, who I've only known for two years, can even see a difference in me when I miss my medication for more than a week. There has never been a downside for me taking this drug, I've never had any of side effect and it has greaty improved my life. I'm happier all the time and have more energy and want to get out and do things. I guess the only bad thing about it is when I miss for like over a week (which is rare but happens) there is a drastic swing in my mood and its clear to me and everyone around me. I am a totally different person when I dont take the drug. I'm afraid that I am dependant on it, and although I dont want to be on Lexapro my whole life, I guess I'll just have to wait and see.

I was on Zoloft which worked (lost efficacy after a few years) switched to Effexor, Cymbalta, and Wellburtrin (not all at once) and so far Lex has little to no side effects.  Effexor made me slowly go crazy and not realize how much of my life I had lost.  Effexor shut the blinds on my view of the world, Lexapro puts on sunglasses and I can see without pain.  Bad analogy but you get the idea!

I upped my dosage to 20mg, and gained 10 pounds in a week and a half. Anxiety attacks left, but maybe that was because my therapist taught me how to work through them. Depression is still there. This may be because SSRI's just don't work for me, so I'll be trying Wellbutrin. Definitely not as bad of an experience as Effexor, but wasn't satisfied.

It really works great for me and I can really tell a difference in my mood. My one and only problem with it is that it has dramatically decreased my sex drive and ability to climax and orgasm. I take the meds for a while and get tired of not being as close feeling with my husband so I go off the meds for 6 months or so and then I get so stressed out and anxious all the time till I can stand myself or anyone else so I have to start taking it again.

Take it for depression/anxiety combo.  Started out on Lorazepam for anxiety attacks, but quickly realized I needed a daily medication.  Had used Xanax for a short period a few years ago, but I like the Lexapro because it isn't habit forming (I'm sure there are withdrawal symptoms, but it isn't addictive).  Started at 10mg, which worked fine until I was laid-off earlier this year, so I switched to 20mg.  Doing fine on 20mg and plan to stay.  Lexapro has made a huge difference in my life - I used to have trouble sleeping, was disinterested in life in general, often wondered what the point of living was, and would constantly worry about EVERYTHING.  I felt improvement of my depression within 1 week of receiving the prescription.  A word on side effects:  I too felt EXTREME fatigue, nausea, terrible headaches, and lack of appetite in the first couple of days.  I was taking it in the morning before going to work and I honestly felt AWFUL within an hour of taking it - but the depression was getting better so I hung in there with the medication, figuring the side effects would go away once my body adjusted to the medication.  I also switched to taking the medication at night right before I went to bed instead of in the morning, so any side effects would occur while I was sleeping and I didn't feel them as much.  Thankfully making that switch did the trick and as far as I know the side effect went away after the first week or so.  Give it time if you're just starting or thinking about starting.

It helped with my mood swings and I felt happier. However, after about 5 months I noticed a slight gain in weight. I tried a few other meds but had suicidal thoughts so went back to 10 mg of lexapro Over the next 6 months I gained 40 lbs. and the depression came back. The Dr. wanted me to up the dose but I was afraid of even more weight gain. I am now trying to find my new magic drug that will help! What has worked for you, any suggestions?

After the Cembalta gave me side effects of arythmia which landed me in the hospital, my doctor put me on 1/2 tablet daily of Lexpro, together with xanax for anxiety, and a sleeping pill to sleep. I felt great for about a week to 10 days, then slowly sunk deeper and deeper into depression while on the medication. My doctor adviced me to quit.

I did help me get thru mother's death, hubby's cancer and death, and enabled me to hold a job without losing my temper. After four+ years, I've weaned myself off Lexapro, and now after 2 yrs off of it, I'm STILl calm and not prone to anger like I was all my life. Lexapro has had a lasting effect, which has been very beneficial for me.

It worked, I too felt lack of not caring like another reviewer.  I did stop taking it to try and get pregnant and experienced dizziness for a few weeks after but it went away.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/11/2009 9:27:59 AM	I was diagnosed with Depression/General Anxiety Disorder. I was having panic attacks and couldn't finish a thought yet would lay awake at night and stress all day about anything and everything. I was prescribed 10 mg at first and took that for about a month. After having another awful panic attack in my sleep I asked the doctor to up the dosage. Now I have been taking 20mg for over 2 years and it does wonders for me. I am more even-tempered and don't have the anxiety/panic attacks. Sometimes I still struggle with stressing about things but not like I did before. I can finish a thought and think clearly. It has improved my memory (I have a really bad memory-some short term and long term)and I am able to function much better daily. I did have sexual side effects for a long while but after so long those seemed to dissolve as well. I wish I could tell everyone who needs help about this and how it has helped me. There's nothing more relieving than to be able to function everyday on a normal basis. I would recomment atleast trying this medication.

I was given samples of lexapro by my dr. and he thought it would work great for me. After a few weeks, I started feeling better over all. Then I turned for the worst! I admitted myself to the ER twice and wanted nothing to do with life. The attacks got so severe that i demanded a change. I'm going to try a new med. that does help with bi-polar and depression. I'll keep my fingers crossed that it'll work. Remember though, this is your life, and if you need a change, speak up!

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	waterparkwarrior , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/9/2009 11:56:20 PM	This drug did a tremendous job of removing my anxiety but it seems to have moved me to the other side of the mood spectrum--I seem to be very apathetic about things.  I don't care if the house work gets done, bills get paid, clothes get washed etc, I just don't care.  I went on a diet soon after starting the drug--I lost 75 pounds in 5 months.  It was not the drug that helped me lose the weight,  I believe the drug helped me stop obsessing about things--food included--and that was what finally helped me lose weight.  Did have sexual side effects, dry mouth (which improved after a few weeks) and some difficulty sleeping.  Unfortunately my insurance will no longer pay and doc wants to switch me to Celexa.  I am super paranoid about gaining weight on Celexa (although weight gain is often a side effect of Lexapro, too) and as I stated before, Lexapro did not make me gain weight.  I am hoping for the best as I switch to Celexa.  FYI--my doc said Lexapro is an improved version of Celexa.  Lexapro is escitalopram and Celexa is scitalopram, so again, I am hoping for the best in my experience with Celexa.

Had been taking Prozac for 10 years previously, but started having anxiety attacks and doctor prescribed Lexapro 10 mgs daily. Worked great the first month with minor side effects (tiredness, hunger), but then I noticed that I was feeling angry or irritable a lot of the time. When I cut the pill in half or skipped a day, the anger would simmer down. I started taking half a pill a day about two months ago and that seems to work okay. Frequent bouts of worry (but not full-blown anxiety) have started it up, but I'm trying out some stress reduction techniques to help alleviate angst.

Unfortunately I have had awful side effects all of a sudden. I have suffered severe drowsiness and dizziness. I have weened off and felt better but now having bad withdrawls with dizziness and memory loss.

I was prescribed to Lexapro 10mg and it was a huge relief when I finally felt the difference after the 2nd week in. However, I have noticed that the it has seemed to wear off and I have gradually been getting back those nasty old feelings (trouble sleeping,feel like I can't get enough air sometimes, nervousness, biting my nails all the time, short tempered with people, heart palpitations,headaches). I have also noticed that my libido has gone completely out the window, which is horrible. My Dr. has now prescribed me to Zoloft 50MG. I pray that works for me.

I would take less med and spread the days apart. I started experiencing a strange sensation in my head especially when turning my head quickly, I would take a small chip of the pill and the sensation would go away. This lasted for about 6 weeks and then the side effect started subsiding, be sure to wean yourself off this drug. Now that I'm not taking any meds, reality is not as easy to cope with and am debating about returning to Lexapro for the escape and to return to &quot;whatever.&quot;

I took for about 8 months, then stopped.  Recently, I had symptoms come back, so doctor placed me back on since I did so well on it.  I have expereinced no side effects, and when I take it faithfully, has been a great medicine.  I am one that does not experience any withdrawl symptoms---so if I forget to take it, I only realize it when my symptoms return.

Seems like the older I get, the worse my anxiety would become.  I've tried Effexor, Wellbutrin, Paxil, Zoloft &amp; others with no relief.  Finally, Lexapro has been my saving grace.  I am now able to travel &amp; drive without fear.  I don't even check the weather channel before I make plans anymore. Thank you Lexapro!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female		4/3/2009 4:46:51 PM	I have been taking Lexapro for about 2 years in combination with Welbutrin. Overall I do feel better, but I have gained weight and I feel starving hungry all the time. Has anyone else had this problem? I ran out of the pills and went 2 days without them. I felt horrible! Headache, dizzy, panic, breast pain. Once I got it back into my system within 8 hrs I felt much better. Makes me wonder how hard it will be if I ever want to stop taking it. Already went through bad &quot;withdrawel&quot; from Efexor. I do recommend it as I think it works, just leary of how it will be to stop taking it.

Since i've begun this medication I have been experiencing nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. I have no energy to leave my bed. I sleep for 15 hours at a time, being a student and an employee this is not good.

Initial side effects were serious drowsiness and diarrhea, and I get terrible dizziness as a withdrawal symptom, even if I'm weaning off it slowly or even if I've just missed one pill. I would recommend it for sure, but don't let anyone tell you there are no side effects or withdrawal symptoms, because they're lying. Also, do NOT drink alcohol while taking this--I become a sobbing, irrational mess (yet I never seem to learn...).

It lasts for about 2 hours and is almost dibilating. Also I am starving, and I do NOT need to be hungry right now. I have gained 50lbs from sheer depression alone, I dont need that as an additional side effect. If I gain more than 5 lbs on this medication, or do not lo0se these crippling headaches within 2 weeks, I will stop taking this drug and admit defeat and sucome to the depression. I will oficially give up on trying to fix myself and enjoy life. this has been a 12 year long battle that I am not able to fight any longer.

I was going through life with no emotions, just dull and monitone. I also gianed 45 pounds, which they of course do not liekto tell you.  My husband and I are trying to have a baby and in order to do that, I safely weaned myself off of Lexapro.  Wow, gradual or not, the side effects were some of the worst I have ever experienced.  I have been on and off of several medications since I was 14 years old (I am 28 now) and I have never experienced withdrawal symptoms like those I did with Lexapro.  The dizziness and nausea was too much to handle. I was literally off balance for a month and my brain was constantly &quot;re-setting&quot; itself making my vision blurred, causing headaches, lack of balance and exhaustion.  I recommend to everyone to truly investigate teh side effects of this medication BEFORE you start taking it.  It is now six weeks later and most of the symptoms have subsided except an occassional dizzy spell.  Please talk to your doctor about teh side effects of this medication adn teh withdrawal sympoms which can last anywhere from 2 days to 3 months.

I was told about the possible side effects, headaches, weight gain, decreased sex drive, but I felt the good out-weighted the bad.  I started taking half a pill and then the full 10mg after 5 days.  I did get a mild headache on the 5th day, but nothing that interupted my daily activities.  I have not gained any weight or experienced a decrease in my sex drive.  My attitude and general outlook on life has gone up and I feel a lot happier.  The little things really don't bother me anymore.  I feel as though I'm back to my old self.  Lexapro has improved my life.

The sadness and worthlessness are gone. I can actually get up and do things, and I actually like myself for once. The panic and anxiety I usually feel happen a lot less. So in those areas, the drug works. However, the sadness and worthlessness have been replaced by what can only be described as, whatever. I just don't care anymore. And it's not like, oh nothing is worth it, I don't care anymore. It's simply not there emotion-wise. It's like everything is blank. Blank and a little foggy at times. On top of that, I started overeating. Full, or not, I'm constantly hungry and have to stop myself from eating all day long. I also have a slight ringing in my ears sometimes. So I have mixed feelings on this drug.

Ever since, I have been a basket case.  The insurance wants me to be a &quot;rat&quot; and try other drugs in the meantime, and right now (after several others) I am on Celexa-a similar version of Lexapro-but not close enough.  I was also on Topamax with the Lexapro, and dropped a signifigant amount of weight.  I NEVER felt better--not just because of the weight loss, but EVERYTHING.  And believe me, I was under a LOT of stress-backstabbed by a friend who ended up with my husband at the time, and of course my hub and I ended up going through a divorce; death of family members; a close friend; my dog; dang-there's a country song...the Lexapro worked.  And I can especially see it now.  Presently, I am on Lamictal and Celexa. I gained all my weight back and more, am more depressed, feel like kicking the crap out of my ex and his wife. I have an appointment on Monday and am pushing to get back on Lexapro and Topamax.  I KNOW I need it for that extra push. Good luck everyone.  Certain pills don't work for everyone, but I know it did for me!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	25-34	3/27/2009 3:03:07 PM	I was put on this medicine for Depression, Anxiety, and feelings of complete and total Anger. Since I have been on it, I have noticed that I have begun having Suicidal thoughts which is not like me. I am on 20mg and my OB/GYN put me on Xanax after about 5 months to help with the severe anger issues that were still coming up. Taking this medication scared me and made me feel like there was something seriously wrong with me. I also noticed that my Depression got alot worse and I didn't know how to deal with it. I was just taken off the medication by a psychologist and I am on something that I am praying will help me since I don't feel like anything else will.  Be very careful when you are taking this medication and don't wait as long as I did to tell your doctor if your problems get worse or if new ones pop up.

My chronic anxiety had started to manifest itself into irratibility.  This medicine has make a tremendous difference in my life.  My first two weeks on the medication I experienced side effects where I felt &quot;foggy&quot; headed, sleepy and I yawned a lot.  I also felt very relaxed and unconcerned which was a relief.  After that I started to wonder if the effects of the drug had worn off.  What I didn't realize is that I had stop &quot;blowing up&quot; at my family at the end of the day.  My level of anxiety and subsequent irratibility is the lowest it has been in many years.  The only side effect I experience now is a slightly reduced interest in sex.  For me, the benefits far outweigh this negative.  In my case, interest and performance are inter related.  I am 46 yo MWM.  My ability to perform is not diminished by the medicine, but my interest is.  However, when my interest is there, I can perform as any male my age can.  I am much more relaxed and patient while taking this medication and my relationships have improved because of this.

I could not even drive. When my Dr. gave me samples of this medication, I rolled my eyes? I thought I needed to be checked into the hospital for a million dollor work up on my brain? The first 3-4 days I still hade attacks. There were cirtain places I had to avoid,Stop lights,the bank,my kids school parking lot? Then the 5 day it was like turning a off a light swith. I have been on this medication for 4 years, I will never go without it. I started on 20mg of Celexa, when I changed to Lexapro I was given 10mg. I have never had to increase my dose! I take one every AM, I never forget it. You need to realize it takes a week for this medication to get into your system. Also, Lexapro works on BOTH sides of your brain, Celexa only on side at a time. I am so thankful for this medication, I have my life back!!! If it makes you sleepy,take it at nite. If it keeps you up,take it in the am. It is worth you time to really give this medication time to balance your panic attacks and anxiety. Work with your Dr. Best Wishes, God Bless!

The only bad thing is, I am SO tired, all the time. Ever since I started taking this pill, I feel like I am going to pass out after work/school. I work till one and go home and fall asleep for hours!

The side effects that I have experienced are the reason I will stop taking this medicine today! Side effects for me include dry mouth, headache, sleepyness, muscle aches and worst of all DIARREHA! It's so bad it's to the point of perhaps 10 times a day. It seems I can't go anywhere or do anything without the need to have a portolet behind me at all times. I'm not depressed though. Overall the side effects aren't worth the the trouble. Without health insurance it is way expensive too. Luckily I got samples from my Dr. so I'm not out the money.

I have not had a full blown panic attack since starting this medication, however I will get to the point right before an attack. I do still worry some and avoid situations or areas I have had an attack before. Considering I did not leave my house before taking this medication. I would rate it a C+, But I do believe I can be far off better then where I am now. As far as side effects, none that I can report of.

It made me feel &quot;normal&quot; again.  I felt like I was made whole again.  It allowed me to have emotions, but I was in control of them and could deal with them appropriatly.  The two very unfortunate side effects to this medicine were severe weight gain.  I was 118 and am now 147.  I gained this much weight in a matter of just seven months.  I finally requested to go off this medicine and have been off it now for two weeks with no weight loss yet.  The other very serious thing that occurred with me is that my sodium level dropped severly low and the doctors thought my addrenal gland was failing.  It was only after a great number of tests that they realized it was the Lexapro that was causing my low sodium levels.  I was so low, I was put on anti seizure medicine and was also at risk for stroke.  I would be cautious in recommending this medicine to people.

It worked great for me although i was a little sleepy and after a whle I did have some sexual side effects I didn't like (no orgasm).  I have tapered off after about 18 mo. and feel good so far, only I have been dizzy since going clear off. I did taper off slowly. Has this happened to anyone else?

I take 10 mg and my panic attacks are gone. Stress still exists but how I handle it is much different. I had very little side effects, just a little nausea in the beginning. I have gained no weight. I take it at night to avoid the sluggish. I exercise regularly, and I think that has also helped to give me energy etc. I would recommend this product.

I had already lost my mother several years before. It did help with the depression/anxiety but have been on so long, it seems I am immune now. I did, however have bouts of &quot;breakthrough anxiety&quot; in which I had to be prescribed Xanax to calm down. I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown though and the Lexapro and Xanax kept me from losing it. My doctor has now prescribe me Effexor as a change to  see if that will help since some of my original symptoms are coming back.

Immediately after her death I began Xanax but became immume to it within a week so my doctor put me on 10 mgs Lexapro. It has been excellent! The first week it did make me loopy &amp; I took it at nite and I was not sleeping. So I took it along w/ Ambien.  After 1 month I have not side effects, the loopy feeling is gone. I dont cry all the time.  If you are going through the unexpected death of a loved one, this medicine will help you make it through each day sanely.  It may not be for all though, a few friends and a cousin could not take it for they gained weight and they felt &quot;medicine head&quot;.  It was hard for them to think clearly.  My experience has not been that way, it keeps my appetite under control and I have not gained weight.  I plan on staying on Lexiprol for the next year.  One other piece of info, I had to change from taking at nite because I realized it kept me awake w/ too much energy. Now that I take it in the morning, it helps kick start my day and I am sleeping much better.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Lyssa, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	3/22/2009 5:12:01 PM	I've been on 10 mgs for a week, so it is too early to tell.  My depression has lifted somewhat, as I felt I was always on the verge of tears, but I am very tired. I need a nap during the day, and I am not motivated to do much.  My doc said it din't matter if I took it in the morning or at night.  I think I will switch to taking it at night to see if I am more awake during the day  - however, night sleeping has been good.  I specifically asked for a drug that would NOT put weight on  - too soon to tell about that, but I seem to be less hungry during the day  - maybe I'll be one of the lucky ones who actually lose!!  However, this is apparently a pretty powerful drug, efective or not, so I'd be careful with starting or stopping it.

Lexapro+Oral	Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/19/2009 10:59:20 PM	I had a &quot;trifecta&quot; of issues when I was put on this family of antidepressants eleven years ago.  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression &amp; Panic/Anxiety attacks mainly related to death of my mom and overall loss of both parents. I started with celexa then was eventually changed to lexapro. Simply said, this medication saved me from serious issues.  Initially doctors &quot;played&quot; around with some other antidepressants that did not help and more often made issues worse or caused worse side effects.  That trial period of being a lab rat was not pleasant but ultimately a good doctor finally decided it was seratonin that needed and so I began taken the meds. Under doctors supervision I have been taken off or switched to other meds on three occasions over the last eleven years and ultimately go back to lexapro.  It's the one that works best for me.  The worst thing about this drug is the associated weight gain but I've decided I'd rather have a &quot;muffin top&quot; and be a positive, happy person than wallow in fear, anxiety and sadness each day.  Not to mention, the only person stopping me from exercising to lose the weight is me.

I was suffering from a mild depression as well as mood swings related to post hysterectomy(no hormones).I take 10 mg,it took about two weeks and I felt like myself again. Not only does my internist prescibe it but my gynecologist would have as well. She told me that she recommends staying on this for two years. My doctor told me that a weight gain is possible but I have worked hard to exercise so that doesn't happen.

The side affects I experienced at the beginning were nausea, headache, dizziness, tiredness, etc - the usual. I stopped &amp; started the Lexapro several times due to the side affects.  However, I found if I gave it more time (at least 2 weeks) it worked wonderfully with the Wellbutrin.  Especially for anxiety.  The only pitfall I experienced was a very decreased libido and lack of orgasm.  This placed stress on my marriage.  I weighed the cost &amp; once again stopped taking it after a few weeks. It has now been about 3 months off the drug and I'm having anxiety almost everyday.  I know I need something to supplement the Wellbutrin &amp; the Lexapro did wonders except for the libido.  It's quite possible I didn't hang on long enough to see if that symptom subsided as well.  I most likely will go back on it since the overall result was positive and helped me to feel more like my old self.  After all, it is about the one taking the medication - to ward off the anxiety and depression, right?  Therefore, in my opinion if you can get past the initial onset of side effects, Lexapro is a winner! Side note for another writer - Wellbutrin works when you don't even realize it.  Try going off it &amp; see if others don't notice.

I never wanted to kill myself, but the anxiety was so bad for me that I wasn't sure I wanted to keep living in spite of my wonderful wife and son. 4 days after starting on these medications I felt like me again. The initial side effects were a bit tough, but stick with it. I have had NO loss of libido. Some delay in ejaculation, but orgasms are 100% more satisfying! I can't say how much I appreciate feeling like me again. I still feel tired a lot, I think that's from the Seroquel more than the Lexapro. I see my psych on Monday and am going to see about discontinuing the Seroquel and going with just the Lexapro.

I was very moody before I started taking it but now I am more calm at least calmer than before. However I do feel like it's not as affective as it was when I first started taking it. I don't really see any side affects but I do sweat a lot and I read a couple other users say the same thing. Over all I would recommend Lexapro to people.

I have always believed that suicide is a selfish act that is no less evil than murdering another human being.  In spite of this, I tried to end my own life.  It was my first and last attempt.  I lost my friends, I scared my family, and I had to drop out of school because I was put on stay of commitment.  While I was in the hospital watching TV I saw an ad urging people to sue the drug companies if they or someone they knew tried to kill themselves while on certain medications.  Lexapro was one of them.  I had been put on this drug to lower my depression, when in fact it just increased the probability that I would try to kill myself.  The meds I'm taking now work a hundred times better, and I have no desire to kill myself whatsoever.

Zoloft worked for a while, but eventually I needed pretty  high daily doses.  Parnate (a MAOI) worked very well, but it comes with too many restrictions and adverse interactions with other drugs. Lexapro combined with Wellbutrin has worked extremely well for more than 2 years and this treatment has helped me find a real stable place with ups and downs, but no dramatic swings in either direction. With other drugs I found that after a while I was confident I could handle it myself, only to find a deeper depression when I stopped meds and resistence to the same meds for treating the new episode.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	3/10/2009 4:05:12 PM	I was on lexapro 10mg last year for about 4 months.  I do not recall any bad side effects except I was tired all the time.  I started to feel better so I weaned myself off.  That was last November and I started having terrible panic attacks in the middle of Feb this year.  I decided to go back on lexapro only 5 mg to get used to it.  At first it really helped me but I still have panic attacks.  They make me feel crazier.  I am not depresssed I just have anxiety. I have never been more tired.  I want to work out but my heart beats so rapidly that I am afraid to.  Sometimes it feels fluttery.  I get dizzy and it sometimes feels like im falling.  My ears ring, Im constipated, I still get anxious.  I feel spacey. I'll be mid-sentence and pause then kinda forget what I was saying.  I eat constantly and I get shaky and sweaty.  I also don't feel anything.  I just want God to help me with this, I don't want to be on anything anymore.  I've decided to ween myself off.

I was prescribed this medicine to calms my anxiety in hopes of helping my insomnia.  I remember the symptoms made it hard for me to concentrate at work for a few days.  I kept taking the drug for a couple weeks and then months.  I noticed how much calmer I became.  I was not depression or anxious.  If I forget to take my pills for a couple days, I do notice an intense anxiety attacks.  For me the only downside is the lack of sexual desire.

In the past, I have taken Zoloft and Prozac.  Since I have started taking all of these medicines for depression (15 years), I have gained 35 pounds. It doesn't make a difference if I exercise and watch my food intake (Which I do).  And the doctors I have had tell me I need to exercise more.  The medicine has nothing to do with it.  That alone is depressing for me.

I have not tried yet. I was on Zoloft before Lexapro and the Zoloft made me so jittery I had to take Lorazapam to calm me down and I had NO sex drive. My doc switched me to Lexapro 5 mg a day.  It works wonders on depression and anxiety but I still have decreased sex drive  but not nearly as bad as the Zoloft.  Change of insurance is making it very expensive, so I may try the Celexa if it's cheaper.

It's good at first, but then your body might get used to it and it will lose its effectiveness.

I couldn't handle the attacks anymore so my doctor put me on 10mg of Lexapro.  The first two weeks were awesome I didn't have any attacks and didn't even think about having one!  Then when the third week rolled around I started feeling worse than I did before I was on meds.  So, I called my dr and she up me to 20mg.  Hopefully it gets me back to my old self soon!  For me and my family!!:)

I even began to workout at the gym. I would spend 2-3 hours at the gym about 4-5 days a week and my caloric intake had not change, yet I was still gaining weight and inches. I have known others that have taken the medication and began gaining weight all the while not changing their lifestyle.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	3/3/2009 12:31:06 AM	I started lexapro two weeks ago and believe my previous post was premature.  The benefits have out weighed the negative side effects.  Before I would not leave the house for work or social things, I had no energy, and I would get upset.  I now go to work and go out on the weekends.  My energy has started to return, but I am still not close to 100%.Side effects I have experienced but have been able to deal with / get over: nausea, ringing in hear, sleep problems.  I am keeping track of my progress at http://davidslexaprojourney.blogspot.com/.

Please Please do not stop taking this drug without talking to your dr.  so very important--I was off of it for 6 days but believe me it was not because of cold turkey reasons--i did not make an appt with the dr and they would not approve a refill.  So please be consistant with dr visits because if you go off cold turkey you will feel so so bad.  I will never ever let this happen again. Now the weight gain is another story.  But I like who I am with Lexapro and am working on watching my calories.  Good luck to everyone.

It was great while I was on it, but when I felt as though I could overcome my depression without medication, I went off it, cold turkey.  Worst decision I have ever made. I of course had to go back on it because I was physically sick. Then after, I tried going on natural vitamins that helped with depression and anxiety and it helped slightly. I had the worse withdrawals from being off it.  I was addicted. The worse symptom of the withdrawals was the &quot;electric shock&quot;. I am now on the generic brand of Celexa and love it!

It has made me worse in every aspect. I have read that a lot of people are gaining weight...but I've lost 9 pounds in a week...which is really weird because I've been at the same weight for years...Sometimes I get the night sweats,major headaches,frequent suicidal thoughts...it just seems like this drug is working the complete opposite for me. I sleep A LOT sometimes until 6pm....has anyone else experienced weight LOSS? Does it have to get worse to get better? It seems like this drug has made everything worse.

Before he had the horrible mood swings, he would get angry and the smallest thing and blow up. He has been on this for some time now and it is doing wonders. He hasn't blown up since starting the meds. His temper has mellowed out considerably and he has only raised his voice once or twice. He would blow up at small things to the point that he and my husband would get into shoving matches, always started by him, and we (me and my mother-in-law) would have to physically get in between them. This has been a really effective medication for him. I had to fill in the ease of use rating even though I am not taking this, but it seems to be easy.

Only side effects were that i had nightmares for 1st month of use,Scary nightmares,but now gone, and i shake sometimes and feels like heart going to beat right of chest in the mornings, I take my pills at nightime before bed, but can put up with high heart rate for the satisfaction of putting this depression behind me. Do not understand how i even lived in my past  but this pill is a wonder drug as far as I'm concerned.

I have gained 21 pounds in one year! Thats ridiculous. The doctors kept telling me it wasnt the medicine which made me feel horrible, after reading other comments and knowing my amount of discipline when it comes to food, I know the medicine had a lot to do with all this weight gain. They have now put me on Wellbutrin, but I am irritable and beyond dizzy, so I dont know what to do, be fat or dizzy!!!

Then i had a bad down-fall. I had suicide thought; everything was planed out. I had a bad panic attack and went to check myself into the hospital. I had to wean myself off of the medication and switch to Paxil and Xanax. Im still having problems but I'm not suicidal anymore. Maybe my medication needs to be stronger. I also think im bipolar now. But i read all the side affects for bipolar meds and they are bad. Dont know what to do?....

After children, removal of uterus/ovaries, I felt worn out and on edge. Everything and everyone annoyed me. My doctor suggested this medication. Wow, I feel like my old self - short temper is gone, I can laugh and those little things are no longer HUGE issues. Always a side effect in medication -- I feel hungry a lot! I have gained about 10 pounds. But as one friend told me.. &quot;it's worth it, you are so calm now.&quot; A positive side effect: I take it at night and I sleep better than I ever have. I wake up feeling rested! Even with the weight gain, I'm sticking with Lexapro it truely makes my life and for those around me much better.

Ive had to go back in forth between 10 and 20mgs, in order to manage M.D.D.. As far as the efficacy for treating anxiety Ive noticed little to no improvement but after adding 15mg of Buspar/Buspirone thats also improving. I was told to take it in the morning do to that fact that antidepressants can have the potential for keeping you awake if taken later in the day. I did and I think still do experience a really dry mouth and is necessary to drink water frequently.

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	45-54	2/19/2009 4:04:59 PM	Took this for about 3 days. Immediately experienced flushing in hands and face; third night, woke about 2 a.m. with suicidal thoughts, feeling manic and desperate, with the worst panic attack ever. My husband talked me down and walked me around, then called my doctor first thing in the morning. Doctor said don't take this or any other SSRI again--apparently I can't tolerate this class of drug. I've been okay since; this was about 3 years ago.

Most doctors do not warn patients about SSRI DISCONTINUATION SYNDROME, so please research this before deciding that Lexapro is right for you.Lexapro was fairly effective at easing my depression, but every time I missed a dose, I felt sick.  Because of this, and the sexual side effects (complete inability to orgasm, no arousal during sex, no interest in sex), I decided to switch to Wellbutrin, and let me tell you, DISCONTINUING LEXAPRO IS HELL.  PLEASE, please before taking Lexapro, look up SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome on Wikipedia. It has been over a month since I finally tapered off Lexapro, and I have felt sick the whole time.  It's like having the flu every day but it doesn't go away, and the feeling of being &quot;zapped&quot; every few minutes is VERY disconcerting.  I am only JUST starting to feel better, however I still get major headaches every day, I feel like I have a low-grade fever and my body still hurts most of the time.  If you do take Lexapro, DO NOT QUIT COLD TURKEY. TAPER OFF VERY SLOWLY to lessen the very unpleasant effects of discontinuing it.  My doctor had me taking 50mg/day, which sounds like a lot, but it took that much to be effective for me. But nobody warned me that I would have to take it the rest of my life or suffer the misery of discontinuing it. Lexapro can be a very effective medication, and the benefits of taking it can outweigh the problems it may cause, so do the research and make an educated decision based upon your personal needs.Keep in mind that WebMD is sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, so you probably won't find anything about SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome here unless you are reading what patients have submitted.  Please research carefully and thoroughly so that you understand exactly what you are getting into if you do decide to take Lexapro.

While I was deployed my OCD was out of control. The doctors put me on Zolft and I had a very hard time with that medication. When I got home, my doctor tried 10mg of lexapro. I have my life back, and feel in control of my life... Finally, I feel what it is like to be &quot;normal&quot;. I don't this is a medication for everyone, but it worked for me.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	2/18/2009 8:50:54 PM	I'm on 20mg of Lexapro and have been for about three months. I'm in love with this drug and can't say enough about it. My mood has calmed down completely. I woke up with anxiety the other night and realized that it was the first time in the entire time I've been on Lexapro that I had anxiety (as opposed to multiple times daily before being prescribed Lexapro). I haven't noticed many side effects other then hunger. It doesnt seem to last 24 hours, so my doctor put me on 50mg of Seroquel at night and that has completely alleviated the sleeping problems.

I was feeling better than when off medication but not really myself.  I finally went to a psychiatrist (much better than PCP) and am now on a combination of lexapro and wellbutrin.  Never had any symptoms with the lexapr, it just wasn't enough for me alone.

I have a more optimistic view, things don't seem so overwhelming and I have much less anger.  Others around me have noticed as well.  It has really changed my life.  I was very sad, very depressed, very irritable.  I can still get down, but things don't seem so hopeless now.  After a couple weeks I felt a slight difference, after a little more than 3 a big difference.

The first 2-3 weeks I experienced nausea and stomach cramps, but these went away completely. My mood is much better and I am able to enjoy life again. The side-effects I've had are drowsiness, disruption in sleep patterns, weight gain, difficulty achieving orgasm. I take it in the morning and get very sleepy around 2-3PM. I tried taking it other times. When I took it in the evening, it was very difficult to wake up in the morning. Other times of day I had trouble remembering it. Sometimes I've had issues with insomnia; inability to sleep until 3-4AM but this was rare.I've put on about 30 lbs. since I've been taking Lexapro. I was too skinny before, so this hasn't been a real problem.The sexual side effects are a nuisance. An understanding (and creative) partner can help there.
Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	meg, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	2/17/2009 1:12:09 PM	I recently started taking lexapro for anxiety and panic attacks. Not being diagnosed for depression but i think that the attacks all stem from on-coming depression. Lots of trauma and life altering events have happened. This does seem to help me quite a bit. i am also taking xanax for the anxiety, that did not subside from the lexapro. I suggest taking this at night before bed to help avoid the possible side effects. Good luck to all, and never be ashamed of this, just be thankful there is help out there. Stay positive!

I finally went off all of them for approx. 2 years.  About 5 months ago when I felt the anxiety/mood swings took over my life again I asked my internist for a med. that would still allow me to function.  I have found lexapro has given me what I need to focus on the jobs as well as function with my family.  I am now able to sleep thru the entire night.The only side effect is that it can be extremely difficult for me to wake in the a.m. but once up I am raring to go.

This is the only one that actually made me feel normal and happy again. I am now 22 and just been told my insurence no longer covers it and have been switched to celexa im not happy about it and if it doesnt work the same i will pay for lexapro myself knowing how great of a drug it is!

It has helped with my irritability tremendously and I haven't experienced extreme mania or depression, but my mood is down a lot more than it is 'normal'.  I stopped taking it for 10 days and I noticed the mood swings coming back.  One minute I'd be so happy and carefree and a few hours later I'd feel myself getting depressed.  The depression I feel without it is scary, but I think I need something more to take away the 'down' feeling.  Also, I lose my train of thought in mid-sentence.

I feel human again. I lost my daughter 6 years ago and had tried prozac, paxil, and zoloft. None of which helped like lexapro has. Zoloft helped considerably, but Lexapro worked so much better. I thought my life was over, but now I can actually get through a day without dwelling on my loss and can do normal  activites with better concentration.

I have taken this for 2 1/2 years and have faired well.  It doesn't cause a &quot;cloudy&quot; effect in the brain, but takes the edge off of stressful situations.  I have now been switched to another medication.  I have reached a point that it doesn't help me any longer and for the past year have been fatigued and rapidly gaining weight.  With any medication, your body just doesn't respond like it used to, so I have now switched to another medication. My suggestion is 1 to 1 1/2 years maximum on this medication.
Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	me27513, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	2/10/2009 5:50:08 PM	I've been on every SSRI out there for panic disorder and depression for the past 20 years. Most docs don't tell you that you may need more than just one drug. The best combination for me is Lexapro 10mg at night + Wellbutrin XL 150mg in the morning. Initially, I was on too high a dose of each individually, and almost gave up. Luckily, it took awhile, but I feel like a new person. Docs don't tell you that you build up an immunity to most SRRIs (like Lexapro) over time. Wellbutrin helps fill in the gaps, helps improve libido, and increase energy. Worst side effect of Lexapro didn't turn up for two years...night sweats. They're horrible, yet they go away completely if I skip my dose for a few nights. Ob/gyn tested hormones for menopause and that's not the problem. Weird that the side effect listings don't describe that problem. It should be easier to report side effects to the government. The FDA website makes the process next to impossible unless someone has died as a result of the drug. Overall, Lexapro is worth trying for its milder side effects, but no generic is available just yet.

Lexapro changed my life and I no longer have anxiety problems...however my libido and ability to reach orgasm are suffering!  I'm talking to my doc about starting on Wellbutrin.  We'll see how that works...it's one of those things where I'm so happy with the way the meds work - I can lead a normal life, etc...but do not like the negative side effects.  I'll try the Wellbutrin if that's what the doctor recommends,and know if it doesn't work for the anxiety, I can come back to the Lexapro.

After being on Lexapro for a week and a half I noticed that I am much more calm during stressful times. My co-workers, husband and family have made positive comments as well. I am much more laid back and able to handle stressful situations in a rationale way. This medication has worked very well for this mother and kindergarten teacher. I am planning on weening myself off after six months to see if I need to continue Lexapro or not.

It took around 5 or 6 weeks for this medication to work for me.  I take it in conjunction with Mirtazapine (Remeron, which is an anti-anxiety medication.  I also had to do some cognitive-behavioral strategies (thought stopping) as well.  I am doing much better, but do not know if that is a result of my situation in which I was obsessing about getting better, or the meds, or both.  I also have had no decrease in sex drive.

It has been wonderful. I feel as if I've gotten my life back. That was until today. I have been trying desperately to lose the 12 pounds I have put on in just one year and have failed miserably. I was just shopping online for some clothes for a cruise and realized that I have gone from a size 6 to a size 12. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow and having him take me off the Lexapro. There has to be a better way to feel better. I am just as depressed now as I was a year ago. While this may seem petty to some, I pride myself in looking as good as I feel. And this is just unacceptable

It worked very well but I put on 15lbs in 2 months which put me into depression (weight gain is one of my fears) I tried to get the weight off and nothing worked so after 6 months I stopped taking it. Also developed severe itching all over my body which is another side-effect of Lexapro. The severe panic attacks never returned after I stopped so it did have some lasting positive effect.

I had never been able to take an antidepressant except Valium and drs. are very hesitant to prescribe Valium. I had no side effects at all to the Lexapro.I had tried other antidepressants in the past and had bad side effects or no benefit at all. A benefit I had not anticipated was while taking Lexapro I no longer had sleep paralysis.Now 5 years later I find taking only 1/4 th of a pill keeps me from having sleep paralysis and the depression is gone.I also think it helped my hot flashes.It is expensive though.

Anxiety since the age of about 9 and depression starting at about age 18. When I started taking Lexapro, everything just subsided. I felt like my regular self again. I could sleep again, eat again, and was in a generally good mood 95% of the time. I still had my down days, but that's going to happen on any drug. I stopped taking it earlier this year due to financial problems and not being able to fill th rX. I had no withdrawl symptoms and still felt fine. But now the depression is coming back so you can bet I'll be back on Lexapro soon enough. This drug works wonders. Whether your going to be takink medication permanently or temporarily for depression, I highly reccomend this drug!

I take this along with .5 mg of xanax and i have my life back. I can perform at work and drive without losing it. Wonderful combo.

My GYN prescribed for night sweats and hot flashes. It helped to the point that I thought I could go off them. I was off for 1 month and the hot flashes and night sweats returned. I am very pleased with the outcome of Lexapro! I can sleep all night without waking up 5-6 times a night. No side affects at all. Very effective and I would recommend for anyone going through menapausal symptoms. I was shocked when my Dr. said it could help my symptoms. I only take 5mg before bedtime.

Lexapro worked for me.  I can't even tell that I am on it like other anti-depressants I have tried.  A true wonder drug.

I've dealt with depression on and off for 25 years.  It really eliminated my ultra highs and ultra lows and just smoothed everything out.  It made it easy to focus, to concentrate, and simply to just enjoy the company of the people around me.  However, this drug was VERY hard for me to come off of.  Even with a gradual withdrawal, my symptoms included irritability, inability to concentrate, rapid and severe mood swings, headaches, and brain &quot;cloudiness&quot;.  Not much fun.

I couldn't eat, was irritable, and mean.  It increased my suicidal thoughts and at the end of the month I actually tried to commit suicide by overdose.  Be very careful when taking this medication, especially in young adults.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	1/26/2009 6:44:13 PM	I had heavy job stress, then lost my father, brother, and best friend in 6 months time. I just wanted to curl up and hide under a rock. Lexapro got me out of the &quot;dark pit&quot; initially, but I wanted to just sleep to avoid thinking about the losses. Dr. gave me Provigil to help me get up and be awake to rejoin life. I no longer take the Provigil, but feel great. I still miss my loved ones, but I can deal with it and other situations (like recently having breast cancer) without crawling back into the &quot;pit&quot;. The only drawback is that if I miss a couple of doses, I get a bad headache, and I understand that this is common. I hope one day I can quit the Lexapro, but things are going well for about the past 6 months - I sure don't want to push my luck and quit too soon. I've been on Lexapro approx. 3 yrs.

In conjunction with Topamax, taking Lexapro 10 mg daily has helped me immensley.  At one point, I could be so manic I would charge out  the entire woman's dept. at Macy's; then 3 months later find me in bed, unable to get up, though it was a beautiful day outside.  Fortunately, that was 3-4 years ago.  Both drugs have helped me greatly.  Guaranteed, I gained a few pounds but who cares? I feel great and am able to work at a good paying job with fine benefits, too.  Posted: Jan. 2000

In my mid 30s I was prescribed a 10 mg dose of Lexapro.  Very quickly my symptoms, listlessness, feelings of hopelessness and the inability to complete tasks lessened and then disappeared almost completely.  I have not experienced any of the possible negative side effects.  My life has been drastically improved by this treatment.

My depression and anxiety are gone. It does mess with your sex drive though. When my wife get done with school I will stop taking it. But as with all medications like this do not stop without a Dr. supervision. I have had some side affects if I forget to take it for a day or two.

I never realized how bad my depression was, the symptons are not completely gone with the meds. but enough to warrant taking the medication.The anger,thoughts,and emotional crying spells are enough to make you go CRAZY!! I have felt really dizzy and sick to my stomach. So My Advice Do Not Stop Taking It Unless Directed By Your Doctor!!!! I'm not myself or who I'm supposed to be on the meds. I've tried others but this is the only one that has somewhat worked.

My depression is much better, and I no longer have anxiety attacks.  However, my sex drive is zero and I have put on 10 lbs. I have been having trouble sleeping, but this may or may not be caused by this drug. I feel this is a small price to pay to be able to function on a daily level and no longer have suicidal thoughts.

Tried not taking it because of cost, but it's worth the money.  As for sex drive?  I'm 55, spaded and love it!  No more suicidal thoughts.  Depression does not last long.  Does not make me sleepy.  Calms me down.  Do not stop taking it all at once...you will experience dizziness and a feeling of falling.  Please talk to your doctor to lower yourself each day.  Are you taking it properly?  I take my each night right after brushing my teeth.  I always, always brush my teeth!

I was just prescribed Lexapro 3 days ago. So far my panic attacks do not occur as frequently, but do still occur. When I take it, I get extremely nauseated and go hours without eating anything, so I decided to chop the pills in half when I take them (which helped with the nausea). Looking forward to a happy, &quot;normal&quot; life. :-)

Lexapro+Oral	Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	1/16/2009 4:54:48 PM	I took Lexapro 10mg for two days for my PTSD and it gave me unwanted side effects.  Not long after I took it, it made me dizzy, then very sleepy (a lot of yawning).  Nausea set in later and then anxiety once I tried to go to sleep that night.  The second day I was nauseous (not too bad though), sleepy (yawned a lot with the feeling like I wanted to vomit every time I yawned), and a little anxiety.  But the straw that broke the camel's back, was my inability to achieve an orgasm - that's when I called my doctor and she told me to discontinue.  Although I had these side effects so early on, I must also mention that I am sensitive to medication (very low tolerance for medicine).

Then I had my first panic attack.  I was sure I was going insane.  Dr. put me on Lexapro 20mg per day and Klonopin as needed if I felt an attack coming on.  The Klonopin also helped ease the transition onto the Lexapro.  I was able to stop taking the Klonopin after a couple of weeks when the Lexapro was fully effective.  In the time since the Dr. has bumped my Lexapro dose up to 30mg per day.  After nearly 2 years I have not had a single panic attack and my anxiety issues are gone.  I feel normal again.  I only take a Klonopin if I am going into a situation that I know will cause stress (like flying), and that is only a couple of times per year.  The rest of the time I am doing fine on the Lexapro, sleeping well, not worrying all the time, sweating less, etc.  I don't care if I have to stay on this for the rest of my life, I feel normal and happy again, and that's worth it. I take it at night just before bed because it does make me sleepy. This drug is not for everyone, so don't give up if it doesn't work well for you, try Effexor or Welbutrin.  You don't have to live with panic or anxiety, it is caused by a chemical issue that CAN be treated with the right drugs.  Best of luck to you, and get yourself well!

Though, after the last year on it. I began to get real bad suicidal thoughts and actually found myself contemplating how I would do it.  I talked to my doctor who immediately switched me to another medication called Cymbalta and I haven't had any side effects since.  I've been taken this new one for about 2 years now and feel terrific!

I felt stressed out and got angry about any thing that bugged me.  The day I took the first one  it all changed. My wife could see the difference in my behavior and my friends as well. I don't get mad as much and am not really as stressed as I was. All is well. Thanks Lexapro.

I have numbing sensations throughout my body as well as headaches. Lexapro helped in a few ways, but the side effects were too overbearing. I had less anxiety, but I was too careless. I cried &amp; sweated easily. I had trouble sleeping and I felt spacey often times.

My doc added 20mg of Lexapro and life is good again. I think it has less severe &quot;initial&quot; side effects than Wellbutrin. I did start taking it at night because I would yawn all day. I can only say two bad things - weight gain and no sex drive-bummer.

I just took myself OFF of Lexapro because it has left me feeling like a zombie.  I can't get off the couch &amp; my anxiety builds as I watch things around my home pile up because I'm not getting anything done.  The side effects from going off this medication are scary to say the least. I feel like 1 lady who posted w/one of my withdrawls from this med. Small brain seizures (as if someone is startling me), headache, shaky, super rapid heart beat and when I move my body I feel as though I tingle all over and that I am going to fall down. It's as though I cant control what my body is doing.  I used Lexapro for depression, migraines, extreme pain &amp; panic attacks after my ex-husband tried to kill himself. The coward tried to kill himself when I caught him cheating 4 times in 6 months while he was out of town working. I had my beautiful 2 year old son with me when all of this happened &amp; I just fell into such a deep depression because he didnt stop the damage to our family with the suicide attempt, he ruined us financially, tried to get full custody, let our truck get repoed while I had our son at the grocery store and the list goes on.  I went through several antidepressants and this one had the least amount of side effects.  I feel as though I built up a resistance to it because I just didn't want to do anything anymore.  Thus, I took myself off of it and the withdrawls are terrible.  I really want to try and change my diet &amp; exercise to balance out my body and it's chemical makeup.  I hope the things I am feeling now go away within a couple of days because I am even afraid to drive my car.  I just feel like someone is shaking me and my body is tingling.  Best of luck to all of you that are trying to get healthy and I hope there comes a day when doctors stop pushing pills for everything.  ebaydeals07 at yahoo dot com.

Went off it and the withdrawl was pretty bad for about 2 days nausea,spacey, increased anxiety.  I decided to quit taking meds and moderate my diet and engage in intensive exercise 5 days a week, this has has worked wonders for me, mood has improved, sleeping better, and panic attacks have disappeared.

It worked great. I had my days where I was sort of zombie like but they were rare. I am having to change medications because I don't sleep at night and I sleep about 14hrs a day. I have ABSOLUTELY NO sex drive. Its harder for me to orgasm &amp; sometimes I just cant, when I actually try. My mood was changed for the better though.

Before I would scream at my family and could not multi-task at all.  now I am in control and can handle day to day activities.  The first two weeks are tough while the drug gets into your system.  I yawned constantly and felt a bit spacey but after I leveled out, I was &quot;normal&quot; and feeling very good.

My Dr. perscribed xanax to try to help me get through it, but after 2 weeks of losing weight and no improvement I quit the lexapro by the 2nd day of being off it I felt much better I was able to actually get off the couch and started eating again. This drug was not for me

The positives are a balance in mood and behavior.  The side effects are extreme somnolence, inability to achieve orgasm, low sex drive, mild confusion and forgetfulness, nausea, and indifference and lack of drive.I stopped taking the medication for 1 month.  I experienced mild brain seizures(it feels like being startled continuously for 5-10 min). They began lessening as more time went by.  I started smelling odors that were not present, and I experienced extreme confusion and inability to focus and forgetfulness.  On top of that, my depression and inability to experience beauty and thoughts of suicide returned.  I'm going to see my doctor and go back on Lexapro or try a different medication.  I hope there is no negative long term or permanent changes that occur in my brain due to these medications.

I felt a little buzzed and had some digestive issues, but that was it.  I took this drug for a total of 2.5 months, increasing gradually from 5-15 mg.  With each new dose, I felt a wave of relief followed by a decrease in the effectiveness.  By the time I reached 15 mg., I began to feel numb instead of relieved.  For this reason, I have switched to another drug.

I would lie awake at night nervous and anxious and I would cry almost everyday over almost anything.  Since I have been taking Lexapro, I have noticed that I am calmer, and &quot;evened out&quot;. Sometimes I still get sad over things, but it is not this overwhelming sadness as I had before.  The anxiety is much better and I am no longer lying awake at night worrying like I used to. I haven't had any side effects from the medicine, and it has really been a blessing to me.

After many trips to the emergency room my Dr. put me on Lexapro. The panic attacks have stopped. I like the drug for that. My sex drive is a little lower and it takes longer to reach an orgasm. I have been taking Lexapro for about 6 months. Hope this helps someone.

My mom would just lay on the couch for days after she had my sister and after a week or so, when I would get home, she'd be up and about and more active.

My doc and I felt that I needed it for severe anxiety and major depression.  I am also taking Bupropion. My husband has terminal cancer and my mother is very ill, so the stress has been great.  After taking one pill yesterday morning, about two hours later, I had tention in my muscles, severe shaking, hightened anxiety with exhaustion, and inability to sleep past 5 hours. I had a friend come over because I was so scared. I also could not eat after I took the pill.  I cannot aford to lose any more weight.  I've already lost 25 over the last year, 15 in the last month do to stress.  I am going to take the pill again today, but not until I have a large breakfast.  I do for the first time in a year feel hungry this morning.  I will try Lexapro for one week.  If the side effects don't go away, I will stop and try something else. Am am really frustrated that I have to take medications, but I am also greatful that they are out there.  I guess I worry more about the long term effects more then short term.  Plus what is going into our water systems?  Two headed fish and frogs?  If it makes some of us have no labido, then what will it do to the whales?!?  We are all drinking the same water.  Maybe that is why so many people are having mental health issues in the first place!  Just thinking.

This is important for me because when my mood swings to the &quot;up&quot; phase, I am normally very high strung and impulsive.  Lexapro has helped me find the middle ground, and I believe this is a wonderful medication.  Best of all, I have not had any side effects.

Each dose I took put me to sleep for 18 - 24 hours at a time without interruption.  Fortunately it was a weekend at home so it wasn't a major issue.  I stopped using the drug after 2 doses and had no more sleep-related problems. I resumed using Zoloft and resorted to the reverse Viagra or &quot;skip a dose before sex&quot; strategy, which isn't perfect but works reasonably well.

For the last few weeks, I've noticed that my anxiery levels are very high and I've lost desire on anything. Also, I have insomia these days. I wonder if it is time to change meds.

I was on it for about six months. It severely affected my life quality.  Could not drive, walk, go places alone--too dizzy/absent.  Lived in a fog, distorted vision. Human zombie, no depressing thoughts--no ability to deal with everyday.  No sexual function whatsoever. Memory affected, could not remember daily events. Increase in impulsive speech. I feel like this drug effected me long-term.

I couldn't seem to get enough sleep and I was always extremely tired.  Felt an overwhelming need to nap constantly (9-11 hours of sleep nightly were just not enough!).  also the killing of my sex drive was devastating for me and my boyfriend.

Got tired of taking it and AMA, I weaned myself off it a little tiny bit at a time.  I actually shaved down the tablet over 4 months until there was nothing left.  Side effects were &quot;brain freeze&quot;, delayed vision, nausea, headache, feeling like I was falling backwards, and other minor ones.  I put my friends and employer on notice and they helped out a lot.  If you decide to withdraw, do it very, very slowly and watch for the side effects.  They disappear over time.  I've been off 2 years now and I'm fine.  I cry but I prefer that to not feeling anything. On the other hand, Lexapro helped me get through the roughest thing I'll ever experience.  I could not have done it without help and Lexapro stabilized me enough that outside professional help was possible.

SPECIAL NOTE: I have found that alcohol will immediately neutralize the month's worth of medication buildup in your system which I find necessary for the drug to be effective.

It was horrible I felt nauseous and light headed. I went back on but have to get off because by plan does not cover it. Right now I'm getting samples from my doctor. Has anyone weened off of it without side effects.

It has greatly helped my anxiety but the sexual side effects are terrible. I used to want to have sex at least twice a week, now I'm lucky if I want it once a month. If they could just fix that it would be great.
Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	12/29/2008 8:48:22 PM	I'm not one to write or put much stock in online reviews but I did read these before taking the drug so I'll review now that I'm off it. Not to scare anyone but I didn't take well to Lexapro. The side effects were overwhelming especially considering I am 29 and very healthy and in shape. It made me very depressed, when I have no history of depression, and the sexual side effects were   staggering. I took 10mg's for two weeks in combo with lorzepam and 20mg'f for the last two weeks. It simply wasn't worth it- I'd rather deal with the panic. I'm back to valium here and there for now and though I realize this drug can and has done great things for a lot of people, I really didn't take well to it and it was not the drug for me. The onset of the side effects took a few weeks and I gave it a try but, if you're at all like me, don't feel bad if this drug is not for you. Everyone is different and I can assure everyone I will never touch this stuff again. I had night terrors on it and depression I don't care to revisit. I have had no withdrawl effect. A minor headache and some very minor insomnia is all.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	12/28/2008 9:44:04 AM	I was prescribe lexapro to treat depression. I took the meds for only 3 days because it made me sick to my stomach.  I also had really bad dry mouth which made me vomit and loss my appetite and therefore caused me to loss 3 pounds in 3 days, which is the only good thing that came from taking this drug.  I guess you would have to see how it will effect you.  It works for some, but in this case, it didn't work for me.

Sometimes I feel really great, confident and happy and other times I feel total despair and hopelessness. I'm really not sure if this is hindering, helping or is just acting like a placebo. I want it to work so bad, I've taken it religiously since I begun on it. I had some side effects in the first month or so, but really I haven't noticed anything major.

I started taking it early in the year and it took a while to work. The 1st 2 weeks were a little difficult because I would get frequent headaches, excessive sweating (all known side affects). Then once I adjusted it worked great. I felt so normal. Went off the drug on own and had terrible withdrawals. I would have really bad headaches that would last for days and frequent anxiety attacks. I even stressed out so bad that I got shingles. Dr put me back on it and its been almost 2 weeks and I am starting to feel great again. I recommend this drug to anyone who suffers from constant anxiety.

I have had no side effects other than gaining a few pounds. This pill has only been half effective for me. It took the edege of so i could get out of bed but it has not fixed my depression or completely brought my anxiety to a managable level. just this week my dr added buspar for me to take 5mg twice a day. overall lexapro is a great drug. lexapo has also helped my grand father and both my aunt and her brother to completely get rid of their anxiety and depression.

The only good thing about this medication is that I did not have withdraw side effects.  This medication made me very tired and I gained almost 20 pounds while taking it. I would suggest to anyone who is new to this medication to talk to others who have been on it before taking it.  I did not do this and wasted 6 months of taking this medication and being exhausted the entire time.

Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/17/2008 11:04:32 PM	I am 25 years old  and have been taking Lexapro for roughly 20 months.  Before taking Lexapro I was taking Effexor XR.  After weaning off of Effexor XR (which I had been taking for about 6 years for anxiety and depression) I began having horrible panic attacks.  My doctor put me back on Effexor XR but it did not help at all, so I began taking Lexapro (15mg daily).  It was a wonder drug!  My panic attacks stopped and I have not had one since taking the drug.  I am now trying to wean off Lexapro and went from 15 mg to 10mg in March of 2008 and just went from 10mg to 5 mg last Friday.  I am experiencing intense night sweats, blurred vision and mood swings since going down to 5 mg.  I really hope this will stop after my body adjusts to the new levels in my system soon.  Has anyone else out there successfully gotten off of this drug???

When he died my physician increased the dosage.  Lexapro has been the perfect medication.  I function normally, have no thoughts of suicide or negativity at all.  I have a regualr daily life, am active and interact with all my friends and family.  Personally I would recommend Lexapro to anyone in my own family.  I feel good and I truly follow a totally normal pattern every day.

Until then, I would get a migrane twice a week.  It works perfectly!  I have not had a migrane in three years!  The added benefit is that I have no fear of flying too.  Double benefit!

I quit drinking and it really helped with my depression. I have tried to cut back by  taking 10 mg but I notice that the depression tries to creap back it my brain. I am able to meditate more and watch &quot;The Thinker&quot; more. Life is a gift don't waste on depression. It does cut your sexual drive the only negative side effect.

I remember the day I started it.  A few hours after I took the first dose, I became very very ill. I was at work, sweating, throwing up, just a terrible feeling. I called the Dr. He said it will pass in about a week or two, and to just wait it out.  It did work very well for my panic attackes.  Before I would pass out from them, but after taking the medicine they almost stopped.  I would have a few every now and then.  The side effects were horrible. The throwing up stopped after the first week. I had sever dry mouth, and then got the wonder side effect of not being able to achieve orgasm. I didn't know it could effect females like that.  I evently had to stop taking it. It was very frustrating not being able to &quot;finish&quot; with my partner.  It made her feel like she was not good enough.  That was not the case.  But anyway my panic attacks have been coming back but not nearly as strong. If it didn't have that side effect then I would probably still be taking it. I now take Wellbutrin XL and Seroquel. They seem to be working okay other then the Seroquel has made me gain weight like crazy.

I appear affable and in good spirits, convivial and all that, but the underlying, nagging presence of the &quot;black dog&quot; as Churchill called it, follows me everywhere.  Present in what to many would seem most pleasant and celebratory occasions are always dampened by that thing that will not go away, that force that says all of this in fraudulent, or so shaky as to seem so.  In my particular world depression has won nearly every match and continues nearly undefeated headed to the playoffs.

I was tired during the day and couldn't sleep at night and seemed to have panic attacks more often. I started taking Lexapro before bed along with Melatonin. I slept great and the anxiety and panic attacks were gone in a day or so. I would highly recommend this to anyone and find out what works for you. My mother also takes it and finds that taking Lexapro in the morning works for her.

The first week was horrible. I was nauseated all the time and slept about 19 hours a day. After about four days, I switched to taking it before bed and side effects went away. I am now much happier, more relaxed. I can laugh and smile again, and I don't obsess over thoughts that used to make me drive myself crazy. I realize the difference between normal thoughts and things that make no logical sense again. I'm more loving and it has actually improved my sex life, no negative sexual side effects. It's the first medication I've ever taken for Depression/Anxiety and the first SSRI. I LOVE Lexapro! The only way it could be even better is if there was a US-based generic equivalent because it is kinda expensive.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	5	4	Female		12/10/2008 12:05:17 AM	When my dr. prescribed this medicine to me about 4 months ago, I was weary. I tried Zoloft for about a year, but it didn't help me much, and when I stopped taking it, my depression became more severe. Lexapro has proven itself much more effective, in my case. It's easy to use because you can take it anytime in the day, as long as you're somewhat consistent with at what time of day you take it. The only major problem that I have experienced is decreased energy. I become tired just a few hours after awakening and feel the need for sleep at a much earlier time. Other than that, I have felt more confident, less pessimistic, and much less anxious while being on Lexapro.

I take 20 mgs/ day; started on 10. It took about 6 weeks to feel like myself again, after feeling ready to cry every morning, mood swings, etc., for over a year. Went to 20 mgs to reduce extreme stressed feelings. Feel great MOST of the time now. Alcohol (more than 1 martini) brings on depression feelings. Some weight gain; 10 lbs. Will ask Dr about weight control.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/6/2008 3:54:13 PM	After being physically assaulted, I experienced death wishes and overall depression.  This drug slowed my thoughts and controlled the depression.  I was on this medication for 6 months in conjuction with therapy and the depression and death thoughts all came to an end.  I recommend this medication highly and would use it again if needed.

This continued until the 3rd day when I experienced extreme palpitations and fast heart rate with some pinching and tight  feelings in the left chest area.  At that point I stopped taking the medication but was unable to return to the prescribing doctor due to financial concerns.  I am still concerned this drug may have damaged my heart in some way, or precipitated a heart condition I have never had before.  Also, after discontinuing this drug I was completely exhausted and weak for several days.  Maybe my experience with this drug is uncommon, but I still believe this drug is too dangerous to be on the market.  I would not recommend it to anyone!!!  (It should be noted that all my tests the prior year were negative including complete lab work and a nuclear stress test.  I am 54 years old with no known prior medical conditions.)

I would feel very lightheaded. I was taking it in the morning though. I switched to nighttime and after about a week or two the side effects went away. So to anyone out there experiencing side effects give the medication a try for about two weeks. I was on 10mg at first and I did notice a difference. I wasn't so high strung, was able to focus so much better, and was able to deal with life in general much better. This only lasted for a couple of weeks and then I was back where I started. I went back to the doctor and he doubled the dosage to 20mg. I must say I've been taking it now for about a year and half and it is WONDERFUL for me! I am able to handle situations that I never would have been able to handle before. It also helps me with my &quot;monthly&quot; bouts of depression. If you're a female you know what I mean. I've got to be honest this has been a wonder drug for me. I realize that medication effects people differently and what's good for one person may not be good for another. But, if offered Lexapro by your physician, give it a chance. As with most other drugs you will probably experience some sort of side effects the first week or two. Thanks for letting me share and hopefully this review will be able to help someone.

When i first stated it i felt very &quot;weird&quot;, i was always dizzy, and my head hurt. This all went away after a while but the medicine never seemed to help really help me.  I was alwys tired and still sad only i no longer cared i was sad. Nothing bothered me, i was like a brick wall.  I decided to stop the medicine, but instead of talking to my doctor about it i just stopped taking the medicine.  DO NOT DO THIS!!! My emotions went out of control, i was dizzy, had nausea, a headache theat would not go away, and was shaky.  I know of people who have greatly benifited from this medicine, it just wasnt something that worked for me.

But Iwas able to find a generic brand through a pharmacy in Canada that was 1/4 the price here in the US.   I learned that the generic brand cannot come into the US until 2015 when Lexapro patent runs out. I believe this is the case. I do love how this drug helps me.

Weaning off of it was a nightmare. I felt like I had the flu for 4 months.  I had to wean VERY gradually to avoid severe headaches, feeling comatose.  Though it helped me through a tough era, I must admit if had I know about the withdrawal symptoms I would never have taken it.  I'm an active, busy person and I felt miserably sick during the weaning.  If you need to wean, get appropriate advice on doing it slowly.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	19-24	12/3/2008 1:55:05 PM	Before I quit Lexapro I was on it for about 7 months.  The first side effect I began to notice was stiffening of muscles followed by joint pains.  I've now been off the drug for about 2 months and the joint pains haven't gotten any better.  I feel it prominently in the bones of my knees and elbows.  Beyond that, while on Lexapro, I had lowered sex drive, increased appetite, dizziness, and slight drowsiness, all of which discontinued upon stopping usage.  Withdrawal symptoms included vomiting, dizziness, confusion (at work), and a light head feeling.  The drug did alright while I was on it but the negative effects it caused in me didn't come close to outweighing the positive effects.

It was also very hard to wean off of, but now that I've been off for 5 months, I feel great!

At first I would just get nauseous and maybe throw up once or twice a few weeks. It gradually got worse over the months and I began to vomit nearly every morning about an hour and a half after taking it. I missed countless lectures because I would run out and into the bathroom. I couldn't keep it down long enough for it to really help me...

The side-effects were really terrible at first, I felt 'weird' and tired all of the time and lost my appetite completely (along with about 10 lbs). Since increasing my dosage I have begun to feel nauseous again, but it's gradually getting better. I really like this medicine - I feel like I've never felt before. It's great - for me.

It negatively affected my job because I was so tired all the time and I would often sleep right through my alarm clock. Even though there are no noticeable effects as far as weight gain goes, I was so exhausted that I never felt like exercising and ultimately gained a small amount of weight. Excessive yawning, although not a major side effect, was a noticeable side effect as well as sever night sweats.

Then I was feeling like it wasn't doing much, but muscle aches and racing heart in the evening. Decided to stop the 5 mg a day cold turkey. I am on day 4 and no withdrawl so far. I feel this is a very good medication, just not right for me.

It does take away the anxiety, but I have a lot of side effects - my sex drive has decreased dramatically (not good for my marriage), I've gained about 15 pounds and am heavier than ever and I sweat a lot which is terribly embarrassing and annoying.  I have been going off the medicine gradually (tried going off cold turkey but that was painful - brain shocks and headaches that were scary).  Yaz has helped my mood swings and regular exercise has been great for my anxiety attacks.  I also know that eating healthy food helps me tremendously.  I'm hoping once I'm off Lexapro completely, I'll lose the excess weight and stop sweating!

Prior to starting the med, I was very stressed and close to depression. The main symptom I was experiencing was extreme muscle pain in my neck and shoulders along with tension headaches that would make me nauseous. I would also sometimes have panic-like symptoms, such as fast heart rate and sweating in some circumstances. Taking Lexapro was like NIGHT AND DAY. It made me feel less irritable, calm, and care-free without that &quot;flat affect&quot; feel of some other meds. Most of all, it reduced my muscle pain dramatically. The heavy cost of the med is completely worth it. Substitutions like Celexa (Citalopram) have side effects like weight gain and are not as effective. Lexapro is a great option for those that are physically stressed and need a pill to feel normal again. I stopped taking Lexapro when I felt ready (approx. 2 years later) and do not feel dependent at all. Make sure you  follow doctor's orders and wean yourself off it slowly.

I had my first panic attack and my doctor put me on 10 mg of Lexapro. 3-4 weeks later I tried to kill myself and could not leave the house. I am off of the Lexapro. Not sure why my doctor gave me this stuff. I will never use it again.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Jess, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	11/26/2008 11:15:19 PM	I have depression and also social anxiety.  My pychiatrist said lexapro works well for that.  when i first took, there were no real differences.  I was more outgoing so I guess the depression part worked. I woul still get anxious in social situations but I could handle it alot0  better. what was interester though was that I kept waking up at night. I got a sleep study done and they found i awoke 20 times during REM sleep, DR said it's not normal because at that stage the body is paralyzed, He thought the Lexapro was causing the disruptions....so if anyone has problems staying asleep at night, talk to your doctor because I would be fallin asleep at my desk since I would wake up at least 5 different times through out the night....

Oh word of advice: Don't drop off this med! Shock waves pulsate through my face and head, very dizzy experience. Makes me remember how much medicine I'm actually putting into me. Expensive; no generic. But it made me feel normal again when I would take it regularly. Good stuff

It worked for me immediately. I am totally satisfied after being on it 4 months. I feel human again and only wish I had started taking it years ago. I've recently had to switch to Effexor XR due to chronic headaches (unrelated to Lexapro). I am trying to be patient with Effexor XR since I am starting at 37.5mg a day and working up to 150mg. I definitely notice some of my old symptoms of depression &amp; anxiety coming back. However, I will gladly take the headaches and go back to Lexapro if Effexor XR doesn't deliver.

Now after being on only 10mg for about 6months now I am not very happy with it.  I am still somewhat moody (nothing like I was though).  The aspect that I am extremely unhappy with is that is with no change in diet and exercise I have packed on about 25lbs.  The biggest I have ever been!!  I do not mind gaining a few pounds to feel better but this is a little extreme and if I continue on the medication what will happen?  Not to mention I am on 100mg of Topamax which a side effect of this is usually weight loss.

I took Effexor for three years and had serious sucicidal thoughts which i never acted on, i had dreams that were seriously real to me, and Effexor affected my daily routine. Since making a switch to Lexapro, i have never felt better. I have been happy, like i havent felt in years, i dont feel sick when i miss a dose, and I feel like a totally new person, the way i act and the way i react are completley new lifestyles to me, and i feel Great! If you are in situations similar to mine i highly suggest talking to your doctor about trying Lexapro and if your taking another medicine, consider making the switch like i did, it was the best thing i have done for myself in the past five years!

Lexapro+Oral	Other	EEP, 55-64 (Patient) 	4	5	4		55-64	11/20/2008 10:53:29 PM	I have used Lexapro for about 3 years, mostly for primary insomnia (can't sleep).  It's one of the few antidepressants that I've tried that has no side effects.  It does not make me feel &quot;drugged&quot; or sleepy, necessarily and I don't wake up with a medicated feeling or &quot;hangover&quot; from it.  It does improve mood and I feel that it helps me sleep without MAKING me sleep.

I was haveing extreme anxiety episodes that I could not control and I felt sad most of the time. It brought me back to my old self. I call it my happy pill and I don't leave home without it. My daughter told me that she finally had her Mom back. I had some lifechanging events happen and was in denial of my depression. This medication was referred by a freind who used it and it has been a wonder drug for me. It took about a week of feeling a little off balance but other than that I have had no side effects. I don't let myself think about not taking this anymore.

I felt no different on the medication than I did before I started taking it. I also felt very weird on it, my short term memory was completely gone and my appetite was out of control. I gained about 21 pounds on it in about 4 months which is very disappointing. I quit taking it because my anxiety levels just were not chaning at all. I would not recommend quitting cold turkey because the withdrawl is not fun. Extreme dizziness and moments where I feel like I have absolutely no idea where I am or what I'm doing there- it's literally like stepping into yourself after leaving your body for a few moments. My skin has also broken out severly, I don't think I've had this many blemishes on my face at one time in my entire life. It was easy to use in terms of convenience because I just took it once a day and didn't have to worry about taking it twice a day or every 6 house or something like that.

I stuggled with anxiety related stomach issues and it has almost completely relieved those issues.  I am much happier and feel like I am in more control of myself.  I am not happy about the 20 lbs. I've gained, but I feel so much in control that I can take that weight off with a little work.  I have also notice some of the night sweats, very slight dizzy episodes and a slight decrease in my sex drive.  Overall I am glad I started taking the 10mg almost 5 months ago.  Thanks for changing my life Lexapro!  I feel like a normal person now!!

I have been very dizzy, constant head ache, confussed, my eyes also hurt and twitch. I am trying another med called Wellbutrin due to the massive weight gain from the lexapro. As of now, I am thinking being fat is better than anxious and depressed!

The only thing I did not like about this was  I gained weight from the birth control and gained more weight from the lexapro.  But it is by far the best anti depressant i've been on.  helped a lot with my anxiety symptoms too.  Had a horrible time coming off the medication.  shocks in my arms and legs and eyes.

My MD Physicatrist says I should double the dose and I tried to increase the dose and felt really wierd and worse. So I am back down on 10mg now, but still not feeling any relieve from the depresion or anxiety. I am not sure if you develop a tolerance to it or what.From reading about the other SRRI&quot;S Lexapro has the most postive comments.

After about 3 weeks that went away and my anxiety went away with it.  I felt so much better.  But I gained about 20lbs. and completely lost my sex drive.  I am currently weaning myself off of it, and am experiencing some equally awful withdrawal symptoms- nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tiredness, bad dreams, chills, tingling, headache, confusion and just about anything else you can imagine.

Now, I can concentrate, I get things done, I am confident, and VERY happy that I sought treatment. My husband is happy too, because it has actually increased my sex drive. ( I think that just comes from feeling better all together).

Panic was a daily thing for me and now. I have nerves of steel. My doctor and I decided on a plan to go off the medication about 6 months ago and my life turned into a hell that got me right back on my meds. I take 1 10mg tablet every morning and move on with my day. The only side effect that I have experienced is yawning.

I have been on this medication for a little over 2 years. My job is VERY stressful and it has helped me cope with it.  The only down side that I have found is that you will gain weight and occasional constipation(or at least I did). The weight is alot harder to get off because it has increased my appetite.

It started to work the day I took it. Before Lexapro I'd get anxiety over a bunch of hangers all bunched up every which way. On Lexapro I now go &quot;Let's see, this one comes out this way and then this one is next and so on. It takes THE EDGE OFF of everything! Everyone I know says &quot;Lexapro has changed my life - for the better!&quot; No sides effects to speak of for me nor my Mom. Oh, yeah - Lexapro took my Mom from Miss Negative (couldn't stand to be with her) to the Mother I had always dreamed about. I finally got a Mother I dearly love and want to be with all the time - and she's 95! She's a hoot and together - with us both on Lexapro - we have fun and giggle a lot........the way we'd always wished for. It's a miracle, without a doubt! :-)

I was put on lexapro because of constantly being depressed and thoughts of suicide. I was also having severe mood swings. One minute I would be happy and the next mad or crying with no reason as to why. I was going through some personal problems when I noticed a increase of frequency of this mood swings and intensity of depression. I have now been on lexapro for a few months and I feel wonderful. I really did not realize how bad I felt until I was put on this. I was so hesitant to talk to the doctor about my problem but I am glad I did.

I am experiencing hot flashes and I am exhausted all the time, but I am used to manic highs and this levels me out and makes me feel the same all the time. I have not experienced and weight gain or other side effects. I think its a positive drug overall once you get past the fist few weeks od physical adjustment.

I was worrying so much too.  I had health problems with stomach and pelvic. I just kept complaining all the time.  I started taking 10 mg of lexapro. I noticed a big change in me. I felt so happy and postive. I thought I was happy before. I was now really happy. I kept telling people how happy I was too. LOL.  I didnt complain anymore. People were impressed with my change.  I am glad of this change. I do have chronic yeast infections and dont know if this medicine can cause that. Any info from others would help. gablog@ netzero.net

The first 2 weeks were rough, and then my symptoms inmproved. I feel it really helped for a while. My problem is trying to stop the drug. The first time I stopped Leaxapro I had 6 weeks of dizziness, and increasing moodiness after that, so I restarted it. Main SE now are sexual side effects and strange dreams. I just keep taking it because it is easier than stopping and making my family and friends miserable again.

Had to stop taking it - felt very woozy and couldn't concentrate at work. I went back to my dr. and she told me that was normal at first but would go away in a few days. I tried again, taking only half the dosage for awhile and eventually moved up to the whole pill, without any trouble. And it has definitely helped me cope with the stress of life. Only other thing, I can't drink alcohol as I did before. I used to drink socially and having 2-3 drinks on a weekend was no problem. Now 1 is my limit - alcohol seems to affect me much more strongly and I don't enjoy having a drink like I used to. One more problem - sex drive decreased.  But overall, feel better and wouldn't dare stop taking it.

I would recommend this medication to anyone who can take it.  I had very little side effects from it.  All I had was a migraine the first few days, as i assume this was my body just adjusting to the new medicine

It worked wonders for me.  I recently thought that maybe I would be ok without it and my anxiety and panic attacks returned.  My husband immediately knew that I had quit taking it!

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/1/2008 8:22:36 PM	I was on Topamax and developed strong anxiety and panic symptoms.  I went on Lexapro and the first 3-4 weeks were terrible.  I was more depressed and anxious than ever.  After that fourth week, I literally felt like I woke up and discovered myself again.  I felt like me again, and didn't recognize how bad the depression was until the lexapro kicked in.  I still can feel all emotions, sadness, anger, etc. They just don't consume my life and the anxiety is around only when it truly is warrented.

I had only mild side effects. I am 35 and do not have any other medical conditions. I am already thin, and I lost about 5 pounds due to loss of appetite. I would have stayed on Lexapro, but the drug was too expensive, as there is no generic form. I have recently been switched to generic Celexa.

I was reluctant to start on any kind of med, the first week I was very tired, and experienced increased sweating and &quot;hot flashes&quot;, but after the 3rd week these started to lessen. I have noticed a huge change, I smile more often, I sleep better at night, I'm less irritable. You don't realize how bad things are until you feel better, then to look back you wonder how you lived like that for so long. I'm very grateful for how i feel today!

That was about 8 years ago. I was perscribed lexapro and was willing to try anything to make myself feel better. I started this medication and it made everything worse like 10 fold! But because of other people that I have known to take this medication I kept taking it and letting it work into my system. I didn't notice any signs of inprovement until about 3 and a half weeks. The side effects were horrid for me too! But after that 3rd week I started to defenately notice the pressure being taken off. I would recommend that if you are perscribed this medication take it for at least a month unless you have a bad reaction to it! It really has given me my life back! Just deal with the short time side effects it's so worth it!

My depression and anxiety have increased in that time apart from the first couple of days in which I felt great (placebo effect perhaps), but that may be due to occurances over the last couple of weeks which would probably affect anyone adversely. I'm hoping over the next few weeks, things will improve. It's too early to make a proper judgement on the med. My anger has increased also. These may not necessarily be caused by Lexapro.

Switched to 5 mg and have been on that for almost a month and I do feel it is helping me. I used to worry about everything and while I still worry about some things, it's not like it was. I don't feel overwhelmed and frustrated like I used to. And I'm also going thru a challenging time in my life and panic attacks were happening a lot more often and it's helped that immensley. I was scared of losing myself and becoming a zombie as some have mentioned can happen on antidepressants and since this is the first time I've ever taken anything for anxiety, I was really nervous. But overall I have to say, I am pleased with Lexapro. I'm glad a I switched to the lower dosage and it's true, give your body a couple weeks to adapt, and then some of the effects go away. My side effects were dialted pupils, yawning, no appetite and extreme tiredness. Because I was so tired at first I took it at night and it did help me sleep! Anyway, I am grateful for Lexapro. I feel much better and I feel like I have a handle on my emotions.

I take 10mg daily.  I need to take it in the morning because it will keep me awake if I take it at night.  Sexual side effects aren't good - it really does take away desire.

The only downside (I think) that it causes, is weight gain. I am considering not taking it for awhile to see if I can handle my life situations and lose some weight, too.

I was unable to eat sleep or function normally after just one pill.I had panic attacks terrbily that day.  The doctor gave me clonazepan and then I felt like I think heroin feels.    Two days later I am still trying to shake the effects.  Definetly not for me.  I did fine on prozac (ten years ago) and they are supposed to be in the same family but I will never take this or the clonazepan again.

Kicked in quick and worked well... but after about a year I started experiencing muscle aches and weakness, crampy hands and almost 15 lbs.  Not happy about that one.  I am now on my 7th day off after a VERY SLOW wean.  This one is tough to get off.  I have experienced horrible dizziness and a feeling like an electric surge is flowing through my body.  I've taken Dramamine (the motion sickness drug) to help with the dizziness and surprisingly it helps.

It really helped my anxiety (along with some hypnosis sessions), but it really makes me tired all the time.  I am only on 5 mg of it and tried to go off of it once, but noticed when I did that, I wanted to cry at every little thing.  I went back on it and that went away.  Would love to be off all meds, but I guess that isn't an option yet.  Aside from being tired so much, I have no other side effects.

I have tried everything from Paxil to Prozac.  The only other med that worked as wonderfully as this one was Paxil, I was on that for about 5 years untill I experienced 'Paxil Poopout'.  I switched to Lexapro from Citalopram after taking that for 2 years and the effects were immediate! Within 2 days I was calm and had NONE of the side effects that I have experienced with all the others.  The best.. no sexual side effects, my husband has noticed such a difference!

I was a knew person after I started Lexapro. You always feel happy and content nothing bothers you any more. I think it causes a little weight gain, not sure if it's the medicine or me but, I did gain a few. I'm trying to come off of it now because I feel like I may be doing better now, I will go back on it if I start doing bad again. I started having seizures this is the reason for the Lexapropanic attacks etc. It has been about 1 week now and i'm feeing a little lite headed and emotional again.  If you decide to come off the Lexapro do it slowly and I think you'll be fine but, speak to a Doctor first. I was told you could start and stop any time no problem by a Doctor. Always talk to a Doctor first before any medicine, be sure it is right for you. Glad I know it's out there for me.

We came across Lexapro and we decided to try it. This pill made me lose weight. Not because it made me nausiated, but because it made me bounce off the walls. I was so hyper on this pill! I had energy up the you know what! The downside of this was that if I missed a day, it would be like a bad crash and burn after an energy drink, and it would take my body 2 to 3 days to reboot back to normal. Also, when I would crash and burn by missing a dose, I would also get horrible headaches, like someone who drinks caffeine constantly and just goes off of it cold turkey.

This stuff made my anxiety so bad, I couldn't even get out of bed for 3 months.  I had a feeling of fear in my gut constantly - even the birds chirping was driving my crazy.  My doctor told me it takes 3-4 weeks to kick in so I get taking it, but the anxiety was not going away.  As soon as I stopped talking it, I was able to deal with the anxiety - it wasn't as bad, then my doctor put me on Klonopin and I was back to normal again.

I was using Effexor and found that if I missed a dose or did not take it the same time everyday, I became very sick, like withdrawing.  Lexapro is excellent and I do not  have all the side effects.

This drug has helped me get through it all.  The downside is that if I suddenly quit taking it, I get dizzy spells and incoherent symptoms.  I was told to reduce my dose slowely to completely get off of the medication since I am not depressed or in the same life situation.

My depression is completly gone, i do not get angry at petty much anything anymore. The only problem i have is that it is almost impossible to have an orgasm. Other than that it is the best antidepressant out there for me.

Only downfall i seem to have is excessive yawning. I would rather yawn then deal with all the anxiety i had though. Definately works for me. If you start taking lexapro make sure you give it time to work for you.

Side effects at first were nausea, loss of apetite and yawning/fatigue. Lost about 10lbs, but once I got used to the medication and the side effects subsided, gained that plus about 10 more pounds. Do have relief from anxiety and I take it right before bed, so I always sleep very well!

After my son died, I started with Paxil. It was terrible. I have since changed to Lexapro and feel like a normal person again. Only problem is that everytime I try to get off it, I just can't. I think I may need it forever. I don't mind taking it, especially since it has helped me so much!

Due to the drowsiness the medication causes taking it at night has worked well and i still get the benefits of the medication during the day when it is needed the most!! Taking Lexapro before i go to sleep has allowed me to sleep throughout the night without waking up every few hours. i wake up at the same time every morning feeling refreshed and ready to get out of bed. i have noticed that i think more positivly and cearly throughout the day and have not experienced any anxety attacks while driving, which used to be a regular occurance!!

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	1	3	Female	25-34	10/13/2008 4:12:00 PM	Lexapro worked quite well for me other than the 12 lbs I gained during the short time I was taking it, with no change to exercise or diet.  I suffered from depression with anxiety and after getting up to 20 mg per day, in addition to taking 300 mg of Wellbutrin, I was feeling amazing.  I finally felt like I was able to process emotions in a normal way.  My husband and I are trying to start our family so I had to wean myself off of both drugs.  Wellbutrin was quite easy to stop taking, however Lexapro was terrible.  I could not sleep, suffered from brain tremors&quot; and could not concentrate on anything.  It took 3 weeks to completely get off of Lexapro and I still sometimes feel the side effects of stopping.

I will be going to see a neuropsychologist to see exactly is going on with me.  The lexapro just makes me sleepy and the reason i went to my doctor was because i'm no longer focusing at work...hopefully i will get the correct diagnoses and get the proper medication for my problem.

I also felt nauseated.  After tapering down my dosage to 10 mg, then to 5 mg, then to none, I am having severe withdrawal symptoms.  I am having what feels like tremors in my brain, all day for the past 5 days.  It is scary and makes me feel bad.  I've read many stories similar to mine on the web on other sites.  I wish I had never taken this drug to begin with.

Ask your doctor to switch you to CITALOPRAM, which is a generic drug really similar to lexapro. My doctor was able to switch me over right away, I didn't even notice a difference, and it is on Walmarts $4 generic list. With insurance I was able to get three months supply for $2 !!! Huge difference. Good luck!

Pill made me very sleepy 1 hour after taking it.  When I saw my doctor on Tuesday (after taking 5 doses), I was crying and sleeping most of the time and not eating or drinking.  Was put on 20 mg of Fluoxetine and by the following Sunday (only after taking 5 doses) was doing a lot better.  Saw my doctor the following Tuesday &amp; he could not believe the turnaround.  He also has me on Xanax (small dose 3x a day) to relax me.  But I am feeling a whole lot better.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	55-64	10/4/2008 8:42:36 PM	I am receiving treatment for depression from a psychiatrist. I wanted to die. I had fits of rage. My husband has PTSD long term .I started taking 10 mg Lexapro daily. It really pulled me out of the anger and depression . The dose ws increased to 20 mg.My suicidal and homicidal thoughts went away. Nothing bothered me. I literally became numb emotionally, just like my husband.I could not cry. After the dose was raised to 20mg,I had palpitations and chest pain, pressure. I went to the Dr. He said if these symptoms returned to call. These side effects subsided.  I experienced the fatigue, it passed. The worst side effect I've had is severe joint pain. I thought I could handle it, I was afraid of my depression returning. I decreased the dose  to 10mg. This didn't reduce the joint pain and swelling.My last dose was Sept. 18.I am 61 years old. My concern is that the drug has placed me into the possibility of having permanent arthralgia, arthritis. I am very healthy and work over 40hrs/wk as an RN. Will the pain diminish?

I felt very nauseas and had severl loose bowel movements. I started to feel dizzy and shaky with cold sweats and had shortness of breath. I took another on Friday because I thought it would get better as it got into my system. NO! I was in the E.R. within 3 hours of my dose. I felt like I was not inside of my body. Like my thoughts were being controled for me and I had no emotion. I looked at my 2 year old crying and just watched. My husband was with me, thank God. He took me in and they told me to come off of Lexapro right away. I still feel very weak, disoriented and sick. How long does this last? I don't suggest this med to anyone! It may work for you, but I wouldn't risk what I went through!

My only side effects have been weight gain, vivid dreams, and lack of interest in sex.  I feel this medicine has helped me tremendously but wish I wouldn't gain weight and that I had interest in sex for  my husband again.

I was not up, I was not down.  I was just there.  My doctor put me on Wellbutrin twice a day along with the Lexapro and I feel MUCH better.  It seems to balance everything out better.  I felt dizzy on a few occassions getting out of bed and my hands barely shake sometimes.

A couple of weeks later, I could also feel the anti-anxiety effects kick in. Within four months, my doctor had increased my dose to 30mg, although I usually took 40; I wasn't willing to cut the pills in half- they taste aweful. Eventually they seemed to stop working. I didn't not experience any serious sideeffects, though. Just sweaty palms and feet. Charming, I know.

I had severe stress in my life which lead to extreme depression. When I first started to take this medication at full dose 10mg I was constantly in the bathroom, had a lot of bloating, and had gas all the time. I went back to my doctor and we dropped the dose to 1/2 a pill a day instead of the full 10mg. I just cut the pill in half. That stopped all of the above symptoms. I am able to focus better on this it has helped with my depression and I have even lost weight taking this, about 15lbs. Which is awesome.  This medication has helped me get back on track and lesson my anxiety as well. I recommended it to a friend as well and she could tell it helped her out in a few days as it did to me. I've been on Zoloft before and that took months to take effect and even then that did not seem to help as Lexapro did in just a few days. My drinking has also been cut back because of Lexapro. I used to crave alcohol a lot now I may have a drink here and there. This drug has really helped me a lot.

The only downside I have had to this medication and its not really a down side is that my dreams are more vivid if thats really even considered a downside.

I was placed on 5 mg and my insomnia got worse, I did not feel irritated during the day, but by day 14 I felt like I had drank 10 pots of coffee, I was grinding my teeth, I felt dizzy and sick and I lost 6 lbs over those 14 days. I called my doctor and he took me off Lexapro. I just want the insomnia to go away!

I had more energy and wanted to do more. I noticed that I gained wait through out use,  I was getting more depressed, moody,restless, and couldn't sleep.

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Darth Erin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	9/27/2008 12:42:33 AM	The plan was to take 10 mg a day and then up it to 10 mg twice a day after a few weeks. This medication made me useless. I started it on a Friday night so I had the weekend to see how I would react to it. And it was a three day weekend. I couldn't move. My brain could not talk to my body. I was essentially in bed the whole weekend. I took it on Saturday and Sunday night to give it a chance but there was still no improvement. After Sunday night, I stopped taking it and it took several days just to feel normal again. I still couldn't drive on Tuesday and missed work. I will never take it again. My grandma takes it and she does fine on it. For me, it just didn't agree with me. Take with caution.

I dont have them severely anymore. &amp; I dont cry every second anymore either. However, Im extremely tired all the time. I feel extremely lazy &amp; Ive always been a busy body. &amp; I'm always feeling sexual but now I dont. &amp; I'm moody &amp; mean now &amp; Ive always been a happy, nice person.

Within a month on 10mg a day I felt good - normal.  I had more energy and motivation.  I was more tired at first but that went away after a few weeks.  I felt more myself.

My doctor switched me to Lexapro, which was much better, and I have less side effects.  My dosage has been shifted up and down, but this medication works for me.  I think everyone's body responds to different meds differently anyway.  Overall, I am happy with this medication (which takes about 1 1/2-2 weeks to kick in).  It has honestly saved my life.

(from a psychiatrist) at bedtime.  It seems to help with my depression sometimes, but at other times I'm really down. I've been going through many changes in my life for the past 10 years. This keeps me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	9/25/2008 3:29:21 PM	I have been on 7 types of anti-depressants and have never experienced anything like when I was on Lexapro. This drug gave me severe night sweats, headaches and took me 3 months to ween off, during which I suffered from nausea and diarrhea. I will never again go on this drug, especially when I didn't feel much different on it.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	25-34	9/25/2008 9:22:09 AM	I was put on 20mg of Lexapro for depression and anxiety.  For the first week, give or take, I had very minor nausea, but it went away.  I also noticed myself yawning a lot, and gradually I became more and more tired, which likely was made worse by the trouble sleeping I had.  I also noticed some sexual side effects.  After about a month, I really noticed positive changes in my mood, but the tiredness continued.  If it wasn't for that, I would be very happy with this drug.  My doctor has reduced my dose to 10mg a day, which I've been on for about a week.  I haven't noticed a big change in mood or tiredness yet, but I think both have decreased slightly.

Lexapro has evened my moods out, I no longer overreact to small things. No weight gain, but I had some headaches at first and really vivid, odd dreams when I took at night. I take it midday now and the dreams have gone back to normal.

It was horrible every month I turned into a monster! I could time my due time by the pure anger I would feel the week/day before - now with Lexapro I cant tell when &quot;its&quot; coming - this was literally a life saver!!! It also helped with night sweats that I had been suffering from since having a tubaligation over 10 years ago. I would recommend this to any woman. Take as recommended for two weeks for the full relief to kick in.

It has been a year now and it seems to have changed in it's effectiveness.  I get really bad night sweats and seem to go through different levels of depression which is not a reason why I started this.  I've been consider lowering my dosage to 5 mg a day instead of 10.

I am a 32 year old woman who was diagnosed bi-polar/ocd when I was 15. I have been on depakote in combination with lexapro, and topamax... for over 8 months after 16 years of being on a roller coaster looking for the right combinations, I finally feel normal. When I first started taking the combination, I was tired, but once the levels were balanced in my system, everything was great. Make certain to express any issues with your doctor.... not all meds work for all people.

He was 24. Since then I battled severe depression, uncontrolable anxiety and panic attacks. I tied to make it on my own, without medication. I finally realized about 2 months ago, after ending a mentally abusive relationship, that I couldnt do it on my own. I needed help. I started taking Lexapro. I first took the 10mg and noticed an immediate change in how I felt. I then had to be bumped up to the 20mg and never looked bakc after that. This is an amazing mediacation. I honestly dont know how I made it this long with out it.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	9/22/2008 1:36:10 AM	I had recently broke up with my fiance, and was experiencing a whole realm of depression and anxiety.  My doctor prescribed me 10 mg every day.  I began taking the medication in May, and I have never felt better.  Before the medication, I always seemed to be sad, and I would cry about anything.  Since then, I have not had that problem.  Don't get me wrong, I still deal with being sad and upset sometimes, but that is life.  Overall, this drug worked miracles for me.  I have not experienced any side effects.  My doctor and I plan on taking me off in October.

No more panic attacks!  Though I have recently winged myself off of this medicine, I am considering getting back on it.  I am experiencing mood swings and a strange muscle like spasm.  I can be happy one second and very angry the next.  I would definitely suggest to talk to your doctor and make sure you are ready to be off the medication.

This was probably due to my age, as I was aware these side effects are possible in teens and young adults. I have since switched to Zoloft and I am relatively pleased.

I've stopped obsessing about trivial things. My kids don't call me the Mean Mom anymore. I've had virtually no side effects, except for slight weight gain (10 lbs), which I can live with.

My panic attacks were so bad that once I started having one they would last for hours. I had to go to the ER twice before I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder. This drug has changed my life, I take 20mg a day and have not had a panic attack in over a month. I have also lost 21 pounds on this medication. The side affects have not bad for me at all, my doctor started me out on 5mg for 4 weeks, then 10mg for 4 weeks, then 15mg for 4 weeks, and now Im up to the 20mgs. When I first started I had stomach aches and headaches for about 2 days and that was it. As for the sexual side affects, I lost my desire after the hysterectomy so for me its no different.

I have been on 10MG a day. The problem is that I have no sex drive and no more orgasms! It's horrible!!! To make matters worst, it didn't help resolve my PMDD I just ended up crying all the time. I'm glad I took it because it did make a difference in making me feel better as far as anxiety, but this one is just not for me.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Hope, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/17/2008 3:49:53 PM	I take 10 mg a day. It has really helped me  A LOT. I have had no side effects whatsoever. I've been on it about 3 months and it started working right away. I took St. John's Wort before this, which was not strong enough. Then I took 5HTP which worked better for me. But due to some bad life stress, I needed something even stronger. Prozac worked well for me years ago, but my body became tolerant to it. I wanted to try something different. Had a few side effects with Prozac, but no side effects with Lexapro. It balances out my  moods. It is expensive though because there is no generic available in the USA and my insurance won't cover it. So eventually I may try to just go back to using 5HTP, in addition to non-medical ways to reduce stress.

I have now been on it for about 10 months and it has helped me immensely! I am much more calm and rational. The only side effects I had were during the first 2-3 months: one of my legs would suddenly jerk if I were lying in bed reading or watching tv. Kind of strange, but not something that would make me stop taking it. I have no side effects whatsoever now and it is truly working for me!

The combo worked great, and the klonopin worked to combat the drowsiness.  Things changed and my anxiety decided to become monogamous with mr. depression, so they upped my dose to 20mg a day (still with the klonopin).  So, it is working...but like everyone knows, these drugs take time to build up in your system, and it takes your body even longer to stop hating them and making you sick.  I am nauseous into week 3 of the increased dose, and still dizzy all the time.  But, just as I did when first prescribed, I know it will be worth it, so I will wait.Sexual side effects- TRUE.  Zero sex drive.Weight gain (aside from normal fluctuations or just eating like a piggy): 13 pounds in 2 and a half years total.Note about anxiety/panic- I was suffering from 3-5 debilitating attacks a week.  Even on my cocktail of only 10 mg of Lexapro, I had ZERO.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Male	35-44	9/10/2008 4:29:02 PM	I have been taking Lexapro for about 5 weeks.  Overall, I would say that it has definitely helped me with depression.The main reason I am writing this is that I experienced strong anxiety, bordering on panic attacks, for the first couple of days that I was taking the drug.  My doctor was skeptical that this was possible so quickly - one of the main reasons he prescribed Lexapro specifically was due to the relatively low incidence of major side effects.  I just want to make sure that anyone else who experiences a similar reaction initially knows that it is not just them.  The major anxiety went away for me after a couple of days.  I have had some degree of a lot of the side effects listed (dry mouth, stomach issues, some decrease in sex drive, etc.) but they have dissipated over time.With Lexapro, counseling, and some changes that I made in my life, I have been able to go from being pretty depressed most of the time (to the degree of having borderline suicidal thoughts) to feeling fairly close to normal.So just some encouragement that though some people may have more difficulty getting started on the drug than they are led to expect, it has been worth it in my experience.

Since taking Lexapro, the last 5 years have been the best years of my life.  My family also noticed the change in me.

It helped my depression but has its drawbacks.  Weight gain, no libido, occasional depression(not as bad), fatigue.  I'm going to see if my Dr. can prescribe something else because I've started have short anxiety bouts, palpitations. I don't think that's normal.

The side effects were horrible in the beginning. I could not even function to go to the grocery store. It actually took me a full month to adjust, but now that I have, it is working wonderfully. I am borderline anorexic, so I am watching my weight very closely. I have actually lost 5 pounds (which I didn't need to lose), but exercising with it makes me feel a ton better. I plan to continue unless my weight changes. I am so glad that I stuck through those horrible weeks.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	35-44	9/8/2008 11:58:48 AM	This was given to me for depressive disorder, I have been on it for 3 months and overall I feel good.  A few draw backs that people need be made aware of that I was not until after I began treatment.  1. Sexual side effects for me have been horrible-  I have NO sex drive now  2. I am tired all the time. 3. In 3 months I have gained over 20 pounds. If you are willing to possibly give up sex, be tired most of the time and gain weight- then this is a great anti-depressant.  Nothing bad to say about the effectiveness- just the side effects add a whole new load of issues to deal with.

Only problems have been with severe burning stomach pain which has began to subside after a couple of weeks. This med has worked better for anxiety than any other anti-anxiety med I have taken. So far it has been better than ativan (I was so out of it with even low doses on this med) and even k-pin (which seemed to make me almost psychotic at times). As long as it works, I'll never stop taking it, since it helps both my depression and anxiety.

I was a witch BEFORE now it does not even stop when I start my cycle!! This made me more depressed crying all the time feeling useless and disgusted with myself. Also made me gain weight!!!Never again.. I have heard good thing about Sarafem for PDMM anyone else?

It does make you tired, so I make sure to take it in the evening-not morning-works much better.  It works great for anxiety especially, very calming but not drugged feeling. It is very expensive and my insurance doesn't cover the cost, so I have my doctor write a perscription for 20 mg pills (same price as 10mg) and I just take half a pill (10mg). That has cut my monthly cost in half ($40 mo instead of $80). Very difficult to stop taking....it takes months to reduce the dosage and taper off of the medication, still unpleasant.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Devorah,  Female 	3	4	3	Female		9/4/2008 3:27:47 PM	I am  unsure yet of my experience with this medication as I just started on it. I also take a medication for mirgaines, so I must be careful what I use. My last migraine lasted 70 days and as a result my coping skills were depleted hence the lexapro. There is a side story here, but I shant go into it. I have not experienced weight gain just the opposite I have no appetite. I have been told no wheat gluten as it will increase the chances of a migraine and I also have just recently been told I have cysts on the left side of brain that need to be removed  hence the cause of the mirgaine. When it rains it pours does it not. I am sensitive to meds so my options are limited. But you all are so very strong and will get through this. I have read many of your comments and what I hear from all of you is there is strength in your voices. And you share your stories here with each other so people like me come along and read them and we do. We take strength from your words and your perserverence and admire your willingness to shre with strangers. Thank you all. I wll say a prayer that all of you find hope in the sharing. I never join these kinds of things but I do not know what is happening to me and I feel like I am standing on the outside of the world looking in on everyone else. I have never been sick broke my neck once but I came back from that with Gods help and my friends and family. I am the strong one for others, how do I be strong for myself? God bless all of you. Be well one day at a time, Chersih you life today and now. Devorah

DOC SAID THAT LEXAPRO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SO GREAT AND DIDN'T HAVE AS MANY SIDE EFFECTS AS OTHER SSRI'S...SO I WAS EXCITED! THEN...I TOOK MY PILL..ONE SINGLE PILL... AND WITHIN A MATTER OF 30 MINUTES I WAS AT THE TOILET DRY HEAVING(I WOULD HAVE THROWN UP ACTUAL FOOD BUT THE ANXIETY WAS SO BAD I COULDN'T EAT), THEN I GOT THE RUNS...MEANTIME I HAD A SEVERE POUNDING HEADACHE, WAS EXTREMELY DIZZY AND DISORIENTED, VERY WEAK...THE NEXT MORNING I COULD BARELY MOVE...ALL THESE SIDE EFFECTS MADE ME SO EXHAUSTED..TWO DAYS OF HELL FOR ONE 10MG PILL. IT WORKS AMAZING FOR SOME PEOPLE, BUT NOT FOR ME! NEVER AGAIN!

Most people with GAD doesn't know what that feels like.  I had VIVID dreams yelling out but asleep, trying to get away from someone and kicking my husband (hee hee) It was all funny in the end.  This stopped and the tiredness began.  I was EXHAUSTED all the time could sleep 24/7.  We ran every blood work we could think of and finally came to the Lexapro.  I was taking 20mg then cut it to 10mg and slowly quit taking it.  The Fatigue went away.  I was so unhappy because I knew I would have to switch and loved Lexapro.  But if I can't get out of bed to care for my children there isn't much benefit.  I have been switched to Cymbalta.  I hope it is Lexapro without the severe fatigue.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	2parrotmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	9/3/2008 5:57:32 AM	3weeks of use.starting at 5mg. as this med gets into my system i am experienceing less anxiety and a more even temperment. No instant fix but give hope that this will be what works for me. I Like the tiredness side effect because i have trouble falling &amp; staying asleep. Weight gain is a major concern as I have worked hard to lose and keep it off, but will continue to eat right and excercise and watch the scale. No other side effects have been experienced. Its a trade off concerning meds, but sometimes what you need to make you feel better is your attitude and constant check in with yourself, There are no instant fix me drugs out there. It all must work together but feeling less overwhelming depression is the goal to effective decision making.Important to work with your Dr. be honest and do not follow your own advice as far as how much you need or dont.You need to work together on this, their medical knowledge is what you pay for. Have tried many different drugs for depression but this one is so far so good. Hang in there.
Lexapro+Oral	Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	9/2/2008 9:47:11 PM	I took Lexapro for depression, OCD, and trichotillomania (hair pulling) for 2 years until I was on new health insurance that wouldn't cover it. $200/month for the prescription wasn't an option!  Now that I'm on insurance that will cover it, I have been on a month. However, I am epileptic and had a small, myoclonic seizure this afternoon (similar to a reaction I had to a migraine medicine). I'm upset that I might have to stop taking the only drug I have found to treat depression, OCD, and trichotillomania!

I took 10mg, once daily.  I felt better after just 2 doses, more energy, less depressed.  The first dose caused nausea, so I took it with some juice and yogurt the second time and had no nausea.  Then the next night I woke to shortness of breath and chest pains.  After a trip to the ER, they determined I had a rare (like affects less than 1% of population) side effect of a severe panic attack.  I had never experienced anxiety to that extreme or a panic attack, so it scared the living crap out of me.  I was advised to stop taking it immediately and after 24 hours, I had no more anxiety or jittery feelings.  I feel like Lexapro would have really helped my depression if it wasn't for that side effect.  I'm apprehensive about taking anything else right now and have been trying vitamins and supplements to help with my depression.  However, I think I'll be talking with my doctor to try a different antidepressant...

I have never taken any type of depression pill before now, I am 50.  I felt like I was going to lose my job of 21 years, and I had to get myself through a very bad place with my employer.  So far, I am sleeping much better, I have chosen to take my 20 mg. pill at 8:00 PM, so I am not so tired in the morning.  One of the great benefits I have noticed is that my fibromyalgia has virtually disappeared.  I noticed that some folks are complaining about weight gain so I am taking extra care to eat healthier and I feel like exercising again.  I hope this positive reaction I am having keeps going.

I was too sick to eat and that made it even harder to get out of bed. I was on several different doses for 2 months and now I have switched to Wellbutrin which has caused chest pain and nervousness. Depression runs in my family and we all have a lot of trouble finding a medicine that works so I guess it all depends on the individual.

I'm thinking I'm about to be let go so was having crying episodes.

I am wondering though if the people who said that it changed their sexual desires are male or female. My desire has not changed in fact I think because I am more relaxed now instead of sad or moody my desire has increased and wondered if it was because of the medicine.

Side effects-I have a decreased appetite and will find myself spacing out and not participating in conversations. Overall-a big help with my anxiety.
Lexapro+Oral	Other	Dee,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female		8/22/2008 3:01:36 AM	Be careful what you wish for on this medication. I had a trauma induced depression and was recommended this to treat the depression and for anxiety. It took away the axiety alright. It also took away my sex drive, my laughter, my sadness, my happiness, my concern for others and my concern for myself. I was a complete flat line stuck in purgatory. Two of my friends had a similar experience, plus weight gain. I had NO anxiety because all of my emotions were sucked out of me. I almost drove off the road and did not even flinch! This was no way to live. I was off of meds again for another 8 months until another tragedy happened. I went on welbutrin recently and have had significant improvement in my mood and overall well being. My goal is to cope. We are supposed to experience some level of disappointment in life, so I am not sure why anyone would want that kind of fix. I just started welbutrin 2 months ago. I am very satisfied with the results. I laugh and cry, like a normal human being. Lexapro was also difficult to come off of. I had problems with my equilibrium for nearly a week.

I'm good now. The only real issue I have with Lexapro is the cost. It seems an outrageous amount of money to pay for a month to month supply when Celexa seemed so much more inexpensive. It's even worse when there's no insurance. They say you can't put a price on staying healthy; yes you can. It's a catch 22. I'm disappointed.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female		8/17/2008 7:03:17 PM	I have experienced reduced symptoms related to my depression within a few weeks of being on the medication. I have few or no side affects. I take my pill every morning around the same time and my day is brighter. The only side affect I notice and its only cuz I have been taking it for 2 weeks is I get unpredictably tired. I can sleep at night 5-8 hours, and during the day, I want a nap for a few hours. Other than that...no problems. I have not been as depressed or anxious since starting this medication.

I am much more happier. The only thing that has me feeling bad about myself is the weight gain. I think I've gained weight because I'm content with myself.

The down fall is that I do not have insurance and I have to pay full price and it isn't cheap!

My doctor recomended that I start on Lexapro to see if his would help with them.  After a couple of days my panic attacks were gone.  The medication seems to work very well but I do feel spaced out on occation which never happened before I started taking Lexapro.  Weight gain has been a problem but I have joined a gym to help that.  I do suggest taking it the same time everyday to help with the spacing out issue.

It has few side effecs and keeps me very stable emotionally.  the only problem is I'm a bit less interested in sex but I try to do things to help that like relaxing more, having more quality time with my partner etc..  However I think it is defenitely better to feel mentally healthy rather than focus on small side-effects.

I tried Zoloft first which use to work years ago and my doctor suggested trying Lexapro.   I am totally satisfied with Lexapro.   On days that either forget taking it or take it late, my family is the first to notice.   Few side effects for me, more if I don't take it!!  Weight gain is the biggest problem for me, about 20lbs but I am already overweight.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	25-34	8/12/2008 4:32:32 AM	Finally started on anti-depressants when I got insurance.  I have a potentially stressful job, and found myself weighed down by worry and fear.  Unable to get out of bed some days, because I knew I had to go to work.  Began taking Lexapro about 7 months ago and noticed a definite improvement after about a month.  Had to abruptly stop during a two-week insurance mix up, and felt extremely dizzy until I got back on.  Currently taking 20mg a day, in the morning before bed (I work midnights).  I have some trouble falling asleep, and more trouble getting up, but overall I feel much better.

I started off with very vivid dreams making sleeping an adventure! I didnt mind it actually.I went up to a max 20mg per day dose and my partner said i was a little more spaced out then, but not really noticeably. Im now back down to 10mg and over the last year or so have started to experience severe night sweats, im absolutely drenched in sweat and wake up most mornings feeling very tired, drained and dehydrated. I thought it may be a relation between the drug and my hormonal cycle. There seems to be some correlation between it and the time of the month.I hate the sweats but i dont want to stop the drug because im scared of how i will cope without it.I also see the trouble people have with other drugs, Lexapro seems to be the best available at the moment.What im curious about is...how does the drug make you sweat more? What is the chemistry behind it? Does anyone know?

Better than I have in years. I am on 5 mg and it seems to be working. In the past have tried effexlor, prosac, paxil, zoloft, all of them I had to many side effects.I think it's all about the right dose for the right individual.

I cut back to .25 mg per day and it has worked great. Just need to start small and work up.  I take 10mg a day now for 2 years and its really helped me tremendously.

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	8/5/2008 5:09:25 PM	I was experiencing insomnia and decided, in conjunction with my therapist, that it was due to anxiety.  My doctor perscribed Lexapro and I have been taking it for about 5 months now.  It has definitely helped me to sleep better, although I am starting to wonder if I need to increase my dosage because I've had trouble falling asleep recently.  I experienced a decrease in sexual pleasure when I first started taking the drug, but that has diminished.  I think it has caused me to gain about 10 pounds as well.  Overall, however, I am very satisfied with the drug.

Initially had bad anxiety with combo of Lexapro and Ativan. Dr changed me to Wellbutrin.  Still had some anxiety so after a few months added back the Lexapro.  Worked well and eventually stopped the Wellbutrin due to cost. (miss the &quot;cravings&quot; control it helped with) Lexapro has been great.. have occasional anxiety but overall has given me my life back!!!
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	7/31/2008 6:19:01 PM	Been on Lexapro for just over 1 month now. Before I would have 2-3 panic attacks a day. Since the start of the medication, I can count the episodes on my hand. It does make me somewhat tired throughout the entire day, along with some pretty weird and vivid dreams.. But it has dramically turned my life around for the better. Great Drug!

When I was younger it worked fine, but once I was taken off of it I had a couple of relapses. I was put back on it and it did not seem to work as well.  With this medicine you can become somewhat immune to its effectiveness after time. I also had issues falling asleep and was prescribed ambien to go along with it.  Lexapro and Celexa are best suited for younger individuals, and the side effects are less severe. I would recommend this product for younger individuals but with more severe cases I would not.

The everyday activities that used to send me over the edge with worry and anxiety don't bother me anymore. I coast through my day and I am better at planning the future without worry, and I feel more competent interacting with others in a positive, effective manner. My personal relationships have improved with my husband, kids, and other family. My family doesn't &quot;annoy&quot; me as much as before taking Lexapro, and I just feel like I can better handle and actually enjoy the constant demands of being a good wife, mother, daughter, sister, and full-time teacher. I don't worry about stress causing other health problems or damage to my family relationships anymore.

My anxiety keeps me up at night worrying, and this drug kept me up even later. The side effects that I had with it are: it made me gain over 10 pounds, decreased sex drive, and dry mouth. Not recommended for anxiety.

It has only been near a month of using it for anxiety episodes/nerves, but I intend to continue using it for the full affect.  I do have one problem though, it constantly feels like I have a lump in my throat.  At first I thought maybe it was indigestion, but now I'm not sure.  Will speak to my dr. about it.  Overall, seems to be working for now.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression		4	5	4			7/30/2008 4:42:41 PM	I used Lexapro in combination with Wellbutrin.  Taking both of these helps with daily depression.  I feel more stable on these, but a little frustrated because I feel like it I can't cry sometimes and release pent up depression.  I've been off of these after years on them, and I need to go back on them.  They are helpful!

I am a petite person and took a small dosage 1x daily.  I experienced a horrible reaction!  I had trouble sleeping anyway, but this made it much worse!  I wasn't able to go to sleep at all.  Before I would just doze and be up several times throughout the night.  I was also nauseated.  I continued to take it, thinking that it would go away.  On the 3rd day I began to feel flushed and hot.  The only way to describe it is as though my entire body was on fire on the inside.  I literally lay on the cold floor, nude, to get some relief (which didn't help).  I called the ER who put me through to poison control.  I was told basically that what I experienced was not a reaction and there was nothing to do but wait it out.  2 years later, a teacher in my school had the same experience with burning after taking this drug for about 1 week. She also was told this was not a side effect and to &quot;wait it out.&quot;

My family lives 1000 miles away except for my dear husband. Most of my friends are dead or have drifted away. I think my body is getting too used to this drug to be as effective as it once was. It has been very effective in the past and hasn't had many side effects.

The first few days on lexapro I had headaches and felt extremely tired, but overall my mood felt much brighter and more stable. I also felt nauseous and indigestion, so my doctor had me switch to taking it at night instead of morning. I am taking 10mg right now and will probably need to go up to 20mg. I also have had the loss in sexual pleasure, but it feels like it is going away. So far, I feel much better on this drug, and feel a real sense of relief like there is hope to consistantly feeling normal and over all happy!

It is also helping me sleep deeply which I wasn't even expecting...and I have insomnia typically, so this has been a great surprise. I have energy during the day and sleep well at night. And I am so HAPPY for the first time in about 30 years! So far, the only thing is a rapid heartbeat during the day and feels like a squirrel in my chest at times. Well worth the benefits, though and I am hoping that will go away with time.I haven't had anxiety or a panic attack so far!

Dr. has me on combination of Xanax &amp; Lexapro in addition to the Wellbutrin I was already on.  I have not had noticeable weight gain.  I started feeling better within a week.  The only major side effect I have had is the inability to have an orgasm.  I wish there was something for women to help them like the men have with ED medications.  Along with increased communication, Lexapro has saved my marriage!

I am doing 150% better. The only issue I have had is significant weight gain. I have gained about 15lbs in 5 months. I am contimplating switching back to wellbutrin, which I lost weight on. I am happy about the way Lexapro has made me feel, just wish the weight gain wasn't so bad.

Helped greatly with worrying over minor issues.  Tried Cymbalta before but couldn't take because of the nausea.  No side effects with lexapro.  Helped me to stop yelling at my family.  They have definitely noticed a difference.  I smile a lot more these days.
Lexapro+Oral	Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/22/2008 7:43:28 AM	Developed insomnia 5 months ago. Along with a sleep aid, my Dr. wanted me to try this because she said daytime anxiety was causing my insomnia. I told her I was just fine until I hit the bed &amp; thats when the anxiety started. But she said &quot;You have to listen to me&quot; and so I did. I was up all night cleaning. It made me have too much energy and I felt wired. A couple days later I felt an out of body feeling, and said no way, I am getting off. Switched to Celexa...much more calming experience-made me yawn a lot...and feel a bit too lazy...now I am off all of them except my nightly insomnia med-sonata at the moment. Don't let your Dr. force antidepressants on you if your only symtom is insomnia. It may be a change of life issue, not a depression/anxiety issue.

I do find myself quick to become withdrawn and scattered and sometimes very manic and sad when a dose is missed or even later than usual sometimes. some lack of physical interaction with my husband of only a year has also become appearant, especialy to me. I am actually here looking for some info on just that. I thought I ad really found the right pill this time, but I am now hoping I can find a way to ovecome this or I am going to have to start looking for a substitute. taking 15 mg/day. began taking this again 4 months ago at 10mg/day. upped doseage 1 week ago.

I will say that it was difficult to get used to the medication. I would get hot flashes, shakiness and feel like I was going to vomit about an hour after I took it. It took a few months but I was finally normal again. If you have panic disorder, definitely consider it despite the side effects at first.

I feel like I want to jump out of my own skin. Short tempered, eating like crazy, unable to retain thoughts. DO NOT abrubtly stop taking Lexapro. I wanted to stop taking ( after a couple of years) because I sleep so much better when I'm not on it.  I will be refilling my scipt today.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	19-24	7/16/2008 10:39:44 AM	This medication made me feel worse than I already did.  It also threw my entire system out of whack and made me extremely moody.  I had had no appetite before starting this, but even after taking it for a month, the smell of food made me want to vomit and I ended up losing almost 30 pounds.

Much less. I have ileostomy so I only absorb about half the medication. I'll ask my doctor at next visit if I can up the dose a little. Now taking 20mg/day.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	7/15/2008 4:32:02 PM	I have been on Lexapro for two and a half months. I had post-partum depression, and depression from losing our newborn. I do not cry as much, and I have lost the hopeless feeling I once had. I feel as though I can deal with lift once again.  I had no weight gain, no sexual side effects (which were the two I was most concerned with) I really had no side effects. I am very pleased with Lexapro, and plan on going off of it as sson as my three months are up(recommended by my doc).

I do feel calmer on the medicine, but I think it's been making me more tired. It also upsets my stomach a bit unless I eat something first. One thing: definitely taper off slowly if you want to stop this medicine, the withdrawal effects are terrible.

I have a greatly improved mood, almost like I have come up for air after a very, very, long dive in a deep pool.  No more crying or worries.  Sex, after years of blandness has suddenly become very interesting, although a bit difficult to achieve satisfaction.  Weight gain looks like it might be a problem so I'm walking more and watching the total caloric intake.  All in all after 7 years with paxil, with more side effects and less joy I am pleased and will continue this drug.

I experienced a few side effects in the first month of taking it. Night sweats, trouble sleeping, and some extreamly frustrating sexual side effects as well. Thankfully the side effects subsided after a couple of months. I will continue to take Lexapro because now its difficult for me to decribe what it was like to be depressed. It works for me! :)

I noticed an the uplifting feeling very fast and I lost a few pounds at first and even though I have a less of an appetite, I eventually gained weight--a good 15 lbs or so. I am very tired a lot, to the point of falling asleep at work if I don't get up and move around! I do sleep better for the most part and do not worry and cry nearly as much! I will probably stop taking it because of the weight issue.   I started taking the birth control Seasonale about 2 months into taking Lexapro, so I will stop taking that to see if that was cause of weight gain before I stop taking Lexapro.

I feel so much better my doctor just changed it to 10 mg I was taking 5 mg I haven't had any panice attacks. After reading about the weight gain I am worried now thats why I went off the paxil
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	13-18	7/11/2008 9:20:26 AM	I am on 2.5 mg for anxiety and anorexia. It has reduced my obsessing over trivial things and has helped me sleep because I don't worry so much at night. However it gives me a headache and jaw pain, and increased my appetite a little. It has also made me kind of lethargic so I am thinking of doing a smaller dose.

I take a very low dose on normal days, only 5. Then 10 when I'm stressed.  It doesn't make me feel like I'm taking the drug.  But I can tell when I forget it for a few days.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	drugexpert101,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female		7/9/2008 3:42:24 PM	Citalopram is the generic of Celexa and Escitalopram is the generic of Lexapro. Lexapro is the S-enantimoer (a more refined version) of celexa. Escitalopram has been shown in the majority of studies to be superior (in effectiveness) compared to Celexa.

But I did want to drop an FYI: the generic for Lexapro is Citalopram.  That is what my dr told and gave me.

There are days, a few a week, i feel great before I take the lexapro (12:30 every day) but 20 minutes after I take it, the mind goes all over the place.  It feels like you have to hold on to a rope while the wild mind gets anxiety, depressed, horrible thoughts, then fine about 4-5 hours later settles down.  Lexapro can turn on you.  I was a very stable person, went through 4 situations of severe emotional turmoil and it is taken over 9 months for the mind to subside, but I think Lexapro has only made it worse, I am scared to stop taking, but very scared every day to take.  I am in a good state of mind and can actually feel now that Lexapro can make me worse. Therapy and exercise might be better than really depending on Lexapro.

I had to slowly stop taking it because my doctor was afraid of dependency. The only side effect I had was that it make me sleepy which was okay because I took it right before bed each night. Since stopping it my anxiety attacks have come back, but I am better able to deal with them because while on the medicine I realized the things I was worrying about were not worth the effort. I am glad I took Lexapro but do not think I need it any longer. I would recommend it for any one with anxiety that is at a lost at what to do to get through it.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Ceci, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	7/5/2008 10:30:02 PM	I have been taking Lexapro for about 3 days now. On the first day of taking my medication, I noticed a slight beneficial difference in my mood and anxiety level. As of now, I have only had 3 side effects which are insomnia, a slight lump in my throat (which may be from the antibiotic I'm taking), and increased sweating. I believe the medication is working because I don't worry as much and I feel happier than I have in a long time. Anyone else that has experienced a lump in their throat please let me know. It does not effect my breathing or anything, but it just feels kinda strange. I haven't been able to sleep the past two nights, but I was able to take a good nap. I would also like to know if anyone had trouble sleeping like I did and how long it took for the insomnia to go away. So far I would say I'm fairly satisfied with this medication now that I'm not stressing about the little things.

The withdrawal symptoms are AWFUL!!!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	LD, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	7/4/2008 12:22:11 AM	I was on both wellbutrin and Lexapro to stop smoking and was to stay on wellbutrin only a few months.  It ended up I switched doctors and I stayed on both a while then stopped the Lexapro because the wellb. gave me more energy.  I didn't realize over time that I'd become less able to think clearly or calmly.  I was shaking, trembling at times.  Bursts of anger and panic attacks, mad at the world and going over and over bad things that happened and really everything got to me.  I just last week returned to using the Lexapro.  Starting on 10 mg and this doctor said to go to 20 mgs.  At first I was dizzy and sort of sleepy, but I also was calmer and got things done.  I was having trouble leaving the house.  Now I get ready and go!  I can concentrate better and I'm getting so much more accomplished.  I sleep better and feel like I'm in a good mood, actually a little perky and much more outgoing.  I was on lexapro for about a year before the wellbutrin was introduced and it really helped in quitting smoking, but I now see I should have stopped the wellbutrin and stayed on my Lexapro.  It's expensive on my RX plan $50 a month but I feel convinced it is well worth it.  If anyone know when the generic will come out, let me know!!!!!  Thank you for listening!

You have to give your body time to adjust to the medication.

I had been on it for 6 weeks. Not bad at first. After about 3-4 wks I began having fast heartbeat, weakness on right side, insomnia got worse, felt more anxious than ever before. It was not good so I stopped taking it altogether and have been feeling much better. The weakness on the right side was very scary.  It also raised my blood pressure even though I take med for BP control.  Lexapro did not agree with me.

It worked but I was completely numb to everything that went on in my life. I didn't feel sad, happy, excited, stressed.  I had no emotions what so ever; good or bad. Plus I was always tired but when I got in bed at night I couldn't fall asleep. I was worn out and it really made me feel worse off than before I started taking it.

I started with 10mgs, I am now at 30mgs, and I never felt better. I still have a little bit of anxiety, but it is nothing like it used to be. The only side effect that I can complaine about is some sexual side effects. I couldn't even leave the house before Lexapro. I would suggest Lexapro to anybody that is having anxiety.

My brothers were given Lexapro; one became suicidal, the other was agitated, suicidal and extremely hostile. The doctors did not agree it was an effect of the drug, but the FDA person I contacted wanted a formal complaint which I filed. These men and I were in our 50's, but the warnings only mention kids and teenagers. It was horrible  since the doctors did not believe Lexapro could be so damaging, but one brother harmed himself severely. Twice.

I'm happier than I've been in 20 some years.  I was in a VERY bad place when I finally saugh help.  The first month it did make me tired so I switched it from morning to evening.  I don't really remember if it caused me to eat more or not.  I really don't care if it does.  I would much rather be fat and happy than thinner and suicidal.  I am loving life now!

The first day I took it, I started suffering from severe panic attacks... I would get burning hot through my arms, neck and chest, and would start to hyperventilate. I also was nervous/anxious all day, and was starting to get rather depressed, crying thinking I may have to live the rest of my life like this. The dr said I was having a reaction to the med. I stopped taking it 2 days ago, and am slowly starting to feel normal again. She is going to try another med tomorrow, but now because of this reaction, I'm soo scared to try something else. Has this happenned to anyone???
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	6/25/2008 8:02:53 AM	I have been on 10mg lexapro for close to one year now. I'm on it to treat depression/anxiety. It has worked really great for me. The only side effect that I have had is some weight gain, and general tiredness. Overall it has helped my depression immensely, and about half of my anxiety problems. The only downside is the weight gain, but some general dieting and exercise really help to take care of that. (I hear exercising helps with depression some too.)

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		3	3	3			6/19/2008 7:18:21 PM	started over a week ago. tonight will be my 9th does of 20mg. was on zoloft 50mg for many years and decided to taper myself off to 25mg while also quitting smoking with the patch. needless to say I went into a bad state of anxiety, experiencing 4-5 panic attakcs daily for a few weeks. doctor recommended lexapro. first 5 days were horrible. I was experiencing bad head pains, inability to concentrate, inability to be around anyone but myself and shaking. called my doc after 5 doeses, he told me to hang in there, let it work for 2 weeks. last 2 days been feeling better. little to no anxious feelings. hope it works because its scary not to be able to function in life.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	6/19/2008 9:21:53 AM	I would not tell anyone I know to go on this drug. I was like a zombie and had people telling me I had no emotions. I experienced weight gain big time on this drug, along with not sleeping and being tired all the time. I started weening it out of my system 2 months ago and I feel so much better. if you are looking to go on this drug please go and type in side effects from lexapro in your browser and you will be shocked at what you will find. I love webmd, but all the side effects are not listed here.

I was also having social anxiety, although I had been suffering from this most of my adult life and didn't know it. I quit crying all the time and quit having feelings of guilt and self worthlessness. Made me VERY tired all the time. I couldn't cry if I tried. Doctor changed me to Zoloft after 6 weeks because I gained 26 lbs. in 6 weeks. Other than the weight gain I would reccomend it.

It alleviates depression and anxiety.  Spend the money on yourself, you will be glad that you did.  No headaches, dizziness, or sexual dysfunction with lexapro.

While it did calm me down, I felt like a zombie. Had no feelings what so ever, felt detached from life. Very scary experience, I decided to start and end with half of the pill 5mg. Took it for 3 weeks, three days since I stopped taking it, and still feel like a zombie.

Initally it helped a lot, but after being on it for about a year I and my family notice a change in me and a decline in effectiveness. I would even say it turned against me. I gained a lot of weight (30+ pounds) and I became more severly depressed. I even found myself thinking I couldn't live this way. That scared me to death. I quit taking it. My new boyfriend and family said they noticed in a week after quiting that I was a different, happier woman. Since quiting it I was fine and did loose the weight. That was the clincher. I have seen and heard from other patients similar stories in my work in the medical field. I would not recommend it. I felt the side effects were worse than the depression I felt. Please seek help though. This is my opinion only. There are many options.

Help with anxiety. I did gain about 20lbs and had bad sexual side effects. I had no desire to have sex and when I did it took forever. I stopped taking the drug and was dizzy for a few weeks, but it finally went away.

I was so riddled with anxiety I didn't want to continue to live that way. I have little to no anxiety now, I can laugh again and focus on things other than the &quot;what if's&quot;! I have gained a lot of weight. 40-50 lbs! Partly because food is not the enemy anymore. Even with a diet and exercise I am unable to loose any of it. I have also lost my sex drive but I think it may be due to the unattractiveness of my current heavy state, not a side effect specifically. I hesitate to go off as I can feel the anxiety if I forget to take it. Do I stay on it forever? How do I cope with the anxiety with out it? How much more weight will I gain? Is being fat and unhappy better for me than being anxious and unhappy? Will I have horrible withdrawls if I wean off? these are some things I still need to find out. Anybody have answers?

I've stopped smoking with Chantix.  My PTSD, anxiety and depression are virtually non existent now.  However, I have gained approx. 4  lbs. per month and am the heaviest I've ever been at 241. Lex works for me but the weight gain is awful.

Tried weaning off myself (1/2 dose for a couple weeks, 1/2 dose every other day for a couple weeks)  The depression returned &amp; started getting the brain zaps.  Didn't connect them with the drug until reading other comments. Very Helpful!  Back to a regular schedule, and feeling better.  Guess I'm not ready to stop the meds.

It isn't as effective as I was hoping it would be, but it is better than the alternative. Just make sure that you don't run out because you will have withdrawl symptoms. I get feelings like electric shocks...not too fun.

You definately need to be &quot;weened&quot; off of it.  Otherwise, you'll experience withdrawl symptoms, which would explain your nausea, and if you have any &quot;brain zaps&quot;.  It's strongly recommended that you stop taking it slowly, rather than just stop.

Now that I've been on this for almost 2 weeks, I'm not experiencing the side effects as heavily.  I'm still a little tired, but I don't feel dizzy or nauseous or &quot;drunk&quot; anymore!!   My anxiety attacks haven't completely stopped yet, but they're definately declining.  I took my son to the movies over the weekend and though I felt a little of the anxiety kicking in, I breathed through it and told myself that I'd be alright. Between that and the medicine, my son and I had a great day together!!   I'm loving Lexapro!!!

I have been completely off for 1 week and I cannot stand how bad I feel! My head bothers me constantly and I can't get anything done. I also feel nauseated and weak. Any feedback would be so appreciated!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	6/4/2008 9:26:48 AM	I was on lexapro for about 5 months. I'm no longer on it. I found that after a couple weeks I would have to get a higher dose because it would stop working. I have changed to citaphram (celexa) and it works great.

I can't sleep, can't eat, I'm nauseous all the time, and I'm dizzy.  I almost feel like I'm drunk, which is no good when I'm at work or caring for my 4 year old!!  It's too soon to tell if it's helping with the anxiety or not, but the side effects are aweful.  I'm just hoping that after a few  weeks, they will subside and I'll be able to live my life normal again.  It's been a long time!!

I bumped up to 20mg with no change in depression.  I also have gained about 10lbs since bumping up to 20mg.  Now mind you, I work out 6 days a week, and run 3 days a week.  I shouldn't be gaining weight.  An average person might gain alot more.  ( As a woman I know we research the weight gain part of meds.) Also, lexapro is a very mild medication, and only takes the edge of MDD.  I am supposed to take stronger meds but hate the zombie and weight gain effects.  In conclusion, I am not sure if their IS ANY help for this condition.  Side effects can further the depression.

I hope I will get through this without anything else. I never want to take any of these drugs again.

Started out on 10mg every day.  It felt like too much, I was a zombie.  I've cut back to 1/2 a 10mg pill every other day.  It's perfect.  Just enough to take the edge off and I have a bit more energy and motivation.  I had no motivation to do anything except lay on the couch or read in my bed.  I took Prozac for 7 years and have been off it for 4 years.  Felt I needed something, but not as drastic as Prozac.  Lexapro is working for me.  The weight gain was a huge issue with Prozac.  I gained about 75 pounds.  I am making a conscious effort on the Lexapro.

My temper and outbursts have minimized as well as my axiety.  During the first two weeks I took 1mg of Lorazepam in the evening, and 1/2mg in the morning to ease the transition into this therapy which seems to be working well.  The Lorazepam helped me to sleep at night until this medication began to work.The most difficult side effect for me has been the morning nausea (the urge to vomit).  I discontinued the use of Lorazepam after three weeks with some insomnia and night sweats. Sexual desire has waned slightly, and arousal takes a bit longer but engaging is still as good.  I am a large man but have not experienced any weight gain but the urge to eat more frequently is there.This therapy does work but I am not certain if this is for a lifetime.Take Care!

Lexapro was the first medication I tried and it worked really well. It made me a feel a bit strange for the first few weeks, headaches and spacey feelings but these wore off and I feel I am back to my old self. I still feel a bit depressed sometimes but it has worked wonders on my anxiety. I can leave the house and drive on my own again. I have been on 10mg a day since January 08.

It seems to take the edge off so I still feel like me. I do seem to be hungry more often so I am trying to eat healthier foods and walk 30mins/day to help stop the weight gain. I have also  feel dehydrated so drinking lots of water and  avoiding coffee seem to help some. And, like others, feel alittle tired. All in all, it seems to a good fit for me inspite of the side effects.

Lexapro+Oral	Other	mamaR, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	5/27/2008 1:05:16 PM	I started taking Lexapro for intestinal and digestive illness.  At first the racing heart, and being unable to sleep for two weeks was unsettling. I blew up at a technician at the hospital for no good reason the second week!  Anger was not my thing before taking this drug!  I was told by the pharamacist that Celexa would be so much cheaper since it just went to a $4.00 price, but I'm not sure of the change, and my doctor ignored me when I suggested the change.  Perhaps he makes more money when he orders Lexapro?  Although my stomach calmed down some, I experienced a huge appetite, the opposite of what I was told by the doctor!  I ignore my stomach now, and I'm not as moody as I was when my stomach was always painful.  I must say though, I also seem to have developed a void of emotions.  It's like I can't even cry when it would be appropriate.  I question whether this is a temporary thing.I'm going to continue to research this drug before taking it long term.

Lexapro has lessen them.I rarely have them now. :) I am also no longer plagued by anxiety and IBS. It took about 6 weeks to really work at 10 mg. After about a year I started to feel nervous again and had more migraines return. Now I take 20 mg. I am thrilled at age 49 to feel so happy and healthy. the best i have felt in years. Don't give up..it may take awhile to adjust to it. I was very tired at first..

I see alot of people on here say they can not afford this drug. Most Doc. give samples away so that the patient never pays for it, or try the pharmacuetical comp. they always have programs to help pay for meds. Google discount drug cards and thousands come up and u can check the price, the cards are free and you can print them out. GOOD LUCK!!

I didn't even know it was possible to feel that way. I can't believe I didn't get off of it sooner. Terrible. Took it when I was 17 years old.

I have gained 25-30 pounds, sweat like crazy, clench my jaw, have jitters, and no sex drive.  If it keeps up my husband may need some sort of therapy.  The good thing is that I just don't seem to care about any of this......I am going to carefully, and with my physicians help wean myself off this medication.  Hopefully I will be able to get ride of the prudish fat sweaty nervous wreck I have become

I wonder if I'm the only one.  It's a good medicine, but a little pricey.  I'm scared to be taken off given the accounts of withdrawal symptoms.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/18/2008 10:14:53 PM	I started on Celexa, which worked ok, but had more side effects- I was constipated and had nausea, it helped to take it in the P.M. I went to a Psychiatrist and she put me on Lexapro instead- Works better for me, fewer side effects.  I stopped taking it for a while and gradually noticed a difference, re-started on it and immediately (overnight, actually) felt better.  If you need it, it's better to stay on it.  It's amazing what drugs do to the system... I see people having problems taking low doses.. I'm at 20!  Go with what works, I guess... Good Luck!

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	ANY ONE GETTING WEIRD SIDEEFFECTS FROM LEXAPRO ? , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	5/13/2008 4:35:51 PM	I crashed from anxiety, stress and i jumped out of my skin, horrible mental breakdown out of nowhere.  (years of stress or hormonal imbalance, not sure) Either way I have tried to keep my mind stable.  I felt very stable before i crashed.  I started Lexapro 10 and it was too strong, it made me scattered, hyper mentally (no physical side effects) and I couldnt complete a chore because I couldnt think straight.  Somewhere in the middle of all this I became OCD with horrible thoughts ( i think it was panic/depression setteling in) and i fought this away.  With doctors guidance, I lowered lexapro to 5 milligrams and most days seem ok, but like today, I woke up fine exersized mentally perfect.  I took lexapro same time every day and within 15 minutes It makes me feel weird, detached, cant focus, WEIRD and not a good weird.  feel horrible.  It takes a while to wear off and I take 1/2 a lorezepam to fix what the lexapro might be doing.  I am not 100% sure about lexapro or just going natural and taking a lorezepam or 1/2 a lorezepam when panic/mind racing starts to come on.  If anyone is having the same problem with lexapro, please respond in this website.  I want to try and like and stay on lexapro but it can give me really bad days after I take it.  I FEEL FINE BEFORE I TAKE IT.  I dont get it.  Thanks.

Now at age 24 my doctor felt I should start again for sleeping issues due to anxiety. I took the drug 20mg dose for two days. Well it was worst two days of my life. I was unbelievably thirsty and tired. If anything I felt depressed and cloudy. I couldnt talk to anyone and didnt answer my phone. So without telling my doctor YET I will not be taking Lexapro.

Nothing worked. Most made things worse.  I was finally diagnosed OCD and prescribed only 5mgs of Lexapro. It really made a HUGE difference. I could enjoy things again!!! The only side effects I had were some dry mouth (and that went away in the second or third week, and I had more bowel movments(!)This was accually a good side effect. It seemed to make me more &quot;regular&quot;. I am definately happy with this med. The only reason I only gave it 3 stars in &quot;ease of use&quot; is it costs alot even with my insurance, but even that is not enough to make me stop taking it.That being said, my husband also took it, and it didn't work for him. his dosage was higher, and he experienced sexual side effects, both lack of desire and anorgasm. It was bad enough to make him change to a different drug. I have known a few other people who tried this med. Now, this is in no way a scientific survey, and comes from a very small sample, but from what I have gathered from other users, it seems like this drug may work much better for women the men.

The side effects were so bad -- extreme tiredness, weakness, very dry mounth, lost of appetite; restlessness, jettery, and nervousness. This is the 2nd  day without Lexapro and I still have thw side effects. I am not going on more anti-depressant drugs again.

Dr. then put me on Celexa 60mg/Welbutrin 300mg. After 5wks on both, I had severe panic attacks 6-8 times a day. From there I went on Zoloft 150mg. HORRIBLE!!!! Couldn't get out of bed, sad all the time. Finally put back on Lexapro 20mg.  AMAZING.  I feel in control, strong and independent.  No panic attacks, less obessive thoughts, only sad and depressed with situations(not &quot;just because&quot;.)  This medication has been a real lifesave.

My alcoholism eventually drove me to the state of severe anxiety. I began taking Paxil while I was still drinking so it really didn't work. I switched to Lex and also went to rehab at about the same time. I am now 9mo sober and still taking Lex. I believe this drug helped me through this challenge. When I read the reviews it almost looks like the people with Anxiety benefit far greater than the people with depression or greater dis-orders.

The main thing I didn't like about this medicine was the side effect of weight gain. Everything else I liked. It seemed to get get into my system and start working quick even though the literature says it doesn't take 6 weeks or so to start. I felt better in a week. I know it was the meds, I had no other reason to feel better!!! I was doing spring cleaning in January, reorganizing my filing cabinets, joined a gym, started a book club. I felt more alive than I think I ever did. I got off of it because of the weight issue and my blood pressure, I am now on Effexor...no weight gain, just as good of results

I suffered SEVERE nausea and headache, along with shakiness and dry mouth and a general feeling of being unwell.  The inability to eat even a tiny amount of food caused me to lose nearly 10 lbs.  I was hoping the drug might help me gain a bit of weight, as I am underweight to begin with.  All in all, a nightmarish experience.  No more SSRIs for me!

I have only been on for a few days. I feel OK metally, but not physically. Last night I had a couple beers and did not think twice. Boy was that a bad idea. I wwas throwing yp all night. Anyone else have any experiences with this drug and drinking. I read a post that the person was sick for their first week, so just wondering if it is normal the first week or if I was sick from the combo of alcohol and Lexapro?

When I get flair ups, which come with anxiety attacks, my doctor prescribes Lexapro. It takes at least four weeks to begin to work, but the results are wonderful. My side effects are quite different than those mentioned: I become extremely tired and sleep well at night and it actually reduces my appetite. I have lost a few pounds. After three months, I wean myself off the medication, until the next attack occurs.

However, the insomnia, weight gain, and negative effect on my libido are unacceptable side effects and are profound indeed.  In order to get regular sleep, I had to be prescribed a sleep medication and absolutely could NOT fall asleep without it (despite many attempts); I am quite proud of a major weight loss, but, after taking Lexapro, I gained quite a bit back--absolutely unacceptable; being quite vivacious and alive, I found that while taking Lexapro, my libido had drastically declined.  All in all, the negative effects are simply not worth it for me.

But, the general consensus of the three of us is that i have characteristic (in my blood &amp; bone, born with it) depression and anxiety. So they said: &quot;Go with Lexapro&quot;. I have been on it for a little more than a month now. I think it's working. My anxiety has subsided. I used to have these feelings of loneliness, despair quite often and easily triggered. I still get anxious and lonely but not as frequently and i do not  start feeling as hopeless. The first week on this pill i could not sleep, now i can barely get out of bed in the morning. But it is a kind of nice sleepy feeling, very relaxed and comfy. Strange. I have always sweated a lot, with wet stains underarms. Now it is even worse. But, i swear, it does not bother me as much, i kind of look at it more calmly, without panicking and running to change the shirt. Funny. So, Lexapro is working for me pretty decently, but i certainly do not want to be taking it forever, and i hope to not get bad withdrawal symptoms.

I have tried a few different medications and I have found Lexapro to be the most gentle medication to my system.  The first week was a little hard to sleep and I felt dizzy especially when I was standing in one place for a long time.  I have been taking Lexapro for almost 5 months and I feel like me again.  I cannot wait to not have to take it anymore, but since I have been thrown quite a few obstacles lately, it is definitely helping the anxiety.

Love Lex but hate the sweating side effect that comes with it as I have a sweat issue. I hate to read the sexual side effects! I have been on it but not long enough both times to experience the coming off addiction or the other stuff, just sweating. After having my son 15 months ago I feel like my patience and my worry is going through the roof and Xanax makes me want to sleep so I am trying this out again... has worked before so we shall see!

This medication made me worse, I wasn't able to concentrate and had two car accidents in one day!  I hate this medication and I told me doctor that I refuse to take it and showed him an article from the London Times that Lexapro has been banned in the U.K. and I believe it is a bad medication.

Lexapro+Oral	Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/26/2008 11:16:05 AM	My number 1 complaint has been impulsive anger, sometimes to the point where I feel like I just want to rip my skin off.  My therapist has waivered in diagnosis from Panic Disorder to Depressive Disorder-NOS, and at this point I don't know what the diagnosis is, but Lexapro has helped a great deal!  It also was a pleasant surprise to find that it has helped my bug phobia and has helped me be a little more outgoing as well.  However, I have found that I am VERY sensitive to it.  Initially starting at 5 mg and then increasing to 10 mg, I had what I would describe as mild hypo-manic episodes and then when I tried to discontinue it due to sexual side effects (anorgasmic) I experienced SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome (withdrawl).  Within days I felt like I had been hit by a truck, my entire body ached so badly I could barely get out of bed, I experienced an electric shock sensation in my brain approx. every 30 seconds, and my temper was through the roof!  So, I ended up back on Lexapro to allieviate those symptoms and to wean off it more slowly.  Months later, I came off of Lexapro with just the electric brain shock sensation (that never seemed to really go away) and after finding Wellbuitrin SR and XL ineffective, requested to add back 2.5mg of Lexapro and I'm back to feeling pretty good again.  Not as great as 5 mg, but at 2.5 mg the sexual side effects are minimalized.

DO NOT TRY TO COME OFF OF IT BY YOURSELF..I tried this and I couldnt sleep for a week..it gave me a nervous feeling in my legs like someone was trying to pull them off. No a good feeling. I went to the doctor and he said it was like a &quot;withdrawal&quot; effect. But Lexapro has tremendously helped me! I would recommend it to anyone!

I was absolutely resistent to drug treatment, tryting months of alternative therapies.  After virtually no relief I finally &quot;caved&quot; and began Lexapro as part of a multi-pronged aspproach that seems to be working: I requested a role change at my job, committed to getting more sleep &amp; eating better, started seeing a therapist, and began Lexapro @ 10mg.  It took 6 weeks for the med to work - the panic was less frequent and less intense but still needed xanax on occasion.  After 3 months, upped dose to 20mg and I am thankful at how I am WAY better than a year ago.  One noticeable side effect - I've gained 12 lbs in the last 2-3 months (hadn't gained weight in many years before), my Dr. told me virtually unavoidable with this class of meds.  I look at it as a necessary evil - I am functioning consistently almost like my old self again.  The weight gain is frustrating and I would think I'll lose it when I can wean off the drug, but it does work for me and is giving me hope to restore balance to my life again...
Lexapro+Oral	Other	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	4/23/2008 4:22:41 PM	My physician prescribed this medication for chronic pain.  I was having terrible headaches and nech aches for months, with no success from physical therapy etc. etc.  I was going through some life changes and had some anger issues, as well as mild anxiety and just a general lack of happiness.  I went from waking up in a bad mood and getting mad atleast several times a day to getting mad twice in 6 weeks!  I actually laughed afterwards b/c it was so amazing that I had changed so much.  I am generally a much happier person, though I am experiencing some side effects.  Difficulty sleeping at night (mild insomnia), and it is quite difficult to orgasm, though my girlfriend does not complain.  Overall my sex-drive is back, at first it went down, probably from frustration in not being able to orgasm, but I have control of that now.I've been on 10mg for 6 weeks and am very satisfied.

I started taking 10mg, along with The Patch to help me quit smoking. After a couple of weeks, and the Lexapro began to take it's full effect... I soon discovered that the two of them did not interact very well together. I ended up passing out from it. My Dr took me off the patch, purged my system from everything, increased my dosage to 20mg/day...Lexapro has helped me a great deal... I am back to work, with a better attitude, no thoughts of suicide, all is going well again.If I forget to take my meds before I go to bed (once in a while), I definitely can feel it. Or if I forget to call in my perscription and I'm off of the meds for a couple of days, I start getting the chest pains, become very agitated, irritable, and I begin to feel depressed again. So I do recommend Lexapro, and I do recommend that you don't forget to fill your perscription. If it helps you and you see and feel that it has improved you... and made you feel better than what you were feeling before you started taking it... keep taking Lexapro as a maintenance. It really does work.I hope this helped.

It made me feel worse then before i started. I mean im 15 years old and it made me feel horrible. I was really shaky on the outside and i felt like insane on the inside. It just made me feel worse. I now take Zoloft which has helped wonderfully!

It should be taken off the market. ANY drug that elevates your seratoin will also drop you hard. Ask ANYONE who's come off it. 40+ years ago, My brother was unwittenly addicted. He kicked that habit after going to Hell and back, swearing never again to replay that part of his life. However, recently he was involved in a near Death experience (roll-over accident), because of his inability to get back behind a wheel of a car, his Dr. prescribed him Lex. to help with the anixeity. The first month he was great! The end of the second month, his greatest nightmare RETURNED and has been ever since. This stuff is worst then any narcotic. I am not lying. I am talking from experience. I am really mad at his Dr. for prescribing this to him, without informing him of it's severe addictive powers. He now gets to deal with the sleepless nights, twitching, night sweats, nightmares, no energy, etc.; because of his Dr's lack of knowledge of medicines. This is a repeat of 40 years ago, when Doctors got a very young boy addicted, after an accident. Then after his families insurance ran out-they deemed him cured. Although, they forgot all about to un-addict him, during the process.Please, Please be ware!!! This stuff is like playing with Fire, you will get burned!

With Lex 10, i can control my anger, feel relaxed, can sort out what is important to worry about and what isn't. No bad sexual side effects, actually can stay erect alot longer!! Have only been on for 4 weeks so far and it seems to be working great!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	13-18 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	13-18	4/19/2008 10:41:48 PM	I switched to this medication after being on citolpram (celexa). I had severe nausea for the first week and could barely keep food down. However, it was completely gone after that and I felt grea. My anxiety is almost gone and I am much more laid back. I also don't feel any symptoms of depression &amp; feel better than ever. I recommend it!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	5	Female	19-24	4/19/2008 11:00:26 AM	I started Lexapro this past November after a suicide attempt. After about a month I felt wonderful and as an added bonus I had no appetite so I was losing a bit of weight. However I fooled myself into thinking that I didn't need it and stopped taking it cold turkey. DO NOT DO THIS!! I became depressed and suicidal once again. If you feel that it is time to discontinue use please talk to your doctor!! I am now back on it and feeling somewhat better. Live and learn I suppose. A few drawbacks are mild dizziness and nausea and a major one is NO sex drive but perhaps in time it will pass.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Trader, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	4/15/2008 8:28:22 AM	Two partner neurologists treating me for spinal stenosis, vertigo and resulting anxiety after 2 years of suffering symptoms decided after less than 3 minutes in my first appointment that I just HAD to be 'depressed', and prescribed Lexapro.  Within 4 days I landed in the ER with a diagnosis of &quot;acute drug reaction Lexapro&quot; and they were peeling me off the ceiling.  Never before did I have such horrible thoughts... of homicide, suicide, insanity or unreality.  These neurologists should have had their licenses pulled, and this drug should never be prscribed unless by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist and only after proper testing and full evaluation for 'depression'.  I've never been depressed a day in my life, thank goodness, and I'll never again accept an anti-depressant from any so-called 'doctor'.  This drug caused me the scariest incident of my entire half-century of living...

Before lexapro, out of nowhere I had a breakdown from stress or hormones, not sure, but I was a mess. Very severe anxiety, disorented, thoughts turned scary obsessive.  The beginning of lexapro at 5mg  ok, and then 10mg was too strong (taliing very,very fast etc. like severe caffine)  Lowered to 5 and I'm doing great.  I sometimes feel weird/not like myself, and feels due to the medication.  It can put you in a manic (fast) state of mind.  The anxiety has subsided, but I am afraid to travel far from my doctors because I worry that the drug will flip me out a little.  Exersize is excellent, Lorezepam is excellent just in case and deep breathing great as well.SIDE EFFECT:  For the entire time, there is a low buzzing/like a radio frequency/ringing that I can hear in the am while waking up and middile of night when up from sleeping (can hear when its quiet)  Doctor not sure, pharmacist not sure.  Blood pressure and physically all tests fine.

I've been on 10 mg of lexapro since december and have had little problems. taking it mainly for anixety and depresson. After being on high dosages of Prozac i feel so much more alive on lexapro. i have noticed slight spasms when trying to sleep, but have been having difficulty sleeping since i was a child. also slightly controlling, which i though was just my personality..but could be the medicine. Have unfortunatly noticed before i get my period my mood swings overpower the medicine and cause be my depression.

I was taking 20mg for about a year, and it help SO much, my anxiety was practically gone-- so i figured, why not get off if i am feeling great? The withdrawl symptoms are horrible (but any withdrawl symptoms are pretty bad). I had horrible head 'buzzes', but it went away and i felt great for a few months until my anxiety hit a high again. Ive been 20mg now for about 6 months, and i have found myself in a constant state of depression. very little anxiety, but ive come close to suicide a few times. I cannot get myself motivated to do ANYTHING. I want off drugs completely... but i decided to give effexor a chance before i stop again. any advice?

My girlfriend is understanding, and we hope it will just go away. I might need to try something else.

Yes, it helped my anxiety and panic. I am a loving, sweet person and having a outgoing personality.  Lexapro made me have extreme mood swings and I became VERY hostile.  I actually, bought a book on &quot;Anger Management&quot;.  I felt like I had no control over my actions and it was not a way to live.  My husband called me &quot;PITBULL&quot;, because of my out of control aggression. It was a horrible six months!!  I finally came of Lexapro and I am back to being the sweet, kind, gentle individual, I use to be.  Now, I am on Cymbalta and it really works for the panic attacks.  Please, watch for side effects and talk to your DR, ASAP if you notice anything unusual.

I've taken Prozac and Zoloft for short periods in the past, and neither were as effective as Lexapro.  I have not experienced any side effects.  I was concerned about the possible sexual side effects.  I've had no problems at all - its actually helped because I'm feel so calm and at ease.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	4/3/2008 11:05:05 PM	Dr. prescribed this for anxiety and depression.  Was doing 20mg, then 10mg after side effects became unbearable.  Lex does help even things out emotionally, and sometimes to excess, but oh the side effects!!  I had insomnia, weight gain, jaw clenching, excessive yawning and tiredness, almost no sex drive, and a jittery buzzy feeling.  I also enjoy a glass of wine or beer, but not with Lex.  More than 2 glasses and I get a head splitting migraine.  I don't know what's worse - feeling depressed and anxious or physically feeling like crap.  I was hoping the 10mg dose would help.  I stopped taking it and feel fine physically, but now I'm irritable and have the anxiety again.  Or maybe it's just I have too much stress right now?  I'm thinking of seeing how it goes for the next couple weeks after stressful stuff is over.  If I still feel anxiety, I may try 1/2 the 10mg pill to see if I can even out the feelings and not have the terrible side affects.

I did'nt seek help untill I was in my 40s. After getting mental and medical help. I was put on prozac, that didn'nt work well so I was put on paxil. But that did'nt help either. I was put on Lexapro 6 years ago now and it works well for me. I get naeusa, once in a while, and deal with anxiety once in a while. but all in all the drug works for me. I feel it has really saved my life. I'd rather put up with a little naeusa, and happy than be depressed or dead.

A year before starting, I had twins.  I suffered from severe postpartum depression.  I tried to get better on my own, thinking it was just &quot;baby blues&quot;, but a year later, the depression was still there.  I was also beginning to have anxiety attacks.  My ob-gyn decided that I need to try 10 mg, and it has made me feel so much better.  The first few weeks, I felt very dizzy and tired.  I also had some headaches.  These side effects subsided after a few weeks.  Now, 3 years later, I am still on 10mg and doing great.  I have never tried to come off of it because I am scared I might start with the depression again.  I would recommend this medication to anyone suffering from postpardum depression!!  It sure has made a difference in  my life!!

I had post partum depression and this medication was a life saver! My son is now 4 months old and I have continued to take Lexapro because I feel it helps my mood swings. I feel like I can be a better mother to my sons because I'm much happier with this medication. I would recomend it to anyony suffering with any type of depression!
Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder		1	1	1			3/30/2008 11:12:56 PM	I was put on Lexapro for panic disorder. In my first few weeks, I never slept, and it gave me even more anxiety then I've ever known. Through out the duration of being on the drug, I was constantly nautious, and frequently vomiting. I lost 12 pounds in my first month, and 7 in my second. I weened off the medication with proper instructions from my physician about 5 months into the pill. Even though I too my time, I would get zaps out of nowhere during the day and at night. It felt like someone was taking a tazor to my body. Be VERY careful coming off this pill.

Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	cupcake, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/29/2008 8:42:25 PM	I have been on Lexapro for 4 months now, I was having very bad panic attacks, not able to breath. This medication has helped a great deal, yes it messed with my sex life, and sleep pattern, but I had to give it time to work about 6 weeks. The changes that I have experienced have been for the better and I am no longer having panic attacks, you do have to get plenty of rest, and do what works best for your individual body. But I would not change it for the world. Everyone has noticed that I am much calmer. But please always consult your physican when starting and stopping taking these drugs, because they do have serious side effects.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	3/28/2008 10:33:50 AM	Was on it for 3+ years and decided with my doc to change meds because my sex drive was NONEXISTENT and other meds had become available that had fewer sexual side effects - We weaned me down VERY slowly - Literally over a month's time or more - Did the last .25mg for 2 weeks and then stopped - Felt weird at first and then exactly 10-14 days after my last dose I crashed - We had had a snowstorm the night before and all the dr.'s offices in town were closed - I wasn't suicidal, per se, but I definitely had a concious understanding of how people can be - Scared me very badly and I went to the emergency room immediately - The psych on call ended up working for the same place where I went for therapy sessions so I started seeing him and everything went very well after that - So my primary opinion is that you should be VERY VERY careful when you are going off of it
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	3/27/2008 11:12:57 AM	I only took Lexapro for one day, but my symptoms were so outrageous that I know it's not for me. One of the symptoms that I saw no one else listed was difficulty breathing. When I had been sitting for a long period of time and got up to walk around, my heart would beat a lot faster and I couldn't breathe very well. After a couple of hours, I became very tense to the point where my lower back began aching. Near the end of the day, I was so awake I couldn't sleep ALL night, even after I took a sleeping pill. Lexapro may work wonders for some people, but I just felt like I took a stimulant rather than an SSRI.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/26/2008 3:20:57 PM	I was on another a.d. for years and it was fine but I am always seeking something better.  YOU CANNOT TAKE THIS AT NIGHT if you have anxiety.  Yes, it will keep you up as I was up for 56 hours and no I am not bipolar because I was exhausted.  Dr. told me to take first thing in the morning and since then I have been fine.  In fact, a bonus for me is I have no appetite.  I'm only 50 lbs overweight and I am trying to lose weight but am an emotional eater.  So this has helped.  I just started it 3 weeks ago at 10mg, so we shall see over the next year how I do.

I am SOO tired, have NO appetite, nauseated, dizzy, and feel NUMB! STILL from only ONE dose the previous day! UGH! I may try a half next time, but for now I want NOTHING more to do with it.  Need to see about getting xanex instead and just take when i need it.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	25-34	3/26/2008 2:14:20 AM	The medication helped bring me out of my depression but I kind of stayed in a careless nothing bothers me attitude. I also experienced some sexual side effects such as partial erection and not being able to ejaculate. I also experienced some jitteriness which caused me to tighten muscles in my arms and legs and caused me to clench my jaw.

Noticed a big difference. My mood swings and anger are better. Although I do go off sometimes. The biggest drawback from this is no sew drive at all. My husband and I have had no sex life for about 2 years. I feel so bad, but thank God he understands. He would rather I be on the meds than not.
Lexapro+Oral	Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome	Jennyrose44, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/24/2008 10:04:06 PM	This drug has changed my life. I have been on 5 mg/day for 4 years to treat anxiety disorder. I had panic attacks since age 3, then anxiety disorder since 14. I had been entirely resistant to taking medication to treat my anxiety, but after being diagnosed with PTSS (after a near-fatal car accident in my family) my doctor said I really should give this new drug a try. It doesn't take away the consciousness of being anxious or worried for me, but does take away the physical symptoms of anxiety and allows me to deal with it so much better. I went from being afraid of leaving my house to moving alone to Scotland and traveling the U.S. for work. I suggest this drug as an option for anyone struggling with consistent anxiety (not just &quot;being stressed&quot;). It's not for everyone, and I would suggest starting with a low dose first to see how that does, especially if you're as resistant to going on drug treatment as I was.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	3/24/2008 7:43:45 PM	I started Lexapro after severe side effects taking Zoloft (which was odd since I had successfully been on Zoloft for 16 months 3 years prior). For Lexapro, my dr. started me on 10 mg, to be increased to 20 mg after 10 days. I took 10 mg for 10 days before stopping. I stopped because I had tremors throughout my body (face, tongue, hands, arms, legs) and mucous diarrhea from day 7-10, as well as increased overall anxiety and panic attacks that were worse than the original anxiety. It has been 5 weeks since I stopped Lexapro, and I now take half a .25 mg Xanax every 2-3 days as needed(at first it was every day). I also have been exercising at least 3 times a week. My anxiety is almost gone now. This regimen is working out much better for me than the SSRIs for now.

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	Birmingham, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	2	Female	55-64	3/23/2008 3:24:29 AM	I started taking Lexapro for General Anxiety Disorder, most recently manifested in roller coaster blood pressure (varying between 180/110 and 95/65 within the same day in spite of BP medication), and the fluctuations causing debiliting vertigo. In the past I have also suffered from panic attacks, migraines, irratible bowel syndrome, stomach ulcers, etc. -- thus the diagnosis of GAO. I was unable to tolerate the full dosage of 20 mg of Lexapro, due to continued feelings of anxiety, difficulty sleeping, nightmares, and a general feeling of &quot;weirdness&quot; or &quot;unrealness&quot;, even though I was taking clonzipene to offset those symptoms.After 4 months, my doctor finally decided I was too sensitive to Lexapro to take 20 mg and reduced me to 10 mg, as well as prescribing Ambien to help with sleep and nightmares/anxiety dreams.After another 4 months at 10 mg, I finally feel like a normal person again.  Blood pressure is stabilized, allowing reduction in BP medication.  Feeling of &quot;weirdness&quot; has disappeared.  Still have some sleep problems, which I expect to continue as long as I take Lexapro (a decongestant or caffiene will keep me awake all night.)

Used to scream and yell a lot--I was miserable &amp; others around, me, too! I've gained 20lbs--not good. Sleep a lot--that's o.k. I used to feel everything, like having my tentacles (octopus tentacles) stepped on. Now, they are retracted &amp; I don't hurt near as much emotionally. I still get sad and want to cry, but I don't outwardly cry that much anymore. I still cry silently inside myself. But, overall, I do feel so much relief as compared to before taking Lexapro. I don't want to go back to being that old, mean, person.  I was irritable, aggressive, hateful, had no patience, and very talkative.  Couldn't sleep and always complaining.  Now, I'm an angel!  My boyfriend is very happy with me now.  So, the drug definitely has helped me. I'll be on it forever.

In a span of 2 1/2 years I have gone from 105 lbs. to 139 lbs.  I cant get my six pack abs back. every time I try to stop taking it I get VERY sick, I throw up, I've passed out, dizziness, headachs the list is never ending. I told my doc I was gaining waight, tired all the time, couldnt sleep at night.  He said &quot;people that are happy now do gain waight and thats a good thing&quot; NOT. I cant hold my eyes open at 1:00 in the afternoon and thats when we start surgery at work!  NOT a good time to fall asleep!!!! My dr. office wouldnt give me the weaning dose.  I'm doing as my sister did when she got off of it and will never take anything ever again.  I feel like a drugie needing a fix.  I have to take benadryl to help me sleep at night. 2 cups of coffee to get me up in the morning!  I see tracers with my vision. I quit the stressful job right after I started taking it and love my job now.  I dont need this little white pill. Trying to quit is making me more crazy then when I didnt take it at all.  I say to anyone that reads this DO NOT START TAKING THIS MEDICATION!

I was diagnosed in 1995 w/ Lifelong or Double Depression (Dysthymia) along w/ severe anxiety. Needless to say, I've tried several other meds and up until now Zoloft or Effexor have been the ones I have been going back and forth w/ every 18-24 months. I was on Lexapro before but it seemed to &quot;wind me up too much&quot; and add too the anxiety. But now that I'm taking oxycodone for severe back pain from work injuries, it seems to help w/ the sedating effects of the pain meds and has helped the depression and anxiety.

It worked wonders for mild depression and anxiety.&#160; Day to day life was definitely more positive and much clearer.&#160; It increased my motivation and focus.&#160; However, you do feel &quot;numb&quot;- I couldn't cry or feel much emotion at all.&#160; I gained almost 20lbs in 6 months, had NO sex drive, and had the inability to orgasm.&#160; The weight gain seemed to continue and I drew the line.&#160; I weaned off over a 3 week period and felt pretty bad in the process- sick, dizzy, headaches, etc.&#160; I'm happy to be off- looking into trying something new!

I started feeling a difference in days, and found a new balance in my life in just weeks.  Now I usually feel normal and have an occasional bad day in stead of the other way around.  The only side affect I've noticed is that it made me tired for the first couple weeks, but then my body adjusted and I don't have any noticable side affects.  This little 10mg pill has literally changed my life.  I wish I had sought help much sooner in my life.

It took about 5 full days for me to get used to the side effects of this drug but each day got better-less dizzy, less nauseous, less tired, etc.  The only lasting side effect is the loss of appetite.  Food sounds almost disgusting and I cant eat more than a couple bites a day, so Im surprised how many people gained weight on this one.  Ive lost it!  But Im weaker due to not eating.  I did start taking all the appropriate vitamins and suppliments after talking to several women who have been taking the same thing.  I take extra Vit D, fish oil, probiotics and a multi with iron.  I also have not had any alcohol since starting this drug.  So all in all I feel pretty great.  I have not had any panic attacks since starting this drug and I feel pretty mellow.  Im very happy with it.

AFter almost four months I put on 30lbs!  I weaned myslef off for month and a half, and during that time it caused dizziness and headaches.  I recommend for people who are depressed and have no appetite and are underweight, you will gain weight.  Panic attacks stopped, but I also quit my stressful job, so that helped as well.  Won't take any SSRIs again as Paxil put weight on me a few years back as well, I took that for 9 months and had a horrible time weaning off, I was so dizzy I could not work for a month. Now I've been off Lexapro since October 2007 and need to lose 30lbs that doesn't exactly make a person feel better.  Try something else.

It has helped her greatly but has ruined our marriage. She is always tired, she has gained a great deal of weight, and ash has no interest in sex.  But it has helped her bipolar.  So if you have a cring husband (or if you don't car bout your husband) this might be the cure you need.

Previously tried Zoloft but discontinued because of severe migraines and was put on Lexapro. Suicidal thoughts, deeper depression and increased time spent with compulsions. Worst medication of my life. For me, it did not help my depression, OCD or panic attacks, instead, just increased the symptoms.

The medication worked great for me in terms of easing my depression, panic attacks and irritability however it caused me to gain a tremendous amount of weight which began to cause me a great amount of frustration.  My MD added Wellbutrin to the mix which is said to help the food cravings but it did little to help me and I continued to eat uncontrollably and gain weight.   I decided to go off the medication.  At first I attempted to stop using Lexapro cold turkey.  Do not do this, the withdrawal effects are terrible and I had to go back on.  I then began a program of weaning myself off under the supervision of my MD which worked much better.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	3	2	2		25-34	3/16/2008 3:42:00 AM	i was using this drug for about 4 years i started with 10mg then went up to 20. at first it worked great my panic attacks decreased,my mood swings were under control and i felt more control over my life and had a good amount of energy too. 4 years later though is completley opposite. and now i have new problems i cant concentrate as well i zone in and out of conversations. harder to follow through with simple tasks and weight gain. also if i go more then a day without it i get severe headaches to the point of vommiting. and i am so tired on it that about after a hour from taking it i fall asleep. and i notice it keeps me tired all the time. i finally told my doctor that i cant live anymore on this drug. it took away my life in away and my friends and family noticed that as well. i started i new drug this week in conjunctin with the lexapro to help ween me off it. i hope it works. bottem line is if you have mild symptons of deppression and anxiety i would only recomnd taking it for a short period of time otherwise you might be dealing with a whole new set of problems. for people with severe deppresion i would look into something diffrent then a drug thats mostly prescribed for panic attacks.

(My primary care doc says he 'doesn't understand why I'm not losing weight.') On the other hand, I don't cry at all, ever.  (I've been to two funerals for close family members and, while I certainly wanted to cry, I couldn't.) In that regard, I think that the drug has evened out the real &quot;lows&quot; of depression I used to experience, but I also think it has rather flattened my affect.  Parents and friends remark that before I started taking it, I seemed much livelier. I also have practically no sex drive since starting it.  (And I used to be a gal that really liked sex.) In short:Pros: Flat affect (no mood swings) Cons: Weight gain, 'zombie' feeling, low libido
Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	3	Female	13-18	3/12/2008 6:25:03 AM	I originally started on Zoloft and switched to Lexapro just recently. I stopped Lexapro a few days ago because it would make me extremely tired. I ended up wanting to fall asleep every night at about 6:00-7:00. It was highly effective in treating my anxiety, I just couldn't take the exhaustion. I just started Prozac today.

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	5	4	Female	25-34	3/12/2008 1:01:13 AM	Well it was hard to admit I actually needed it.  Began meds and have had tremendous success.  It took some adjusting to the meds but have felt much more like myself.  I still have some anxiety and occasional panic but nothing like it was pre med. side effects are not severe enough to quit the little white pill.

Have been prescribed Anti depressants in the past but was always scared to take them.  Finally had enough and gave Lexapro a try for about 7 wks now.  Started out on 10 mg. at night which for about 2 wks  was waking up feeling severely anxious and was extremely tired during the day but all side effects went away after about 2 and a half weeks. Took xanax .5 as needed to get through the startup period.   After about 6 wks felt like I could   use a little more so I upped my dosage to 15 mg.  I feel like this med is helping a lot.  I still feel but I am much calmer and the anxiety is almost not there.
Lexapro+Oral	Panic Disorder	19-24 Female 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	3/11/2008 12:31:43 AM	I went from crying 2 to 3 times a day over stupid things to not crying and feeling very little emotion since my first dose of lexapro. It sucks not being able to cry, even at appropriate times, but i am definately feeling a lot better that i did before. The only complaint that i have is that i barely have any feeling!

I tried the Lexapro and took it in the morning when I woke up. After about 2 hours I was sooooo tired, and could hardly function at work that day. So then I tried it at night and then suprizingly it made me wired. My doc told me to try a half of a 10 mg tab in the AM to taper onto this med. It worked better but then when I was to try the full 10 mg again it made me extreamly tired again, not to mention the weight gain and wanting to eat everything in sight. I started Zoloft tonight. I hope it works better with less side effects. I hate trying diffrent things to see what works and what doesn't.

Ended up in ER. Severe tremors, nausea, severe hot flashes. Have never taken any anti-dep drugs before. Will never take Lexapro or recommend to anyone. This was horrible.

I was taking 10 mg. If I stayed on it my girl would never have sex with me because it would hurt her too much after a long session. I knew I wouldnt see it working after those few days but I couldnt give up sex. The side effects happened quick. I chose to have anxiety rather than have a hard time ejaculating

I tried wellbutrin first and got very bad hives so I swiched to lexapro.  I take it about 4pm and am so tired by 8pm. I sleep so good now.  Am more sleepy throughout the day as well and have less libido too.  No weight gain,I am feeling great so far and don't want to come off it.

I was so anxious, I couldn't function. It took 4-6 days to get into my system. Some of the side effects I've had are hot flashes (similar to taking Niacin) and low libodo. I am emotionally flat most of the time, and I do get frustrated/angry easier. My patience is much lower than before, but considering the alternative, this is all acceptable. I have gone off this med 2-3 times. By myself, and with medical advice. It was very difficult each time. I had relapses every time. So I plan on taking it for the long run. I hope it will work for you as well.

I am enjoying life again, and I am not having bad thoughts, or feelings of doom, or hopelessness. And not to be funny, but the side effect I have experienced is the difficulty with ejaculation, but ironically, it has worked to my advantage :)I have become a real Superman!!!!

My Nurse Practitioner started me when I was actively suicidal/very depressed and warned me about the slight chance of increased suicidal thoughts. I feel much better and do not have any suicidal thoughts. I'm getting back to myself again and have started actually enjoying life. I have a decreased appetite, which I welcome, and the very tired feelling i had the first couple weeks has passed.

I've been on Lexapro once before and this extreme fatigue caused me to stop taking it.  I've stopped driving, I can not stay awake behind the wheel.  At 24 this can not be better than the way I was feeling before.

I was on 0.5mg The Doc put me on 10mg that worked for a couple of months. I had go on 20mg I did get lazy slept most of the day then up every other hour of the night back to the doc he uped it to 20mg plus a half I didn't even want to get out of my pj's  I thought if they don't make 30mg maybe you shouldn't be taking them. Three months before next appt. so I weaned myself off I had some problems but when I did I thought about the money I was saving. When I go back to the Doc I will get something else or nothing. I was on it 4yrs as I said it was great at first it just didn't last.

I had frequent headaches and dizziness.  The side effects way out did any minor benefits of the drug. Coming off of the drug was even more problematic.  It was horrid.  I was disconnected and dizzy constantly.  I almost passed out on numerous occasions.  I felt sick constantly.  I couldn't focus on anything.  It was horrible.  Even more troubling was having two doctors tell me that they had never heard of such a thing from Lexapro while my pharmacist told me the opposite.  All the research I had done listed all of the symptoms I was having and then some in coming off of the medication. I know two additionall people taking the medication that have had nothing but problems while on it and coming off of it.  I have since switched to a much more effective remedy with no side effects-5-HTP.  I have never felt better and have had absolutely no problems with taking 5-HTP.

It made me feel good for awhile but the weight gain was unbearable.  Weaning off Lexapro was 100% easier to get off for me then was Effexor and Paxil.   The weight gain was terrible but the good news is that the withdrawal process wasn't horrid.

Afterwards my emotions were a little more difficult to control and my dr gave me 6wks of Lexapro samples. Initially I had increased heart rate but by the end of the trial that went away. Very balanced afterwards, do have dry mouth though.I was off my bc for a month and noticed that the Lexapro may have been balancing it out.

At first, it increased my panic attacks.  As they subsided, I lost my libido and have never got it back.  But, I just can't imagine going back to those horrible panic attacks I had before Lexapro.  i wish there was something i could do about the decreased libido as it is seriously affecting my engagement.

I can't remember most of the time I was on it, and I lost about 40 lbs because I just wasn't hungry.  Maybe it was the bad combo of drugs, but I'm actually doing so much better this past year without taking anything at all.  I haven't had an anxiety attack in 8 months.

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female		3/2/2008 6:09:25 PM	I have only been on Lexapro 5 mg for two days, and so far am very happy to report very minor to nothing side effects, compared to my one time Cymbalta intake. I notice I have a little bit of leg achiness, nothing I can't handle.  I take it at night, and it makes me tired, so that works well.  Notice an increase in wanting to eat, but, can't swear that's also not from my stress. Being aware it can put on weight, I'm trying to watch my junk intake. I do notice a little bit of a fuzzy head feeling in the morning, but, I'm assuming it's part of the first two weeks in acclimating to the medicine.  So far, I am happy with it.  Much, much, MUCH better then the side effects of the Cymbalta.  My hope is not to be on this long term, and I will definitely take my time weaning from this med, after reading the many posts.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	25-34	3/1/2008 11:11:19 AM	I have been on this drug for about four-five months. Suicide was not one of the reasons for it. However,  I noticed a considerable increase in ideation. I have not gained any weight.  I sweat like I am in the Bahamas everyday weather it is freezing cold outside or not.  I seem to be more depressed, lazy and have more anxiety than ever before.  I now have changed my doc and will change meds too.  The sexual side effects really bother me, mostly because I can not achieve a full peak.  Sex is not normally a big issue for me but when I want to feel that release and can't that really effects my husband's manhood.  One last thing about this, I truly believe that I have been going through the change of life because of this medication and at 31 I should be at the best part of my life. This medication did not effectively take away my symptoms I believe it made it worse.  Thanks

After that dosage didn't help much, my dosage was increased to 20 mgs.  I did notice it worked at first, but then I started getting worse.  The depression became more severe, so severe I couldn't even bring myself to get out of bed or want to be around anyone and my anxiety turned into frequent panic attacks.This has all happened in the span of a year and I go back to the doctor this week to change medications.  There wasn't many horrible side effects, but I did notice that after never suffering from acne in my 30 years of life, my face was constantly horribly broken out.  I also put on some weight that I couldn't lose, I found that I was angry &amp; mean at some moments for no reason, and my sex drive decreased.Overall, I don't recommend this medication because it didn't work for me, but others may have luck with it.

Since then I have found it has stabilised my depression and anxiety a fair bit, but i still have a fair way to go. I have found I now have terrible acne breakouts and am finding it very difficult to lose weight. I am reluctant to change medication because i know that will take a while, but I can't stand the weight and pimple problems!

I took it right after dinner. Around 4am I had a severe panic attack that woke me from sleep.  All day long I've had a headache, shakiness, loss of appetite, and trouble concentrating.  The Dr doesn't think it's been in me long enough to affect me this way, but I'm not buying it.  I'm not going to take anymore.

Was crying alot, nerves were bad, marriage was having problems. Dr. prescribed lexapro and I could tell a difference after a few weeks. I felt alot better but tired from the meds. I probably needed the rest. Anyway, only bad side effect was I gained about 10-15 pounds in the 2yrs I have been on it (have decreased to 5mg) and loss of libido is big complaint from hubby. But overall I am pleased and feel a whole lot less b****y if you know what I mean.

I'm a nice chick, but I wasn't being nice going through the change. I had anxiety over the littlest thing. But now, I'm so calm and layed back. I've had no side affects like I did with other anti-depressants. Give it a try and get your smile back! :-)

Doc is not changing me yet, just cutting dosage but side effects are getting unbearable, I'm just gonna stop! Is there a time limit on this pill?

Though in regular life I was feeling normal but without any reason I used to have occasional high BP and nervousness especially when visiting my doctor. I used to think much about life and death. I was not enjoying my family life. Finally I was prescribed Lexapro 10mg/day about 6 months ago and for me it worked fantastically so far. I take this medication right after lunch. I have slight weight gain and in the beginning I felt erectile dysfunction for a month or so but by the time I was back to normal except prolonged ejaculation time. Sometimes I hear and read about Lexapro that it is not good for liver and heart which scares me. Is there someone who has such information to share?

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	HoustonHopeful, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/19/2008 11:33:18 PM	Age 45, male.  Brand new to depression.  Spent 8 days in the hospital a few weeks ago due to sudden onset of severe depression.  While hospitalized, I had to work up to 50 mg of Lexapro to stabilize (highest dosage I've seen posted).  I've been in group therapy about 3 weeks now.  After about a week on the medication, I started having some nervous shaking, teeth chattering, and one MAJOR panic attack.  Doctor put me on some Klonopin and that took care of the anxiety effects.  Overall I am doing much better considering I was in the hospital 3 weeks ago and am now at home (though going to group therapy daily on short term disability).  One bad side effect of Lexapro for me (being a male) is sexual dysfunction.  But, from what I read online, that is a &quot;common and known&quot; issue.  To describe the problem in &quot;kind words&quot;... let's just say the bomber can take off and fly the mission, but can't deliver the payload.  I know that may still be too graphic for some, but I tried to be polite about it.  I hope the doctor slowly tapers my dosage back and that issue gradually goes away.  But, for now, I will take it as an acceptable trade-off compared to being hospitalized with depression and feeling there was nothing to live for (though I have a great life going!).  Good luck to all you fellow Lexapro-ers out there.  Hang in there everyone.  Depression is what is bad, WE ARE ALL GOOD PEOPLE.  We will get better in time.  Take care!

The only annoying part is when I have had to increase the dose or when I first start taking it because I experience a dizzy feeling almost like I'm drunk but I'm not. MUCH better than the other drugs I've taken such as Paxil and Prozac.

I didn't like being on a drug that had such scary withdrawal symptoms. The switch to Lexapro was easy. I don't think Lexapro has worked as well for my anxiety and obsessive thoughts. I can be fine for a while and then &quot;boom&quot; have it hit me. Even when I feel good, I still feel the anxiety beneath the surface. I'm up to 30 mg now and I think it's working better, but who knows. I'm thinking of trying something else. But, geez, I'm scared to after reading all these reviews. I'm afraid of a horrible experience. As far as side effects -- no sex drive (none with Paxil either).

The highest dosage my insurance will pay for is 20mg. I started taking 40mg, and told my MD. He put me on 20mg Lexapro and 5 mg of Zyprexa just today. For the time I was taking the 20mg, I didn't feel any different but others saw &quot;big changes.&quot; I gained a total of 40 in about 8 months. I'm NOT happy about that. I felt better on 40mg. But we'll see what happens. It helped me, I would recommend to others.

Talking to supervisors at work, strangers about pretty much anything (ie: bankers, pharmacists, my own MD!) would cause an uneasyness, sometimes a shortness of breath, loss of my train of thought.etc.ANYWAY - the point is that Lexipro is a wonderful thing for some of us, and if your MD recommends it...give it a chance.  I don't feel &quot;different&quot;, I just feel like the me that could not seem to make it out without a little help.

I took one at 10 pm since he said it would make me tired.  By 2 am, i was wide awake, shaking, eyes dialated, vomiting, crapping myself, couldn't sit still, chattering teeth, fever, telling my mom &quot;this isn't good drugs, ER&quot; in between surges of puke in the toilet.  tried to take some pepto but got nothing but pink puke.  after about four hours, i passed out from exhaustion.  if we had health insurance, i would have been in the emergency room.  the doc told me it was an impossible reaction.  and just to spite me, my dad took a lex pill to prove i imagined the whole thing. [he was fine.] they switched me to celexa (a cousin drug) and had nausea and vomiting every day for a month before i boycotted that stuff too.  Behavioral therapy helped me after that, plus being re-diagnosed with PreMentsrual Dysphoric Disorder which the psych docs didn't think to evaluate me for even tho it has coordinating symptoms. now take birth control to alleviate symptoms caused by hormone fluctuations, not serotonin problems like they had thought. i would not recommend lexapro to anyone. i think i almost died.

I think I am going to stop taking it because I have been having severe muscle pain and weakness.  The muscle pain and weakness are worse than my original depression symptoms.  I think I will just deal with it on my own.

I had allot of stress and drama going on in my life all at the same time. Then we decided to move - well.....not so much me! Lexapro worked amazingly for me. It worked best for me if I took it at night - it did make me a little tired. I am very grateful that this medication was available to me &amp; my doctor was finally able to get through to me that it was going to help. It really did help &amp; I was able to function in everyday life again. That alone is PRICELESS! I do not take medication nor do I like to take medication - this was a blessing!

Have lived in constant state of alert for 40 years.  Edgy and very short-fused.  My wife and kids love the calm and relaxed me.  I can now overcome irrational fears or concerns with ease.  I can now see what people mean by &quot;don't sweat the small stuff&quot;.  Blood pressure is down over 20 points - both systolic and diastolic.  No impact on sex drive but climax is tougher.  Wife is happy with this, also.  Had dizziness and nausea for the first week.  Was tired, also.  Now, I sleep well, and can enjoy life and my family.  I hope you have similar results.

I took Lexapro for symptoms that were related to anger, lack of interest, depression related. I have taken a variety of different depression meds over the last 10 years but had stopped about 2 years ago as I felt that i had plateaued. I was given this med by my OBGYN. Started on 10mg, after about 3 weeks increased to 20. At first I felt an immediate response at 10mg, however I still felt very sad, so I asked for an increase in dosage. Again, almost instantly the med incease kicked in and although the depression was pretty much gone, so was everything else. such as, any energy, I was sleeping much to much, I was happy not to be so angry or sad, but well aware that I felt lethargic and very bla. At 8 weeks I saw my obgyn and explained my concerns and symptoms, it was agreed that having no energy, flat-line personality, and a weight gain of almost 10-15lbs was not worth this particular med. The weight gain flipped me out as I was already over my limit, having no energy kept me from wanting to get off the couch, having a &quot;who cares&quot; attitude didn't help either. My very big concern is on the flip side of all of the negatives is that I was very calm and mellow, making me a very easy person to be around, my family reacted to this part of the treatment with me so well. I am disapointed that I am not able to continue this med for that reason. My Dr. suggested that I take the med when I feel an episode of overwhelming sadness or anger related to my periods - mostly what took me to this in the first place...  I felt that there was no happy medium with Lexapro. I am off it completely now, I am clear headed, have not felt as depressed and have started to walk every day and work back into a healthy full excercise and diet regimine again, I am also being very mindful of my inner thoughts and moods more so that I can not be as reactive towards my family.  Lexapro was weight gain, sleepy, no interest in anything, inc sex.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	bjr28, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	19-24	2/10/2008 7:55:34 PM	I was prescribed Lexapro for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and depression.  Initially I was prescribed 10mg, then 20mg, and finally, 30mg.  I was on 30mg for almost a year, but I noticed no change in my anxiety/depression.  Despite the very high dose, it just didn't seem to work.  Perhaps that was because I didn't have much anxiety in the first place, or perhaps I wasn't that depressed, but nevertheless, it just did not work for me.  Getting off of it was easy; I would advise (to be on the safe side) decreasing the dosage by 5mg at a time (for maybe a week or two), then repeat until you hit 0.  Although I am not a psychiatrist, I have heard (anecdotally) that Zoloft is a superior anti-depressant/anxiolytic.  Zoloft also works for OCD, I believe.  I would talk to your physician (and do some research) before starting on Lexapro...you may find that Zoloft is superior for your symptoms.

This med didn't work well for either at 10mg, but has worked well at 20 and then more so at 30mg. I had some side effects such as nausea,sleepiness and slight headache. Now at 3 mos. I have no side efects including weight gain, but continue to have some inability to sleep soundly. I t has been a Godsend but it took about 7-8 weeks and increased dosage to get the good feelings I have now.

Worked ok , but I lost my sex drive and I also couldn't orgasm anymore. So I got off of it and I was doing ok until stressful situations came up and I seemed to go back into depression but a much harder one, I got so bad that I had suicidal thoughts and am now back on lexapro , 10mg for now, it's the second day and I feel better. Not crying everyday and stress doesn't hurt so bad. But I don't like that my sex drive is totally gone. Not sure about weight gain as of yet, so I will be watching out for that.

It made me feel numb, unable to cry....also it killed my once healthy sex drive and put 15 pounds on my small build despite diet and exercise.  Between the no libido and pudgy body, I felt more depressed that before I started it....so, Last week I quit...hooray!

My family Dr. prescribed Lexipro, first at 10mg, not much of a change, the 15mg not much of a change, now I am at 20mg with little change (except for the shaky hands and lack of sex drive), and he says I can't take a higher dose without going to a new doctor. This does not make things hopeful for me.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Ellen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	2/7/2008 11:19:32 AM	I began taking Lexapro  9 weeks ago after being diagnosed with depression , anxiety and Obsessive thoughts. It didn,t help much at 10mg but at 20 and then 30 mg. it has worked wonders. I still have a little trouble with insomnia. Great help at 30 mg.

I had little sex drive before the medication, so my doctor and I didnt think it would affect it, but it did.  Then my family told me about the possibility of a heart attack or stroke.  I stopped taking it.

I would say it has helped for depression, also has killed the sex drive almost completely,,, I also take wellbutrin 300mg with 20 mg lexapro and a blood pressure medicine... I still don't think they're great, but don't stop taking them,,, bewarebeware don't quit the lexapro without having a plan with a doctor,,, it is really bad.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Mac, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	5	5	5	Male	45-54	2/6/2008 9:15:32 PM	I wasn't sure this med was working for me so I went off it to see what, if anything, would be different. Well, I would not suggest anyone else try this, I did not do well without it. I am about to lose my job due to a buyout and this was the time I decided to try this experiment. I not only freaked out, I also had designs on taking my own life. I started taking the drug again and behold, I no longer have that problem and seem to be dealing better with the job situation as well. Seems to work very well for me...

It is very hard to get of of also. My brain feels fried. Every time I told the Dr it wasn't working he increased the dosage. This did NOT work, it made my stress worse. I would not recommend taking this for anxiety.

Lexapro+Oral	Other	jek, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	55-64	2/2/2008 9:56:49 AM	Due to a death in the family and having suffered a previous heart attack, I thought it prudent to see me Doctor to get some medication to calm my nerves.  Along with a prescription for Xanax, he gave me some sample packets of Lexapro to be taken once daily.  On the second day I began to experience moderate muscle pain and night sweats (no fever) ..   3 days was enough and I stopped taking.   Took two more days for my system to get back to normal.   In talking with other people about this, it seems that doctors now are pushing these antidepressant meds off on patients with anxiety problems (for whatever reason) and equating it with depression, giving you free samples of  powerful antidepressants from your friendly pharmaceutical company.   I feel like a guinea pig rather than a patient.Rest assured my doctor is going to get an earful when I see him next.My advice is to be very careful when taking these antidepressant meds.  They results are not always positive and they are powerful.  Be careful and use common sense about how you are feeling.  It is your health, and your body, and it seems pushing drugs for the pharmaceutical industry is getting more mainstream in patient treatment.

I would end up going off of it because of money and insurance reasons, (go quite nuts without it), go back on it and after a month feel so much better.  Even my children and husband call them my &quot;happy pills&quot; because they saw me without them and I just felt like I couldn't deal with life like a normal person.  Personally they have been a true life saver for me.

I had some blurry vision and some clenching of my teeth.  Nothing was so uncomfortable I thought of stopping it.  Within 4 days I was feeling better, I was sleeping at night, not crying at the drop of a hat, and my moods were more even.  4 weeks later I am so very much improved.  I don't hate to be around everyone, I feel calm and the anxiety attacks have lessened so much.  I do worry about the increase in my PVC's I have all the time, but the Doc and the Pharmacist do not think it is the Lexapro.I used Paxil for a short time in the past and it worked very well except I was so very very sleepy all the time.  Lexapro helps me sleep, it is a miracle...

I would startle,stress and shake n'stress. Total panic! Worse-people could visually see.Since college my mood swings went nuts. I have seen many doctors.  It was PMS,PMDD, PERI MENOPAUSE,MENAPAUSE &amp; NUTS! I started my period at 9-thought I was dying from a toilet seat germ! Well enough this year I went to the doctor at the pleas of my family. One mood swing too many and a thrown glass too many-two pets dying slow deaths three homes in two years,a military wife,daughter graduating and going from high school to college,proms,driving her everywher and teaching her to drive, knee surgery and septic infection from glass on a lake---------New home with sewage line break times three and broken custom tub flooding den and frying computer!  And dealing with it all???????? PRICELESS!  These are all stress ?  There is tons more but enough.  Lexapro has numned my anxiety and myself at times. I have vivid nightmares, significant memory loss moments, no appetite to ravenous appetite episodes,dizziness,sleepiness,sex suppression -----. However my overall mood is vastly improved. I can handle whatever comes next------I hope.  Cymbalta was the worst for me and Paxil did nothing.Xanax was temporary.  Lexapro  so far a mind saver.

I started Zoloft and had taken that for about a year and it made it even worse, than after seeing my doctor i was put on Cymbalta, but because my mom didnt feel comfortable having me on that i was put on Lexapro. I have been taking 5mg daily and its done nothing. I cant sleep, i just lay awake at night like i have all my life. The only medicine that helped me was Cymbalta. Taking Lexapro has not helped at all with my anxiety, and people are starting to notice me regressing, and so am I.

I had signs of derpression after losing one parent and another parent had a stroke.  Taking lexapro was a huge sign of relief.  I am not a pill taker and I don't want to become dependant on pills for life.  However, I have only had positive effects from Lexapro.  I no longer suffer from terrible angry/irritable mood swings. I do have trouble staying asleep at night and I yawn often.  I hope to see more benefits from taking this medicine the longer I'm on it.  I would like to get back to my regular workout routine.  Which I still have a lot of trouble doing.  No longer have a desire to run or lift weights.  Which I've done for over 20 years.  I'll continue to take this medicine for a few more months.

After 3 months I got a job and was really quite happy for the first time in 10 years.  I am sure if I took Lexapro exactly as prescribed I would have stopped drinking and experienced a constant level of well being, but I am still doing ok after about 9 months.  I have decided on my own to stop dringing alcohol.

Lexapro+Oral	Other	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/24/2008 2:35:01 PM	Prescribed primarily to combat stress-related anger issues (to take the 'edge off').  For this, it has worked quite well for me.  Stressfull situations no longer cause any 'panic/anger' response.  Taken 3 years (I divide 20mg tablets to 10mg to save money - same price - double the pills).  No sexual side-effects noticed (not like under CELEXA which I previously took for 1 year).  Some weight gain noticed, but it coincides with me getting older, so it is hard to tell if it Lexapro or not).

It left me with a carefree feeling which coming from having an anxiety disorder made me like i was not in control of my thoughts.

Works great except.....gradual weight gain and absolutely no sex drive whatsoever which my husband doesn't appreciate.  I am weaning off Lexapro because the weight gain has given me panic and anxiety.  My doc has now prescribed Wellbutrin XL and hope that will even out my moodiness, improve my sex drive and reduce the pounds.

It has helped tremendously with anxiety, depression and ocd. When I first started taking it, I experienced nausea the next morning. I found that taking the drug with food helps a lot. The nausea only lasted about 2 weeks.My naturepathic doctor is also treating me for the same symptoms, so the natural supplements I have been taking are probably helping a lot also. I am much calmer and I have fewer obsessive thoughts.

I suffer from mild depression and anxiety.  When I first started taking it, I had severe nausea, however after about two weeks, it went away.  I do have to say, I do not have a sex drive whatsoever.  Doesn't make my husband too happy, but we deal with it.  I am a much happier person since taking Lexapro.

I still have a few now and then but not nearly as bad as I once was. I have almost no sex drive. I have a dry mouth most of the time but I drink tons of water. I also have gained some weight. But as long as I don't have to deal with the panic attacks I am ok. Haven't taken anything that did anything different.

I should of done some investigating.  I told my doctor I wasn't sleeping well and was somewhat unhappy with what happened to me time after having 2 kids close together.  It is called life....I should of listened to my instinct and waited to get more me time than letting my dr. put me on meds.  I specifically said I didn't want to gain weight and I enjoyed my sex life and didn't want any interference.  Unfortunately, I let him talk me into it and continued with it til now.  I have since gained at least 20 lbs. and have a harder time orgasming. The weight gain has not helped my self confidence either.  I started weening myself off the meds slowly and will try to deal with the side effects - dizziness, nausea, memory issues both on and getting off meds.  I have since been able to join a gym which my kids also enjoy going to.  That is how I used to be - very active.  I just had to be patient until my kids were a little older to allow more time for me.  Again, I should of listened to my instinct, not cover up everyday issues of a new mom with medication.  Some people need extra help with all kinds of issues.  I just think my doctor was quick with prescribing without understanding my background.  Too quick to line the pockets of drug companies.  There are way too many people on meds that might really not need it.  I am not discounting some real mental issues that need meds.  I used to work with a psychiatrist and do believe many do need meds.  I just would recommend investigating the meds and getting a couple of opinions if possible.  I just cannot wait to get off this med.  Good luck to those of you on it.

Helped greatly, no longer any attacks.  Feel better, gained some weight, no sex drive.  Hate panic attacks, so willing to trade some weight gain for the attacks.  Starting to taper, on 15mg for 1 week, now have headaches, not sure if related.

I still have some axiety on lexapro, but not as much as when I wasn't on anything.  However, when I was on paxil I went up 2 dress sizes.  So far on Lexapro, I'm pretty much the same size.  Gained just a little weight.  With lexapro I have absolutely no sex drive.  I want to go off of it because of that.  I'm afraid to go off because I'm think I'll have the same experience as I had going off paxil.  I felt dizzy, couldn't stand up, couldn't drive, etc.  I would love to go on something else, but I'm afraid they all have the same side effects as the paxil and lexapro.

I'm 16 and I have been on this medicine for a few months to treat my social anxiety and depression. The medicine helps a lot with depression and it has improved my depression by about 80%! However, this medicine barely helped with my anxiety. It helps specifically with being happier, more optimistic, and more calm in nervous situations. But overall, it has only improved my anxiety only by about 25%. The side effects are definitely noticeable too. I experienced trouble sleeping, weird dreams (especially nightmares), and low energy. I also had alittle nausea the first time I took it and yawn a lot. Please try to make sure you eat something when you take it, I think it helps. I think overall that I am going to discontinue my use, because the side effects are so great and it didn't help much w/ anxiety, which was the main reason I started taking it. But I still think if you are considering taking it, you should give it a try- results vary so it may work better for you then it did for me. I think you should definitely try it if your problem is depression, because I think it works best for depression- but most people have side effects so you should know although it alleviates depression symptoms, it will probably give you new ones from the side effects. I hope my review helps all of you! =)

I also noticed immediately after starting these that I yawn ALL day and my short term memory is non existent.  Scary side effects in all.....but it really has been helping with the depression.

The only trouble is that I feel like I'm on speed.  My heart beats too fast, I'm dizzy, I get waves of nausea throughout the day and my appetite is almost gone.  I am experiencing almost every side effect of this stuff.  I am probably going to try to get something different from my doctor.

I was started on lexapro to get me over the hump and it work amazingly.  Despite how amazing this drug is at treating symptoms, it also comes with a lot of baggage.  When I first started the medicine, I was manic for about 2 weeks, not sleeping, singing all the time, pacing  .. etc.  After all that goodness wore off, I had no sexual appetite and when I did couldn't finish.  After I self dc'd the med (as a sexual relationship is very important), I even tapered off (I know better then to just stop) I was so dizzy I couldn't stand, sit, drive do anything!!!  I was miserable for about a month.  Although this drug worked wonders for me (temporarily), I've had to move onto other things to control my anxiety as I could not deal with all the side effects!  There are other meds out there, don't give up the hope!  Best wishes!

Doesn't work as good for the anxiety as Effexor XR did, so an anti anxiety med was needed in addition.  Took almost 2 months to get the full effect and the side effects were minimal. Just have a hard time focusing while driving. Overall its been a decent drug.

I felt like I could go up to any one and talk to them...and when I was around obviously mentally ill people...(homeless schizophernic people)  I felt like my mind would go where thier mind was...to a scary place, and felt unsafe...so I would avoid places like Venice Beach, where there are a lot of &quot;strange&quot; characters.  I finally had to get off it....and the withdrawal symptoms are horrible....I have lost several jobs from being overally emotional and not able to get up and function.  I highly recommend having your doctor direct you in getting off the meds.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		3	3	2			1/19/2008 8:31:01 AM	My doctor prescribed it for stress which had given me a wild case of dermatitis all over my body. I know that it takes awhile for your body to adjust to a new med but this stuff makes me jittery, unrestful sleep, and my head feels like it weighs 50 lbs. Also despite an interest in sex, and feeling like I want to have sex, I'm unable to climax. So I'm wondering is this going to be worth it? I'm also very concerned about the difficulty in the weaning process, what I've been reading sounds pretty horrible. I think I'll start cutting my pills and stop the madness before I get in any deeper, after all everyone has stress in their life that they have to deal with, right?

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/19/2008 12:14:49 AM	i am 23 years old and I have been on Lexapro for over a year, with little to no sex drive. (Thank God for patient and understanding fiances)I definately feel a difference in my moods when I skip a dose. Everyone can tell the difference as well. Some days it doesn't  matter if I take it or not. I have crazy dreams all of the time, lots of nightmares. I've gained about 20 - 30lbs. (My cholesterol shot up so Im fighting the effects of the Lexapro to make me gain weight to try and lose it for the sake of my heart) Anyway, I definately think the Lexapro has benefited my mental and social well-being, my sexual and physical however, have suffered. It's definately a give and take relationship with this drug

I started tapering off from 20 mg to 10 to 5 and now to 2.5 (the pill can't break any smaller!!) to get off the pill and I'm having vertigo so bad I cannot even drive a car...  This is the worst part in my opinion...

I knew within 24 hours that Lexapro was the medication for me. It takes the &quot;edge off&quot; and helps me cope with whatever life deals me.  I have had no side affects at all.  A few of my friends have started taking Lexapro with  great results.

My only problem with is that I'm nauseated a lot, and I frequently have to deal with dry mouth. Also, been having some anorgasmia, which I hope will subside soon. Other than that, I feel like it's made a significant difference in returning me to my old self.

Trust me they all stop working sooner or later for those of us who need to always be on meds.  I have been taking Lexapro for about a year now in combination with three other drugs.  I has helped me tremendously up till now by giving me energy.  Yes energy.  I take Cymbalta, Seroquel, Triliptal and Lexapro.  I did have some side affects in the beginning but went away in weeks. My shrink has upped the dose once so far.  I believe I need it changed again and checked on here to find out what size of a dose people usually take and how well it works for them.  Hmm my suggestion to anyone reading this is to make sure you go to a shrink and not just a family doctor if you suffer from anything other than just a bout of situational depression.  These drugs all work so different on each of us.  I am an &quot;older&quot; person who lives alone and gee at times I wish it did slow down my sex drive but suppose I am fortunate that I have never experienced that with this or any of the other.  It is also the most expensive of all the drugs I take but so far it has been worth it.  I had terrible withdrawl symptoms from my Paxil but I do everything under my doctors advisement.  Never, never do I play with my meds.

Has been one reason I just had a 14th wedding anniversary, instead of a divorce. It also helps me control my mouth and keep a job. Now my new insurance company has put it on a non-preferred list and I don't know what to use. This was the first one I've ever used.

I mostly just experience odd sleeping patterns (I have trouble sleeping at night, but I feel sleepy all day), with lots and lots of yawning, and the occasional case of the shakes. Overall, it's the best option I've found.

I'm sweating profusely, headaches are out of control, no memory, no coordination. But I'm really happy. Overall, no, the harmful side effects are forcing me to switch to another drug.

It does not help with the anxiety but got rid of my depression.  Results where almost immediate. Side effects I have are weird dreams and night sweat. The only sexual side effect was it is harder to climax, no loss in drive.Good for depression-No help for anxiety.

Some will use their effectiveness over time. This drug worked immediately with my panic attacks. It is slowly helping with my depression. I am sleeping more soundly at night, however, I am sleeping too much at times. I can sleep 10-12 hours a day with this medication. Unfortunately I still need to live. I hope this need to sleep will wear off in time.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	1/7/2008 3:07:05 AM	I have been taking paxil for about 5 years. Decided to give lexapro a try because it listed less side effects. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I couldn't sleep, my anxiety/panic attacks became more frequent, I became irritable, grouchy, nervous and on edge all the time. My appetite became non existent, I was staying so very sick to my stomach and could not eat. I also developed horrible heartburn that would not go away. I was dizzy and off balance. My doctor switched me back to paxil and ALL of these side effects have subsided. My attacks are now almost non existent, my nerves have calmed down, the heart burn is gone, I can eat and sleep very well now. I would suggest that anyone who is considering the use of this medication to be very careful.

I woke frequently at night also.  Med worked well for depression for several years, then seemed taper off.  I switch to Wellbutrin XR after Lexapro's effectiveness faded and I was able to lose the weight I had put on and I have so much more energy and can stay awake past 9 pm.  Overall I feel better off the Lexapro.

Lexapro+Oral	Bipolar Depression	SuJun, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1		45-54	1/5/2008 4:44:03 PM	Can I say this was less than ineffective?  I was on this drug for 11 days.  I have NEVER ever been this dizzy in all my life! Laying down, moving, sitting, turning my head; I was always dizzy!  My appetite was completely nonexistent, and I am thin.  I could only eat a few bites then I was full.  I suffered from hyperventilation and ultimately hypomania.  I have never had a good experience with an antidepressant and  Lexapro only confirmed their toxicity to my physical health.  Since I have stopped Lexapro I no longer hyperventilate, I do not suffer from hypomania, I can eat, and I am not dizzy.  Taking Lexapro was a horrible experience.

I can't believe how well it works. It does make me somewhat depressed, but I can tolerate being slightly depressed if my anxiety is relieved.  I have not gained any weight. It does interfere with my sleep.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/4/2008 5:03:56 PM	I have suffered with depression most of my life and have been resistant to taking any drugs. Lexapro changed my life. I feel like a weight was lifted off my shoulders and that I am finally seeing the world in color. No sexual side effects at all. I was taking it in the morning and feeling drowsy, but just switched to night time and I get some of the best sleep I've ever had. I yawn a bit more than usual, but considering how it's made me feel that is no big deal. It has also completely eliminated my PMDD, I never know when my period is coming unless I check the calendar!
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	1/4/2008 12:11:30 AM	This is the first antidepressent I've ever taken. I was prescribed it for anxiety and mild depression. I have been taking Lexapro for seven weeks and still have symtoms of both. I am constantly hungry and have gained 5 pounds in the past month despite exercising regularly. I also have no sex drive whatsoever.

For years I couldn't do normal 'college activities'... go to bars, parties, or anywhere that I may have had an anxiety attack. I've also been dependant on kolonopin and xanax for as long as I can remember. However, when I'm taking Lexapro I feel normal, no anxiety, no stress, no mood swings. Only the stable, happy, positive me--all of the time. I do however have no sex drive and I sometimes feel like the always constant mood is slightly zombie-esque...but for me these pills have given me a new lease on life and the side effects are little and manageable. I highly recommend this drug!

However I was nauseous at times so I always had to take it on a full stomach.  Then the cold weather set in and I would break out in hives all over my legs and arms whenever I got cold.  It was horrible!   Then my face started to break out in a rash.  I stopped taking the pills and the hives stopped once it was out of my system.  However the rash still remains.

I'm someone who has recently stopped being a VERY heavy drinker, and this has helped to stabilize my mood swings without heavy side-effects. I'd say this is a perfect 1-2-3 combination with Trazadone and Valium for alcoholics who have recently quit drinking and are SERIOUS about keeping liqour out of their life. However, if you continue to drink, any of these three medicines will be very dangerous.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/2/2008 4:37:01 PM	This drug has been very effective. It has made it possible for me to get though the day doing normal activies like working and going to school. However, after a few weeks of not taking the pill in the past I found the withdrawl symptoms to be very sevear. And at my current dose of 40mg a day, I am starting to face new side effects that might be a result of taking this drug. Basicly mild visual and auditory hallucinations along with vivid, and strange dreams. At lower doeses, the typical 10mg or 20mg, this was not an issue. This is by far the best antidepressent I have ever taken and it has less side effects than most.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	1/2/2008 4:24:05 AM	This medicine was very easy to use but it did nothing to improve my depression.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	dudeboy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	1/1/2008 3:11:33 PM	This medicine has helped me come out of the depression I seemed to have been in for decades. I was never treated for it until four months ago, when I went to an alcohol rehab. It has been amazing, I have my old optomistic self back, not the pessimist I had become. The only drawback is my libido. Almost impossible to come, and hard-ons don't last like they ought to. At least I don't have to worry about satisfying anyone else at this stage of my life. But, I can't even have fun masturbating anymore.

My only negative side effect was the sexual kind. Total interest loss of sex and trouble having a orgasm. I think it is a good mellow drug, but as with any chemistry altering drugs..do your research and talk to your doctor.

I've been on tht for about 2 months now. I love lexapro except for I have terrible night sweats. No problem with sex drive and it works great for me so I figure it's worth it because I have taken zoloft and that took away my sex drive and wellbutrin gave me bad mood swings.

I call these my happy pills. I have been on them for about 8 months and although I still think about how severe my condition is going to get, this drug makes me not want to act on the situation. A big downside to this drug is it makes you forget everything. So far this drug is working for me.

When I decided to stop taking it I began slowly weaning off as directed by my doctor and am now 9 days into being lexapro free.  I am having severe headaches, stomach issues, restlessness, anxiety and dizziness.  While I was satisfied for a while on this medication, I suggest to anyone considering it to make sure they do ALOT of research before hand on how hard it is to get off or never plan to quit it.  I hav enever felt so terrible and helpless to control my body in my life.  This withdrawal period has made me hate this drug and I will never put it in my body again.

Overall, its symptoms were easier to deal with than the others I'd experienced. I would sometimes get sick to my stomach after taking it, other times I would get very agitated and aggressive. Other than that, it was effective and easy to use. The best I've had so far.

I'm currently on the 20 mg dosage. Lexapro has made changes in me that I didn't even notice I needed change in. My b/f has seen significant changes in my mood, what we argue about, my social life, memory and focus. It's been my gold in a bottle.

That made me very reluctant to try them. I have been in therapy for months,suffering from major depression and anxiety, was hospitalized for suicidal ideation, and still didn't want to take the drugs.  But I have three children who need me, and it reached the point I would try anything.  Thank Goddess I did. After a matter of days, I feel like I have my life back.  I can think, I can feel, I can simply be happy!Lexapro hasn't made my problems go away; it has returned me to a state of mind where I can deal with them.  Very slight stomach upset the first night.  Some people have more severe reactions.  But I must say, don't be afraid of trying these types of medication. They can make the difference of a lifetime!

Upon realizing that I was taking Serzone, the new doctor said, &quot;We have to get you off the serzone.&quot; He started weaning me off gradually. Then prescribed Lexapro. After taking it for about 4 years, I still thank God daily for the Lexapro. Before Lexapro, I laid in bed with no will to live or sat in my recliner doing nothing. I had no interest in anything. About 3 or 4 months after starting Lexapro, my usually unobservant son-in-law remarked that I seemed to be a different person from when he was worried about me at Thanksgiving. I now have gotten on with living doing volunteer work with the elderly in nursing homes, having grandchildren over regularly with big celebrations on holidays with as many as 22 in my home. I highly recommend Lexapro. I never want to be without it.

It slowed it from 150 down to 79. However, I had a spell that appeared to be a heart problem and the er doctor, after he saw I was on lexapro refused to do the heart test my doctor had ordered and put me on a valium drip, saying all I had was an anxiety attack.  He sent me home with a pulse of 120, which I had for 3 days.  I went to a heart doctor who said the attack did not sound like anxiety to him.  He found I've had an electrical problem with my heart all of my life that causes my periodic rapid heartbeat and probably caused the attack that sent me to the er. I've stopped the lexapro and now am undergoing mild depression symptoms which are getting better each day. Prior to being on the lexapro I had no anxiety attacks, but while on it I had several of what appeared to be anxiety attacks and had to take valium to help the sypmtoms.  I also had a huge increase in migraine headaches and migraine auras.  My family doctor told me the new problems were imaginary, but they have improved since I stopped the lexapro.

I was crying all the time, had no energy for everyday things, getting angry at the stupidest things and all I wanted to do was sleep. I am on my second week of this drug. I started feeling more like myself within 5 days. The crying went away and so did the anger and my energy started coming back. The only side effect I noticed was a &quot;medicine head&quot; feeling throughout the day and some diarrhea that has since gone away. I have not noticed a change in my libido. I am thankful to be on this medication and getting back to myself again!

And I have to admit that it helps me with my depression symptoms. For some people like me who was born with chemical disbalance and suffered from depression and anxiety since childhood it is a really powerfull drug. I see everything differently now than I used when I was depressed. But....there are some side effects that I connect with the drug. I always feel very tired and I can sleep up to 15 hours a day, which is not really helping my relationship with my boyfriend and my lifestyle. I still have some anxiety epizodes and experience a shortness of breath. Occasionaly I take Atarax for my panic attacks... But considering what this med has done for me these things are pretty minor.

I slept about 20 hours straight about once a week or I slept 14 hours every night. This also occured when my dose was moved up from 20 mL to 40mL.I was, before it, a self harmer. Probably once every other day, about a month after I was able to stop completely though this doesn't always happen. It sometimes made my head spin a little and I was often dizzy, though that is possibly just me. The other thing is I had severe withdrawal reactions. To be honest i felt like i had an axe in my head. My best advice with that is don't drive, don't take any of your thoughts seriously, and likely if you call a pharmacy they will give you two if you can't get through the weekend (i discovered this and it was a lifesaver). Most people apparently do not have this problem. It also works very very well along with concerta. It is a very good drug for what it does just doesn't match up with my body chemistry.  I suggest it and if you can't afford it's price Celexa works as well it just is missing an anti-anxiety affect.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/20/2007 2:24:34 PM	I've only been taking this medication for a little more than a month but I have noticed a difference in my mental clarity, my mood, and just overall feeling of well being. I was hesitant to take a medication thinking that I shouldn't be depressed because things in life weren't so bad. However, I feel much more like myself than I have in some time. I'm resting better at night and feel more awake and engaged during the day. My only complaint with the Lexapro was the regular bouts of diarrhea I experienced. Were it not for this side effect, I would consider it a complete blessing.

The depression is better, but the side effects have been worse.  I've developed sleep myoclonis (involuntary muscle twitches all over the body both day and night), for which I'm now having to take Requip to counteract.  I've also remained very fatigued -- at least as badly as before treatment, if not more so -- and have not have the energy to resume the exercise I used to enjoy before the depression hit.

I have more control of myself and my emotions. I felt better in a few day.  I had been on zoloft years ago and gain alot of weight and didn't want to take that again.  I'm very pleased with the results so far.

I was feeling overwhelmed and sad all the time. Little things started to get to me. I had lost both parents within 8 months and was pregnant. I felt better after the second day. The only side effect is a sexual one, but I'd rather have my sanity then an orgasm.

Withdrawl symptoms were extremely severe, dizziness, emotionally unstable, headaches, etc. Was the worse time of my life getting off of it. Beware and use a taper schedule to stop taking the drug, don't go cold turkey.

The side effects are so minimal, I have a ringing in my ears at night and in the morning and then it subsides during the day.  My anxiety keeps trying to get through the Lexapro .10 and I get a little disoriented but focus on something else.  I must say, I have been feeling a little depressed from taking this and I have never had depression, but out of nowhere three months ago, I started getting severe anxiety out of nowhere.  My mind also started scrambeling and having horrible thoughts, became little twisted, not sure what the heck happened, but the lexapro did calm the mind.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Wendy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	12/16/2007 6:23:52 PM	I had a very stressful demanding job that nothing else helped, but Lexapro. The sweating wasn't as bad as w/ effexor. Once I changed jobs it took me about 3 mths to wean myself completely off of it. I had slight balance and nausea issues and feeling as though I was dropping in a elevator at random events. My responsiblities have changed again and the stress has returned along w/ the old symptoms of being angry and edgy all the time. It is symtomatic of the position as my coworkers are all under the same stress and half of them are flipping out! The rest are burnt out... I can't flee or fight the changes as I need to keep my position and as the company is paying for it I will finish my education. I will be speaking w/ my Doctor next week to get put on a 10 mg dose as the stress level will be managable w/ this increment. If I take the 20s I will be a flatliner again and I need to retain my personality...

I spoke with my doctor about numerous &quot;drugs&quot; that would help and Lexapro seemed to be right for me. I exp. insomnia and sweating for the first two and a half weeks and it took me 6 weeks to notice that I wasn't always screaming at everyone when I got stressed out.. ALOT... It has worked for me quite well, only it did take my body some time to accept it..

Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety		5	4	4			12/14/2007 11:53:22 AM	It is better to ease into taking the drug, half a pill for 3 days, then continue with full dose.  do the same when getting off the drug, start breaking your dosage in half for a few days before you stop completely.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	12/14/2007 6:36:11 AM	I have been on Lexapro for 2 months now. I feel tired but my energy is better if that makes any sense and do not cry 24-7 anymore.  My libido is decling but my appetite is HUGE on this drug and I gained 7 pounds already! Does it make anyone else very hungry?? Overall it is helping me through some rough times and I am going to stick with it for now.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/13/2007 8:14:52 AM	This is the one month mark for me.  I have been updating weekly.  This week, my side effects are gone.  I am not as tired.  I noticed that if I get a full eight hours sleep I am not tired.  I also work two jobs and that may have contributed to the tiredness.  My mood has been great.  I can deal with life better, without stressing out or freaking out.  I have not gained any weight.  I forgot to take it once but took it late (8 hours).  Had the shakes but after about an hour or two, I was fine.  This medicine works for me I enjoy living without feeling so stressed out.  I will try to stay on this medication.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/11/2007 4:32:27 PM	I experienced side effects for the first 2 days-uncontrollable yawning, periodic nausea and feeling like my knees may buckle under me.  By the 3rd day, the side effects were gone and I was feeling great.  My depression has lifted, I haven't had any outbursts of anger and my moods are not constantly shifting anymore.  I also suffer from OCD and it has also helped in that respect as well, though that is not the reason for my starting on the medicine.  The only negative has been that I suffer from irritable bowel syndrome and it has brought back (at least I assume it is the medicine) some of the abdominal pain.

When my father was undergoing chemo for leukemia and my mother hospitalized with congestive heart failure, diabetes and other ailments, I was overwhelmed.  I started with a 10 mg dose of lexapro and after a year it was increased to 20 mg.  It has really &quot;taken the edge off&quot; all the stress I am feeling.  It is a wonderful drug for me.

Also, be sure that no other family members have had problems with this drug before starting it.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Akiko, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	12/7/2007 10:59:47 PM	I couldn't achieve an orgasm with this medication.  I was ALWAYS tired, sometimes on the weekend, it would take me forever just to get out of bed. I was always yawning, I would take little nap breaks at work and I would never do that! Even though I had 8-10 hours of sleep, I always felt that wasn't good enough.    I was also bitchy...  It did nothing for my depression. For my social anxiety disorder, that helped, in that sense I felt more confident in talking to people but if you got on my bad side, then oh well... you know the rest, lol  I was also hostile to my therapist and accused her of not supporting me!  I told my doc who was doing med management for me what was happening to me and he says, okay we'll put you on Wellbutrin.  Mind you, before I was taking Lexapro, I was taking Paxil CR (now that was a totally different story).  With Wellbutrin, I can get up from my bed, clean the house and actually function as a normal human.  I find myself looking at life a little different. I'm currently on the 150 mg and later will be on the 350 (I think but too lazy to look at the bottle in the bathroom, lol)..  I will write later and let you know how the higher dosage works compared to the 150 - but see the Wellbutrin reviews.  It does make me thirsty, so thats a good thing, I also have my libido back as well as my earth shattering orgasm, yippee!  Depression is gone, I am always smiling and my eyes look alert.  Bottom line, Lexapro did jack for me. If you like sleeping, looking tired, sweat alot, bitchy and hostile, the inability not to have an orgasm, have a low libido, I say go for Lexapro.  If not, have your doc put you on Wellbutrin.

I finally tried Lexipro after my younger sister told me that she had been taking it for years. I am so glad I did. It have had wonderful results and it even keeps my panic attacks at bay most of the time. At first I did have some sexual side effects like not being able to climax but now I can. I does take longer but it is not bad enough where I would think about going off the drug for now.

It has really mellowed me out. I don't feel medicated or &quot;wierd&quot; like my doctor said I might feel. I do sleep a little worse, but overall I feel SO much better!!!

However, like the others, it does also require me to take Ambien to sleep through the night, which I hate, but I will continue to do since it has eliminated my panic attacks.
Lexapro+Oral	Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	12/4/2007 1:58:04 PM	No sex drive or energy.  Body temperature changed, went from always warm to freezing cold.  Anxiety still here. I guess I would rather deal with my anxiety than feel weak and cold. I also don't wan't to be pushed into depression by weight gain.
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	25-34	12/4/2007 1:31:40 PM	Week three, I noticed that I am so tired I can't even function properly.  I slept until 6pm on Sunday and went back to sleep at 8pm.  Maybe it is too much or maybe I should change all together.  I have still feel depressed, yet I feel that I can talk without freaking out.  Have no energy at all.  I noticed that I have stomach pains more often and almost lost control of my bowels (how embarrassing)  I think it helped calm me down a little.  Still blurred/double vision.  Last week I thought this was good for me but after another week of still feeling worthless I am starting to think that I was wrong.  Also, I am very shaky at times a bit like nervousness for no reason at all maybe that is what they call tremors.  My hands and feet get swollen like retaining water to the point I can't take off my wedding ring in the morning.  After talking with my doctor at the end of the month I will update again.  Thanks

It has helped me greatly. I still have my occasional &quot;Moments&quot; but overall, I feel much happier.

I am very pleased with the Lexapo and all I can say is that I am looking for it going generic, it is pricy, but worth it!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	45-54	12/1/2007 7:10:19 PM	This medication helped me feel better initially.  It did decrease my libido and after a few weeks, I felt it no longer helped.  No one told me that stopping the medication &quot;cold turkey&quot; would cause dizzyness.  I ended up going back on it and then weaning myself off slowly, over a perioed of several weeks.

I have not really seen any changes, my Dr. uped the script to 20 mg instead of 10 mg 3 weeks ago and I feel so sad and depressed for no reason along with fits of anger. I don't know what is wrong with me, I have a wonderful life, husband and 3 beautiful children.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	11/29/2007 3:53:11 PM	First update, this is week two of the medication, still take it at night before bed.  I have really adjusted to the medication well.  I don't feel too many side effects but I am still tired all the time.  Sometimes I have bouts of double/blurred vision but that is ok with me as long as I'm not depressed I am feeling better than before.  I think this medication was a perfect match for me so far. I did notice bloating but have not gained any weight yet.  I weigh myself daily to monitor any sudden gain. I will update again.

Then 1 month ago depression and anxiety kicked back in for 2 weeks. Saw doctor and she upped my dosage to 20 mg. I feel a lot better. Helps to take meds and see therapist. Still have low days, but not as low as before. Still have slight anxiety when in large crowds, but pulling myself to the side and calming down helps. No thoughts of suicide. Good days greatly out weight bad days.

All I could think about was eating! I was about 135 lbs at beginging and 5 months later was up to about almost 160. Not good. I also had a hard time sleeping and horrible dreams when I did sleep. For the most part I was happier and more rational in day to day activities. Oh and I had NO sex drive. :( My Dr switched me to Cymbalta. So far so good. Not thinking about food 24-7. But worried about the withdrawl side-effects when my Dr and I decide that I don't need it.

When I first began taking it, I had major depression with suicidal thoughts.  I've been on Lexapro for about five years now, and it has really helped.  I have only experienced mild side effects, as well. (Like nightmares, if a dose is skipped.) It also works very well against the anxiety associated with my disorder.Overall in my experience, it is very effective and comes along with a very low rate of side effects.

Lexapro helped relieve my anxiety and still allow me to feel like I wanted to have sex. I also didn't suffer from the feeling of just walking through the motions of life. I actually participated. Too bad my insurance company doesn't cover the Rx.

Normally optimistic, after suffering a bout of insomnia - he became withdrawn and zombie-like. He hid despairing thoughts, and wrote a suicide note 5 days after taking this drug. Three weeks later he killed himself at the age of 58. He had everything to live for and was the last personality type who would commit suicide. This drug can be a killer for certain individuals, especially if they are do not fall into a typical depressed category. His doctor gave him samples &quot;to help him sleep&quot;. DO NOT LET ANYONE YOU KNOW TAKE THIS DRUG WITHOUT THE CLOSE ATTENTION OF A PSYCHIATRIST. OFTEN PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY MEN, WILL LIE OR HIDE SUICIDAL IMPULSES EVEN WHEN ASKED DIRECTLY (AS I DID). I watched my husband for any signs of suicidal ideation, and there were none. He hid it all. I disliked the zombie quality he was exhitibiting, but I knew that the medicine claims to need weeks to begin to work. THE FACT IS THIS MEDICINE CAN TAKE ONLY 3-5 DAYS TO TURN THE BRAIN CHEMISTRY AROUND TO SUICIDE....My advice: Don't let anyone you know take this drug - there are so many other antidepressants out there with less risk. Lexapro is being pushed as &quot;safe&quot; but hundreds of people have committed suicide out of the blue on it. History will record Lexapro as being one of the worst offenders in pandering this drug as safe, when it is clearly not. Sample packages are still being given out casually all over the country. BEWARE THIS DRUG.

Lexapro 15 mg per day. (Previously on Celexa.) Lexapro has lost a lot of efficacy with time. Weight gain, despite claims this is not an issue. Effectiveness as an anti-anxiety agent variable (I also take Xanax). Muscle pain has become a problem. Diminished libido from the start. Some blunting of affect. A big advantage for me, though, is that I am sensitive to meds, and Lexapro is one of the best-tolerated of the SSRIs. I'm hopeful that supplementation with another med, and/or tweaking the dose, will restore the beneficial effects for me.

Not sure why, but it didn't seem to help much. Over time as I built a tolerance to the Lexapro, my doctor had to put me on Klonopin for panic attacks/anxiety disorder. Maybe others have had better results than I have or maybe I have just been on it too long.

Overall, it has been effective, but I think my body has become immune to it and it's time to change. I definitely recommend taking this one, however, and see how it works for you. I haven't had any of those horrible side effects I have heard about from others on other anti-depressants. The first week it took a bit getting used to, but nothing major and after that it was smooth sailing.

I take it at night cause I have a tendency to sleep when depressed.  The first night I had weird dreams. I cried all night. The second day, I took off work because I was still a hot mess.  But, on the third day I started to feel a little better.  I still don't have my depression under control but it seems to be working with it. The only problem is I still sleep as much as I can.  That is one thing I would like to rid of.  I have not noticed any weigh gain, however, I am hungry all the time so the weight gain will be next.

Wanted to take PM naps with higher dose.  Dimished sex drive and reduced the physical enjoymnet of intercourse

The scariest thing of all was that I knew I shouldn't be overreacting the way I was about inconsequential little things, but I felt like I had lost control of myself and my emotions.  I began lashing out physically and hit rock bottom one night and punched a hole in the wall.  That's when I went to see my doctor and told her about the symptoms I had been having.  She diagnosed me with depression and prescribed Lexapro.  It's really worked well for me.  My family no longer has to walk on eggshells around me, fearing that I'm going to either explode or break down at any moment.  I haven't had any side effects and I've been able to live my life normally!

Zoloft was not helping me personnally @ all. Then I was diagnosed with Bi/polar disorder not as extrem as some.My new Dr. Had been trying to get me to try Lexapro change is not something I like, however after not being able to handle the panic attaks and being sick and tired of them I was willing to give it a try, it has all but stopped them, I take 40 mgs everyday, and am ready to drop down to 20 mgs per day. I have still had some set backs with the Bi/polar area but being aware and and educated has had some benifits.I cannot do it all @ once but I am trying. If you suffer from panic attacks please give this a try and @ least 30 to 45 days of medication, you will be happy you did, and you wont have to suffer for as long as I let myself(seven and a half years is to long to be stupid and not take chances) Glad I did in Tn.

I have improved so much since I started taking Lexapro that I now can go in to stores without anxiety. I can go to church without fear of the noise level being too much for me. I went to the periodontist and he scaled my teeth below my gums and I was relaxed and handled it very well. I am a much calmer individual and happier. Irritability is down 90%.

In the past I tried Paxil and Prozac and did terrible on both. Lexapro basically saved my life. I do remember when I started the medicine I would have extremely vivid dreams at night that didn't make sense and it took a few months for that to subside. One downside of the medicine is that I gained a TREMENDOUS amount of weight; I'm only 5'1&quot;, used to always weigh around 115/118 lbs, and I ballooned up 144 lbs. The drug manufacturer doesn't state weight gain as a side effect, but everyone I know who has been on the medicine has stated the same thing. I religiously watched my diet and couldn't lose the weight; this is actually the reason I went off the medicine. I am in a much better place, both emotionally and mentally, than I was before starting Lexapro, but I found the weight gain to be something that made me more depressed and miserable.

I didn't feel depressed but I didn't feel happy.  I didn't have any rapid heartbeat problems or antyhing.  It didn't aleviate any pain.  For the first five months I craved alcohol something fierce.  Then suddenly didn't.  My doctors switched me to cymbalta for pain control.

It is a life saver.  As long as everything in my life is going fine I'm great.  I still can't handle emergencies and I still have some paranoia about having heart problems, cancer, etc. I'm afraid to go to the doctors because I'm afraid they will find something. Went from 10 mg to 20 mg and have gained weight.  But I'm much better than I was.  Depression and anxiety runs in my family.

If you're stressed out, work out.  Don't let anxiety take over you!  You can change the way you think and the way you feel.  Change your situation.  It might take a couple of days before you feel &quot;excellent&quot; but believe me you will.  Talk yourself out of getting excited.  You have to say &quot;I feel fine&quot; and you will realize you do feel fine!  Pray to GOD and ask him to help you to think positive and pray about whatever is stressing you out and GOD will take that stress off of your shoulders and heal you but you have to believe.  Don't just say the words, but believe in him.  Have faith! Everything will work out, you don't have to take the medacine forever.  And when you do ween off, there is a tea not from safeway, but from a chinese shop (look it up online too) where you can go and these teas are for healing not for pleasure.  Working out has truly changed me physically and mentally.  If you don't have time to go to the gym theres so many things you can do from home, just stay encouraged and stress free.  peace and love.

This was from one pill! I didn't sleep at all last night, I had to turn off all the lights and tv so I would overstimulate my eyes, and the diarrhea was still occuring up until a couple hours ago. The doctor suggests I half the dose, but I don't know if its worth going through this nightmare again. If you are sensative to medication I would say be careful about your dosage!

I took Lexapro for a couple of years to deal with depression from a stressful job/condescending boss.  It did work, but when I stopped taking it I started getting brain jolts, zaps in my mouth, dizziness, vertigo type feeling when I would move my eyeballs, spinning when I would move my eyeballs, and I also had headaches.  It is very hard to explain the symptoms, but you know it when you are dealing with it.  I was absolutely miserable.  I didn't know what it was from and ended up at many doctor's offices thinking I had a brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, you name it.  They gave me an MRI of my brain, lots of tests, you name it.  Finally I did some of my own research on the internet and found that there a LOTS of other people that were going through the same thing.  I just had to type in the right thing in google and there it was.  There were so many people with the same problem, not only from Lexapro but other anti-depressants as well.  You would think doctors would know!These horrible things finally went away after about 6 months of torture.  I don't wish what I went through upon anybody.  I guess if you are never planning on getting off the meds then you are ok, but if it's just a temporary thing then I would recondisder.  The withdrawl symptoms are just too much.  I was also suicidal during the withdrawl.  It is out of my system now and I am clean of anything and feel much better.  If only one person reads this and listens to me it will be worth it to save them from something like this.

Switched from Paxil thinking Lexapro was safer since I want to get pregnant. I also experienced an adverse reactive and became noticably more depressed with more anxiety.

I have been off them now for many years until just recently when a family crisis brought me to go back on them.I've been on Lexapro for 5 weeks now and when I first started, I was really tired, could barely work, alot of yawning, jaw clinching, NEVER a problem with sex for me. Haven't seen the weight gain yet. I did notice though at about 5 weeks, on the way to work I felt very bad as if something horrible was going to happen to me. I don't know if I was trying to fight off a panic attack but I finally felt better late afternoon but it was the worst feeling in the world. Like my life was ending right before my eyes and there was nothing I could do to stop it. My girlfriend told me to call my doctor and tell him about it. Never did because the feeling subsided. The problem with me is that I get to feeling better and I get tired of the possible weight gain and ween myself off them. I'm staying on this one for now, seems to be working but is there an antidepressent out there that won't put the weight on?

It is very easy to start and stop taking. Full effect for me generally takes a week to ten days. The side effects lessen after 3 weeks or so. I have had no ill effects upon coming off the drug in the spring. I have taken it for 4 winters now w/ no problems.

I started the Lexapro, again, and it was gone.This combination works great for me...And now that Wellbutrin comes in a once a day dose, and the Lexapro is also once a day, it's very convenient, to take, first thing in the morning, and I'm done! Some others I've tried in the past, had to be taken more often, and sometimes I would miss a dose... and that's scary!So... I give Lexapro a 5-Star rating on all of the criteria above.^..^

Took about 6 weeks on 20mg to get relief, but still get occasional panic attack, but not obsessing about things as much.  As with all treatments, be patient for the drug to work and be sure to seek a therapist/psych-not your regular Dr.  And if the current therapist/psych does not seem to &quot;fit&quot;, move on to another until you get the right one.  Again be patient and persistent.  Decreased libido, but worth it.  No weight gain.  Some lethargy.  Increased sweating.  Found out that increasing intensity of exercise helps with the anxiety.  Also helps with my minor OCD of excessive cleaning and organizing... now things are messy, but I can live with it. :-)

Lexapro is the first antidepressant (others:elavil, norpramin, prozac, wellbutrin) which has effectively suppressed my anxiety.  I have not felt much, what I might call, joy.  But I have not been deeply depressed for over 3 1/2 months.  I've never gone more than 4 months without sinking into a dark tunnel.  The next month will be crititical, and I hope that I can follow up on these remarks.

Side effects = weight gain and sexual side effects (which ebbs and flows).  I have found diet and exercise helpful with the weight gain.  I say it is very much worth it.  One caveat: once you start, they will recommend you stay on it if it's working, indefinitely. I have taken it for almost 4 years and have no plans to stop.

Now I realize how hard it is to come off any ani-anxiety drug. I constantly feel like I am going to faint and I am nauseous.

Lexapro+Oral	Depression	Melodious, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	4	1	Female	35-44	10/27/2007 1:59:29 AM	I was on this drug for about 6 weeks and noticed a very positive change in my mood as well as less panic attacks with anxiety.  However, right about the six week mark, I woke one morning to swelling in my hands and feet three times the normal size.  I could not fit into my shoes.  Also, my limbs ached terribly like I have never experienced before.  My feet hurt to walk on our hardwood floor, I could not hold a cup of coffee because my fingers ached so badly and I was bedridden for about 3 days because it was too painful to move.  Bloodwork from my doctor revealed a very rare side effect from this drug.  I was terribly disappointed since I really felt this was working for me.  My doctor has given me samples of Effexor to try instead so hopefully this will work.

The only thing that I have had with it is the fact that since I have been on it I rarely show any emotion.  I hardly ever cry no matter what the situation is and that has even included the death of my husband of 27 years.

I was on paxil for several years and felt it wasn't helping with anything.  I took myself off (slowly).  I eventually reverted to an emotional, hot flashing, anxiety riden nut.  Lexapro took (10mg) effect almost immediately.  I am much calmer, few hot flashes and much much much less anxious.  I am so grateful for this peace of mind.

I normally just have high anxiety.  The depression lasted for 2 weeks, I felt I had no purpose.  I changed my medicine to cymbalta.  I don't know if my body just adjusted to it and the lexapro wasn't working like it should have.  I have been on cymbalta for 2 months now.  I have more side effects then I did on lexapro.

It caused me to have a flat affect as noticed by a friend who didn't know I was taking anything.  Also, I had an incredible weight gain of 30 pounds in about 6 months. I experienced a lack of sex drive and also the inability to have an orgasm.  My husband was away for eight months and I wasn't interested in having sex at all.  Everything returned to normal after I stopped taking it. Lastly, coming off of this drug was shear hell.  I was so sick even though I was reducing extremely slowly.  I experienced what felt like electric shocks in my brain quite frequently.  All I wanted to do was sleep because when I slept, I didn't feel anything.  It was horrible.  I vowed never to take anything again, but recently I was convinced by another doctor to try Wellbutrin.  So far so good.

Doctors will tell you that you can come off of this med whenever you want, but they don't tell you about the hell of withdrawal effects that you'll have to suffer through in order to do so. I have been off of it for a month now and I'm going through exhausting &quot;electrical shock-like&quot; episodes almost nonstop. It's like being crually tortured! Along with the shocks, I have headaches, anxiety, and &quot;brain farts&quot;. If you just want to go on something short term to get through whatever you're going through, I don't recommend this drug. It works very well and I had very few side effects, but plan on staying on it unless you want to see how tuff you really are! If you are a woman and think you might want to get pregnant within the next couple of years, think twice about going on this med or any other like it...doctors recommend coming off of them before conceiving. Look at all of your options, weigh out the good and the bad of each option before making a decision. Just do your research before going on any medication because the doctors won't tell you about how hard it is to come off of them. Good luck!
Lexapro+Oral	Depression	ChubbyCherubp, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	10/26/2007 12:35:55 AM	I feel it has helped me and I have been on it for over 2 years almost.  I had been on many other anti-depressants and this is the one that has helped my depression the most.  I am on 30 mg as of just a few days ago.  I was on 20 mg.  I have had no side effects with the medication.  And they are easy to take and do what they are supposed to do.  I was put on them originally by a Psychiatrist and also recommended by my own personl Physician (Internist) who I have 100% trust and faith in.  I can't say the same for the Psyhiatrist as he only saw me for 5 minute intervals and I was out the door.  My own personal Internist can do the same prescribing and spends a lot more time with me.  I will soon be seeing a new Psychiatrist as my Doctor feels I may need a mood stabilizer.  So I don't know with that being thrown into the mix (depending on what the Psychiatrist puts me on) how it will mix with the Lexapro.  My Doctor feels I may be Bi-polar and need a certain medication like Lithium.  But that is up to the Psychiatrist.  When I was on Cymbalta 30 mg I was fine but when the original Psychiatrist prescribed the 60 mg I broke out in hives and a rash all over my body.  My lower lip swelled up and my face some.  I was in agony with that rash off and on for months.  So anyone on Cymbalta beware as this is what happened to me.  I never had one bad side effect from Lexapro.  I know a lot of others on it and they haven't either.  Lexapro is my anti-depressant choice.  And believe me I have been on at least 10 different ones.  Thank you.  Diane L.

I still have bouts of depression, but nothing like before and completely managable. I also, know it does not cause ED in men like many anti-depressants do. I give Lexapro a huge thumbs up, and coming from an all natural girl that says a lot!

I find that 20mg is the dose-not the 10mg; @ least for me. The cognitive therapy (CBT) helps-teaches me what to listen to inside my head, and what is part of the depressive thinking and to disregard. Just popping these pills is the start. CBT, exercise, sun light and no depressants (i.e. alcohol, marijuana, opiates and benzodiazepines) all are part of regaining control of your thinking.

I was not diagnosed with bipolor at the time. I now understand that I need to be on a good mood stabilizer to benefit from a SSRI. I had, however, switched to taking solely Zoloft about a year later. I did not experience the massive weight gain like I did with Lexapro. It took me months to lose all that weight.

I didn't realize how uptight I was til my husbands DR suggested I take it along with him. My husband stopped taking it due to it's sexual side effects.  I just stopped taking it due to less stress and the fact that I have gained 20 lbs in the last 5 months.  Going to see if stopping the lexapro helps me shed those pounds. If not I will definitely go back on it. Not sure if weight gain is a side effect or not.

After prompting from my family, I finally told my Dr. about my symptoms (irritability, insomnia, tension).  He prescribed Lexapro and after a week I noticed a HUGE difference.  If I had known that I would feel this good, I would have done this years ago.  It has changed my outlook, my way of thinking (I no longer worry things to death), my sleeping habits (I am able to fall asleep and stay asleep).  I highly recommend that if you are suffering from any anxiety related symptoms talk to your doctor and don't wait.

At first it was 10 mg then it had to be raised to 20mg.  That has worked really well until recently.  It is to the point that it is no longer working and there are difinate side affects when trying to get off of it.

I had the weidest sensation that I could not explain until I search the web &amp; found other patient's describing withdrawalsas &quot;BRAIN SHIVERS&quot; - that is exactly how it felt &amp; it went on for weeks after I weaned myself off. NEVER will take this one again!

During that week I was very on edge and perspired a lot. After the week I felt normal and had no more panic attacks. One side effect I have noticed after long term use, is a diminished libido.

The drug helped with my depression but I felt that I could not always think straight.  I experienced weight gain, a decreased sex drive, and major hot flashes on this medication.  I decided to discontinue it and have been experiencing some withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness throughout the day, increased agitation, and others.  Overall, I am glad to be off of the drug.  I had mild depression and now with some lifestyle changes, I feel I can manage without the medication.  For me, the side effects were not worth it.

I have been on it for 9 months and can honestly say it has been the best thing to happen to me ever. I use to cry all the time even at commercials and now I have better demeanor and even have a better outlook on life. I would definitely recommend this drug for helping with anxiety and depression.

It has helped a lot with my depression and my anxiety. I can certainly tell if I forget to take it. I do not like being so dependent on the drug though. If I dont take it every day, I have horrible side effects. I get dizzy, extremely irritable, and nausiated. I haven't experienced any weight change since I've been taking the drug, I just have horrible hot flashes and dry mouth. Overall, the medication has helped my anxiety and although the side effects suck, I can't imagine not taking Lexapro

It worked pretty well for my anxiety and depression, but there were too many negative side effects. I lost interest in sex, gained weight, and got frequent headaches. I had to wean off of it when I found out I was pregnant and weaning caused me nausea, headaches, tiredness, dizziness, depression, and mood swings. Also, when I started the medicine I did not feel like myself for the first few weeks. I felt drugged up and out of it.

Instantly I was experiencing severe weight loss due to a decreased appetite. I dropped to 90 lbs. My doctor stated this was normal but that the dose needed to be increased. So I took 20 mg. I still had no appetite, My body felt weightless when I walked and I experienced severe dizziness. I told my doctor and she did nothing, so I stop seeing her and stopped the medication. To me, that was certainly NOT normal!

It did.  Lexapro has been a terrific help for my feelings of depression and social anxiety.  I would have never believed it would give me the confidence to climb out of the black hole I often found myself.  The side effects are real - but they did subside for me.  The most frustrating side effect that I've had to accept is that it takes longer (sometimes frustratingly longer) to climax sexually.  Certainly I could see the beneficial aspects Lexapro would have on someone experiencing premature ejaculation issues.
