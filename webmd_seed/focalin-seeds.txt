I also seem to be very sensitive to the &quot;ups and downs&quot; effect common with the use of extended release medicines. However, the best response I have is right after my morning dose; once that wears off, I pretty much fight a losing battle all day with the return of inattentiveness, distraction, and fatigue as the lower-end dosing 'xr' begins to fizzle out. My Dr. told me to wait for a while longer to see if things even out.

newuser.reviews.create(comments: "I am 39 years old and was recently diagnosed with Adult ADD.  After trying Stratera for a few days, my doctor changed me to Focalin 5 mg twice daily.  The Stratera did not work for me, made me very drowsey, wicked cotton mouth, upset stomach and the ever onmious &quot;sexual side effects&quot;  but alarmingly it gave me very gruesome nightmares.  I've never had that happen before, so the doctor changed me to Focalin after only 4 days.Wow what a lifesaver.  I'm currently in school fulltime because of a career change.  With the ADD I was unable to work and go to school at the same time, to the point where my parents offered to support me while in school.  The ADD was just too much for me to do both.  After only a few weeks, I can say that this drug has saved me.  Finally I can concentrate fully and not get distracted.  This has allowed me to start working again while in school, so I am extremely happy.As for side effects, I've been pretty happy with the dose I'm on.  The only real side effect for me is loss of weight, which at my age isn't something I'm going to complain about too much! lol  I do have to remind myself to eat, and it's a weird sensation to go a whole day without eating and not be hungry.  It's amazing in that respect.  Other than that I have no complaints.One last comment is regarding sleep problems.  I have suffered through many many sleepness nights because of the ADD.  It is not unusual for me to be up until 3 or 4 am everynight because I couldn't quiet my mind enough.  I take this drug twice daily, six hours apart.  In a roundabout way, Focalin has relieved the sleep problems, because by the end of the day I seem pretty well spent.  I workout 3 times weekly and I seem to have more energy now due to the Focalin.  The workouts and the Focalin ensure that I am dead tired by 10 pm.  This is a fast acting drug and I feel it within 5 minutes of taking it on an empty stomach.  It doesn't make me feel ramped up, I do have a lot of energy when taking it.",effectiveness: 4, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 5, created_at: '2008-04-23 04:13:19', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-22256-Focalin+Oral.aspx?drugid=22256&drugname=Focalin+Oral&pageIndex=24&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

I do all of those anyway but it's like I have to force myself.  I work full time and go to college full time. I do feel that it is helping a little.  I don't feel like I'm all amped up or anything. More like, clearer. The only side effects are very very mild.  Feeling not very hungry.  Which is fine by me, because I also take Welbutrin XL 300mg and Seroquel 400mg which made me gain like 30lbs in the last six months.  I'm still eating well. Just not allllll the time like before. I also noticed a sort of heavy feeling in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.  Not sure what that is about.  I'll be sure to ask my Dr about it though.  It usually only happens if I take it on an empty stomach.  But other than that I can't tell I'm taking it.  I was scared starting ADD medication because I hear alot of terrible things about being zombie like, mean, moody.. and so on.  So I'm going to stick with it and see how it plays out until my next appointment in a month.",effectiveness: 4, ease_of_use: 5, satisfactory: 4, created_at: '2009-01-06 011:12:14', review_url: 'http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-22256-Focalin+Oral.aspx?drugid=22256&drugname=Focalin+Oral&pageIndex=19&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1', drug_id:newdrug.id)

Special Education, good diet and exercise, and A LOT of homework help at home helped, but she still required a lot of redirection and one-on-one time at school from her teachers.  We finally agreed with her doctor to try a medication.  We tried Concerta and it was terrible.  Too strong for her!  She was tearful and suffered insomnia and nightmares.  We asked the doctor what else we could try.  He prescribed the lowest dose of Focalin... 10mg.  It worked!!!  The difference in her behavior was like night and day and it didn't affect her sweet personality at all.  I didn't tell her teachers so I could really see if they noticed a difference, and they immediately saw a change in her school performance.  She was less impulsive, she stayed on task, and she actually finished assignments!  At home she was able to do more things like getting dressed on her own, cleaning her room, doing most her own homework without me prompting her every five minutes.  We found that giving her half a pill in the morning and half at lunch (the school helps us with that) worked best for her (it seems to last 5 hours).   After school homework time was a challenge since the Rx had worn off, but her Dr. prescribed a 2mg dose as needed for these days, and it works really well.  She is still able to sleep by 8PM.  She still has a good appetite too (which worried me).  It is available in generic form so it's easily affordable. The only problem with this Rx is that it isn't long-acting so you need to give a booster dose mid day.  But we haven't found this to be difficult for now.  I hope this helps someone out there!
