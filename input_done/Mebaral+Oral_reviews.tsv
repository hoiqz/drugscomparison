Epileptic Seizure	katahtude, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/6/2012 8:06:30 PM	I have been taking this since 1980 with NO side effects and the seizures are controlled. Mebaral is the ONLY drug to control my difficult seizures, I tried so many other drugs with no help. I may die due to Lundbeck Pharmaceuticals discontinuing the drug. I am terrified. My friends who are in the Stock Market are dumping this company and companies dealing with them. They blocked Generic with clever statements and now this, not a reliable company. The medication was a gift of life for me, hopefully a good company will somehow obtain it and do something good, with a nice medication like this.

I am working with my neurologist and he has recommended either Keppra, Vimpat or Lamictal. Can you provide input on these??

Epileptic Seizure	thecommish2k, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	3/28/2011 4:35:24 PM	 I was allergic to Phenobarital alone and dilantin alone, so they gave me a &quot; cocktail of Dilantin, Mebaral, and Mysoline and I have been seizure free for over 52 years.I turned 65 this year and Medicare refuses to pay for the drug and the cost is not counted toward the doughnut- hole. I must therefore pay $400.00 for a two month supply. My husband's Union cancelled my Prescription coverage when I turned 65, and they don't pay for most of meds as they are either Statins like Lipitor or nexium. I receive a very small Social Sdecurity check and have been denied coverage as I own my home.

The other problem is that the company who manufactures it has a program to assist people with the cost and they also don't cover Mebaral. I have been on this medicine for 40 years and 40 years seizure free and am very upset. Maybe as a group we need to do something to change the status of this drug so it will be covered under insurance plans. We need this medicine for our seizures and yes it can be addictive but the alternative is something I do not want to experience again.
