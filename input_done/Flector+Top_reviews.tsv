I have these headaches with it that are migraine like.  It lasts all day-and is making me irritable and feeling horrible.  I also get a tightness in my chest that makes it feel like someone is giving me a &quot;bear hug&quot;.  I also feel as if I have &quot;withdrawel&quot; symptoms-but I am not trying to break away from any meds/alcohol.  These side effects start happening about 2 hrs after applying the patch.

Does have some side effects.First being a lot less pain.Second being the runs... oh well,nothing is perfect.  Also may be what causes those really bad headaches I get at night.

Found that the patches have worked really well for me. I am however really dissapointed with the cash pay price. Prescription for 60 patches is $425 here in Florida. But, how do you put a price on pain relief that is non-narcotic? Narcotic pain meds only lead to more pain meds and more pain. Take it from one who has been there and has recovered from 5 years of dependance. Flector patches have helped me get off those kind of meds. If King Pharmicuticals and the other company that distributes these patches is reading this, you would sell much more of the patches if you would lower the price and get the FDA approval for use on the conditions that most doctors are prescribing them for!

After 15 days I am covered in itchy hives and have been given an inhaler to help stop the constant coughing I have developed. Now trying Singular to get rid of the hives. With the added stress of this, pain is now worse then before and I itch like crazy. Everyday I wake up to see what part of my body has the hives now, hope it ends soon, it's been 5 days so far and yes I quit the patch when this started.

For the past several years I've had significant constant pain in my spine just below the shoulder blades. The pain managment doctor prescribed these patches to help alleviate the pain. Unfortunately, they have no effect on my pain so I still hurt like heck. The only think that seems to work for me is highest allowable dose of slow release morphine sulfate 3 x day, and the highest allowable dose of percocet 3 x a day along with ice. For me, these patches are a complete waste of time and money and royal pain to put on my back. As my back hurts, the contortions necessary to put this on my back are unbelievable and then the patch does not stick well so I'm constantly having to press it back down. I'd recommend saving your money and the annoyance and do NOT accept a prescription for the patches.

First off, it looks like a LOT of people are in the same boat as I am- my insurance didn't cover them and a 15-day supply (30 patches) cost almost $200!!!!Secondly, they only work for minor sprains and aches, which is not what I have and my dr. is well aware.  My dr. is a pain management dr. and he and I talked about Lidoderm patches and How I had used them in the past with good results...and that I was sketchy about these patches because of their interactions with coumadin (blood thinner) and possible GI bleeding. Doesn't matter, I guess.I get 'em anyways, and now, I have no Dr. because I know the pain management Dr. wants to try everything under the sun before entitling me to what works.  I can't afford 2 monthly RX's @ over $350 just so he can &quot;step me up&quot; slowly.  But I digress.  I still keep some of these patches around for muscle aches, they seem to work OK.  Only thing about (all) patches- they just don't hang well with me and my back :)

It has to be pre approved for just minor strains, sprains and bruising. Per the FDA approval use. I had a script for bursitis of hip (coincendently after I had disclocated my shoulder that must be why they paid for it the first time)  but it did not work  on the bursitis of the hip as well as the lidoderm patch.However, in desperation one night I applied the Flector patch to my shoulders AC joint arthitis pain. I have had several injections in my AC joint and now the only recommendation is for surgery. It actually works wonders for that pain. I have been able to avoid surgery by using them when I have a flare up. My pain management doctor prescribed them for that pain the next time I saw him. As I said earlier, now the insurance BC/BS refuses to pay for them not FDA approved for arthitis. Why isn't Flector patches approved for arthitis use. It is a God send to me. Thank goodness I had enough left over for a while. It is a shame that insurance compainies make you jump through hoops like this.  This medication works wonders for AC joint arthitis.

NSAIDs work but i can not take them due to edema and gastritis. wearing ice 24/7 was becoming impractical. getting cortisone injections every 6 months was not something i wanted to do. so, i came up with the idea to try the flector patch over the SI. i wear one 24/7, change it every 12 hours. it took a few days for my SI inflammation and pain and looseness to go away, but since then its essentially gone, except when i go without it to see if i really need it. within a few hours, it is clear that the flector patch is necessary. and i've had absolutely no side effects from it in the 6 months i've been on it, no gastritis, no edema, no skin irritation. it does take a day or so to take full effect, but if you keep using it and leave it on and change it every 12 hours, its miraculous in its effectiveness. i have an overall inflammatory arthritis as well, but the SI joint was the main thing that made living impossible. now its no longer a problem. i also sometimes have really bad flares in my rhomboid area of my upper back. that is also disabling. when it hits, i can not sleep, can not sit, and the pain causes the physical symptoms of a panic attack: gastritis and pounding heart. in desperation, i cut my flector patch in half, put half over my SI joint and put the other half over the left rhomboid area. it took a few hours, but what a difference! last year, i was out of work for 6 months while trying to heal the injury. this time i think i might actually be able to nip it in the bud before it snowballs out of control thanks to the flector patch. and if i pat it on well, and wear clothing over it, it does stick just fine. though taping is always another option.the flector patch has changed my life for the better! i was looking at disability. now i can live my life. i also use a topical triple nsaid KIP gel for other occasional spots like the neck.

Other	drsean, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	2	3	Male	35-44	2/7/2010 12:34:45 PM	As a pain management physician I was excited when this patch first became available, especially with the problems with the Cox II's and potential side effects of all other anti-inflamatories.My experience with this medication has been somewhat dissapointing and perhaps that is because many of my patients have a tendency to compare expectations of their meds with those of narcotic analgesics. (Some even believe they are being given Fentanyl patches I believe).Overall, proper expectations of this med as well as utilization techniques, coupled with the apparent lower degree of side effects based upon the cutaneous delivery method, make this med a good option for some.My advice is first to apply the patch according to directions.Next, I advise additional use of a good skin adhesive tape, as the patches simply do not adhere well to many persons and/or body regions.Finally, I would advise to patience in order to allow the drug to work. A, &quot;One patch trial&quot;, simply does not allow time for an adequate responce. The anti-inflamatory process takes time and by giving the patches adequate time, some patients are pleasantly surprised by their benefit.So, in summary, I believe the Flector Patch to be a product that can indeed be helpful for some. Do not expect a narcotic like responce. Apply the patches as directed. Utilize addition skin adhesive tape. Change the patches evey 12 hours and properly dispose of them. Make sure to reseal the patches and do not use expired patches. Finally, be patient. Perform supplemental exercises (Ask you doctor, chiropractor or physical therapist if appropriate and what exercises to do). Limited exacerbating activities and you may find the patches to be helpful.

Then I tried it for fibromyalgia pain, especially in the neck and shoulder area when I've overdone the computer, and I've been very impressed.

I am an intermediate metabolizer for drugs using CYP2C9 pathways.  Diclofenac uses the CYP2C9 pathway, so I started with just half a patch.  It was very effective for reducing pain, however it made me very sleepy.  After using the patch intermittently for a week, I experienced an ophthalmic migraine.  I have since discontinued the use of the patch.

I can actually walk better &amp; sleep at night.  I have finally found an interim medicine that actually helps the pain!!

I have undergone diagnostic studies over the past two years and have been place on Percocet for multilevel degenerative disc disease in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. The Percocet does not control the pain as much as I would like. I found the Flector patches reduce the pain entirely along with the Percocet. I only use at night on my left hip for twelve hours. I have not had any side effects and the patch stays in place as long as i keep it on the flat surface.

They're figuring it out, but in the mean time I couldn't get the pain under control, and I didn't want to take hardcore prescriptions that make me nauseous and high.For days I could hardly move. Less than an hour after I put on the patch, I could walk a block. It still hurts, but it's absolutely nothing compared to before. This is a miracle.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	2/7/2009 2:12:55 PM	I have undiagnosed lower back pain (3 years).  I am on my way tapering down on Fentanyl patches, but because of this I have add'l pain.  The Flector patch seems to work well.  My Doc told me to cut it in half, apply to pain site for 12 hours, and remove.  I do this each morning, and try to make it through the night without it.  It has been effective in reducing my pain.

I immediately started having digestive issues upon useage, and it did not slacken the pain at all. I have acid reflux, so this product should never have been prescribed.... Doctors need more training, more consulting b4 just throwing scripts at us.

Recommend using tape to help it attach--I use fabric &quot;Cover-Roll stretch tape&quot; from my PT--made by &quot;Beirsdorf&quot; 10ydsx2&quot; for ~$20.

It was effective in relieving my pain for the most part but caused cardiovascular problems which caused me to discontinue the Flector patch.  I am currently unable to work due to the side effects of this patch.  I was hospitalized for about a week and before that I was in and out of the ER trying to figure out what was going on.  
Other	amderrick, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	9/7/2008 7:27:59 PM	I was prescribed Flector for hip tendonitis. I cut the patch to about 1x4 and sometimes follow up with a piece of medical tape to keep it there during the day. It works great! It has not made the pain completely go away but at least I can go about my day normally.

But I can't get the patch to stay on and it is driving my nuts trying to keep it on. There has got to be a better way. maybe make it a little smaller.
