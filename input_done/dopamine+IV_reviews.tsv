The surgery went well and he was to be released from the hospital in four days.  He had low urine output and his doctor prescribed a dopamine IV to increase his urine output. Minutes after starting the dopamine, he had severe problems with his blood pressure, increase heart rate and nausia.  They stoped the dopamine and he was taken to ICU where he developed additional problems including kidney failure.  He passed away 13 days after the dose of dopamine began -- we believe it was the inital cause of his ulitmate death.

Recently received a stent in the hospital then blood pressure dropped suddenly. He is in ICU receiving this medication by I.V. and currently waiting to stabilize.  So far it does seem to work, just need to wean him off to another medication to take home.

Chronic Heart Failure	sandra_earth, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/22/2008 9:56:57 PM	I am wrting on behalf of my dad, who is 85 and in what appears to be the last stages of his life. He has brutal congestive heart failure and a benign brain tumor. The edema he suffers leaves pools of liquid, literally, wherever he goes from his feet.  Upon his most recent hospitalization, the attending doctor gave him Dopamine to increase his blood pressure and it worked very successfully. My dad was weaned off of the Dopamine gradually and with proper care.
