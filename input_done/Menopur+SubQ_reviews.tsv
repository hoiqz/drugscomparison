Stimulation of Ovarian Follicle	ciera1love, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	6/19/2012 8:09:51 PM	this medicine did not work for me at all and i went up to 5 vials per dose. I was on it for about 2 weeks and then was put on estrogen and then progesterone to start my next cycle. I only tried it once and got no response due to my age/fsh level.
Infertility associated with the Lack of Ovulation	Hybrid Cycle , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	5	Female	25-34	4/21/2011 11:24:46 AM	I started a &quot;hybrid&quot; cycle of Menopur with oral medication Femara preceeding.  So far, with these hormones raging, I have been in acceptionally good moods.  Maybe I am a minority when taking this, but my moods have been much better than prior to all these hormones.  I'm not as emotional as I usually have been, and have overall been feeling great.  I started the injections last night, and found it just as difficult as ripping off a band-aid or facial wax.  We will see on Saturday 4-23 what the US shows...

Pain to mix different doses, but injection is easy once you get the hang of it. Hoping it works this month!

I did not enjoy having to mix the vials and the injections hurt going in but all results have been very positive and it worked.
Female Problems Causing Trouble in Getting Pregnant	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	6/2/2009 3:41:12 PM	I have been using the medication for almost 2 weeks now.  I have been a bit emotional with it.  I have responded well to this medication but have had to have it increased a couple times.  I am up to 6 vials now but no real bad side effects.  I do wish, however, that it was a prefill syringe rather than having to mix it all.  Having to take that many vials it takes me about 10 minutes just to get it all ready...BUT OVERALL AM VERY SATISFIED WITH IT!!!!

Burned a bit while injecting but overall it wasn't that bad. No results as of yet but I will be going to the doctor tomorrow to see.

I used it for only one month and it worked the first time! I tried the Clomid medication and it did not work for me.
