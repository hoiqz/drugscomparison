Anxious	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/19/2012 9:35:50 PM	I was prescribed the 25mg pills, which I could take 1-2 at a time up to 4 times a day for anxiety.  The first time I took it, I got diarrhea every 2 hours for 2 days straight.  It did not calm me down, or ease my anxiety because I had to keep running to the toilet.  The next time I took it, I got stomach cramps.  After that, I felt hungover.  Now when I take it, I make sure I drink plenty of water and take it with food and if I notice the stomach cramps, I quickly take a Zantac.  I always have trouble sleeping when I take it and wake up with a &quot;hangover&quot; feeling.  It does not help me sleep or calm my anxiety.   When I went to see my doctor, I had asked for a refill of the Valium I used to take, but he told me he was not supposed to give me that anymore because it is not recommended with other meds I take.  Well either I'm switching the other meds I take or I'm going to another doc who will give me something else other than this crap.  Vistaril has way too many side effects.  I wish I had more info when he had prescribed it.  I would have said no way.

I have always been very adament about not wanting to be on any real psychiatric medicine and I find this to be very helpful. Ive been taking it in the middle of the night when I get up and it puts me back to sleep for about 2 hrs. i think this is a really good medicine to try for anxiety/insomnia, as it has very little side effects.

I wanted to stop taking it but I did not. I was told that would get better and it did. I only take it in the evenings because that when the stress hits the fan. After a few days the sleepyness went away.  It is helping me deal with the stress and I sleep much better at night.  A good nights sleep also helps me to deal with the situtation. I will not take anything that makes me feel &quot;disconnected&quot; from reality.

This med has a side effect of drowsiness. It takes 1 1/2- 2 hrs to get sleepy or wont sleep at all if taken. I would love to get what i was taking before, which was Lunesta. With this i was able to fall asleep within 20 min and stay asleep without waking up throughout the night. I just want to be able to function and feel rested which in turn would make me feel irritable to people.

The communication problems continue as each drug same DR keeps giving me is causing me major side-effets..LIKE I am making it up..WHO would NOT take a drug that was was helping them w/out major side-effects.

It's like I'm in a haze and can't feel my emotions properly which is just as bad as panicking I think. I'm also constantly nauseous and tired, and I can't function that way. Off of them, I panic and shake. On them, I feel miserable because I'm still thinking about the things that panic me, and the anxious feeling is just muted. I honestly don't know which I prefer and it's driving me crazy!

I was going through my life constantly &quot;on edge.&quot; I always felt like I was about to have a panic attack. So far, this drug has been WONDERFUL for me. It makes me a little sleepy, but nothing that I can't handle with a little bit of caffeine. (I work 12-hour night-shifts. I can take a pill at 9 pm, and I'm still able to stay up all night.) I don't feel myself turning completely red when I talk to people anymore, and I don't have that constant nervous/anxious feeling. I really hope it stays this way. I had forgotten what it was like to feel &quot;normal.&quot; Thank goodness for Vistaril! :o)

If you depend on this drug to make a Miracle happen,then you will wait forever.You hafta Change some things,too! like if your Anxious define what's making you anxious ELIMINATE it! When people come into the clinic i work at BEGGING to be upped on their Methadone or Suboxone,we usually tell them no unless they have a good reason,I'm sorry but 'i still have craving isn't a legit reason. So like with that you hafta change some things for this drg to work properly...I'm not,by any means, claiming to know everything about this drug but In this day and age there are ALOT of substance abusers so Given something addictive to someone that's a potential abuser is like putting a loaded gun to your head...I don't know folks...If it doesn't work it doesn't work but if your looking for something buy it off the streets...Thank you guys for reading!

I was still having anxiety most of the time and having attacks. After taking it daily for a week twice a day I started to get a ringing in my ears, dizziness, tunnel vision and once the ringing stopped I had a migraine. Medications for psych issues are tricky some work for one person great and for another not at all and it is frustrating trying to find the right one. Especially if you are in your mid twenties and docs dont want to prescribe you &quot;addictive&quot; meds... even when you are on pain killers for major back issues and voluntarily moved to lesser ones that don't work as well because you didnt want to be on something so strong. But hey docs dont know everyones personality.

I take elmiron, sancutura, vistaril, 9 pills a day of the neurotin.  I can tell when I don't take the 100 milligrams prescibed to me.  I can last going to the bathroom about every two hours, the vistaril helps me more comfortable.  I advise anyone that has IC to try taking the vistaril.

I also use it to help me sleep. I have never had a problem with it! I take 25 mg as needed, at worst I have needed 100 mg in one day. (Which is considered an average dose.)It did take my system about 3 weeks to start seeing less drowsiness and more even anxiety levels though.

Inducing of a Relaxed Easy State	Megan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/16/2009 5:12:24 AM	I've taken this drug a few different times in my life for different reasons.  The first was when I was doing a home detox off heroin.  I was given ativan and then vistaril as a step down once the ativan ran out.  I found it completely ineffective against my symptoms (primarily anxiety, nausea and vomiting, and insomnia).  It felt like a placebo pill.  I have taken it since then as a minor drug to take the edge off anxiety and insomnia, and have always found it to be essentially ineffective.  I feel no more effect than if I take a few over the counter Benadryl.  50mg might make me slightly drowsy, but so slightly that I still can't fall asleep.  I'm glad it works for many people, but for me, it has never had a registerable effect that I expect from a prescription medication.

I also take meds for blood pressure, thyroid and mild to moderate depression.  THIS DRUG ALMOST KILLED ME.  It depresses the central nervous system and slows down breathing.  I had hallucinations and my brain swelled.  I woke up in the hospital with no idea how I got there.  This drug should never be combined with anti-depressants or anti-inflammatory drugs. It is very effective, but the side effects are terrible.  I did not overdose on it, I only took it as prescribed.  Please, find a different treatment!

I had to pack a very deep wound three times a day after my surgery and would become so anxious before hand that it would become an ordeal (and incredibly painful). This was prescribed to help put me at ease before my poor mother had to pack, clean, and repack my wound. I can honestly say that it basically just made you feel like you had a glass of wine, and this was taken along with a narcotic pain reliever. So, you can imagine the effectiveness if taken alone.If you have severe panic attacks or anxiety I would suggest talking to your doctor about taking something significantly stronger. I even doubled the dose, and it just made me feel as though I was on my second glass of wine, which may work for some, but not me.

Anxious	The Mad Bomber, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	2/6/2008 12:58:33 AM	A 1 star rating means Not Satisfied, 2 stars means Somewhat Dissatisfied, 3 stars means Somewhat Satisfied, 4 is Satisfied, 5 is Very Satisfied...for those of you reading these reviews. The capsule is easy to use, but the drug had no affect on my anxiety and it didn't even make me drowsy. A 50 mg dose had no affect on me whatsoever.
