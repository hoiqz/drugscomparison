Manic-Depression	cynderella42, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	3/1/2011 2:43:43 PM	Since I began using Lithium only 3 weeks ago, I don't really know if it is helping. The psyciatrists that prescribed it says it may take up to 3 weeks to get the full affect. I have had some tremondous nausea, dizziness and hand tremors since taking it and am on a low dose of 450mg once a day. I am satisfied with this medication b/c this is the first time being prescribed or actually diagnosed by a phsyciatrist since I now look back over the last 22 years and see the drastic symptoms. So, I'm happy I'm on the right track now.

Bipolar Depression	Tom K, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	25-34	9/9/2010 4:34:29 AM	I was diagnosed Bipolar about a year ago, before that i took other street drugs that masked the symptoms, but in the end made it worse. After 2 hospital stays in the psych ward in a month, i was put on an extreme amount of depakote as a mood stabilizer. I became violent and would have mental blackouts, so i took myself off the med. Ive been on lithium for about 3 mos. i take 900 mg/day. Except for having a cloudy head, moderate insomnia, and feeling useless around the house and with the kids, I accredit the fact that im still alive to the lithium. So the side effects are a small price to pay.
Other	georgie girl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	9/8/2010 8:36:11 PM	I have been using lithium for 23 years for depression. I tried 3-4 other anti-depressants before lithium, but they weren't so helpful. For me using it, in combination with peer counseling and other supports has really helped me manage my depression.  I am concerned about the longterm effects - i am now taking thyroid supplements and am concerned about the kidney/diabetes issues.  Overall - i'll never forget how fast acting it was for me - used it for a couple of days, and suddenly was able to have some optimistic thoughts...very powerful.

My lithium level was well over 2250.  I honesty thoought I was dying.I was totally terrified.  Will never take it again.  All I can say is I''''m happy to be alive.

I tried everything from gum to mouthwash several times a day, It was so bad I just couldn't take it anymore. It was worst first thing in the morning. I tried it with a full meal, no help. With extra water, no help. I have not read where anyone else had this issue. 
Bipolar Depression	Becky, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	5/28/2010 5:01:41 PM	I am so glad to see at least one other reviewer mention that she/he experienced severe depression and thoughts of suicide. I had 1-2 months where almost every minute was consumed with suicidal thoughts. I was scared and couldn't recognize how bad it was at the time. I hate this drug and am glad that my new psych. (I finally sought a second opinion) prescribed Lamictal and Buprorien. This combination has allowed me to finally be productive and stable. I have a normal level of energy and have had no serious thoughts of suicide. I am also taking Seroquel which has helped with anxiety and insomnia. If you are experiencing these side effects, talk with your doctor about new meds or find someone new.

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	4/9/2010 2:18:04 AM	I was just diagnosed with Bipolar last week, and I've been on lithium for about a week now. My mood swings are back in control, but I've been eating NONSTOP and sleeping NONSTOP. I've had to eat 4-5 MEALS a day and I'm still hungry, even when I sleep through class, take naps after class, and do not wake up if you try to get me up. The way it is working for my mood is incredible, but the side effects are awful. And I pee constantly, with awful odor. Overall, I'm definitely going to find something new.

I have so many highs and lows nothing has seemed to help for me. I've been on Lithium now for almost a week and today I didn't even get out of bed until 4pm. I called into work. I hope this drug works for me.  I'm tired of being a gineu pig!!!!!

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	3/15/2010 1:03:43 PM	I started this following a suicide attempt and becoming even more depressed from Cymbalta. I noticed improvement within a couple of days. I have been on it for about a month now and am doing much better. No extreme mood swings. I cry now only when there is something sad and I don't cry for just any reason. 
Manic-Depression	Silly Boy, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	45-54	3/1/2010 1:10:54 PM	Lithium has been the most effective treatment for my bi-polar mania.  All of the alternatives like valproate and atypical-antipsychotics had me thinking about what was worse, the disease or the cure.  At a 1.0 lithium level, I am symptom free-on both the high and low side of the emotional spectrum.  My only side effects are a metallic taste in my mouth that Altoids takes away and if it is hot and I get exerted with not enough water I feel really dehydrated and flush.

Other	happygolucky, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	2/3/2010 1:40:39 PM	I've only been taking the Lithium for about 2 weeks now,  but I notice the side effects almost immed. I take 300mg twice a day, 1 in the morning and 1 at night. The 1 in the morning runs me down til about lunchtime when I can get something energy related into me. for the most part thats the sucky part b/c being at work I have to be focused not falling asleep at me desk which I've done a few time already :( My boss has made comments but I'm doing this for me not him. I can only hope the side effects ease so that it doesn't conflict with my job. Overall I say give it a shot if you have episodes like me or don't like leaving the house or like to harm others then Lithium may work for you. So far it's working for me.

I can tell the  minute I wake up I can tell if it's going to be that  kind of day. I never sleep good, sometimes going without sleep  almost 3 day at a time. I hate lithium-my dr. won't change it though.What is the difference between bi-polar depression and manic depression? I don't have the high-highs and low-lows; I'm either fine or sad-which most of the time occurs when I don't sleep

Im now about 27 years old. Ive found Lithium is the most effective drug for me. Ive tried many other drugs with poor results. I find the classic drugs like Lithium to be most effective. Weight gain is inevitable, so I exercise a great deal of the day, everyday. Many of the side effects people are complaining about are inevitable with any Bi-Polar drug. They all limit and cause cognitive impairment.

I have regular blood work done to determine dosage increase or decrease and liver function. And I have never been better. I still have moments of depression but they are manageable now instead of all consuming.  The best part is that the nightmares, paranoia and spinning thoughts are gone.  I've taken several other medicines that would work at first but within a month the symptoms would come back. But, the Lithium has saved my life!

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	5/11/2008 10:43:47 PM	I have a friend who has been on Lithium for 33 years and it has worked great for her.  Unfortunately, she just found out that her kidneys are only functioning at 19% due to her use of the drug.  The doctor informed her that it is a highly toxic drug and this can happen.  She had never been told this in the 33 years of taking Lithium.  She is now nearing the point of being in need of a kidney transplant, as well as being in the process of a new medication to treat her bipolar.  It is heartbreaking to say the least.  Please discuss all of the possible risks with your doctor before choosing this medication.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	4/9/2008 10:55:53 AM	 I was recently diagnosed with bipolar type II. I tried one other medication prior to lithium and was not feeling exceptionally great. My Dr. swears by lithium, he wanted me to try that as my first med., which I rather have tried it as a last resort. Been on lithium for about 8 days now and, honestly, I've never been more depressed in my life. I take it 3x a day and cry all day. It makes me sooooo hungry, and tired. It's probably not the best med for me, due to the fact that I've battled an eating disorder for 15 years. I didn't experience any symptoms of the disorder returning when I was on the other medication, so I probably should of stayed on that, but my doctor insisted lithium was best. I'm sure it works for some, but all I want to do is get off of it, and find what works best for me.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	2/26/2008 9:23:38 PM	I have not had a single major episode since beginning lithium treatment 7 months ago--the longest I've gone in years. However, some of the side effects are kicking in. I initially had a severe outbreak of acne when I first started (and each time my dose was increased) but that's stabled out. Now, I pee ALL THE TIME, I'm constantly tired and I'm gaining weight--15 lbs so far. I still feel as though it's worth it but the weight gain worries me. 
Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	2/23/2008 6:44:00 PM	works great but has caused alot of stomache problems even with long use also caused sever weight gain

Night sweats are very infrequent, and at both levels, concentration is difficult, stm (short term memory) is terrible.  now long term memory seems to be worse.  I do not like this drug, it makes my urine stink badly and I feel lethargic at times and do not enjoy life as much as I feel like I'm in a haze almost a lite fog. NO highs and NO lows = NO LIFE. Hope this can help others relate...ps ex spouse was happy when I was on this, afraid of me when not on it.  never threatened her once in 35+ yrs when on or off, go figure...

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/7/2008 8:27:19 PM	This medication was a life saver for me!  I started taking it while I was hospitalized for an attempted suicide. I was still taking my other medications but they obviously were not cutting it for me! I have been handling my disorder very well ever since lithium came into my life.
Manic-Depression		2	3	1			1/4/2008 5:04:39 PM	I had a very difficult time with this medication.  Although it did help my bipolar mania, it caused me to gain a significant amount of weight.  I felt like my mind was in a fog and became lethargic.  The side effects of this medication outweight its effectiveness for me.

I think, in my thoughts, it confirmed I had a serious illness (as well as potential bad side effects) and so I avoided it - for as long as I could. It took a good hypomanic episode to convince me to try it.I did have some typical side effects; shaky hands, dry mouth, loss of short term memory and severe nausea. They all went away fairly quickly (the nausea was yuck..needed to space my doses)and they were more annoying than anything.  Now, more than a yr later I am feeling more myself than I can remember since this illness first beset me.  I feel clear headed and not weighted down. I can see beauty and enjoy it.  I have more energy that lasts all day.  I have a will to live and a mind that desires it. Thoughts of death are now rare. Thoughts of suicide began to disappear shortly after taking Lithium and an antidepressant. I look back to being first diagnosed and the hell that followed of trying to find the right blend of meds... to beginning Lithium... to today.  I am so incredibly thankful for the medication and dear family who had the strength to get me to this point. I thank God for rescuing me.  I am alive for a purpose and I aim to do good and live well.  I have my life back.  I know what true joy is. I am glad I took the chance to try Lithium.

It spiked my blood pressure, requiring medication. Frequent thirst and urination; loss of focus and memory, shaking and fine motor difficulties, and fatigue.
