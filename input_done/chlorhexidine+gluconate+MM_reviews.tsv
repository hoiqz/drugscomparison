Following the procedure I experienced severe burning and redness where the drug had been applied. The doctor attributed the reaction to the drug rather than anything related to the medical procedure. Other than the sensitivity I experienced, the drug was &quot;effective.&quot;

Mouth Infection Prevention	vanilla sugar, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	3/23/2012 1:00:27 AM	After having a papiloma removed from my tongue my oral surgeon prescribed this rinse to prevent infection. It appears to work. I noticed some staining but it was quickly remedied by using an electric toothbrush. I also noticed that the rinse makes food and drink taste bad and otherwise leaves a foul taste on my tongue for some time after each use. On the up side, I am losing some much needed weight :)
Inflammation of the Gums	fa1234, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	12/17/2011 7:27:27 PM	I had very sore/red gums and didnt have time to go to the dentist so i went to the pharmacy and was given this product. I am extremely shocked with this product it has done nothing to help my gums, it has only made them worse and had also made me lose to taste of food/drink, made my mouth numb, started to rot/stain my teeth and also made my teeth very sensitive which is leading me to having very bad toothache. I am really disappointed in this product, i have had to get an appointment with my dentist to see if there is anything that she can do it help stop these problem! Its such a poor product. Would NOT reckon this.
Inflammation of the Gums	Arlene, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	10/21/2011 8:17:26 AM	I am in the process of getting all my teeth removed for dentures and this rinse was recommended for reduction of swelling. It does work but I find I can not eat or drink without getting sick to my stomach from the bad , horrible taste that lasts all day in my mouth. I think I will just use over the counter rinse from now on. However, If you can handle the bad taste it really does reduce the sweeling.

Inflammation of the Gums	Jess, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	19-24	10/4/2010 4:28:26 PM	I was prescribed this mouth wash after getting a deep cleaning for periodontitis. I've only been using it for about 4 days now, and I can already see and feel relief in my gums. The redness and inflamation as gone down, and it has definitely helped reduce bleeding. However, I have noticed a couple things that I don't like. One is a strange sensation on my tongue, and inside of my lips. My tongue feels as though I've been licking something rough (I get the same sensation from sucking on sour candy), it's not very comfortable and doesn't go away at all through the day. The feeling on my lips is very similar to what you feel after having braces for a while, like after your lips/cheeks have been rubbing against the braces for some time and it kinda gives it a raw/rough texture. This sensation also does not go away. Today I just noticed a slight change in taste. I love eating saltine crackers, but when I put one in my mouth today it tasted so foul that I had to spit it out. I'm hoping this goes away. I'll update this when I'm further into my treatment.

I had to go to my dermatologist in hopes to find a solution to clear up the problem.  He prescribed hydrocortisone cream 15% but it is not working. I am disgusted with this situation

I have lost taste sensation and am now unable to taste spicy foods and other tastes are altered. My mouth is dry and tongue has a strange tingly feeling. I thought the side effects would go away but have gotten worse and I am going to stop use. However, my bleeding gums are completely healed and I can floss and brush without any bleeding or pain.

I've had a severe allergic reaction to it, with hives, rash, itching, redness, etc. covering the sites where Chloraprep was swabbed. There is no sign of infection, but the rash is awful!

Professional cleaned teeth and I started using this rinse about 2 months ago. I have had no blood.I floss 2 times a day, and now brush 3 or 4 times a day. I am very satisfied with the rinse. Nice to smile again!
Other	kathie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/5/2009 3:38:26 PM	I have had mouth and tongue sores for over 2 years.  Many tests were negative for anything.  I realized tarter had been a problem for about as long as the sores.  So I went on line looking up tarter problems and discovered what I thought I might have--dry mouth. I got a prescription for Chlorhexidine Gluconate mouthwash and my tarter and my sores are now under control.  I am so relieved.  I still have a strange sensation on my tongue and mouth, but I can talk and eat again without pain.

I also bite the inside of my mouth when anxious. With the rinse all the sores in my mouth disapeared over nite. Q: CAN IT REALLY STAIN YOUR TEETH BLACK?

I didn't like using it because it left an awful taste in my mouth, but it didn't burn like normal mouthwashes. I still use it when I have canker sores, but it doesn't work too well. My boyfriend, however, noticed it worked really well for his canker sores. I don't know...I'm not sure I'd recommend it.
Inflammation of the Gums	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	25-34	12/20/2008 7:02:46 PM	I was given the rinse after scaling and root planing to help my gums..  I used it for about two days and noticed I was losing my taste.. I've been off of it for almost 2 weeks now and have noticed that I never got my taste back.. I can put a lemon on my tongue and cannot taste it.  Other than that, it seemed to help prevent any infections.
Other	tangogirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	35-44	12/2/2008 2:23:50 PM	I was prescribed this after a dental surgery. Within a week I was experiencing dry mouth and tong, irritated gums and tong, mouth sores, dry and irritated red lips and partial loss of taste. The side effects were outweighing the benefit. I discussed this with my dentist and he will prescribe a different oral rinse.
Other	Lulu, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	10/1/2008 6:23:49 PM	I was prescribed this rinse after dental surgery, when I was unable to brush all of my teeth, while my gum was healing. The taste is very strong. It did seem to kill anything that might be living in the mouth. After about 4 days of use, I noticed a brown coating and rough raw texture on my tongue.  This has become bothersome.  It is also affecting my taste.  I hope to see if the dentist can recommend something else.

I would like to know the level of your issues(problem), if you had any side effects and what were they.  When did you notice that that the medicine was working.
