Overall it works well for me, but I still experience episodes a few times a week, just not as severe as before while I was on my previous medication. Side effects are minimal, just a little drowsy throughout the day and very thirsty.

The metoprolol was prescribed for my tachycardia. And it has worked in slowing my heart rate. The only side effect that I had was that it did create errectile dysfunction, which was semi-cured by a prescription for an ED helping medication. ie. Levitra, Viagra, Cialis.
