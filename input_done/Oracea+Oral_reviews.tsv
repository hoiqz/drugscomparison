The bumps seemed to improve a little bit the first few days but are now much worse than when I began.  I've made no changes to my routine.Side effects: diarrhea, dry eyes &amp; blurred vision, vaginal yeast infection, itching (face, back, shoulders, stomach), bloating/weight gain (puffy face- similar to reaction to cortisone), dizziness, fatigueI've clearly decided to discontinue.

The drug is expensive, but not if you use the $25.00 coupon. It takes time to work, but be patient. In my case it works fantastic. Don't stop taking it though as the problems will return.
Other	Patches, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/27/2011 10:12:10 PM	I was given this drug to help clear my acne (in addition to a gel I put  on before bed). At first my face seemed to improve but now it looks like it did before I started. I have also noticed that I have been breaking out badly on my chest and have dry red spots on my back, stomach and legs. I have also had 3 severe migranes in less than two months (previosly it had been over a year since anything similar). I assume that my reactions had something to do with the Oracea since there were not any other variables that had changed during the use of the drug. I was very hopeful that this medication would work for me but I guess it is back to the drawing board!

Two days later I realized it could be the meds, did my research, and sure enough, others had the same problem.  I called my dermatologist who then told me not to take it any more, and called in a prescription for the yeast infection.  However, this has not been a typical yeast infection.  It came with severe swelling, pustules, and very bad pain.  I have swollen glands too  I can't believe I wasn't warned so I could've put 2 and 2 together sooner and not had this drug pumping through my system for an extra 2-3 days.   Talk about MISERABLE!

Within 3 weeks all of my acne was gone and I have yet to have one flair up (I usually have 3-5 new flair ups every week).  So I will continue taking this product.  I also have not had any side effects.

My face cleared up completely after two months, with no side affects. When I went to get my 3rd refill, I was told it cost $320.00 per month with insurance, and $440.00 per month w/o insurance!  Wish I had never tried it, because I can't use it anymore at +$10.00 per pill.  Very disappointed.

My dermatologist said that the rosacea periods should lessen, but I have yet to experience that with this medicine. It is as though the medicine is doing nothing or, worse, aggravating the problem. I am going to ask to try something different, and I would suggest anyone else do the same. This stuff is overpriced and vastly inadequate!

It has to be taken daily. I developed rashes around the eyes which were very itchy and had to be treated with some anti-fungal. I tried minocycline 100 mg/day for a short period and had great results. Also, for a generic drug - doxycycline - this stuff is expensive.

After just a month on Oracea, my skin is the clearest it has ever been, and I have stopped flushing. I'm so happy to have found the link to Oracea. My dermatologist did not recommend because of the high cost, but if you go to the website you can enroll in a program that allows you get the prescription for $25.00 per month. It was easy to sign up for, and my pharmacist ran my coupon and honored the discount.This has been the best product that I have used for my moderate rosacea with moderate acne. It also treats my flushing, which no other product did for me.

The fatigue incresed and my speech was slurred. I contacted my Dr. and ge informed me that the reaction I experienced was very unusual and to stop taking them. He does not kno why I had the reaction and prescribed a topical cream called Finacea, which seems to be helping. I do take numerous medications for other conditions, so that could possibly effect the Oracea.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	2/1/2011 11:57:15 AM	This medicine I took as a last ditch effort before having to go back on acutane for my acne.  In the past four years I developed terrible acne, something three doctors have now tried to treat.  After Acutane my face cleared for a year then it all came back.  This has been the only other medication including topical ointments that actually clears my skin! Its great, the only complaint i have is that it makes me have to use the bathroom an awful lot and I am very gasey... I guess a clear face is worth the cost of running to the bathroom a couple times a day.

I have been taking minocyclene for a long time, and switched right over to Oracea because I have been getting headaches with the minocyclene.In the first 2 days, my acne started clearing up - my face got very dry, and my hair felt like straw for several days.  In the last couple days my hair has started to feel not as bad, but now my underground pimples are coming back.  For about a week I have more bumps all over my face (when usually they are just on the chin and around the nose.  And my face feels rough.  Make-up now looks cacky.  It seems that my body is adjusting to the dryness and is now trying to bring in more oil (which usually I had much of).  I may continue for longer to see if time will help.  But I worry about the side-affects since it is producing such a change within my skin and hair.

It took a few weeks to get into my system, but once it did it cleared up my skin wonderfully.  I now don't have trouble with rosacea and I hardly get any pimples anymore, and when I do, they are tiny and go away in a day or two.  I take it in the morning with breakfast and don't seem to have trouble with stomach aches from it either.

On both occasions, a few hours after taking the pill, I became very ill with flu-like symptoms: nausea, dizziness, chills, joint and muscle pain, headache, and extreme fatigue. These symptoms persisted for about 6 hours in both cases. My reaction was not, to my knowledge, life-threatening, It was, however, very uncomfortable and rendered me unable to work on those two days. I have taken doxycyclene previously without incident.

She prescribed this for me and it worked in less than 3 weeks. However, I had to take it with food because I got severe stomach pains. I have been off it for a week now and I still have abdominal pain from the medication. If this is the only severe side affect than I will continue to take this to keep my rosacea from flaring up.

Both developed during menopause. Did not do much for the red (only laser seems to help) but much to my surprise it decreased my teeth plaque and ear wax about 50% so now ear was in normal range and only need a teeth cleaning every 4 months instead of 3.  Next step is further testing of stomach flora based on these results.

While it cleared up my face for several weeks during the two-month clinical trial, I had a full-blown flareup with rosacea pimples and redness just before the clinical trial ended. I believe that the symptoms were stress induced, and that oracea by itself was not that helpful.

WalMart pharmacies have difficulty processing these. Other discounts available from oracea.com online are impossible to access and frustrating to try to use. The drug itself works well for me, but my doctor told me to double up on the pills during a bad outbreak, which means the scrip doesn't last as long, requiring more refills, confounding WalMart employees.

I was breaking out horribly especially on one side of my face.  I had dry patches and red pimple like bumps.  I knew that i had Rosacea and was using the Metrogel every night and every morning but my face would not clear up.  After one week using this medication my face started clearing up and the dry patches started healing.  I take the pill first thing in the morning with a full glass of water and I have not had any problems with feeling sick.  In the past I have taken other antibotics for the Rosacea but usually had side effects such as nausea. I would recommend trying this medication.

The meds available when I was a teen were not very effective, so I gave up and lived with it. After my sister nagged me about rosacea-I thought my face was just red and my breakouts were hormonal-I went to a dermatologist just to get her off my back. But dang, the derm said my sister was right. The Rx was for Oracea and metrogel.  I noticed a difference within 10 days. Within 3 weeks, so did my husband and best friend. I still have some redness, but much less, virtually no breakouts, and even my acne scars are less noticeable. My Oracea Rx is for 2 months, so we'll see if it breaks the cycle of infection/ inflammation.  Wish I'd had this 35 years ago! I read recently that there are some antibiotic-resistant acne bacteria out there, and that taking two antibiotics helps reduce the side effect of acne getting worse while on an antibiotic, so I think the oral Rx combined with a cream antibiotic is the way to go. BTW, my face is extremely sensitive, I have to use baby sunscreen on my face, regular sunscreen causes awful acne. So I was nervous about the cream, which I put on a few minutes after my regular moisturizer, but my face is soft and clear with it, and it's not at all greasy feeling. I am so happy to have a clear, normal-looking face that I don't even mind much that my sister was right and I was wrong!

I have found the rosacea has almost completely disappeared and I am very happy with it.  An interesting side effect as I am also a diabetic.  I don't know the reason but since starting to take Oracea I have noticed a drop in blood sugar levels more into the normal range.  To some extent I am curious as to why this is happening.  I stopped taking Oracea for several days then started taking it again.  Blood sugar levels went up with out Oracea and then went down with Oracea.  This is for general information for other researchers.

I can tell when I go off for even a weekend, as my rosacea flares and severe pustules &amp; acne form. It takes at least a week for it to kick in again, after missing several doses. It does not prevent all my acne - but does prevent breakouts from the rosacea, esp. around my nose and it decreases the redness. I had severe rosacea w/ breakouts. I looked like Rudolph the Reindeer. I've gotten used to taking it immediatly in the AM, so no breakfast until 1-2hrs later. I am worried about long-term effects and am wondering whether anyone else has experienced any.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Rosacea	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	6/17/2008 8:03:03 AM	With my rosacea, my face is very red and has many pimples. Since starting the oracea, the pimples have gone down some, but not gone away completley. I still have red dots in the redness of my face. The redness has lightened, but not gone away by any means.  People still stare at me when walking by.  My friends and co-workers tell me that they do see an improvement. I guess when you are the one dealing with it, it is harder to actually see the improvement, when you just want it gone.  I take the pill first thing in the morning with 2 glasses of water because I do have stomach/acid reflux problems and am on protonix for that.  I find that drinking the extra water has made it so that I have not had any problems with the stomach/acid reflux and just take the protonix later in the day. I guess I was hoping that this would be the miracle drug that would make it all go away, but it didn't, or hasn't yet. I have only been on it for 1 month however, so I will continue taking it and see if it improves more. If so, I will do another review with an update.

My outbreaks have gotten worse; but it did clear up the acne that recently started.  It has dried out my face and destroyed my nails.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Rosacea	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/8/2007 10:03:15 AM	I was cleared up after a week and the reoccurance has been nil. No side effects to speak of. I've never seen a product work as fast and as well as this one. I'm very satisfied and now I can smile and be seen in public again. I'm experiencing adult acne and problems due to age and menopause, this has helped tremendously.

Between trying to take this medication without eating and not taking my calcium it is hard to find a time to take it. Also I do get stomach and naseau at certain times.  Possibly because it is on an empty stomach as they advise.
