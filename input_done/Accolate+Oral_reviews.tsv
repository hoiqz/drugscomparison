Asthma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	4/28/2011 11:27:21 AM	I ended up hospitalized because of my liver.  I am a non-drinker and the hospital staff kept asking me about my drinking habits.  This one was awful for me.  
Chronic Obstructive Asthma	vikki7h, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	1/27/2011 5:36:13 PM	I have been taking Accolate since 1993 along with Theo 24 and Albuteral (4 times per day).  This combination makes most days liveable and bad days I can cope.  Most doctors say they don't give Theo 24 anymore because there are &quot;better&quot; drugs out there now.  Please!  Those better drugs a) don't work at all, or b) cause allergic reactions.  My sincere sympathy to the reviewer who lost her Mom but some of us LIVE only because there is Accolate available.
Asthma Prevention	DMat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/29/2010 11:33:54 PM	If I miss two doses in a row I have severe muscle spasms around my lungs similar to pleurisy.  I have taken it for more than 10 years and it took me some time to figure out what was causing my pain.  When I looked up pleurisy it perfectly described the pain.  I get panicky if I get close to running out because the pain is unbearable.  My doctors have always just shrugged their shoulders.
Asthma	olmotem, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	55-64	3/30/2010 2:41:26 PM	Been on this (and other pills) for asthma/respiratory problems for over 10 years.  Tried Singulair long ago,  but Accolate can be used twice a day which seems to work better.  I have no alternative since my symptoms are constant and can become severe.   I am allergic/sensitive in a negative way to all asthma inhalers and severely reactive to Seravent.  Between a rock and a hard place.  Accolate,  Allegra,  Ativan work together to allow me to continue to exist.  It is not easy,  but I'm always looking for new meds to improve the situation and I take many naturopathic pills also.  They really do make the prescriptions more effective.
Other	mekylam, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/24/2010 12:39:26 PM	After 4 days of taking Accolate twice daily, I experienced mood changes, sadness,anxiousness, depression, irritability and my neck was killing me! When I got upset my hands would tingle! I was prescribed this to make my breast implants soften. If you have had previous history with anxiety or depression...DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!

Asthma	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/7/2009 1:24:09 AM	My mother DIED from ACCOLATE! Please know that she died from liver failure from taking this drug! First her liver failed then all her organs shut down and she went on life support and died. It was very sudden and she just thought she had the flu. They said it was from this drug. Please be careful if you are on this bc the hospital told us other women were on it and were there for liver transplants and its banned in canada. My mom was healthy and i HATE this drug! I hope this helps someone,,ps she was only in her 50;s this should be banned!I hope if your on it you are getting your livers tested every couple months bc she was only on it 9 months!
Asthma	Hungry Lion, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male		8/3/2009 10:00:47 PM	Once in AM is OK but after lunch you got to wait 2 hours after to take another pill, then wait an hour before you can eat anything, that's 3 hours after eating your lunch.  A bummer

Asthma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	2/26/2009 1:26:06 PM	I was just advised to stop taking this after 15 years.  Its the same as Singular and causes depression/suicide. I did not have a tendency for either.  However, upon stopping this medicine my headaches, muscle aches and fatigue are starting to go away.

Headache and ear ache seem to be side effects, but I'll live with it as long as I can breathe. Since taking it  I no longer have to take inhalers to bed with me at night,  fewer infections and rounds of oral steroids. I am able to exercise, although hills and walking up stairs are still a effort.

Asthma Prevention	bfly, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/30/2008 8:00:09 PM	Until I started taking this medicine about 6 years ago I had no idea that I could breathe as deep and easy as I do now. I've heard its an old school drug but if it works that is all that matters to me! recommend giving it a try. Kind of expensive though.
