If I miss a dose I can tell, the blurred vision and muscle spasms go haywire. I still have minor spasms every so often like if I get too cold the muscles in my legs tremor. Otherwise I can say its affective for me.

I think I've now been taking this medication for roughly about 9 years now. Before I started taking it I swear I had something like RLS. Once in awhile I still get a couple muscle spasms here and there, but not like before.

Other	hype, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	25-34	10/5/2009 12:39:05 AM	Started taking this Med for Hyperhydrosis. I was taking two, 1mg pills per day, one at night, one in the morning.  It completly stoped the sweating, but it made me feel like i was going to faint, along with dry mouth, no sex drive, bad heart burn, and weird times of memory loss. In the middle of a sentence I would completely forget what i was saying. I decreased the medication to half of a 1mg pill in the mornings. It has cut back on the light headed fealing, but still have the rest of the side effects.

Other	bryan9101, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	10/9/2008 6:17:17 PM	First I was on Seroquel and it caused my legs to jerk so my VA doc took me off the Seroquel and gave me Benztropine.  I must say, I have a roommate and he told me that I was hallucinating and talking to people that were not there.  I had NO memory of the 4 days I was on it.  I think this medication (like all meds ) works for some and not for others.  I'm not being rude but please, if you question your meds, look it up because the reaction I had was very serious and I use webmd alot before I take a strange pill.  ......Bryan
Parkinson Symptoms	Kathy77777, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/22/2008 9:32:11 PM	I have been on a number of the same pills for my mental problems for about 2 years.  For 25 years I had back pain and finally back surgery 14 months ago.  I continued to have pain in my pelvic area and ankle.  Doctors could find nothing.  A pain doctor sent me for an MRI.  My pyschiatrist gave me benztropine 1mg 2 times a day because I had parkinson like shaking of my hands.  In the first 24 hours my shaking was so bad that I could not put the receiver on the wall phone.  Within 48 hours my shaking was much reduced.  Then I noticed that I had no back or ankle pain and never went to see the pain doctor with my MRI.  No more pain pills needed. Point being that in my case the Parkinson like conditions developed several years after I started taking the pills.  The back pain was probably muscle cramping that finally went to my hands.  All 5 doctors missed the real cause of my back and ankle problems because on set of shaking hands came after a few years of taking the same pills vrs right away.  Suspected pill is geodon.  I am still in the first week of using this pill.  My short term memory is really shot.  No vision problems.  Within an hour of taking the pill I feel like I took 5 tranquilizers. This pill slows me down more than any other over 50 years.  I won't see the doctor for another 3 weeks.  I might be able to get along with even a lower dose.

I suffered back pain and leg pain which was taken away by the benstropine. I regret to say please be aware of what you read it causes blurred vision effecting me seeing things right in front of my face. I wear glasses and am a writer so you can see the pain in having to take my glasses off to write yet have them to see far away objects.

The Risperdal side effects included hallucinations, confusion, paranoia, pacing, urge to pace and continuous walk very fast (such as speed walking in circles around a dining-rooom table.  I was first given a shot at the Emergency Room and then presribed this in tablet (oral form).  I now take 1 mg. tablet twice a day along with the 1.5 mg. Riperdalin tablets.  I have had no side effects from this drug, nor do I have side effects from the Risperdal now that I take this along with the Risperdal.
