Other	kkaylynne, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	19-24	4/17/2012 12:57:55 PM	The first time I used this product, it was great.. by the second dose I was still fresh but it was the 4th day, I used it again and immediately the next morning I felt almost as if I had an infection.. I now have burning with urination and a slight discomfort, almost an itch, but still no odor. I have no STD's and so this was quite alarming for me. Any suggestions?

The gel pretty much took off a layer of skin from his penis. We couldn't have sex for over a month because it was so painful.

Women who have to deal with it and take antibiotics often have symptoms again within one month of treatment.RePhresh (I take a capsule every day) is the ONLY thing I have found to keep my PH balance healthy and get rid of the horrible symptoms.Thank GOD for it!!

No on wants to go to the DR everytime you get one. So my OB/gyn told me about Rephesh I finally bought and I'm hooked. I took one dose about 4 days ago and I'm back to normal. I don't intend on taking another dose for a few weeks.

I use it a day before my period and after my period has finished. I use it after sex to balance the ph again. I use it no more than once a week. I save money on amazon.com $11 monthly, free delivery. Its private and delivered right in my mailbox. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/5/2011 7:55:23 PM	I started using this after my period when I would have odor for a few days. This immedately worked after the first application. I do not use it every three days as the product recommends but ony after my cycle and that seems to work wonders! I am glad I found out about this product. I love it! I does give me sight cramps right after the application
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/19/2010 11:27:10 PM	I suddenly started having repeated yeast infections.  After taking the medication for the yeast infection I would immediately develope BV.  I started using Rephresh to restore the pH balance.  It works wonderful!  I have been using it for about a month now and no more infections or odor.  And it also helped with the discomfort after sex.  My only side effect was a heavy discharge that initially scared me until I read about it in the FAQs.  It appears to be subsiding the more I use the product.  Also, I read one woman's post about the cost.  I by it at Walmart or CVS and it is never more than $13.  I also use lots of coupons they are available inside the box and on the internet.

Other	lady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	2/2/2009 10:27:35 PM	I kept dealing with a slight odor of uncomfort every time I went off my period. A couple of days after my period I purchased rephresh and the results were amazing. I now feel clear and clean.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	11/20/2008 7:34:50 PM	This product was wonderful when I started using it. Then something weired happended after using it for six months. I started having bad odours which I have seen the doctor and been medicated for. Another problem is that it seems that my pH is now completely depending on this. I have to use it daily (around six a.m), and I smell so bad by 11.00 am. Does anyone know about side effects? Has anyone reported this problem? Please respond.
Other	cheysmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	3	Female	25-34	5/28/2008 6:19:50 PM	The applicator was very hard to use. Hard to get the product out of the plunger. I also bled for 3 weeks after using this stuff. And I only used one application. I also take Seasonique, so it may have totally thrown off my pH levels. Im not sure what happened. 
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	1/19/2008 2:54:20 PM	My gynecologist recommended this for a pH imbalance after intercourse. It is wonderful. It eliminates all of the odor a pH imbalance creates. Unfortunately, the product is ridiculously expensive. The company no longer makes the cost-friendly tube, and now they only sell it in packs of four single use inserts for about $20 for a 12-day supply. While I think this product is wonderful, the cost is a big issue. Maybe someday there will be a generic or the manufacturer may realize people can't pay over $600 for a year's supply of single use inserts. Plus think of the environmental impact of all that tossed plastic.
