I take this medication almost every day now for headaches and back pain. Is is great.

Worse, it really doesn't justify the outrageous price they maintain. Maybe some sort of information about why this medication was changed?

The original ingredients worked great, much better than most OTC pain relievers for my fibromyalgia. Now it is worthless. It is just wonderful how the drugs that actually work on pain are so hard to get in the US. Please, let us have our relief!

Pain	daphy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	1/10/2011 7:34:11 PM	Not sure how to rate this med now.  The old formulation was a miracle worker for those once or twice a year headaches that no other meds will touch.  But since they re-formulated it the drug is pretty worthless.  Now it is nothing more than benadryl plus tylenol.  Plus I was fairly upset that the box wasn't marked to inform consumers that it was re-formulated. I wasted over $10.00 on worthless meds that I will toss in the garbage.  I definitely would like to lodge an official complaint!
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	Carol,  Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		12/3/2010 1:52:50 AM	Why oh why did the manufacturer change the drug? The label is the same and the box is the same BUT THE DRUG IS DIFFERENT! They added benadryl and took out the phenyltoloxamine. Nuh-uh. Lost ME as a customer! 
Head Pain	judy , 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	8/26/2010 11:13:35 AM	I have used Percogesic for migraines for over 5 years and found it to be excellent.  But the formulation change is unacceptable--not only is there no information about the change on the container, but the new ingredient is not at all a sleep aid for me rather it makes me hyper and I would never have chosen Percogesic if I had realized the formula had been changed to include it.  I consider what has been done to this product to be false advertising and illegal.
Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	8/10/2010 5:59:58 AM	Percogesic used to be my favorite EFFECTIVE OTC pain reliever. The original antihistamine ingredient did not give me the creepy-crawly sensation that I always get from Benadryl. Why screw up a very effective pain reliever and why wasn't the change made visible on the packaging? Bad move, Percogesic. I won't be buying your product again. 
Head Pain	Bettyrn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/15/2010 12:53:28 PM	I have suffered from migraine headaches since I was ten years old. A pharmacist suggested it to me when I was twenty years old, and I found it works better than any OTC meds and most presscription meds.  I am 61 years old and still use it.  I also now use it for chronic back pain and arthritis pain.

Head Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/7/2009 1:01:56 PM	I had a migraine for approximately a week. I was in so much pain and was at the point where I was going to go to the dr to have him give me a prescription. I went to my local Walgreen's and asked the pharmisist what he would suggest and he suggested Percogesic. I had never heard of it before but was willing to try anything at that point. i took 2 pills and 2 hours later my pain went from excruciating to bearable. I highly recommend it to all of my friends.
Pain	Davidson, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	7/20/2009 11:57:36 AM	I have used percogesic for many years and it has always worked very well as a sleep aid and for pain but I bought the last bottle walgreen's had and took one only to toss and turn ALL night.  I looked at the bottle, which I paid 10.00 for and it has an anihistimine in it.  I thought it was just an &quot;Extra strenght&quot; version, that is what it says on the box.  I am very frustrated.  I cannot use this bottle.  Lora
