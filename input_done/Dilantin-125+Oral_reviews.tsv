I was initially on 600mg but my liver was so toxic I am on 300mg and have been for 14 months

I haven't had a seizure but I get frequent dizzy spells and twitches, loss of concentration and appetite.   So far though, its better than having a Grand Mal seizure every week or so.
Epileptic Seizure	Cowgirlup, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	2/1/2011 9:53:53 AM	I am taking extended Dilantin, my appetite is gone, nausea is here and so are migraines!  I am taking the pills to please the Neurologist AND DMV. Well ok family too but am not convincinced I need them. I am dizzy from them all of the time and feel out of sorts. And I can't seem to quench my thirst. To boot I have had a gastric bypass so I shouldn't BE on anything extended as I don't absorb extended anymore because things pass thru my system too fast AND the last thing I need is a smaller appetite!!  I already eat the serving of an egg as it is! This is all two weeks old for me and I spent 4 days in the hospital over my grand mal with all normal results of course and a quarter bit off tongue!  Could stress do this??
Epileptic Seizure	goodtimin2, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Male	65-74	1/4/2011 8:59:25 PM	In 1982 my wife suffered a TBI from an auto accident. She has had epilsepy since then and has always taken Dilantin; currently 100 mg 4 times daily. She also took Tegretol, but the side effects were so bad: balance control, slurred speech, double vision,etc that finally a very informed neurologist switched her to Keppra. Wow! What a great difference. She now takes, in conjunction with the Dilantin, 3,000 mg of Keppa each day (4x750). A lot of pills - but they work and the Tegretol side effects are gone. Now...Our insurance only cover 30 mg tablets of Dilantin which would require her to take over 83 tablets of Dilantin weekly compared to the 25 she now takes of the 100 mg dosage. Not fair - not realistic. Solution? Rather than paying out of pocket $62.50 for 100/100mg at our local pharmacy we order online from Canada; 400/100 mg for $59.00. Problem solved. BUT we always buy the actual Dilantin, not the generic.  Living out in the boonies like we do where you either drive 30 some miles to the nearest medical facility or take your chances with 911 and the local volunteer fire department medics; we choose not to gamble with the generic after reading all the negative reviews. We also keep an emergency Diastat close by if needed. Hope this review is helpful.
Prevention of Seizures following Head Injury or Surgery	tsbrock, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	9/18/2010 12:44:32 AM	Dilantin has work to prevent seizures since I had surgery to remove a golf ball sized tumor in 2007.  One of the frustrating side affects I have had from Dilantin are &quot;flu like&quot; symptoms that occur on a very regular basis every 3 or 4 weeks.  The symptoms are bad the first day but lessen over the next 2 or 3 days.  Has anyone else had this type of side affect from taking Dilantin???  My neurologist isn't much help saying it could be the dilantin.  My family doctor has given me blood chemistry test, uranalysis tests, etc. and all comes back fine.  Interested if anyone else has had this type of side affect and any suggestions to lessen the affect?

After that I had seizures every 6 months, almost to the day while the doctors slowly upped my dilatin doses to see what level I needed to have in my body,  now at 430 mg's per day, I have been seizure free for 17 months.  I also retired at about that same time so it may just be the lack of stress.  I have noticed that I have become more agitated easily and I have a lot less patience with little things. But otherwise I have had no noticable side effects.

Before the surgeory it did not clear the seizures. Once I had the surgeory I never had another seizure. I am still being told that I have to take 300 mg a day. I was down to 130mg for a year and still have not gotten a seizure. I am having to also take depression medications because of the side affects of dilantin. Neither of these are covered by insurance. I feel I am losing my money for nothing.
Epileptic Seizure	hulse27, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	5/9/2010 4:09:12 PM	I have been taking Dilantin for 17 years and have had dozens of seizures yet! I started at 300mgs a day up to 600mgs a day and have felt nothing,but dizziness,anger and major depression. The depression come in the morning, as soon as awake which turns to anger mixed with depression and I start having delusions about &quot;Equaling the OD's&quot;, (using any means necessary) and they all seem to be violent acts ending with suicide to prevent any further depression or memory of these prior issues.

Epileptic Seizure	for ever curious, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	2	Male	55-64	4/22/2010 6:43:17 PM	I am 60 years old and have had 10 grand mal seizures since the age of 22. I've been suspicious that the side effects have very definatly affected my quality of life. Lack of concentration have bothered me for a long time as well as the usual swelling of gums. In all that time I have considered something else, but what?Last weekend I was involved in a minor car wreck and was charged with a DUI for not passing the field sobriety test. I'm sure its because of the meds. I'm facing a very costly defense to get the DUI dismissed. Has any one had a similar eperance? In general the medicine seems to keep the seizures from happening but has affected my general cordination and cognative processes I'm sure. Dilantin is not something to mess with. 
Epileptic Seizure	WorriedOne, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	4/22/2010 3:32:37 PM	I have been on the medicine since I was 18 and I am now 29. It helps alot, BUT, after my dental visit I was told that it could cause a GUM DISEASE in my mouth and I could lose my teeth. This is the Saddest thing I have ever experience.
Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	ptbaur, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	19-24	4/8/2010 2:03:36 AM	I began with 300mg, and over the course of about 6 months, went to 500, where I began to experience serious side effects-- amnesia, lack of coordination, inability to focus. I was also taking Keppra and Tegretol XR at the time. However, I found that Dilantin, once added, made me agitated, sedated, and severely depressed. Now being weaned off of it, I notice clear improvement. Dilantin being such an old medication for epilepsy, is NOT recommended from my experience. Having to deal with epilepsy is bad enough without medication that makes your mood fluctuate like crazy, makes you feel unstable, and does a poor job controlling seizures.
Epileptic Seizure	DeAna, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/15/2010 8:51:03 PM	I started having seizure when I was 14. No One knows why nothing tramatic happened, just started having them. I've been taking Dilantin for 19 yrs now &amp; have no problems, A break through ever once in awhile if I'm stressed out or haven't gotten enough sleep. The only time I have a problem is if the insurance company say genric, then I just find a way to pay for it my self. This has made it to where I dont have to worry about seizing in public or at work or anything like that I'm VERY satisfied with this med!
Seizures or Fits in Neurosurgery	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/25/2009 5:35:41 PM	My first seizures were almost 6 years ago while I was pregnant.  I had brain surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation after having my baby.  I had seizures after my surgery and was told that was normal.  Since then I still experience the beginnings of a seizure but I haven't blacked out like I did before and right after my surgery.  Every time I go to the dentist I have cavities but I don't know if it's from dilantin or from the temodar pills I took for chemo.  I can't take back the chemo but if I find out it's diantin, I'll consider switching medicines.
Other	Pete, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	65-74	11/9/2009 12:55:58 PM	I will be 67 in December 2009.In April I rolled off the bed in my sleep.I felt foolish and brushed it off.Three days I began my third Migraine Head Ache in my life. My Migraines have lasted three to five days in the past. Well only two of them.On the third day this time I took Tylenol, &quot;went to bed.&quot; When I woke up I was sitting up on the bed being queried by my wife, &quot;An RN&quot; about where I am do I know who I am etc. I asked her why she was asking stupid questions. I physically felt strange and was a little confused.I had experienced a Gran Mal according to her.I went to the ER, had Xrays and a CT scan. I was informed that I had a subdural hematoma, that I needed surgery as it was extremely life threatening.I was transported about 30 miles and they removed it. I now sport two nice shiny stainless steel plates.The surgeon put me on nightly Dilantin at bed time.Every morning and evening I had numbness of my hand for 5 to 10 minutes. I saw a Neurologist about a week after surgery. He doubled my dosage.Morning dose same as bed time dose.After a few days the numbness went away. I have been on this stuff for six months. Texas says I now can drive after six months. I'm also a contract commercial pilot. Don't know about this but I think my pilots days are over. My side effect is forgetfulness, lack of focus in concentrating and general lethargy, etc.Three days ago I started a three week 1/6th lower dosage I'm feeling much better already. I actually completed a complex UNIX firewall chore today and security checks from external tests to my net show it is very secure. Maybe this drug is my problem, not a permanent deficit due to the Gran Mal. After the initial three weeks we will be lowering the dosage again but I have no idea how much. My RN &quot;wife&quot; made an intelligent, &quot;informed&quot; guess but we are of course waiting for the Neurosurgeon to guide us.

Epileptic Seizure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	45-54	10/30/2009 7:09:54 PM	I started taking this medication because of seizure disorder for cycle accident in 1978.It was made manditory by the department of motor vehicles to recieve a drivers license. After taking this medication for 23 years council had informed the courts that this medication placed the public at large in danger and i should not operate a motor vehicle. How then are people with a seizure disorder around 2% of the population being fairly treated? How is having a disability now placing this portion of the population at risk? I was only trying to maintain a valid drivers license and stay in compliance with requirements imposed on myself. To provide for my family and there needs. 
Other	Jim, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Male	55-64	10/15/2009 6:13:11 PM	My neurologist prescribed this medication for treatment of peripheral neuropathy.  I have been through Cymbalta, neourontin, amitriptylene, and Lyrica drug therapies over a two-year time period, the last three of which I have had significant side effects and all of which have produced no improvement in symptoms.  The dilantin is also ineffective, with side effects of waking with full body itching and extreme morning irritability.  As a patient, I cannot help but wonder why the same type of drug (anticonvulsant, antipsychotic) is prescribed with an expectation of different results!

He was 13 at the time and I weaned him off the drug prior to starting the next school year. However, once he was old enough to go out and start drinking, this triggered gran mal seizures and he was once again on this medication. He is now 35 years old and had been successfully treated with this medication since he turned 19. The doctor decided to take him off the medication 3 months ago and he had a gran mal last night.  He had 1 mixed drink celebrating a friend's birthday. So, once again it was triggered by alcohol. These seizures only happen when he is asleep. He will probably take this medication for the rest of his life.

The medication worked, however I had only ever experienced 2 gran mal seizures, and havent had another since 1994.  There have only been 2 notable side effects that would make me not take this medication again if needed.  The dental problems I have developed over the years despite excellent oral hygiene, and erectile dysfunction, I havent been able to maintain an erection since becoming sexually active.I hope this review is helpful to any one thinking about starting this medication.

Shortly after that I started to have grand mal seizures. I started taking Dilantin at the age of ten. I am now 63 years old and haven't had a seizure in 35 years. Once I started taking my Dilantin faithfully. I haven't had a seizure. I can never miss a dose, or I start showing problems. I also cannot take the substitute for Dilantin. It does not work.

Only recently did i find out from my new neurologist that Dilantin has several long term side effects.  I haven't had a siezure for 2 and half years but i'm changing to a new medicine because i'm starting to show side effects of the long term use.Small tremors, which could be worse if i continue taking the medicine.  Also I was told that in long term use it detiriates the back of the brain.  I've also be showing symptoms of that, dizziness and trouble with motor skills.  The medicine has worked well for me, but my overall experience is very bad.  I wish someone would have told me about the side effects earlier so i could have started new medicine and caught these side effects before they started.

The acccident and its related health issues were and have been fully covered by my auto insurance. While taking Dilantin I experienced side effects, but was as satisfied as one with my condition could expect.However, here's the rub. When my insurance company insisted that I begin being admin-istered only the generic form, PHENYTOIN SODIUM EXTENDED, I began having seizures on a regular basis.  I am now in a three way struggle with my neu-rologist and the &quot;money boys&quot;.  Anyone else having trouble with 'generic' Dilantin???

She made the switch to the suspension 4 months ago and now has a complaint of her lips and mouth burning. She has lost her sense of taste, too. The switch was made because she was not able to swallow the capsules anymore because they felt like they were getting stuck in her throat.  The powder inside the pills actually came up when she had a coughing spell.  Anyone else experienced these things before?  I don't understand why these symptoms appeared after such a long period time.  I appreciate any insight into this matter.
