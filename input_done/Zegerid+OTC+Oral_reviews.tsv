It came on the market at the same time that Prevacid magically disappeared off the shelves. Zegerid made my heartburn worsen and is not effective. The size of the pill is also hard to swallow.
Other	Ginger, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/21/2012 3:59:28 PM	I had gastric sleeve surgery in Aug 2011.  It is a requirement I take a medication like this.  Initially, I was on Nexium, then I tried Prevacid and one other I can't remember the name.  These were good but still required me to use TUMS or Rolaids quite often.  I bought some Zegerid in the U.S.A. and have been thrilled with the results.  I can tolerate more foods than I could and rarely take any TUMS.  I hope I can find it in Canada or I will simply order it online.

Should have saved my $22 and bought antacids instead.
