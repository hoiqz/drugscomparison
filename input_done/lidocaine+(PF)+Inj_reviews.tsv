Other	fmwebmistress, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	3/26/2010 3:19:37 PM	I recently received 2 shots of lidocaine for hip pain from RA and was very satisfied with the results.  As I am reading these comments, though, I am nervous about going back for another treatment.  The Dr. never talked about side effects, and I see I was lucky
Other	miss my mom, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	2/23/2010 10:09:41 PM	who would have guessed that this drug, when taken with diphenhydramine (benadryl) would take my mother in laws life. according to the ME's report, these two drugs, when mixed together, can be fatal. Shouldn't the doctor who gave this injection warned her? The day after her injection, she passed away. please be careful and get it in writing, from a doctor that this cannot harm you the way it did her.

I HAD NO PROBLEMS, JUST RELIEF. I WAS LIVING IN PHX AZ AT THE TIME. I RECENTLY MOVED BACK TO PA AND I CANNOT FIND A DR WHO WILL PRESCRIBE ME ANYTHING FOR PAIN OR GIVE ME ANY SHOTS. I HAVE BEEN TO 4 PAIN MGMT PLACES, RHUEMATLOGISTS, PCP'S, THE E.R. AND THEY ALL JUST KEEP SENDING ME SOMEWHERE ELSE, MEANWHILE BY BILLS ARE RIDICULOUS. I AM SO DISCOURAGED AND TIRED OF DRS TREATING ME LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT AND MAKING ME FEEL LIKE I'M NOTHING BUT A DRUG ADDICT ETC ETC ETC. I JUST WANT TO BE AS COMFORTABLE AS I CAN. I KNOW I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS THE REST OF MY LIFE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT MY GOD WHY DON;T SOMEONE HELP ME?IF THE TREATMENT I WAS RECIEVING IN AZ WAS WORKING FOR ME WHY CAN'T I GET IT IN PA? ARE THE DRS HERE THAT FAR BEHIND TIMES OR WHAT? I AM 47 YEARS OLD AND HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS WITH NO PROBLEM, UNTIL NOW. THE ONLY REASON I MOVED BACK TO PA IS BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE ELDERLY AND THEY NEED ME BACK HERE. AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S TIME TO GIVE BACK A LITTLE TO THEM FOR ALL THEY HAVE GIVEN ME OVER THE YEARS.WITHOUT THEIR LOVE, GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT FEELS GOOD TO GET IT OFF MY CHEST.

I am having Lidocane injections in my neck for a pinched nerve T1-2 and moderate to severe bulging disk @ C 5-6 level. this drug hurts going in and does NOT releive my pain for more than 3 hours. It is not worth the headaches and throwing up that I do after the injection with no more relief than it gives.:( I do not wish to continue this therapy and next week at dr visit I will tell him no more because the benifit is not worth the pain after.

Other	kscloudstrife, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	2	Male	25-34	11/5/2008 10:30:26 PM	I actually am having problems with the lidocaine injection. I received for two absessed teeth. The injection actually busted one absess and allowed it to drain. The other injection i received was supposed to subside in 8 hours and it hasn't subsided in 16 hours so far. is that normal or should I seek medical attention for it?

Other	Desiree68, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/14/2008 3:27:15 PM	I was given two shots of a mixture of Lidocaine &amp; Depormedrol on the side of my upper thigh. A few weeks later, I noticed a huge indentation where the shot had been given (to the bone w/3 inch diameter)and was told by the doctor that that could be a side-effect of the drugs in the shot, but was rare. Now I am disfigured permanently. What happened to informing the patient of ANY RISKS involved and allowing the patient to make the decision whether they will allow the drug or not? I don't think that's too much to ask considering the possibility of being disfigured permanently.

It was extremely scary and i was not given a lot of reason except to say it had gotten into my blood stream.  I still can't find much information about reactions with lidocaine so I don't know if I need to tell physicians about this in the future or not. Was it the amount of me or where it went...I'm not sure and physician down played it!
Local Loss of Feeling or Sensation from Anesthetic Drug	charleswine2@aol.com,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female		3/1/2008 9:31:24 AM	I almost passed out. The drug numbed my throat and made me ill. I am on other medications for heart failure which I am guessing had an interaction.  The dds. said that the injection caused a block which resulted in my reaction but, it felt more like an overdose.
