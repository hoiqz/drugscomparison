Up to this last yera I have never had a problem with it. This drug saved my career, dog groomer. I make sure I always rinse, brush teeth and gargle after using it. In the winter I do 1-2 puffs twice a day, Summer 1 puff a day.This last year I did develop a odd eczema on my chest and shins. Not sure it's the drug or not. My doctor has no idea what it is. I will be watching to see if it lessons over the summer with less drug intake.But over all, if it wasn't for this drug I'd be screwed.

Allergic Asthma	 Female 	1	2	1	Female		6/23/2012 7:50:28 AM	This med is terrible. Years ago, I was offered a free sample of Advair from my Dr. when I had asthma symptoms worsening. It is too complicated to use and it made my asthma worse. I was coughing blood right after using Advair so my mom said no more inhalers unless absolutely necessary. Thankfully now my asthma is well-controlled enough that I only use a rescue inhaler about once or twice a month at most.

Other	Occams, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	25-34	6/12/2012 2:24:35 AM	Having taken this medication sporadically for ~20 doses, I experienced some particularly frightening side/synergistic-effects. But folks, that's why it's a prescription drug. Medicine for legal purposes is an exact science; but otherwise at it's core it's all bayesian analysis and probability. It may be an 8 billion dollar a year drug in a capitalist market, but it works more than it fails. To sum it up from my experience... don't use it if you can avoid it, and try to ween yourself on it very very slowly if you think your cough might be from fiberglass inhalation.
Other	Linda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	6/3/2012 5:42:46 PM	I've never had a problem with my breathing.  Earlier this year, almost all 23 people I work with in small quarters, had some sort of flu-like problem and I developed bronchitis.  At the urgent care center, the doctor prescribed Advair and I told her I didn't have any problems breathing.  She insisted I try it for 30 days.  I only saw an improvement during the first week or so while I was getting over my bronchitis. I had the presciption refilled once and am almost out of the second month's supply. Since taking it, I've had dry mouth, hoarseness, hacking cough and live on cough drops.  Sometimes I can't clear my throat and I cough up green or brown stuff.  Every time I try to talk, I start hacking.  I was sure it was the Advair and now that I've read over 70 of your comments and similar stories, I'm not going to take it anymore.  I also am tired all the time, slightly depressed and don't have the energy to even exercise.  I hope it will leave my system quickly and I can feel normal again.

I have used many different types of rescue inhalers and when prescribed Advair it was a godsend. However, after a year or so the sore throat and hoarseness started, along with the flu-like fatigue symptoms. I am a community college instructor and the sore throat was to the point of preventing me from lecturing. Plus, the fatigue was to the point where I didn't want to get out of bed about 3-4 days a month. I am going to stop using it and see how it goes before I talk to my doctor. I just can't take it anymore and don't think it's worth it.
Asthma	Shdfx1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	4/5/2012 9:26:25 PM	At first, when I took Advair, my asthma symptoms improved. However, I suddenly began experiencing panic attacks, and I felt like I was having difficulty breathing. Then I suddenly experienced difficulty swallowing. I constantly had a sensation of choking, from mild to severe, which made my anxiety go through the roof. A trip to the ER diagnosed me with thrush. I took medication for thrush, but the choking sensation persisted. I had no quality of life and was wracked with anxiety about eating. My teeth also started showing signs of degrading. I never had any of these problems before. I saw 4 doctors, but no one suspected the Advair. I resigned myself that my symptoms must be psychosomatic, and tried to live with it. When I decided to get pregnant, I weaned myself off of Advair, against my doctor's advice. The choking sensation dramatically improved, as did my anxiety.My asthma doctor told me this medication was safe to take while pregnant, but I didn't want to risk it if I could survive without it. During that time I researched this drug, and was furious to discover that all of my symptoms were listed as adverse events fir Advaur. 4 doctors knew I was taking this, but none of them were familiar with the side effects! My throat is so much better, but it's still not back to normal after 2 years off this drug. Advair ruined years of my life!

Have been on it for 7 years and can tell when I need to take my second of the day. (coughing, heavinest in chest) Am dependent on it, but drs feely it is much better then taking oral steriods all the time. Have had very bad thrush which spread to my esophogus and had to take yeast med.  You must rinse extremely well after use but without it I would be on oral steroids.  I also suffer from adrenal problems, post nasal drip in throat and sore throat at times due to Advair. I also take Singulair

This also delays healing of a cut, increased bleeding tendency and cataract formation which my eye surgeons said were caused by this corticosteroid and recent cataract extraction in both eyes. I have slowly withdrawn from this drug after being on it for 6 years and to me the risks far outweigh the benefits of this drug and the cost is prohibitive even after insurance.  I am going to see my pulmonologist to make sure I do not ever become dependent on a drug like this one again and still have good asthma control.  This drug was supposed to go generic my pharmacist told me over 2 years ago, but hasn't happened yet, so more profit for drug companies and those who dispense this medication.  Yes, I am in the medical field.

Magnesium tabletssolved the problem of constricted breathing,and continues to be very beneficial after almost2 years. Turns out my food allergies showed upas bronchial constriction, and I'd removedmagnesium from my cells by lots of ice teaover decades.Almost total avoidance of icetea/caffeine,and 500 milliGrams (up to 1,000 milliGrams)of magnesium daily, spread out over the day,has been a wonderful change.So, instead of high monthly drug costs, I spend10cents/day on magnesium.

Yet, I'm starting to think that I have a few of the side effects since I have been dealing with shaking (for a few years), and the muscle stiffness. I'm becoming curious about it since I started the medicine 6 years ago, and I've been shaking for about 5 years. I will even say that the medicine does work as I only take it 2 to 3 times a week. It's easy to take, and it works. Again, even though it works, the side effects are questionable.

Sure, it prevent asthma when taken frequently, but I have some nasty side effects.  I've gained about 20 lbs since I started taking advair. Head aches, eye pressure, foliculitus, increased lung infections(3-5 per year). If I miss a dose, I have asthma within hours.  It's really made me dependent on this stuff. They should be more careful about monitoring side effects, and educate doctors. I'm sick of being tired all the time, even with a good nights rest.  I have been on the stuff since 2006, and it's not fun. Ohh yeah, I've even had thrush!
Emphysema	Joe K, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	10/7/2011 8:52:04 PM	After being diagnosed with mild emphasema, I was put on Spiriva by my pcp, and Advair by my newest doctor, a pulmonologist. After six months, I couldn't do any physical activity without having problems catching my breath. I was constantly using my emergency inhaler, which I never used before, but was given to me by my lung doc. After missing a couple days of not taking the Advair, I filled my script and took it one afternoon at home and went back to work. Early that evening I had a few episodes of muscle spasms across my chest that were my pecs twitching. I say that because I want to have some dignity here. Well, my chest muscles hurt somewhat when I saw a doc at my lung docs office and he sends me to the ER with chest pain, aka heart attack. Two days in the hospital and a follow-up with the lung doc and he has no clue as to why I can't breathe! So he sends me back to my pcp.My primary care doc takes me off Advair, puts me on Dulera, and two days later I can breathe. Today, 10/6, I'm one week off Advair, and i can breathe, I can work without every step being an issue. I would like to say something positive about my experience with this treatment, but if I had continued using the Advair I know it would have done more harm than good.

Another said it was Asthma.  A 3rd didn't know what it was.  It may be related to scuba diving when I do 24 hrs of bottom time in 6 days.  Anyway I was prescribed Advair 250/50 twice a day.  It worked but after 3 days I reduced it to once a day and it was still equally effective.  After a month, I stopped taking it because of the side effect (and cost) and I was still okay.  A month later the symptoms returned (probably after another dive trip).  Instead of the Advair, I took a Prednisone blast and that worked and was much less expensive.Besides weight gain, Advair side effects included depression and trouble sleeping.

It made me and my family doctor suspicious as to what may have caused the P.E. in the first place. It did not start with any clots but yet both lungs were completely covered with clots.

It is hard to tell if Advair makes any difference as I have been excercising, attended pulmonary therapy and take Combivent. So it is difficult to tell where my improvement comes from. I am not sure if Advair is worth the discomfort of of constantly fighting Thrush in my mouth which spoils my enjoyment of food. I might give up on Advair to see if there is any improvement.

It really helped control my Asthma, where I no longer use my rescue inhaler at all.  Only thing is now I HAVE to use the Advair twice a day or I will get wheezy and have a problem breathing.  Also when I do cough up stuff it is of a dark color which makes me think infection. I read these comments from other users and it really is making me consider looking at other options to control my Asthma!!

I think my lungs know it too because it has gotten a lot worse since I started working again to where I have EXTREMELY hard time breathing these days.  Advair is GREAT!!!

I used this medication before with no side effects and eventually my asthma was so controlled I stopped using all medication. I was put on the 500/50 and it has made me shaky and my heart rate shoots up. I also have a low level headache. I'm not happy because it makes my asthma symptoms better but nothing else is.

Asthma	Holly1980, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	6/7/2011 2:50:14 PM	First went on Advair about 8 years ago - I was newly diagnosed with asthma and very ill.  After a couple of years, my health had greatly improved, but I was beginning to feel like I constantly had the flu.  I cut my dose down to one/daily.  Felt better for a few months and again began getting those daily flu-like symptoms.  Cut dose to once every other day -- eventually to just a couple of times a week.  Finally, three years ago, I discontinued it completely.  Stayed healthy for 2 full years.  Then, early in 2010, I began feeling that nasty asthma pressure on my chest again, like an elephant was standing on it.  Despite my begin otherwise very healthy and working out each day, the pressure kept building till I felt like I was being crushed.  I started the Advair (250/50) again about a year ago - once/day.  By the end of the year, all of the pressure was gone and I was feeling in optimal health again, but always watching for those flu-like symptoms.  In the middle of February, 2011, I began experiencing a vast number of unpleasant symptoms -- vision problems, loss of balance, numbness in my toes, and worst -- a new kind of discomfort in the left side of my chest, different from the feeling that something was standing on my chest crushing me.  This feels like I have a small sandbag inside of my chest hanging on it.  I had a complete physical which found me to be in great health with no absolutely no problems showing up in any tests.  I asked my doctor to switch me to the 100/50 dose and planned to start taking it when I used up all of my old prescription.  However, in the past two weeks, my breathing is getting worse -- this is not like any asthma attack I've ever had -- exhaustion without being able to sleep, panting, difficulty climbing stairs. Today I looked up side effects for Advair and realized these new problems are probably related to Advair and not asthma.  I will be starting new lower dose Advair tomorrow and will report back on results in a couple weeks.

My Doctor says the Advair is probably the cause.  I am nervous about discontinuing this now after my body is used to the steriod.  Back to albuteral 4/times day for me.  I have had some mild versions of the other symptoms that I see listed on this site so I guess I have been lucky overall.

The major symptoms went away but a nagging cough lingered. Thinking the cough would eventually go away, I did nothing until May. Saw my doctor, got a chest x-ray (no pneumonia) and he changed the strength of the Advair to 500/50. Within an hour, my breathing was almost back to normal. Unbelievable.

I have been totally without an infection of any type since starting on Advair. This is very nice. A normal life. However (here we go), I have been experiencing tremors and muscle twitching. The tremors are bad enough to shake food off of my fork while eating, and the twitches, I have literally tossed the mouse out of my hand. So after telling my doc., he adviced testing Pulmicort. In the two months of being off advair, I experienced two (2) lung infections. Both times, i switched back to Advair and the infection cleared up immediately. I am very active at home and at work, so being Asthma free has been a god-send. No weight-gain, no sore muscles, teeth appear to be healthy (I have notified my dentist for observation), so sickness and prety much Asthma Free. Don't like the tremors and twitches and i and leary of long-term affects, but mostly satisfied.

I work out regularly; aerobics 4-5 times per week.  To start, I used the prescribed 2x per day, but over a period of time gradually reduced it to once every 2 or 3 days, and it is still effective; eventually hope to ween myself completely off of it.  Only side effect is I constantly feel like I am coming down with a cold or flu, but not.

Asthma	Advair effective., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	3/30/2011 11:45:04 PM	I've had asthma for 30 years.  Advair 100/50 is the first medication to keep it under excellent control, but when I've tried to go off it, due to concerns about long-term side effects,  my airway closed, I passed out in less than 10 minutes, and I almost died.  I've always swished and gargled with 3% hydrogen peroxide after Advair use and have had only very minimal mouth and throat problems.  I use Real Salt for seasoning and take 1300mg of Magnesium Citrate at bedtime which prevents muscle cramps, heart problems, and bone loss.  I set my Timex Expedition watch to beep at 6:30am and 6:30pm, so I don't forget to use Advair at 12-hour intervals. I drink liquid chlorophyll and take Carlson Blood Nutrients to keep my blood built up, as I've had anemia and low hemoglobin which can cause shortness of breath.  If I start to have signs, such as eczema, of systemic fungal problems, I use baking soda stirred into water, according to the directions on the big box of Arm and Hammer baking soda. Besides killing fungus, the baking soda alkalinizes the body, making breathing easier.  A few years ago I was off all meds because I kept my body alkalinized in this way.  One time I was off all meds for over a year because I practiced Buteyko breathe-pausing exercises daily.  Generally asthma is caused by hyperventilating.  Google &quot;Buteyko&quot; for more info. Those with shaking probably need a lower dose of Advair.  I'm thankful for Advair, but I'm still concerned about the package insert which says that the chance of death is higher when you are on Advair.  I'm also concerned that the fungal infections people get in their mouths and throats could be occurring in my lungs.  Thanks for listening!

I rinse my mouth out carefully after each use, which is an inconvenience, but this has prevented &quot;thrush&quot; the white spots some others have experienced. I no longer need to use an albuteral inhaler.

He was also on an inhaler (albuterol).  He showed symptoms of excessive tiredness.  He also was sick continually.  I WOULD NOT  recommend this drug for a young athlete!   Too many and significant side effects.  The doctor was wrong to prescribe this in this situation.  We took him off this drug immediately and didnt bother to ask the doctor.  Who knows how much and/or permanent damage occured while on this med.

Initially I took it for exercise induced asthma, while I was training for a 1/2 marathon. After I moved back to Colorado, my asthma got worse, so I used it more regularly, but ever since, I have been sick constantly. Last year, I was sick all winter, getting everything from pink eye to pneumonia. This year, I have had the never ending cold, sinus infection, and losing my voice. I have a sore throat and clear my throat constantly. I have been so frustrated because I have been really healthy my whole life, and eat really well, take vitamins, and work out. Why am I suddenly sick all of the time? I haven't felt really well in quite some time. I am really thinking that it may be the Advair. I am going to talk to my doctor about taking another medication instead--I feel like an old person, and I should be in the best shape of my life. 
Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	1	4	1	Female	25-34	3/7/2011 6:08:55 PM	Used the lowest dosage for a year and both my sister and I were on it. We both gained 30 pounds despite lots of exercise and dieting. At one point I was lifting an incredible amount of weight and didn't feel sore. I got Cushing's syndrome, moon face, fat behind my neck, had cavities in the front teeth. This medicine is always promoted as the cure all and doctors look at me like am insane about the effects that this drug and steroids in general have on me. NEVER AGAIN will I take this drug.

Asthma	vmg, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	3/2/2011 3:05:01 PM	This has helped my breathing.  In December, my Dr. increased me to 250/50 because I was using my rescue inhaler after running.  I have recently started having heartburn.  Plus, I was re-tested for allergy treatment in the fall and Candida showed as a new allergy.  I am stopping Advair and going to the Dr.  After looking at all the symptoms for Candida, I believe that that is my problem and I have to wonder if the Advair has contributed to this.  If it will cause Thrush which is Candida (yeast), I think it's likely causing other yeast infections.  I would urge anyone having problems to look Candida symptoms up and check into it.  I've had the worst winter ever for sinuses.  Had some dizziness and depression.  Now heartburn which may be an esophagus issue, which Candida can cause.

After 2 years, side effects developed - thrush, dry mouth, hoarseness, diminished sense of taste, bone &amp; jaw problems, broken teeth, startling increase in size of ribcage, sleep problems, allergic itching. Dr. prescribed 250/50 &amp; everything became MUCH WORSE. Took myself off for 6 weeks, but I realized the 150 does help my breathing. So, I live with the side effects. I also use Ventolin &amp; Atrovent. The Atrovent is great - only lasts 4 hours - but that's usually enough to get me through shopping, bank, etc. I've been on this regimen for 5 years now. Am 70 years old &amp; was very athletic. Not so much these days. Good Luck. P.S. Beware of Pulmonologists - get a good one!!

I have gained approximetely 60 pounds in 2 years, I have a headache everyday after taking my dose in the morning, I feel very tired and always feel as if I don't ever get enough sleep. I now have to wear glasses from the time I wake up until I go to sleep at night. I also was recently diaganosed with depression and panic attacks. I have also developed IBS in the last year. I dont know for sure if this is all due to the Advair but I have a strong suspicion that it is, I've never had so many medical problems in my life as I do know.

I suffered badly during my younger years with ineffective drugs. Being hospitalized many times due to Asthma related complications and almost dyeing once. My doctor about 10 years ago suggested I try this new drug called Advair which I did. I cannot say enough how this drug has changed my life. I no longer have to take multiple pills a day or carry my rescue inhaler it has been a miracle drug for me. I have not experienced any side effects. I still use Advair to this day I rarely have any Asthma flare-ups anymore.

I will never let her take this medication again.  It was the scariest thing, I've ever had happen to my daughter, I don't know if it was just too much medication for her little body or what, maybe they need to make a smaller dose if they're going to prescibe it to children under 8. She was taking the 100/50.

Advair has AGAIN made me sicker with sinus and chest infection.  This drug also makes me feel tired and sluggish.   Did notice less need for my ventolin rescue inhaler. However now i am back on antibiotics and oral steroids.  This drug has made me feel like 84 instead of 44 yrs old.   Sob and increased heart rate. pneumonia.  NEVER AGAIN

Asthma	EddyQ60, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	55-64	11/21/2010 3:33:47 PM	While seeming to control my asthma, this drug has caused me severe problems that were non-existent prior to using it. First of all it robbed my body of calcium and all of my back molars disintegrated and came out in big pieces. I'm talking about losing four molars in two months. Secondly, it caused me to develop osteoporosis, and now my physician says I've developed arthritis of the spine. There is a study also that suggests the many dangers of this drug. I would hope that persons that get a prescription for this drug will research it thoroughly before being the trusting type that thinks all doctors know what they are doing.

I have been in and out of hospitals all my life. I have taken several medications and about 5 years ago my Dr put me on this medicine. It has been a life saver for me. I can tell when I have missed a day and I do not have to rely on inhalers and nebulizers. If you have light asthma you might be able to take other medicines. But, if you have really bad asthma or COPD this medicine works.

I took Advair 250/50 and ended up with a lung infection and only after $13,000 worth of bills to find out I didn't even have asthma.  Now I'm worried about the long term effect it has caused and has left emotional scaring as I don't trust the medical professionals.  All they are out for is $$$$

In fact I had a dr. that changed my dose to the 500/50 and that messed up my system and made me worse to the point that I could not get out of bed.  It was too strong and I stopped taking it.  I went back to the 250/50 which was better, but then my prescription lapsed.  But I realized that my other symptons went away.  I had severe leg cramps, dizziness and vertigo, sore throat and laryngitis.  My voice also changed and has gotten deeper.  I had the -itis':  laryngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis.  I would get these symptons during the year when I was sick, i.e. 2 at a time.  When I stopped taking the medicine, the -itis' went away.

I have Sarcoidosis and asthma and use this 2x a day. If I miss more than 2 doses I can feel the difference. The biggest problem is the cost for me. My copay is $50 amonth. But I do take advantage of (and most ins. plans offer this)the 3 month prescription plan. I end up with a month free every 3rd month. Check with your insurance carrier they will tell you what to do. I just asked the Doc for a one year script and sent it in. I have Fallon and I very sure all the big names offer it. It is a huge savings if your on a few meds at a time.

I run almost everyday and have not needed albuterol when exercising for 5 years since starting Advair.  Advair has worked wonders for my asthma - no weight gain, no side effects and I have a dog and 5 cats...

Asthma	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	2	4	1	Male	25-34	6/3/2010 11:42:14 AM	Used Advair for one year and finally realized that this drug was the cause of a lot of problems, specifically: severe headaches, nausea, frequent colds (monthly), dizziness, chronic sinusitis, and damaging inability to think clearly--to name a few. It took about a week after stopping to take the drug for these problems to begin to go away. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms I strongly encourage you to find a new asthma medication. I wish I would have known about the side effects of this terrible &quot;medication&quot; sooner.

Asthma	Kaye, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/1/2010 11:10:30 AM	Advair has been a WONDERFUL drug for me.  I have been on it for several years and have not had a severe attack.  I have been able to stop carrying rescue inhalers and I don't have to worry about keeping prednisone with me at all times.  I had severe asthma as a child and feel like I am healed.  To Lane that was having vertigo problems:  I too had some vertigo last spring, it is not the advair.  Find a good chiropracter that knows and understands vertigo.  You can be healed, it is a frustrating and debilitating disease, but be patient and stick with your chiropracter, truly, truly mine cured me while Drs were giving me motion sickness pills.

I exercise frequently and have to use Albuterol several times a day. Since starting Advair 3 months ago at 500mg twice a day, I've had no asthma attacks. Previously I took 40mg twice a day, but it did not work. However now, I am shaking, dizzy, have vertigo. Normally, I am not moody, but for weeks now, I've not been feeling well and feel depressed. I'm having trouble seeing and my memory is failing. It seems to have gotten progressively worse. Yesterday, I decided to stop taking Advair. I skipped yesterday and today's doses, but the side effects have not gone away yet. I'm worried and won't use this drug again.
Asthma	frustratedcaregiver, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	3	2	1	Female	3-6	4/23/2010 2:04:24 AM	My now 6 yr old nephew has been using this medication for almost 2 yrs and is a severe asthmatic. He has had 15 lung x-rays in the last yr! Pneumonia again and again! The oral steroids I'm sure are doing terrible things to his body. The DR thinks advair 2x a day will make him a new boy &amp; her a &quot;genius&quot; &amp; claims he is not taking it right. But he is taking advair and has pneumonia again(diagnosed today)! I would not recommend this medication and do believe when you stop taking it your asthma will get worse. TV commercial states pneumonia as a side effect! This is not a miracle drug and people should be more educated if they are prescribed it!!!!! I think doctors ignore most of the side effects or do not believe they are severe enough to take the patient off of it. I recommend people talk to their DR about ALL the side effects and the damage it is or may be doing to their body!!! His DR refuses to take him off therefore if we quit giving it he will have worse asthma! Getting rid of pneumonia 1st &amp; ADVAIR next!!!!!!

Asthma	 , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	35-44	4/20/2010 7:18:25 PM	My nephew has been taking this for a year and is 11 yrs old. We noticed a significant change in his behavior. It started with severe headaches and naseau. He then became very rude and mean to people around him. He couldn't remember things he was doing just 5 minutes ago. We took him for a MRI due to the severity of the headaches and they found a white mass on the top of his brain. They said they don't know what is causing it and they will check him again in 6 months. Meanwhile his behavior and headaches are the same. He never had the headaces, behavior issues or white mass prior to this. We beleive the advair is causing this. We are taking him off of it despite the Dr. says to keep him on it. We are writing this in hopes if someone else out there is having the same issues they will stop perscribing this to young children.

Asthma	As-Is, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	4/6/2010 3:52:40 PM	My doctor put me in Advair only two weeks ago due to a nagging 2 yr old dry cough that I am unable to shake. (I'm still not convinced that I have asthma.) Various doctors continue to try different inhalers with no result. Since being on Advair 250/50 I haven't experienced any releif for the cough but the side effects are significant. Now in addition to the cough I have hot sweats all day, on and off, this ultimately makes me feel exhausted. My voice changed, I have a sore throat and am contantly clearing my throat. This is most annoying and significant when visiting with friends and trying to carry on a conversation. I feel like I am on the edge of getting sick with symptoms like tightness in the chest, lack of energy, tired &amp; fatigued for no reason and the headaches are horrible.I'm going to ask my doctor to take me off this one. I just wanted to share this with others so they have the information.
Asthma	OK w/ ADVAIR, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	3/27/2010 7:08:20 PM	My asthma is mostly exercise or cold weather induced (w/ occasional allergy-triggers), so winter is a trying time.  The PA at my allergist had me try Asmanex, but that didn't help; so she put me on Advair 250/50, twice a day.  At first I felt great, but that I started to need my rescue inhaler at bedtime and with exercise again, felt tired all the time, and generally unwell.   Then as my samples starting running out, I couldn't find my Rx, and it was the weekend, so I switched to once a day until I could call the doctor for another Rx slip, and I felt better.  After I got the Rx, I went backto twice a day, felt crappy again.  I'm doing much better on once a day again.I have noticed however that, the steriod I guess, if affecting my hormones.  I've been post-menoposal for a few years, but now I've got acne again, and the facial hair is growing much more slowly. In the past week or so, Ive been hungry all the time, and I've put on few pounds.  Now, I'm feeling a bit moody, and achy.I may try going off it once summer starts, as I seldom need my rescue inhaler then.Mostly the side effects, occasional sore throat, achyness, haven't been too much of a problem.

It has helped with the asthma but the side affects have been bad.  Weight gain, almost 40 lbs all around the midsection, hoarseness (i chew gum most of the day to resolve that), sore lips, leg cramps and dizziness.  Not sure its worth continuing to take.

Asthma	Yabecoo, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Male	55-64	3/22/2010 7:44:20 PM	Was having asthma flair ups due to exercise and (I suspect) allergy to recently acquired dog. Rx prescribed Advair and Ebuteral for rescue inhaler. Started two weeks ago and will say there has been noticeable improvement but also got rid of the dog. I have horsiness, constant clearing of throat and lack of taste since I started using it. Smell is OK. Calling Rx tomorrow to ask about eliminating the Advair. Has anyone had the loss of taste? I havent seen it posted as an after effect anywhere.

Asthma	jacksmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	3/18/2010 10:07:43 AM	My son was given Advair for asthma at 6 years old. He started having severe anxiety,leg pain,night terrors, uncontrollable white foamy diarrhea constantly, severe stomach pain, chest pain, severe fatigue/exhaustion, vocal tics grunting and rapid eye blinking, and could not eat due to pain in his chest/throat. Our pediatrician said it shouldn't be Advair causing these symptoms and to keep giving it to him. His foamy diarrhea and stomach pain became so bad that we had to go to specialists and eventually he underwent an upper/lower gi under general anesthesia and was admitted to the childrens hospital. He was so sick that he lost 19 pounds in 3 months, was extremely weak, depressed, and was no longer able to attend school. He even kept saying he &quot;just wanted to die&quot;, this at 6 yrs old from a normally happy boy! After looking online to try to figure out for myself what was causing all this, I came across a medications website that had literally hundreds of posts from parents whose children were going through the exact symptoms that my son was. Against the doctors advice I stopped giving him his advair and kept the rescue inhaler ready at all times in case his asthma became worse. Within four days he was smiling again, was able to eat more foods without pain, and the diarhhea had stopped! It was all caused by Advair, even the Gastro. Dr. agreed. I wish I had taken him off sooner and he wouldn't have had to go through the hell that he did. He still has some lingering anxiety and vocal tics a year after stopping the drug but is so much better than he was. In my opinion this is a dangerous drug for children and should not be prescribed for them.

Asthma	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	55-64	3/15/2010 1:19:14 AM	I have been using Advair Discus for about five years. It is very effective. I keep track of use marking it on the calendar. When I have had asthma attacks is when I have forgotten to use the Advair. When missed I wake up caughing. The only dissatisfaction that I have with the drug is the cost! 
Asthma	barb, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female		3/12/2010 10:14:58 AM	After years of taking Advair because of cost and laziness I reduced taking it to once a day. Amazingly, my nauseau disappeared and I find that I have LESS congestion and do not have to cough to clear up my breathing like I used to.  It has only been 2-3 months of 1/2 usage but have not seen any negative affects of the reduced use. I still have periods of aching and &quot;chills&quot; but not sure if it is connected with Advair.  As I said the negative did not appear immediately, it was after years of usage that it seemed to gradually become somewhat negative.

Asthma	Shelby, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	1	Female	45-54	3/6/2010 12:17:59 PM	I took Advair for 3 days for Asthma related problems and ended up calling paramedics because my throat closed up.The medicine helped my asthma symptoms briefly, but at the expense of almost passing out.Not worth the risk.
Asthma	Julia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/5/2010 11:04:22 PM	I first tried Advair a few years ago, and it helped my breathing immensely, but I didn't like how shaky it made me, so I switched to Pulmicort, which has just the steroid, not the salmeterol (a stimulant). Unfortunately, within a few weeks of starting the Pulmicort, my breathing got so bad that I ended up in the ER. I agreed to go back to the Advair since it worked so well. (I went from using a rescue inhaler every few hours to maybe once a month) I've been on it for two years now, and you're supposed to take it twice a day but I only take it at night. It seems weird to take a stimulant at night instead of in the morning, but maybe I'm so used to taking an inhaler before bed (20+ years of this) that it doesn't bother me, who knows? But if I take it in the morning, I have uncontrollable and uncomfortable tremors for hours and I can't even touch coffee or tea, or I feel like my skin is crawling and my heart is going to beat right out of my chest. Maybe it's related to hormone levels during different day parts. My physician can't figure it out either. Needless to say, I'm not delighted with the stuff, but if it means I don't end up in the hospital again, it's worth it.

The only other option for my severe asthma was a portable breathing machine 24 hours a day &amp; I was only 46 years old;My asthma was Adult onset &amp; began in early 40's. There is no family history of asthma.[I was in intensive care for 2 weeks recuperating from asthma[the surgical pulmonologist on duty said if I reached them 10 minutes later he couldn't have brought me back...all I remember was paramedics stating &quot;no movement in any quadrant&quot;... my lungs had no movement. I take a wiff of Advair 2X day as directed &amp; you would never know I have asthma. If I forget to use it I end up with an attack which requires albuterol &amp; a set of breathing treatments. LONG LIVE ADVAIR!!!!! It saved my life &amp; I work full time with no problems relating to asthma.LONG LIVE ADVAIR!!!!!

I feel addicted and want to get off it, but feel hopeless.  Plus, it's expensive.  My doctor says  - it's better than having an asthma attack, but I feel that being on a steroid such as this is not good for me and worry about the future consequences.  I think it has affected me hormonally as well, and has caused acne, and its hard to lose weight.

I have had these symtoms for over 9 years now.  I also have eye issues that I attribute to the use of this medication. I have experienced leg cramps, anxiety, rapid heartbeat, respiratory infections, thrush, etc. It's an awful drug. It works for my asmtha but the side effects are not worth the suffering I have had to endure for the past 9 years.  I have been off of it for over 6 years now. Has anyone else had chronic dizziness even after stopping the Advair?

Asthma	Susan, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	2/8/2010 2:26:54 PM	I have had adult onset asthma for 20 yrs and, yes, this drug has controlled my asthma symptoms so that I could live a 'normal' life. BUT..after taking it for over 5 years I'm getting scared.In reading all of the comments, some of the complaints were also mine; Insanely expensive, can't sing anymore, something is painfully wrong on the top of one of my feet, sometimes my lungs just ache, some leg muscle cramps, trips to ER thinking I was having a heart attack (last time I felt like I was going to pass out and my arm was tingling they told me that I was having an acute asthma attack without any wheezing or shortness of breathe symptoms..SCARY). But, as one person remarked, I'm 62 years old and it's hard to tell what is 'normal' deterioration and what is a reaction to the medicine. I have tried to quit taking it twice before and I am on my third day of being off of it right now. I am going to look for something different, this drug scares me. Thanks for all of your comments, it helps to hear what other people are experiancing.

But I'm once again taking the medicine because basically aside from the thrush, it does work well. I've always rinsed my mouth like advised, but my doctor said to rince with listerine after using it, so I'm going to try that...

Asthma	Judy K, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	1/31/2010 3:13:06 AM	Although Advair helped my asthma symptoms, after using it for a couple of weeks, I lost my voice for several days. When I finally regained use of my voice, it was never the same again. It is now frequently raspy and I am easily subject to bouts of laryngitis. Since using it, I also seem to be very prone to coughing when I have the slightest sign of a cold. I reported this to my doctor who told me it was just coincidence, not necessarily a result of using Advair. However, because these problems arose ONLY after using Advair, I will never use it again.

For the past two years, I had not been able to carry a tune so I stopped singing in my church choir.  I also experience extreme dizziness. My GI doctor thought my hoarsness problem was reflux and my allergist thought it was allergies. No one could determine what caused the dizziness.  I stopped taking Advair two months ago because I couldn't afford to get the prescription refilled.  My hoarseness went away and I have my singing voice back.  Now, I'm only using Singulair for maintenance and keep my fast acting inhaler for my asthma

I have had severe asthma since i was born.  Nothing would relieve my symptoms and I was constantly on prednisone and a nebulizer to control it, especially when the seasons change.  I went on Advair in college after a really severe episod ein the fall with my asthma.  It has been about 6-7 years and I am mostly symptom free with a few random flare ups when the weather changes.  I switch now between 500 and 250 when the weather and allergies get bad but mostly I am satisfied.  I have never experienced any of the side effects in the fashion mentioned by others (a few leg cramps a random mouth sore).  This has been my miracle drug that has helped relieve years of suffering.

Recently my doctor gave me advair 250 and my symptoms haven't improved. I train in mixed martial arts, in good shape, but still find breathing extremely difficult while running, sparring, and grappling. My vision has suffered since starting medication. I also have aches and pains, but they may be attibuted to my recreation. I dont know if I expect too much, but my lung capacity has not changed to where I can see any improvement.

In this past year however, I noticed strange effects. I gained a lot of weight without changing eating habits, terribly hoarse &amp; croaky, shortness of breath walking my dog, and the latest, sores all over the inside of my lips. After reading other reviews, I am now convinced it's all from the Advair. I do have copd (diagnosed 10 years ago) but never really had problems with the condition. Thanks to all who reviewed this drug, I now will talk to my doctor and am stopping this asap.

A never ending stuffy and running nose.  Sneezing, congestion, sinus ache, pressure in head and face, my ears would feel like they had water in them. Itchy &amp; scratchy throat, change in voice, fever, and I could not smell or taste anything after the first week of taking Advair Diskus.  My doctor told me I just had a cold and not to worry.  After a month of telling her of my ongoing symptoms, she said I was having an allergic reaction to the medication and that I should take &quot;Claritin&quot; to counteract the effects of the alergic reaction.  I did so for a week but found no signifigant changes.  My doctor then advised me to stop taking the Advair.  It's been 10 days since I've stopped the use of Advair.  I still cannot taste or smell but the symptoms I mentioned above are slowly diminishing, Thank God!   But now I have a cough that's developed and seems to get worse at night time.  It's a dry, non-productive cough.  I haven't had this type of cough before.  The reason I was put on Advair was because a doctor I went to said I had COPD.  The doctor I went to before this one said I had Bronchitis and gave me antibiotics and an inhaler.  I really felt fine after that.  I thought everything was ok, but followed up for a re-check a month later as the 1st doctor had advised.  I would have never thought in million years that I had COPD.  I didn't have any symptoms of anything of the nature until I got a cold in Feb. 09.  The cold went away but the cough never did.  It was my fault for waiting 3 months to seek help for this cough.  I never get sick.  At this point I don't know what to do. Something is wrong with my lungs, it feels like someone is stepping on my chest.

I sometimes sound like a teenage boy whose voice is changing.  Also used to love singing and received many complements on my singing but now have trouble carrying a tone.  I find this very upseting and would like to know if my voice would return to normal if I stop using Advair.

Asthma	sideaffects, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	9/9/2009 8:49:51 PM	I have had asthma for 7 years.  It started off as exercise-enduced while playing high school sports and quickly became progressively worse.  I was in the ER almost weekly and it was awful.  I was switched to Advair and my attacks did significantly decrease, but the side effects are horrnedous.  I put on about 80 pounds very quickly.  First it was thirty pounds in two months, then another twenty and another twenty, until it hit 80 pounds.  About 80 % of the weight gain is in my stomach and it is accompanied by dark purple stretch marks on my stomach.  I eat very litte, less than 1500 calories a day and I exercise regularly.  I also have dry mouth all the time (and I do rinse after taking the medicine,)extreme thirst, and have trouble doing activities.  I have insomnia, haven't had a good nights sleep without pills in 4 months and have had bronchitis 5 times in the past two years, and I never had it before I took Advair.  While the medicine is easy to use and has decreased the number of asthma attacks, the side affects make it difficult for me to enjoy my life. My doctor also tries to say that there is nothing wrong but I know my bocy.

COPD with Chronic Bronchitis	murdis, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	9/6/2009 11:04:45 AM	Worked wonderful in the beginning.  After 2 months I had terrible muscle cramps, severe bone pain, hoarseness, sore throat, acid refulx, and gas.  Regular physician didn't believe Advair was the cause.  Sent me for ultra sound because he thought I had gall bladder problem and x-rays of spine and hips for bone pain.  Both didn't show any problems.  I got fed up and stopped using the Advair.  Surprise, a lot less gas and acid reflux, bone pain gone, less muscle cramps.  In the meantime he wants me to continue to use QVAR 80 mg. 2 puffs in the am and my rescue inhaler (Ventolin HFA) 2 puffs 4 times a day.  He has prescribed Symbicort because he thinks the powder caused the problems, but I'm not going to get it because it looks that the side effects are just as bad, if not worse.  I'm going to find a pulmonary specialist to see if they are any better than my regular physician.

Asthma	chichi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	35-44	8/24/2009 1:03:43 PM	Sorry, this is going to be a long one. I have had every side effect and it is getting worse.  I am not happy with this medication.  I can breathe but the aches and pains throughout my whole body especially the feet causes me to not want to do anything.  So whats the point if it hampers my quality of life that much?  I have gained 40 pounds in 8 months since going back on this medication. I was off it for 2 years.  Doing well during that time without and lost weight but had a bad lung infection and had to go back on, my docs insistence and her refusal to prescribe anything else.  Doctor does not believe this med can cause these side effects. Been to different specialists and tested for many things.  All comes up negative.  I have sore throat (and yes I do rinse right after) all time and something new just started I have swallowing problems. I am 39 years old and I have been taking this medication except for the 2 year break since 1997.  I went off this med in 2006 and was having these same symptoms of leg and foot aches, previous to the 2 year break. I feel the weakness in my bones and legs. Maybe doctors should listen and believe their patients instead of acting like they are crazy?  I am very close to giving up on doctors / medication and the medical world and treating my self on my own.  I have had to self diagnosis most of the time anyway.  Someone remind me, why do we pay them??

These would occur after going to sleep. I would wake up during the night feeling anxious, overheated, heart racing, dizzy, unable to be logical, and irrational thoughts. I had pain all over my body and loss of balance. All of these symptoms stopped when I stopped using the Advair. I was told that the corticosteroid in the inhaler caused the problems. I am currently on Alvesco which is working great and has none of these side effects. The Alvesco works only on the lungs and not on the whole body.

Now my rescue inh. gets thrown away before I even use it. i have documented my rescue inh. usage over the last five years. I have used it 12 times in five years. I toss them without even using them. I play softball, basketball, and even paintball. I run around and play with my kids. I even ride my bike ten miles one way to and from work without a worry of an attack. Advair has allowed me to do things I have not been able to do ever.

I am having so many problems with sore throat, it makes me panic even more. I do rinse after each application but I dont know what is going on. I bring it to the doctor and he kind of just ignores it. I do get the irregular heart beats and that is scary in itself. Any suggestions?

Recently started having dry mouth, hoarseness(now severe) muscle cramps in leg calf( never had) and a growing weakness in thigh muscles with some dizziness that scared me because I am a very healthy 80 year old man in great shape by Doctor's admission.I was never bothered with any of these symptoms until recently. I am heading to the Doctor tomorrow to get off this medication. Every medication has it's negativity in my opinion.

I am a non smoker and also had many other tests to rule out other indications for loss of voice and hoarseness. I have changed to Symbicort which makes my sort very sore.. not sure about this.

In hospital, I received Oxygen therapy. I was put on Advair, and discharged on that drug. I continue to use Advair. Since then, my Asthma has been quiescent, and I have rarely need rescue therapy with Albuterol. I have not had any side effects with Advair. I rinse my mouth after each use of Advair so that I won't develop oral thrush, which I haven't. To me, Advair is the best drug available for severe Asthma.

Next I got bone pain, severe.  But after about a week it all went away.  So I am glad I suffered it out.  And I should mention the Dr. had me on &quot;prednisone, multi-pack, and antibiotics and rx couph syrup, so I don't know if too much steroids were consumed, or if it was the prednisone.  Anyway I am off all of that and remain on advair.  I still get the &quot;achey&quot; bone pain once in awahile, so that's why I thought it has to be the advair.

As a child, I never really realized I wasn't breathing very good.  It wasn't until I was on both serevent and inhaled steroids that I realized what it was like to take a deep breath, run without wheezing and sleep a full night without waking up to take my inhaler.  I have gained a little weight (I used to rely more on the serevent), but I've found that I enjoy breathing like a normal person.  A small price to pay!

I have gotten off Advair and have switched to Flovent which does not have salmeterol. They say that it causes alot of muscle and leg pain. I was not happy with Advair at all!

This last time I was on it 4 months, and found that I was apparently allergic to it as both the powder and the spray inhaler had the same effect(the Dr. thought it was from the powder variety) I was the changed to Asmanex, I had the same problem with it. So now they have me on Alvesco, so far so good.  With Advair I too got the cramping, but what worried me the most other than loosing my voice, was I felt like my lungs were finding it harder to breath, with a tightness every morning in my breast bone area and pain associated with it. I also have had unexplained cramping of muscles, especially in the back rib cage area and legs. And weight gain,which I have been told is not a concern as the breathing better is the main concern. But I am sure the weight gain isn't helping the breathing either. What concerns me the most is, if I happen to miss my meds in the morning, my body eventually goes in withdrawl and panic mode, which as everyone with asthma knows, triggers the attack, so it's rescue inhaler time and then I take the meds.

I have been hospitalized many times and tried many different preventive treatments. Since I have been on advair, I take it seasonally, mainly during the fall due to damp weather. This has controlled my asthma better than any other medication I have taken in the past. I have not been hospitalized in about 5 years when in the past I would be everyother fall.

I am just now realising that it may be the cause of all of my leg, foot, rib, &amp; hand cramps that I have been experiencing. They seem to come when I have been real regular in my usage. I have told my family physician about the cramping more than once. He prescribed Tizanidine for the cramps. It seems to work. But why sould Ihave to take a 2nd med. just to counter the 1st one's side effects. I see the Pulmanologist next week. I will ask him for a different drug instead of the Advair, as the pain (extremely severe)is just not worth the benefit.Thanks Web MD, and all those who have written about their experiences!!

Asthma	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	1/7/2009 6:59:57 PM	Only used the minimum corticosteroid dosage (50 level).  Drug was very effective with no side effects.  Drug greatly improved chronic asthma and bronchitis complicated by occasional bronchospasm.  Major improvement occurred within a few days, though I ended up staying on the drug for 3 months.  Improvement has been permanent.  The only other thing that worked was oral corticosteroids in high doses, and the problems would come back upon dose reduction.  The drug was considerably more effective than fluticasone alone.  I did rinse out my mouth every time I used to drug to prevent thrush.  I have used the drug for less than a month a few times after acute bronchitis in conjunction with antibiotics, where it provided quick relief to breathing difficulty.

Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	1/5/2009 12:27:24 AM	I've had asthma for roughly 15 years, only worsening to daily use of an inhaler 5 years ago.  I take singulair on a daily basis to control symptoms and it mostly works.  however, I unexpectedly stumbled upon Advair when my rescue inhaler ran out and went to urgent care for help.  I take it twice a year (for about a month as prescribed) when my symptoms worsen due to allergies and it works well to alleviate my asthma.  However, I am not comfortable taking it year round due to tolerance and cost concerns.  Using both treatments seams to suit my severe symptoms best.  While on singulair I use my rescue inhaler occasionally.  Treatment with Advair lessens that but not completely and not to the point I am comfortable relying on it alone.   My boyfriend, also a severe asthmatic, uses it occasionally as well (as prescribed twice a year for about a month when his symptoms are most severe, but not always due to cost constraints) but does not experience as much relief as myself.  He is not otherwise medicated except for his rescue inhaler.

Asthma	adam, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	25-34	12/17/2008 11:01:07 PM	I started taking Advair at the 50 dosage.  It worked great for the first few days, then everything got much worse. Breathing became very labored, and I was getting tired from walking down the stairs, etc.  I felt like a little old lady walking around. Worst part is, to correct this by increasing my dosage.  At the end I was taking the full 500 dose daily. Only by chance (me running out of the prescription) did I discover the Advair was the problem. I suffered for a good 9 months; thought I was going crazy (pretty sure the doctors did too.) At that time, Advair was new on the market and I don't think doctors thought it could be causing my symptoms.  When I stopped it for 3 days, I was completely back to normal.  My doctor now says I was probably allergic to it, and placed me on Asmanex, which I've been on for one week with no ill effects so far.  I'm glad this worked for a lot of people, but I'd really like to know why this had the opposite effect on myself and some others.  I honestly worry about permanent damage, as I seem to have a &quot;sore spot&quot; I developed from taking Advair that is in the left bronchial tube. I was told this was simply from heartburn the Advair was causing; it wasn't. I had a full endoscopy to diagnose for GERD that was negative. I think long term, you will see this medicine abandoned.

Kind of concerned though w/ the FDA wanting to take it off the shelves. Was wondering what anyone out there is considering doing if this in fact becomes a reality.

I have some COPD together with asthma that reappeared in my 50's (asthmatic early in childhood then grew out of it). At first the Advair helped the chest pressure feeling a LOT, but I've had increasing symptoms for the past year where doctors can't pinpoint any cause. Though I know this med is a life saver for some (maybe more with asthma than COPD?)-for me--something has changed over time. My symptoms include clamminess, heart palpitation, anxiousnes, blood vessel breakage, bruising, throat and voice scratchy, tired, and now, numbness of legs, arms &amp; face. Now now measuring my exhalation, my exhale capacity is down. I started suspecting the drug could be the cause or contributing to my symptom when I accidentally used it 3 times in one day and had the heart palpitations. The clamminess &amp; sweating has bothered me too. while it could be something else, my blood pressure is on the low side(good) and its the only thing new in meds or diet. My doctor says side effects of inhaled steroids include &quot;atrophy&quot;; that it's not always predictable what system or function might &quot;atrophY&quot;. I hope I can get off of it and that it won't make my asthma incidents more likely. I see that WEB MD suggests reporting bad side effects to the FDA which I plan to do.

Advair has made my life normal for the first time.I used to have bad allergies and take medication for it, advair is the only medication I take with no side effects, i take 250/50 once in the morning. This is truly a miracle drug, it works today as well as it worked in 1995. I LOVE IT!

It was much easier to usecorrectly.  It had a better effect on my irrtated cough (tickle in my throat) and so I went off of it - mostly because I began hearing news broadcasts that it has beencausing serious side effects.  I was neverdiagnosed with actual asthma.  My husbandsmoked the 39 years of our marriage, and prior and my Father prior.  I began the cough after a two week trip through the  British Isles, and other persons have hadthis as well.  (My husband passed away 15 years ago and I had not then had the persistent cough - but his smoking probablycompromised my system.

Asthma	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	11/17/2008 11:08:01 PM	I've only suffered with moderate asthma for about 10 months now. It suddenly got worse as the air got colder and I was having a horrible time breathing, especially with any exercise. Advair 500/50 twice daily has helped my breathing extremely well. It also does not raise my blood sugar levels like prednisone did. I am gaining weight, however, having bad headaches and joint pain, and my libido has flown the coop! I was curious if the Advair was causing these, and now that I've read others' reviews, I'm pretty sure it is. Guess I'll call my pulmonologist and see about lowering the dosage or something. Thanks everyone!
Asthma	reese, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	11/13/2008 9:37:27 PM	there are many days after using advair that I feel as if I can not breath and have even had incidents where my breathing was extremely labored. Chest feels very heavy and occasionally have sharp, stabbing pains that do not last very long. Noticed that legs are sometimes very weak and I have been getting tired more often. I have been on advair for about 5 months and my breathing is more labored now than before I started advair. Is this normal or is there something else available that won't take my breath away or labored. Sometimes I feel as if I even have to remind myself to breath. Advair also causes heartburn. Had Gerds under control for quite some time and now find have to take nexium and in extreme cases chew a tums or two before I go to bed or the acid reflux hits pretty hard, even on water. So,can you help?

HOWEVER I started noticing horrible bruising all over my body. I found an article in the newspaper that said that Advair is really a steroid and causes thinning of the skin which leads to bruising. I had to stop using Advair because of the severity of the bruising.

My physician recommended Advair and while it's quite expensive ($193.00 per month for 250/50 strength) I've only had to use the rescue inhaler 5 times in the past 3 months. My level of activity is much better. The only side effect I had was joint pain for 2 days.

We found a doctor who WANTED to treat the problem, and not just cover it up.  She prescribed the Advair 100/50.  Since day one, my daughter has not had a single wisper of a weeze or cough.  She can play outside and run around like a normal child.  Something she has never been able to do.

Told my doc, he said it's not the meds. Ever since then I have been in the ER twice because my throat had swelled shut and I'm using my rescue inhaler 2-3 times more often than before I started advair. I keep getting this feeling like there is something stuck in my throat and have an awful hacking cough. I have also had hoarseness and thrush. Not so sure these side effects outweigh the effect of the drug. My asthma is allergy triggered and I think I might be better off using something else. Thanks to all the reviews on here, I thought I was losing my mind... my doc kept telling me it wasn't advair, but now I see many others are having the same problems.

DO NOT OVER LOOK THESE SIDE EFFECTS. and BELEIVE everything your child is telling you about what he or she may be feelin. I have stopped giving her the Advair and letting it wear off. I am praying she wakes up today a new little girl.

I have used it since I did a study before it was released to the general public.  It has worked for me ever since I first started taking it.  It is important that you take it twice a day, every day for complete control.

My doctor prescribed Advair, (smallest dose) and within a few weeks, all my asthma symptoms went away and it is the only medication I use, every morning and every night.  I carry an inhaler in my purse but rarely use it, maybe 6 times a year.  I use the inhaler more as a preventive medicine when I am going to hike a hill or exercise for an extended period of time.  I can dance, exercise, hike and do any activity I choose with complications from asthma.  This has been a miracle drug for me and changed my life.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

It almost felt like I imagine a heart attack would.  I was always shakey, and alot of times I would lose my voice completely.  I told the doctor about the chest pains and he took me off of advair immediately.  He said that it could have caused me extensive heart and lung damage had I waited any longer to tell him about it.

After years of using my rescue inhaler every 4 hours and my &quot;machine&quot; when breathing got really tough, I now only use my inhaler once a week at most.  Advair is a god send. The only negative remark I have about it is the fact that it causes me to have a sore throat if I don't immediately rinse my mouth after use.

Over time it became worse and the diagnosis changed to COPD.  Was prescribed Singulair, Spririva, Advair 500, DuoNeb and Pulmicort in a nebulizer, and became so severe as to needing Medrol 4mg. 8 tabs per day.  Also depended on the Pulmicort every 4 hrs every day.  Gained so much weight (40 lbs)and retained fluids.  Needed Levequin 4 months in a row.  Could not do anything as simple as taking a shower, or walking through my house, without getting scarily out of breath.  Dr. told me to take an early retirement and start thinking about a lung transplant as I am only 54.  A week and a half ago he took me off the Advair.  I felt the difference immediately.  I am able to do things without losing my breath that I haven't been able to do for at least a year, if not longer.  I no longer feel like I am dying.  I wish I had never heard of Advair, let alone used it.  I also no longer need  to use the DuoNeb.  I don't even need my rescue inhaler.  Word to the wise, keep close eye on your breathing when you first start the Advair.  If you think you are getting worse, don't wait to tell your doctor!  I really had no clue as to what it was doing to me, and I am not happy that my doctor didn't put the whole picture together and suggest  this might be why I was getting so bad.

After doing some research on my own found out that the cramps was one of the rare side effects. I went back and told my Dr. he thought I was crazy -if the drug rep. had not been there no one would have believed me. Now I am on symbacort it works well without the leg cramps.

Have not had to hardly use my rescue inhaler.  I have developed Thrush and a rash on my neck.  My 4 a day breathing treatments have stopped completely.  Only use it once a day, but someone told me that you can get seriously ill from not using it twice.  Is this true?

Bronchospasm	PoetryDiva, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	6/2/2008 1:03:09 PM	I have horrible seasonal allergies and was having some &quot;asthma-like symptoms&quot; as I would call them. My doctor said he was pretty sure it was bronchitis. He thought it this drug may help either way. I used it and despite what the package says noticed a difference very soon (within 15 min or less! ) But I have noticed other people mentioning joint ache. I have also been experiencing that same thing since I started using it just a few days a go. Hip pain and back pain worse than normal. Otherwise I have been satisfied with the medication.

It has been marked up over 100% in the past year. I have been living on a very dangerous line because drug companies like this put extreme profit before the needs of patients lives every time. It works very well, but who cares if no one can afford it.
Asthma	sleepy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	45-54	5/26/2008 8:03:59 PM	It works good. I ran out of the med. and did not have any refills. My asthma started up again and it got better when i started it again. I hate the powder left in my mouth. I make sure i rinse right after i use it. I have been taking it for about 7 yrs.. I heard that it ruins the lungs after long use. I am trying to find out if this is true.If i did not have insurance it would cost me at least $120.00 for one diskus.I was told when i first started it that i am to take it once 2x's a day. After a while i cut down to 1x a day. It did not seem to make a difference and when i went to the doc., he was okay with that.

I always rinse.  Have not have any aide effects. I am on 8 other medications.  recently (s months ago) ended up with congestive heart failure.

Would just like to wean off these expensive drugs for cost purposes and just generally being dependent on them.  Tried to quit Advair, symptoms returned quickly, so I'm not taking Sing. right now, that seems ok.  I do have some bone loss.  Have had to take more acid reducer since taking Advair.  Asthma for 40 years.  It does work, just at what cost?
COPD with Chronic Bronchitis		5	5	2			5/2/2008 11:35:47 PM	I have been using this drug for about 5 years. It works but the side effects are way too intense to justify taking the drug.I want to quite asap. I have no energy, muscle cramps and muscle pain.  If i workout it takes 3 days to recover from it.  I gained 50 pounds on this drug, my joints hurt, my voice is horse all the time....I also feel like i have aged 20 years since i started to take this drug.Im done not worth it......
Asthma	Loneranger101, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	35-44	4/28/2008 10:26:16 PM	I have been an asthmatic all my life (I am now 41) I started with rescue inhalers like albuterol and alupent and those worked well for a long time.  Recently I had pneumonia and had to stay in the hospital and I told the doctors that I was allergic to prednasone.  The first time I tried 200/50 Advair it seemed okay but over time my wheezing got worse, so even more recently my Doctor prescribed the 500/50 discus and now I am hacking up a storm and I sound like a bird chirping when I sleep.  When the coughing gets real bad my back starts to itch and I break out in hives and since I have been prescribed Advair 500/50 I use my rescue inhaler 3 times as often.  I am stopping this drug today and asking my doctor if He can prescribe me Spiriva.  I am thinking that my allergy to prednasone could really be an allergy to steroids in general.  I have noticed a definate increase in weight and my ankles are swelling by midday.
Asthma	WorkingMom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/25/2008 4:36:00 PM	With the exception of the very high cost, I have been very happy with this medication.  It has changed my life for the better.  I used to end up in the ER at least once a year due to asthma related illness, but since I have been using the Advair Disc, I have not returned to the ER once.  My chest colds that used to put me down for 2 weeks, are now manageable and makedley fewer.  I have been patiently waiting for a generic brand to become availabe to help with the rediculous cost.  I don't understand how it can be warrented to charge so much for a medication even though it is so helpful.  It can't possibly cost that much to manufacture it.  I am, however greatful that such a medication exists to help improve my quality of life, and avoid the ER bills.

I take Advair with Singulair and Allegra and never use my rescue inhaler, probably 5 years now!  I can be around every allergen I ever had and no problems except maybe a runny nose.  I am concerned about the latest asthma death side effect should I be?

In the beginning it worked very well! 3 years into using it I started getting severe muscle spasms. They were so bad I finally asked for something to take to stop the muscle spasms, they gave me clonazepam. It took a couple of days for it to work &amp; now I only will have a spasm every once in a while. Also I've had alot of trouble with mouth soreness &amp; horseness since day one. Also in the five years that I have been taking Advair I have gained 50 pounds!!!! I am on my last Discus &amp; then I refuse to takie it any more, I think its killing me.

I was put on 250 and it was great.. I was able to breath with no problems.  The dr thought maybe 125; I tried it but I felt like I needed the albuterol again so she switched me back to 250 which is a miracle drug.  I feel so good that sometimes I forget that I have to take it twice a day and I miss my time.  When I do, I feel the difference in my chest.  Advair is great!!

It use to worry me to death if I didn't have a puffer in close proximity.I had the advair in the medicine cabinet for a few weeks and had not tried it and was useing the albuterol about every four hours and decided to try the advair. It worked faster than the albuterol. I even started only using the advair occasionally after about two years because I saw on a add where it might slow healing and I have some nerve damage in a shoulder. I never took it twice a day, even at first. I'm using the 250/50. This was not strong enough for my 38 year old son. I am 63 and have had asthma since I was about 10. Central Texas, McLennan Co. is the worst area for me.

My throat irritation is getting worse and worse.  I take it 2x daily.  Asthma control is good and I have had asthma 50+ years.  I will take some of the suggestions here to hopefully reduce throat problems.  I sound like a smoker because of Advair.  For those of you interested, or able, Advair is available in Algodones Mexico for $30-$35--same packaging and dosage as in US.  Might be more in Nogales.  My insurance is paying for mine now still, but my mail in cost is only a little less than what I pay in Mexico.  I use from both sources and see no difference.  Might be worth a trip to Tucson or Yuma and a bus ride to a border town. People run pharmacy bus tours, and we've seen LOTS of buses lined up at the border.  My husband is on another drug that costs almost $300 here-not insurance covered-- and we pay $68 there.

Other	sick in virginia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	55-64	1/26/2008 7:19:22 AM	I have a case of severe sinusitis.  My sinus were blocked and I had chest congestion to the point of wheezing and rattling in my chest.  Having problems breathing.  Dr. precribed this medication, ProAir HFA,shot of prednizone, followed by oral prednizone for a week and 2weeks of 875-125mg of augmentum.  I have had this condition since 12-15-07 for close to 6 weeks.  I can breathe better.  My head is opening up and some congestion is breaking up, but I'm still sick hocking up.  I hope when I finish all medication this clears up.  I went to 2 different Dr's and the emergency room, plus chest x-rays before seeing pulmanary Dr.  Also cracked a rib coughing(thought I had a collapsed lung because I have had this condition before in an auto accident, but pulmanary Dr. looked at x-ray and believes to be fractured rib from coughing).  The emergency room gave me the antibiotic (bactrem-10 day supply) which did not help at all. This infection has probably cost me close to $1,000.  I wander if anyone else has had this problem with Dr's not giving appropriate medications.  After seeing 1st Dr.( gave me a shot of antibiotic) called back (10 days later) to call in something else to drug store-they would not-wanted me to come back to office 2 days later.  I ended up in emeregency room 5am next morning-having breathing problems (and they did'nt correctly treat me either) I couldn't wait 2 days, I was sick.  Great Dr's huh.  Saw pulmanary Dr. next day on emergency basis and his prescribed medications seem to be helping.

So he thought we'd give advair a try. I haven't had to use my fast acting inhaler in months and its been so long since I needed one, that they all exp. on me! Best inhaler out there but sure needs a more buget friendly price.

I could really breathe  but the Dr.s thought that I had caused damage to my heart from the medication. After a battery of test  no more Advair and no more problems.  I have never experienced heart problems prior and am now on Asmanex  and no heart problems and .... MUCH BETTER

I have successfully used it for years with no problems.

Asthma	35-44 Male  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	35-44	12/16/2007 11:17:13 PM	I guess I had one of the serious side effects they talk about.  I started shaking uncontrollably and had chills.  The medics had never seen anything like it.  It scared me so bad that I'd rather have an attack than go through that again.
Asthma	35-44 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/13/2007 1:09:05 PM	Best asthma medication I've ever used.  I no longer experience any symptoms and I have not had any side effects (former inhalants would occasionally cause my heart to beat quickly).  This drug is so effective I question whether I still have asthma.

I've been using this for two months now and I haven't used my other inhaler since.  Very pricy however, but I feel great.

Asthma	TammyG, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	11/19/2007 12:54:58 PM	I was using my &quot;rescue&quot; inhaler every 2hrs.  Once I tried Advair I couldn't believe the difference.  I guess this is what it's like to have &quot;healthy&quot; lungs.  It's a miracle drug.  Its just too bad it's so expensive.  I don't have health insurance that will cover this and @ $200 a pop... I sadly can't use it on a regular basis. BUT if you can afford it, have your Dr. get it for you!!!!

Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/18/2007 3:25:20 AM	Before taking this drug, my asthma was out of control.  I used a rescue inhaler every four hours.  Now I never use my rescue inhaler.  It should be pointed out that I have &quot;allergic&quot; asthma.
Asthma	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	3	1	Male	25-34	11/17/2007 1:47:23 PM	The disks were initially really good at treatment but now I have been having more of the side effects of headaches and sore throat. The sore throat is REALLY a big issue and I commonly have a sore throat ecspecially by the end of the day or if I have been talking for a while.

Asthma	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/30/2007 5:57:56 PM	i ame very satisfied but cant get medicaid to pay for this medication. I really need it.i have tryed all the other controlled inhalers but this is the one that helps me. can you help 
Asthma	Frank, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	10/29/2007 10:26:31 AM	65 yr old male.  Adult onset asthma at around 50.  After struggling for over 10 years doctors put me on Advair 100/50 trying to get me suitable for hernia surgery three years ago.  Been on it since and like some others I find that I can get by with one dose every 24 hours.  At 65 one is never sure about side effects. :)

But now Im dealing with severe bone deteration and my teeth are literally breaking off. It controls asthma very well but the side effects are not worth it. If you must take this have your Dr. put you on one of the osteoperosis drugs to keep your bones strong(if you have heart problems then at least take extra calcium) I was not told any of this until it was too late and then the damage was done. If your teeth are sensitive even if you brush immediatly after taking advair it will still effect your teeth. Be very careful with this medicene. 
Asthma	MSM, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	10/27/2007 9:28:01 AM	Thank God for Advair. I have no symptoms of asthma now, and have even had fewer respiratory infections. The only problem I've ever had that I know of was side effect of oral thrush-even with mouth rinsing.My vision is also getting worse,but not sure if this is due to med. However, anything is worth being able to breathe easily.
Asthma	Angel, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	25-34	10/26/2007 10:45:12 AM	Despite my satisfaction rating, this drug does work well.  I took 250 mcg. twice a day.  It did help stop the bronchio spasms I was having frequently that triggers my attacks, but I had a rather uncomfortable side effect.  My entire body felt like it was covered in bruises, way beyond the normal muscle aches.  It felt like the kind of bruising you get when you run into the corner of something, but all over!  Just putting on my clothes, laying down or being touched was agony.  Prior to this medication I was on Medrol, which didn't help much and Prednisone which is just a viscious drug to take.  I wish I didn't have this side effect because otherwise, this is a very easy medication to take that otherwise made my life much more livable.

I was using it once in the morning and at night; however, I am now only using it in the morning.  I am considered severe asthmatic, and it has helped me maintain a &quot;normal&quot; active life.

Asthma	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	19-24	10/2/2007 11:17:37 AM	I've been using this drug for two years, it's very effective, although sometimes I feel an attack coming on, it never really gets bad.  Also it has allowed me to go to the gym and run.I'm just a little dissatisfied since it gave me a sore throat and was very uncomfortable to inhale for a while.  Also it gives me daily heartburn.
Asthma	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	9/27/2007 6:03:49 PM	Been using it for years with no complaints. Very easy to use. Doc prescribed 2 doses per day but I discovered I only need 1 for it to work (I told him and he OK'd it). Now I only use it once daily and it lasts twice as long, saving me money. Has almost no taste, you can barely even tell anything goes in your mouth. All in all a great drug that keeps me out of the emergency room.
