Multiple Myeloma	Richard, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	1	4	Male	45-54	6/22/2012 8:21:58 AM	You have to be satisfied with being in remission, but the neuropathy in my feet really makes me question whether or not I should have gone the transplant route. I just found out the Velcade has damaged the nerves in my stomach where I cant digest food correctly.Make sure you are up front and honest with you Doctor about the pain. DO NOT assume the pain is supposed to be that bad.

Multiple Myeloma	 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	3	1	2	Female		2/1/2012 1:52:38 AM	My 72 yo mom took this for a few months through IV while also getting dexamethazone.  She didn't want stem cell.  Ths brought her kidneys back and the light chain numbers down to the 40's but doc recommended diff treatment, said still too high.  Did a trial at Stanford then on o revlimid. Numbers back up to 60's so considering adding velcade  at lower dose and not IV.  Neuropathy so bad with IV she couldn't walk and took over 6mos to get feeling in feet again.

Multiple Myeloma	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	45-54	10/7/2010 4:19:30 PM	Diagnosed with MM in January, and started on an aggressive treatment using Thalidamide(daily),changed to Revlamid(daily), Dexmathazone(weekly), and Velcade injections(twice a week). The combination worked very well, and now getting ready for a stem cell transplant, so I am only on a maintenance dose of Velcade once a week. Side effects have varied, but have been able to control some of them using other medications(most over the counter). The only side effect that has been bothersome has been the pain in my hands and feet, but over the last couple of weeks, using heat in the evening and a change in medications(the addition of a beta-blocker), the pain has lessened and has become livable.

Mild nausea initially, some constipation, worst side effect for me has been lethargy. My numbers are in normal ranges, being transplanted next month. Had no neuropathy, no hair loss, mild appetite suppression but no weight loss. Can &quot;taste&quot; smell of medication days after treatment... but I can tolerate that. Experiencing &quot;dry&quot; eyes, facial hair, and acne, but doctor says that they most likely from steroids. I am very pleased with my results &amp; treatment.

Multiple Myeloma	DAVE , 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	4/24/2010 3:47:48 PM	After being on Revlimid, it was determined that Velcade would do a better job in getting my numbers down to a proper level for a stem cell transplant (autologous). Within 2 cycles I was ready. I had the transplant and within 4 months I was classified as CR (complete response). It will be 2 years in May 2010 and my numbers are still good. The only side effect of the medication is peripheral neuropathy. Although pretty bothersome, it is better than the alternative. I am aware that there is no cure for MM but thankfully there are drugs out there to help us survive.

Velcade has knocked my protein levels down to normal with 6 treatments.Excruciating neuopathy in legs discontinued treatment. I am taking Lyrica which knocked out the neuropathy completely.

After only four rounds, I was in remission!  However, I did develop neuropothy in my feet, experienced vomiting and diarrhea, chills and weakness.  It was not easy, but I would do it again, as I have been in remission for six years.

I went to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the summer of 2008 to have extensive chemo in preparation for a stem cell transplant which she had soon afterward.  When I returned to Florida, where we live, in early September 2008 my oncologist put me on Velcade.  So far, so good.  Even though I have side effects such as nausea and fatigue I seem to handle my treatments OK. Some of the best places for treatment for are in Florida, they are the Cleveland Clinic in Weston, Florida, the Mayo Clinic also in Florida and of course, Sloan-Kettering in New York.

The pain from neuropothy in the feet, ankles and legs is excruciating, and are worse in the evening after dinner than any other time.  The level of pain makes healing very difficult.
