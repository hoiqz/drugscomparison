I gained 80 pounds in four months! I was put on 175 mcg's of a generic version of Levoxyl. I had zero energy, zero appetite, was confused most of the time and was just miserable. I ate very little, exercised regularly but only lost 1 pound a month. I've been on Levoxyl now for two months and feel like my old self. I've lost 12 pounds so far. My mind is clear, no more fog. The only side effect I've noticed is loss of hair, lots of it.

Didn't know my thyroid level was low until I had a physical.  Dr. started me on the lowest dose and every 6 months increase the dosage until my current maintenance level of 88mcg.  No side effects ever.  Be sure to get a periodic blood test to see if your dose strength needs to be adjusted.

Had to take it on an empty stomach and this caused bright red bleeding with bowel movements after 1 week.  Lost track of time, it could be 10 am or 6 pm and I had to look at the clock to know what time it was, I had no internal clock or feeling of what time it was.  I lost weight (not a bad side effect).  I did feel more energy and did not need to sleep as much, only 7 or 8 hours vs. 9 or 11.  Knot in throat feeling every day bothered me greatly.  Heart feels like it is stressed out and has pain.  Stomach pain.  Ears felt like sound was muffled and a stick was poking in them on day 2 and 3.  Very good side effect was my writing skills were awesome, my communication while writing was fantastic, I had no trouble thinking about sentence structure or getting my thoughts across.  Decided the side effects were too much for me, I even tried half a pill.  This medicine was too strong for me but I am very sensitive to most drugs.

I lost 20 lbs (and didn't need to). It caused gastroparesis. TSH was all over the place every time I got retested.  I evidently need T3; I switched to Naturethroid and am doing much better now.

I am now taking 75mcg. I find it dissolves quickly and you have to swallow fast. If I don't get it down fast it can act like a hoarse voice for a short time. I get dull headaches and my energy level fluctuates.  I seem to have an increased appetite, but don't seem to be gaining a lot.  I have noticed increased irritability. All the negative things I will need to discuss with my doctor after investigating the side effects more closely.  When you are over 50 you sometimes attribute it to age, but now I am not so sure. thanks for all the reviews..it helps.

I have a goiter on the left side of my Thyroid &amp; Cysts on the Right side of the Thyroid that require Draining every 6 months to a year.  The drained fluid amounts range from 20cc's to 35cc's plus. I have had Fine Neddle Biopsies with No sign of Cancer.  At my next checkup in 6 months if the cysts are still present my doctor will require removal of the right side of my Thyroid where the cysts are present.

I had been taking 100 mcg a day now up to 250 mcg and the tests still show very high tsh but I'm having many of the symptoms the other reviewers stated - night sweats, heart palpitations, leg cramps, stomach upset.  I don't know why it seemed to work so well before the surgery and now doesn't seem to control the tsh while causing all these problems.

I have been taking this medication for nearly five years now and it didn't make sense. What I was told is that certain foods can reduce the amount of absorption. The person there asked very carefully about any changes in my diet. And then I realized that having spent nearly three weeks in Japan about six weeks prior, I had in fact increased the amount of soy in my diet--much more than I normally ingest. Turns out that the daily intake of large amounts of soy (miso soup, tofu, and other foods) reduced the absorption of Levoxyl and that is why I gained the weight. In addition, the person there said that walnuts, cruciferous vegetables, and a high fiber diet can also reduce absorption. She made sure to note that it doesn't mean that one should avoid those foods. But if one is taking those foods regularly, they should tell their physicians so the adjustment can be made in the medication--to increase the dosage. Also--very important--don't store the medication in the bathroom where the environment can be steamy and hot from baths and showers. This also reduces the strength of this medication. Store it in a temperate, dry environment.I hope this helps anyone who might be taking this medication and who mysteriously gains weight when their diet and exercise program is steady--and healthy. In my case, my diet, on the surface seemed the same--fish, whole grains, vegetables, etc) but I had, in fact, increased the soy unwittingly just by being in Japan where it is present in many of the dishes.

Underactive Thyroid	JenH, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/14/2010 12:56:42 PM	I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid over 15 years ago and have been on Levoxyl ever since.  I didn't know what was wrong with me - very tired, headaches, always very cold and a lot of weight gain.  Once on the medication, felt much improvement - have to have blood work done  4-6 months to regulate dosage.  If you are taking too much it can cause hair loss.  Also, Hyprothyrodisim is an auto-immune disease. If you have one auto-immune disease, you can have others.  Alopecia (hair loss) is also an auto-immune disease.  It runs in my family.  I also have Type 1 diabetes along with several other auto-immune diseases.  So if you are experiencing problems like hair loss, have your doctor do a blood test to make sure you are on the right dosage or it could be some other reason.  A few years ago, my insurance company tried to switch me to a generic with horrible results.  I broke out in a rash, very tired and hair loss.  My doctor nows writes, do not substitute on the prescription.

Now I'm on levoxyl and I feel better, it desolves quick, and still have rapid heart beat which was 115 today, but I'm good. I'm only 25 yrs old female diagnosed after my first and only child was born it was severe hypothryriodism. Ive come along way, hope to overcome it. I'm very active, with my family young have always been thin even throughout this drama. I hope the best for u all too.

I learned that the efficacy of generic thyroid meds can vary up to 10% from pill to pill in the same production lot. This is not acceptable. I would encourage anyone taking generics and suffering from ill side-effects to consult with their doc and get on a brand-name drug like Levoxyl or Synthroid, which is reported to be consistent.I just increased my dose from 50mcg to 75 three days ago. The reason was that my TSH was on the rise over a year of monitoring and I was feeling sluggish, suffering hair loss, constipation, and putting on weight. Today I had a near-fainting spell while driving and I don't know why. I hear some of you talking about neck pain and I wonder where that neck pain is -- back of neck, front? I have pain in the side of my neck. I have also been dizzy for the last two nights. I am sleeping all right now but I have suffered night sweats (really, night SOAKS) in the past, which might be related to this, or to hormonal changes typical for a 42-year old woman. I am also achy in the morning, but again -- is this my bulging disc issue, or the drug? Who can tell?Overall, I have been happy with Levoxyl. The difference between name brand and generic was TREMENDOUS for me so more than anything, I encourage people on generics to explore the possibility of changing meds.

It stopped the rapid weight gain, chills and exhaustion, but my hair continues to fall out at an alarming rate.  Luckily, I have (had) a thick head of hair.  Having to take this medicine 1/2 to one hour prior to eating is hard, as eating breakfast is important and I don't have time to wait around while the medicine dissolves in my stomach, so I end up eating a protein bar at work instead of a proper breakfast at home.  Also, having to wait 4 hours to take calcium supplements is a hassle, as I'm busy at work and forget to take my morning calcium.  I wish my thyroid worked, but it could be worse.  I'm thankful my health problems are minimal.

At a high dose, Synthroid gave me terrible headaches and some other un-livable side effects, even after weeks where I should have been used to the dose. A switch to Levoxyl at the same dose ended all those problems, with the surprise benefit that it is a FRACTION of the cost of Synthroid for the same medicine.

Dry brittle hair with significant hair loss, anxiety attacks, sleeping problems. Weight gain and all over muscle aches. I have been on Levoxyl since 1997. I have tried Synthroid as well. Either way, you must keep up with your blood work, and ask if not hound your doctor for answers. I have learned more about my thyroid condition by keeping a food and mood journal. If it goes in my mouth, I write it down. If I feel a certain way, I write that down too. Keep track of everything! Also, thyroid patients have a tendency for low vit. D levels. Depending on where you live, this can be an issue. Don't make the same mistakes, I have by assuming your doctor is always right. They make mistakes too! This drug seems to work for you at times, and against you as well. It sounds elementary, but diet (high in vegetable fiber) and at least 30 minutes of brisk walking per day, helps a lot. I eat 5-6 small meals per day, consisting of lean protein and complex carbs. It works for me, not easy by any means, but I feel better and it helps keep Levoxyl symptoms at bay. Surf the web for more information and sites like this. There are also books you can read as well to educate yourself. If you work on it, you can feel better. I promise!

I was feeling so bad for so long. I saw the endocronologist who said my thyroid level was at 1000!! VERY bad! She put me on this medication at 25 mi per day. I set my phone alarm for 5 am. get up, take the pill, and then go back to sleep until its time to get the kids up for school. By the time all is said and done, the appropriate amt of time has passed and I am able to eat breakfast with the little ones who stay home with me. I have not noticed anymore hair falling out, which is a problem I was having prior to the meds. I go to the gym every single day and have lost 16 lbs since December 1st. I watch what I eat, I exercise (cardio) and lift weights daily, plus I get out more with my kids to the park. Before this, I did NOTHING! I do notice that I feel a little achy in the mornings. Its a little harder to get out of bed and get myself going. I still feel tired in the mornings, like I havent quite rested enough, so Im hoping that gets better. Overall, I havent experienced any bad side affects so far. God willing, it helps and does its job and my goiter shrinks and it relieves the symptoms of the Hashimotos disease I was diagnosed with. I finally had an explanation as to why, even when I was thin, I sweat like I ran a marathon no matter what I was doing! lol

Underactive Thyroid	Sugar, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	10/5/2009 10:15:40 PM	Have been taking for 3 years.  Started at 25, 50 to 75mg now.  My arms stopped hurting at this dose.  I take omega fish oil with vitamin D and Calcium with minerals.  I take the  thryroid drug at first wake up and take a shower, this really made a big difference for me. Hair loss was alot at first, but may have had reason of both parents passing away the same time I was diagnosed (stress related) I use Nexium shampoo #4 and conditioner.  My hairdresser was smart to recommend it.  I love it.  My hair is now stable.  Just a few strands here and there.  As for weight, I go to weight watchers.  You really need to eat like the fifties.  Nowadays they plastered our diet with pizza, pasta and breads and donuts, pepperoni, creamy soups, cookies, candy, chocolate.  You get the picture.  I lost 20 lbs in 2 years.  Yes, very slow, but I have kept it off. Once you give up sugary foods, and eat vegetables plentifully, when you do eat a sweet you used to, its awful! I grab an apple pronto!  Diet is very important with any medication.  Supplements should be a way of life.  I love purity products, they auto deliver so I never run out.  Work with your doctor, find one who pays attention to your well being overall, not just one organ.  Stay educated.  Above all, keep a positive attitude.  This keeps your cells balanced.

I have been feeling bad feeling anxious and depressed (tired) loosing more hair and weight gain. I had my blood work done about 4 months ago but my Dr says it all looks normal..Im seeing a diet Dr for my weight gain and taking meds and vitamin B-shots and other type of shoot that helps flush out fat deposits stored in the liver. I feel much better but still have a few side effects @ this time Im thinking in seeing a Endocrinologist, for this issue I think I need a diffrent dose?

At first is was good and I could tell a difference but lately I have been extremely tired and confused. I am going to have my levels checked soon and I am even thinking about requesting another drug. I haven't had any of the sweating or hair lose that others have talked about but my engery level has hit rock bottom. This is one of the most frustrating conditions out there when nothing seems to help. I am also on Lexapro for depression, and my weight just keeps going up even though I eat right and exercise several times a week.

In 2005 after birth of son was diagnosed with post partum thyroiditis. Dr also thought I had depression and tried to put me on a drug for my thyroid condition and another for depression. That was a mistake. Rule of thumb is test one thing at a time so you can know what to attribute side effects to. The Levoxyl (44mcg) has been working great. I finally can play ultimate frisbee again and run, etc. But it took a lot of convincing the doctor that it wasn't depression. I knew in my heart that I was a happy, but frustrated person. My advice is foremost rely on how you feel as determinant (not labs), eat well (small amts frequently), exercise (which should help with sleep), try to reduce stress in your life. Take a multivitamin (but not at same time as Levoxyl or Cytomel), find an online support group.

Cancer of Thyroid	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	6/5/2009 12:06:21 AM	I had thyroid cancer and my thyroid was completely removed.  I started on the generic right after surgery and for 4 months I felt like an 80 yr old woman. I took naps and had no energy whatsoever.  My sister kept telling me to switch to Levoxyl and so my doctor prescribed it for me and I have been taking it for about 2 months now and I feel so GOOD!!! I have energy, I am losing the weight I gained while I was taking the generic.  When I went to the drugstore to fill the Rx the first time they tried to sell me the generic and I had a bit of an argument with the Pharm Tech trying to tell her I didnt care that the name brand drug cost more, I was tired of being tired and fat!!!  Not all drug stores carry the name brand, sometimes you have to drive to another store, but I will never go back to ANY generic again!!!

Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	5/1/2009 8:32:36 PM	I was diagnosed with hypothyroid in early 2007.  I had a child in September of 2006...apparently I hap probably had hypothyroid since then because my endocrinologist said my levels were the worst she had ever seen!  I think 400 or 500!  Horrible.  My symptoms were very severe by the time I saw the doctor...I didn't know there was a proble for so long becuase since I had my daughter I just figured the tiredness and such were due to just being a new mom with an infant!  I had severe muscle cramps in my legs but felt very achy all over my body.  I was snoring badly because my thyroid was so enlarged, and I couldn't even walk more then maybe 20 seconds without being tired as if I had run a marathon..I literally felt like an old woman or something!  I started at 50 mcgs of levoxyl then 1oo then 150...been at 150 for the most part.  I feel much better than when I was diagnosed, but I still feel tired more than I used to before the hypothryoid...and when I wake up sometimes I feel achy for about 30 minutes or so.  Also sometimes I get really shaky as if my blood sugar is very low.  I was checked for diabetes just to make sure but thankfully negative.  I hate that you have to wait 30 min. to an hour before eating, because I have always been ready to eat first thing in the morning.  And I have to take a vit. D pill but it's inconvenient not to take them at the same time...I'm a busy girl with a child and I am VERY bad about remembering to take my pills.  Gotta get better at that.  I have gained about 20 lbs. since developing hypothyroid, but I really haven't made a good effort to try to get it off so we'll see how that goes...all in all hypothyroid is the sucky part and the med. is just the added bonus! =(

Though I've been on this medicine for almost a year, this past month I have been experiencing bothersome symptoms that might have been related to being on too high of a dose.  The serious symptoms I have been experiencing were shaky hands, light-headedness, fast heartbeat, and anxiety. I am also taking Vyvanse for treatment of ADHD and mixing the two drugs together with the negative side effects I developed made them worse. It does take a while for tremors and high pulse rates to go back to normal so I'll still have shaky hands for a few weeks. Otherwise I've had no problems with this medication until recently.

I eat less than my 5 year old grandson. I do not eat snacks and I drink alot of water. I wish someone else could tell me if they have this same problem and if they found a way to change this, I have gained 55 lbs in the last 6 months, if you have had this problem and found away to lessen this please let me know.

I need blood tests every 6 months because my levels fluctuate since I've been dieting and lost some weight. My endocrin. says for every 15 lbs of weight gain/loss a blood test should be done. Lately, I've been feeling sluggish and cold, and no weight loss for a few months...an indication to me that I should have my levels checked....

I was put on tapazole and had a very serious reaction to it after only 4 days! The first dr told me I HAD to have surgery but being 21 I said no way and went for a second opinion. That dr did a radioactive iodine treatment in Nov of 06 and within a month I went to hypo( its supposed to take up to 10 years before it does that!) I was put on levoxyl and have stayed stead since then. I cant stop gaining weight and no matter what I do it doesnt stop. I am still ALWAYS tired, and still have hair loss. Just recently have been getting an almost like indigestion feeling, but its at the top of my throat not where indigestion should be. I am due to go back to the drs soon so hopefully something will be changed by then!

Very rapid heartbeat and a very paranoid feeling. This was just after 5 tabletsI recently visited a new endo and he changed me to Levoxyl and I have not had any side effects.

I'm over weight and I think I've gained about 10 lbs.  The Doctor I'm seeing got me up to .85mcg.  I felt really good then.  My blood test results indicated that I needed to reduce the dosage.  Now I don't feel quite as good but still better than before. I hope this helps at lease one person.

Everything seemed to be in a fog, thinking and memory.The leg cramps would have me in tears. Now I have energy. No leg cramps. Thinking and reading is clear.

Cancer suppression necessitates careful dosing, and regular labs a must, but this drug works for me and my endo in our goal to keep cancer at bay while providing good quality of life w/no Thyroid.

Underactive Thyroid	TeacherGirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/2/2007 12:46:03 AM	I am 26 years old.  A year ago I was diagnosed with sub-clinical hypothyroidism, so we began treatment.  I started with 25 mcg, moved to 50, 62.5 and am now on 75mcg.  I like the tablets because they are easy to split (hence the 62.5) and the different dosage levels are different colors.  That way when I increase my dose, I don't get the tablets confused.  I've read some reviews with people who say they haven't had any effects or say they started sweating.  In the first case, the individual likely needed a higher dose.  In the later, the individual was likely on a bit too much.  Some people are more sensitive to changes in thyroid supplements than others.  I know I am.  I am also diagnosed with anxiety, which makes me all the more prone to feeling more nervous etc when the thyroid medication is a bit too high.  Although I may be able to feel the negative side effects of increasing my dose rather quickly, the positive ones seem to be much slower.  Which makes sense, since you have to wait 6 - 12 weeks before blood tests will reflect a difference in TSH/T3 levels.  Also, the fact that I've had to up the dose doesn't mean it hasn't worked, it means my thyroid is still degenerating (not producing enough T3).  It's not meant to stop the problem, it's meant to counteract the negative effects.  Hope this helps everyone.  
Other	Deb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/27/2007 1:24:58 AM	I have been on Levoxyl for the past 10 years after having been diagnosed with Graves Disease (Hyperthyroidism)  I have never had any major difficulty with the RX, after many blood tests and the balancing act of trying different levels .112 level works best for me. I am 45 and weigh 120lbs at 5'4 and no longer 98 lbs due to the Hyperthyroidism. After leaving one Dr and having to find another I was off of my Rx for 3 months I became severely hypo, gained 45 lbs had vision problems my eyes had literally swelled shut with fluid my current Dr gave me 200mcg for 30 days at which time I urinated many many times a day the excess water retention which was the weight I was carrying at the time was literally flushed out of my system.  I am thankful everyday for not only this Rx but for a great Endocrinoligist. She literally saved my life.

Underactive Thyroid	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	9/20/2007 9:39:36 AM	Does anyone suffer from sweating?  I had been using 35 mcg and now I am on 50 mcg. I didn't put it together until recently but I am having sweating, especially my face and I think it is due to the increase in the meds.  Does anyone else have this?
