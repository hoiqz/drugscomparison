Loss of Appetite	mark, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	5	5	4	Male	25-34	9/18/2012 2:24:10 PM	I'm a 33yr, 5'10 male who has been rail thin my whole life.  I've lifted weights and taken practically every supplment and weight gain diet on the market.  I heard about Periactin and gave it a try.  It has worked wonders.  I've put on over 30 lbs in about 4 months.  It's not that all of a sudden I was just eating everything; it's more like I just notice that I eat bigger and bigger portions.  For anyone looking to put on weight, I would highly recommend this drug.  It does make your really tired though.

My doctor prescribed Periactin to be taken before each meal and my appetite returned with a vengeance and everything I ate tasted so much better.
Loss of Appetite	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	11/4/2011 6:09:32 AM	When I was in school I was not eating or sleeping due to stress from family, school and work.I told my doctor that I didn't want to take depression med so he gave me this pill and it really worked. The first couple of weeks all I did was sleep and eat but once my body got used to the medication I didnt get as tired easily. I gained 7 pounds in a week which is amazing for me because it is very hard for me to gain weight. I would advise that you take this pill with a meal because when you sleep it makes you have stomach pains once you wake up.

I recently took him to a new dr because his old dr would not help and was not concerned about the weight loss. When I got to the dr she told me he was really thin. I explained to her what was going on and she told me she was going to give him periactin and to give it every night before bed. That night I started giving it to him and the next morning he was saying mommy I am so hungry. The periactin has helped him get his appetite back and my little boy is finally eating again. If it was not for this dr and for this medician my little boy would still not be eating. This medician is great.

Her doctor put her on this medicine, and it has worked well! The only drawback is, she has noticed that her appetite has increased. She still feels hungry after she has eaten. We are going to talk to the doctor more about this. Overall, the medicine is great!

It worked fabulously. My sex drive returned to its normal level. I was told that it was going to make me sleepy and it didn't. I suppose in comparison to my other meds the sedation seemed extremely mild.

Other	Concerned Mom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	6/27/2008 8:54:37 AM	Hi, Thanks for all of the other reviews, very helpful.  My normally very healthy 8-year old daughter has been suffering from severe headaches over the past 9 months where she has missed alot of school or either is non-functioning at school/home because of headaches.  After on-going doctor visits and neurology consultations, she was diagnosed with migraines and prescribed periactin.  The headaches have improved tremendously, from having them every day to almost non-existent.  I am really happy that she is getting back to a normal state of being healthy and to enjoy life as a kid.  However, she has gained 23 pounds over the course of 3 months since on this medication, so I will be talking with her neurologist about another alternative.

After 8 years of torture, I  tried this and I am astonished.  I was having a bad episode; 5-6 headaches per week.  I was at 3 days in a row of waking up in the middle of the night with a headache when I started on this medicine.  I cannot stress enough the night and day difference this medicine made.  I have been headache free ever since.  It's like a switch was just turned off.  I know it sounds unbelievable, and before I tried it I would have sworn that nothing could cure my cluster headaches.  Migraine treatments were taking too long to work, and by the time they did, the headache was usually gone.  My headaches were only lasting about an hour apiece.  If you suffer from cluster headaches, give it a try.  Believe me, I have been there and, like you, I would rather do many unmentionably unpleasant things than to have more headaches.  For me, the Periactin was a true miracle.  Again, just amazing.  I know it sounds like it, but I am not a drug rep or anything like that.  Just a guy who this medicine has worked for.

After years of suffering and every treatment and test you can imagine, he is able to function normally. We think it still needs to be increased but he isn't missing school anymore.
