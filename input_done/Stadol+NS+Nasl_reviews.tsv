I don't know what their problem is when it has given me back my life from the agony and pain of migraines.  I have to take phenegran for nausea and fioricet helps it work quicker and lasts longer.  Keep looking until you find a real Dr. willing to prescrible what wil;l work for you.  Best of Luck and God Bless.

I would even pay full price because the relief I get is worth it
Migraine Headache	khurstTN, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/27/2011 11:04:56 AM	I have been using the generic form of Stadol for 2 plus years and find it to be very effective...But as alot of other reviewers state its hard to get it to last longer than a week and you get attitude from the pharmacy when you go to refill after only a week, my ins. only pays for 2 bottles a mo. so I end up paying full price for 2 more bottles a mo. at $46.50 each but is well worth it! I do not crave this med but have cronic migraines daily. When I first used it I had to lay down for about 30 min. but now I can spray and be up with in 10-15 min. and function. Good luck to all mirgraine suffers as I have had to search about a year to find a good neuro Dr.

Migraine Headache	JJLScotty, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	3/30/2011 4:09:16 PM	I have been using Stadol for 10 years. I have Severe Migraines sometime to where I can't move any part of my body with out triggering the pain to get worse. Stadol Helps me to relax when this occurs. I been like this from 7 years old up. I'm 40 now. Stadol is also ,what I think is good for someone with meningitis because I have had it 5 times in my life when I was younger. An after that had the same problem when I got older. But, with stadol it does flush everything thats bad in your system out. An when it numbs your head and take the pain away , gives your body time to fight the problem. It's the best medication I've ever had.
Pain	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	45-54	9/18/2010 12:04:13 AM	Several years ago I had a herniated Disc that severely affected the sciatic nerve to my left leg that was so painful that it was the worst pain I had been in since I was shot in the leg during my years in the army back in 1978.My doctor back then gave me Stadol to try and control the pain until I was able to have surgery. The down side to this drug was that it was only effective for a few hours and when it wore off my pain would increase ten fold and I would have to take more of it to try and control the pain.My doctor did not get me to the surgeon for about two months and as a result of that I was taking three times the dose to try and relieve the pain I was in. towards the last 2 weeks before surgery my doctor cut me off of the drug telling me that I was abusing this drug and that I should not need that much.  When I asked him if he had ever had a herniated disc that affected the sciatic nerve he told me no.  I ended up having to sue him for mistreatment and he was fired and lost his medical licence.If you use this drug use caution.
Pain	tp, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/5/2010 1:55:29 PM	I have been taking this spray almost eight years for migraines and trigeminal nueralgia. It truly has helped me with my pain. As long as it is used as prescibed, it has been safe for me.  It is a blessing as I used to be in the ER way more than I am now.  I do find it challenge to keep it primed and not lose some dosages as it is expensive.  Each year I have to have it approved by insurance to receive what the doctor orders.  It truly has saved my life as the pain was excruciating and it gives me hope I can make it with the pain.   
Pain	biggiek47, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/3/2010 7:01:42 PM	i used this medication for about 4 years for pain and migraines it worked great! but this is a very highly addictive medication and if you suddenly stop using it withdrawl is severe! you wont find anything stronger out there for pain so if your doctor isnt planning on keeping you on this medication forever dont start using it at all. 
Migraine Headache	gingin22, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	4/28/2010 7:37:56 PM	Been using stadol for almost 2 years and it has been very effective. Bottle is very small only has 10 sprays in a bottle and my insurance will only allow 2 bottles every 10 days and my copay is $35.00 each time so it is costing me over $100.00 per month. They say the FDA won't approve any more than that dosage no matter what the dr writes on the script. But if you suffer from bad headaches I suggest you try this if you can afford it because it does work very quickly. Within 10 min the headache is gone. At first you may not like it because it knocked me out the first few times but now I can use it even while I am at work with no problem. Also even if the dr says to use one spray in each nostril at the same time I would only spray in one nostril. 2 sprays is too much at once and you will run out very quickly. I try to not use a whole squirt to stretch it out for more than 10 sprays.

Within one try, my migraine was gone! My only complaint, is that there is not much med. in the bottle, and my doc will only pescribe one bottle a month. I have 3 or 4 migraines a WEEK. I need more prescribed a month

Demeral is effective as well but takes much longer to work. When I get headaches my blood pressure rises very quickly so Stadol works great for me. I try not to use full sprays, so does anyone know how many sprays are in a bottle? I'm having problems getting ins. to pay for what i need

But for the last several years I can only get the generic the original is no longer offered where I live.  The generic has less effectiveness and more side effects.  With the original no side effects.  The vials are small and the price is very high.  But it is worth a try. Nothing beats the original.

Got rid of my migraines like nothing else. My only warning is only use it as the Dr recommends as it is one of the most addictive meds out there due to the ease of use. I know this because I am now under treatment for addiction to this drug.

Not something I would want to use every time but on occassion would be okay. The only weird feeling I had it was as if I was paralyzed &amp; couldn't move, I could think clearly and knew what was going on around me but it was like I was helpless and couldn't do anything about it.

This seems to work the best of them all.I get relief almost immediately and rest very well. It keeps me from going to the ER when it's severe. However I don't want to become dependent on it.

I have chronic back pain from industrial accident. When my doc prescribed Stadol NS it was a very great relief.I have been using it for ten years or so. The same dose for all that time. With my allergies I do not know what I would do. My quality of life would be poor at best. I am medically retired from my injury. I am lucky I don't have to pay for it myself as it is very expensive. However better pricing after  the patent run out. About 1/4 less in cost. I have used it for post surgery and for post dental surgery pain control. It works quickly.

Problem is they hit from 2-5x a week. No pill has yet to REALLY help.Fiorcet causes rebounds,you all know the story. However, Stadol Is a god send. I've only used the spray,but it works. The problem is after losing job(ins.),it's 65.00 a bottle. There's about 10 sprays max,so really a weeks supply?I hate the fact of how you get treated at Pharmacy's if you take this enough. It's rude and kinda hurts? Does anybody else ever deal with problematic pharmicies? Or Doctors? It all breaks down to the fact that they are not in our shoes. Good luck All! Craig

It ends up that if I didn't take the stadol, I would have to go to the doctors or hospital for a shot for the nausea.  Once I start vomiting, I can't stop.  I take the stadol and lay down and within 10 minutes my headache is gone.

It is a life-saver.  I have found it also takes care of restless leg syndrome, abdominal pain, insomnia, arthritus pain, cough and discomfort from colds and flu etc. I agree that the bottle is way too small and the pharmacies always think it should last a month when you are lucky if it lasts a couple days when you are in pain. The trick is to have the doctor prescribe several bottles at once, I get 8 to 10 bottles for a month all at the same time, that also gives you only one co-pay for the whole thing. It is difficult to find a doctor to prescribe it as they sometimes think it is only for  migraines, and some think it is too dangerous, some think it is old fashioned and that there are new drugs out there that are better. The problem is with the new drugs is that they are only for one thing and this covers many different problems.  I love it as it causes no side-effects, no &quot;next morning&quot; druggy feelings and it works quickly.  Try it you will find it works better than anything else you have tried. Do be careful not to overdose as it has been known to be fatal and you do build up a resistance and need more over time.

Migraine Headache	bawl1975, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/7/2009 8:40:52 PM	This medication works for my severe migraines when nothing else does.  It does make me groggy, so it is not something I can take when I am taking care of my kids, but when I have a chance to lie down this works well at easing the pain and helping me to rest.  I think the taste is a little odd but not terrible.  I agree though that the bottle is so small and there are about 12 sprays.  My dr. told me to take one spray at onset of headache, another an hour later, and then one spray every 3-4 hours as needed.  So one of these vials really only lasts me through one of my &quot;doozy&quot; headaches which can last 24-48 hours.  Insurance will only pay for it every 30 days.  However, my pharmacy considers it a 10 day supply, so they will fill it in 10 days but I have to pay full price which is around $60.  But if you have a terrible migraine $60 seems worth it.  I have tried diluting it but I find then you just have to use twice as much so that doesn't really help.  But overall it is a good medication, particuarly if you have nausea or vomitting with your migraines and can't keep down medications in pill form.

Migraine Headache	Cainmisty, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	11/1/2008 10:44:19 AM	I have been using this medication for about 2 years. One bottle per month was first prescribed then I found that it would not last as I would get migraines 2-3 times per week. My Dr. prescribed two bottles per month and it would last about 5 1/2 weeks. Recently the pharmacy stated that I could only fill one bottle per month even though it was not what the Dr. prescribed? On my last refill my husband asked the pharmisist if there were long term side effects and he was told that it could cause seizures, and destroy the lining of the nasal cavities like cocaine. I think I will ask the Dr. to change it to something else at my next visit. Although I cant take triptans or other anti-inflamitory meds due to a bad reaction to triptans and ulcers. Not sure whats left to try???
Other	lmsala, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	10/20/2008 12:15:17 AM	I began using Stadol NS for the past couple months for severe burning type headaches that will last for days (I usually will have this atleast 5 days a week or more) I also have been in a state of exacerbation of a recent MS flair up that has been quite stubborn. This is perhaps the only medication at the moment that brings any relief for my constant discomfort. I would highly recommend it if you've tried evereything else. My only disappointment with it is that it comes in such a small bottle and I can usually get a good 12-15 sprays out of it. That only means that 1 bottle just might last a week, 2 would be better, but the pharmacy for some reason only thinks a bottle should last like a full month supply which is impossible. The math doesn't add up and then you end up feeling weird to question them on it!!  This is truly a helpful medication and get rid of my pain quickly although I would never take this if I was at work or needed to be doing anything that required my full attention. It is just a good medication to end severe head and body pain quickly and relax

It has been a god-send and let me slip into some much needed pain-free sleep, until the pain subsides. i agree to start with only one spray and wait at least 30 minutes as sometimes the spray can get caught up in the mucus in your nose. i am having a hard time now finding it, any suggestions?

I work for a trucking company and sometimes the fumes from the shop trigger the headaches. And I have a very high stress life. My migraines have been classed at classic migraines. And I can have 2or 3 headaches a week and they can last for hours or up to 2 days at a time. I am so glad that my Dr. order this drug for me

Migraine Headache	audchild, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/15/2007 8:54:55 AM	I have been using this medication for 17 years...since 1990, when it was brand new.  Back then I was suffering through horrible migraines almost daily.  I told my doctor that we had to do something because I was not willing to live the rest of my life in that kind of pain.  Stadol was my Godsend!  I cannot use immitrex, or other ergot-like drugs because I have vascular disease.  Stadol saved my life.  Over the years I have found that, if you use it too often you will have rebound headaches that are as bad or worse than the original migraines.  But, through work with a really good doctor and neurologist, I have learned how to use this drug for maximum relief and minimum consumption.  It still knocks out my headaches and allows me to continue working.  It works in about 7 minutes flat and the dizziness that comes with using 2 initial sprays only lasts a couple of minutes, so I can use it during a 15 minute break and be fine by the time I have to return to work.  It has saved my life, my career and my sanity!  If you've had a bad experience with this medication, speak to a doctor or pharmacist.  Chances are, you did something wrong...not the medication.  Or, maybe your pain is not severe enough for this med.  If you take it when you're not in severe pain, you're asking for trouble.
Migraine Headache	gannongal, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	11/9/2007 12:31:58 AM	My doctor told me to start off with two sprays I had really bad migraines very often, the first time I used it I was at a convention and went from a sitting position to having to move out to my car where I passed out. I have a really high tolerance to medications but this one was an exception. I never used it again after that. I was afraid too. When you wake up in a parking lot and it is dark and don't remember how you got there you'd be scared to so don't do this for the first time if your at work or in a public place make sure your at home. Just my opinion. It certainly did get rid of my pain

The only draw backs to Stadol Nasal Spray are... 1. the taste is absolutely HORRIBLE!!! 2. It is such a &quot;tiny&quot; amount in the bottle, so it doesn't last long enough when you have migraines almost daily!!! But,  I can deal with the taste as it is the ONLY med. that works for my migraines!!! To make it last a little longer for me I add plain &quot;Saline Nasal Spray&quot; to it, up to the top of the label on the bottle &amp; shake it. It is diluted to about 1/2 the normal strength, but it lasts longer. It still works very well for me. It also helps with my aches &amp; pains which is a BIG plus when you hurt all the time!!! It is a &quot;Narc&quot; so it's restricted in how often you can refill it, as they say it's similar to morphine &amp; is supposed to be addictive. I can honestly say that if my headache is NOT a migraine, I do not NEED it or use it. I just take my Fiorinal capsules, which help my regular headaches pretty good. And when I have a migraine believe me I am desperate for relief from my head exploding &amp; then I &quot;do&quot; want to use the Stadol spray, I do NOT &quot;CRAVE&quot; it or anything. But I don't think I am easily addicted to any of my meds.  *If my Dr. could find me something as effective or better for my migraines I'd use it. We have tried other meds, but Stadol Nasal Spray is THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS FOR ME!!! IT IS THE BEST!!! Hope this helps. &lt;:-)

Normal treatments for migraine do not work for me.
