Which in my opinion is the beauty of this drug, it keeps you accountable to your weight loss goal! :) good luck everyone! The first time i took it i lost 35 lbs in 4 months. i had a baby 18 months ago and i am going to go back on it to lose the baby weight.

You can't expect to lose weight if you're not eating healthy and/or exercising. I learned this the hard way. My first time using Xenical, I wasted lots of $ and barely lost 4lbs, and had many, many accidents. My second time around, I was COMMITTED to following the instructions because I wanted REAL results and NO ACCIDENTS! After 3 mths, I lost 38 lbs; 77 by 7 mths, and NO accidents. YOU TOO CAN LOSE THE WEIGHT! But you HAVE to be COMMITTED to a low-calorie diet, execercise and leave the snacking binges alone! Here's a tip: drink lots of water or flavored water, eat more fruits and vegetables and have one cheat day (I pick Saturday because I have out with family &amp; friends). This way you don't feel as if your depriving yourself from the foods you love and miss. Just don't over do it, or you'll have one major accident. Best of luck to you all!!!

I'm 21 years young &amp; I should have been living my life to the fullest. Weight always held me back from doing just that. Until I tried this, and at first I was sketchy on what made it so different than any other diet pill. Then I found out. I had energy all day long, while loosing weight, it made me feel great. Never had I had an experience like that. I would recommend this to future diet weight loss seekers!

I switched to a mainly vegetarian diet, only baked or grilled chicken , eliminated all soda. I counted only fat grams and kept them under 10 per day. I lost 85 pounds by May 2010. My son hardly recognized me, he went to Marine boot camp in January and I went to Fat camp and it was worth it when he saw me at graduation. I never exercised because I live in the Midwest and the weather was awful however I plan to start to lose the last 30- 40lbs. I will have gone from a size 20 to a size 8. If you don't lose you don't know how to.

The negative side effects are enough to deter probably anyone for overeating.  I did experience a mild headache and had to leave med off for at least a day from time to time.

Each time I find myself looking at food which has a high fat contect I remind myself of the negative side effects in terms of oily spotting and difficult toiletting and so it is acting as a psychological gastric band!!  Brilliant drug if you are able to resist fatty foods and respond well to the worry of symptoms.  I am hoping to lose three and a half stone in six months will udate at a later date - am keeping a blog under billiebimbo at open university if you want follow xx

YES IT IS REALLY EXPENSIVE, BUT FOR ME TO SPEND TO GAIN SATISFACTION AND SELF CONFIDENCEthat more value to it rather waste it on gimmicks and vices... I think the effectiveness varies because some people just depend on it. YOU WON'T LOOSE WEIGHT BY DOING NOTHING AT ALL AND JUST TAKE XENICAL. UNLESS YOU STARVED YOURSELF. it is just actually a good companion helping you eliminate fat and always remind you to always have a low fat diet. FOR OIL LEAKS, i use sanitary napkin to prevent stains. it would just take a little effort and the medication would do the rest for you. THAT'S HOW XENICAL IS EFFECTIVE. BEST VALUE FOR YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.

Also, ordering &quot;special&quot; meals with clients may make they think you have a problem with something, and it takes away from your sales activity during a dinner conversation.

Though she did loose a lot of weight fast, she did so in a completely unhealthy way. She really rarely feels hungry and her lack of hunger causes her to become so weak she literally collapses sometimes just from walking around the house.

Also the drug is extreamly expensive.Suits a person with a lot of money, who has the convienience of their own toilet! This would be the ideal drug.

Only problem is oil stool and leaking especially when you eat high fat foods. Of course you begin to learn what is high fat content and not which trains you to eat better. Also my cholestral number went down. This drug is only one I lost weight on however the downside is the loose bowels, gas, etc that you may have.

I am very lucky in that Ido not have too much weight to lose (I would like to go from 10 stone 5 lbs to about 9 stone) although up until now I have found it very difficult to lose any as I can't keep away from chocolate! Anyhow, I have lost 5lbs with Xenical in my first week of a reduced calorie diet (of about 12-1400 calories a day) and I am keeeping away from nearly all fatty foods as i am terrified of the side effects!!  Xenical is certainly working in that I have had no chocolate for a week, I have a lot of energy and I am feeling great. I will keep taking it until I am down to my target weight (and I will let you know in a few weeks how I have got on!) Good luck fellow dieters :)

I started the drug in February 2007 and I was just released from the hospital yestruday. Where I had been treated with acute pancreatitiis. This is an EXTREMELY painful condition my PA and I never discussed. I Have to go back and see her October 5 2007. I lost only 20lbs since February. I had no idea this acute condition could occur, it was explained as a good drug to help me lose weight because my PCP would not do anything to help me with my morbid obeseity. He showed up when I was brought to the E.R. on tuesday morning, with severe chest &amp; LUQ pain that radiated into my left-side heart,back and neck. His remark to the nurses was I needed bariatric surgery not drugs to help with the weight lose. Had he talked to my insurance company and said that to them I wouldn't had to go to someone else for help with my weight.So now what are the damages to my body?? No one can seem to tell me...What a surprize!!! So where do I go from here, what's next for my health and what other problems are ahead for me after having this acute condition???I'm 45 hispanic female prenursing student,EMT-I, which I may have to cut short because of this hospitalization. I was hospitalized for the last 4 days with out having anything to eat or drink just an IV with antibiotics.
