A type of Parasitic Infection - Babesiosis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/14/2012 11:45:28 AM	While the form of medication is odd (bright yellow, thick liquid, odd taste) it is easy to measure, and take.  Taste isn't too bad, and best to take with food, so that helps &quot;chase&quot; it.  I've had one bout of nausea/vomit after 6 weeks of tx.  Not sure exact effectiveness since I'm on multiple meds plus meds for Lyme: Azithromiacin, Cryptolepis oil, fish oil, pro-biotics, vitamin D... but since starting these treatments I'm feeling much better, much more energetic.  Recently I've been finding throat tightening up into roof of mouth, ear and head which I thought related to work stress, however, I just found out this is one of the potential side effects, as are anxiety and sleep difficulty (experiencing all, thought to be related to work stress, but not my typical reaction to stress).  I'm very impressed by the price of the medication: $2,400, but thanks to my insurance coverage, I paid 25$ for a month supply (twice daily teaspoon).  Now this yellow liquid seems more like precious gold to me.

I would much rather take a pill than to have to take a liquid form! It is like trying to swallow thick flourescent yellow paint.

Much more convenient [and less expensive] than 5 ml packets.

However, it's easy to take.  Only thrown up once after taking it.  Has given me a little bit more energy.

Be sure to know what the side effects are and be on the look out for even small changes before they get too severe.
