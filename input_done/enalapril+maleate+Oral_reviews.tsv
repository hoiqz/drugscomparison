High Blood Pressure	Mary, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	65-74	6/6/2011 3:22:12 PM	I have been taking about 1 mo. I am on 20MG twice a day--Seems like a high dosage.  EXTREME FATIGUE AND EXHAUSTION. Wake up tired-go to bed tired, and try and work in between.   I plan to discuss with Dr. this week.  I have been on this med before, but not very long and not with these issues.  Also, I experience slight dizziness and pressure in head.  It's like I have been up about 14 hours and had only 2-3 hours of sleep.  I also urinate about every 2-3 hrs. at nite, which causes sleep interruption.  I also drink a lot of water; therefore may lie the explanation of getting up a lot at night.  When under stress, the medication doesn't seem to help very much.  My BP is still high-like 154/95.  I have tried several medicines and will keep hoping I'll find one that works for me.

There have been no changes in diet, employment, housing, family, stress or anything else...except that I started taking enalapril. Otherwise it's great, but I just can't take the acid reflux. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I will be asking to change meds next appointment.

I will give it 2 mo. to be effective, if not I will switch back to the brand name.  The mfg. of this will not even talk of price reduction after talking to them. Luckily I am able to afford this drug, but when Medicare or other companies make you pay over $300.00 for 60 pill (1 mo. worth), you have to question their belief in this product. Take other pills for H.B. also in conjuction with this to make sure my blood pressure is within the normal standards, but it is hard.  Why so much $ for these pills when they have been on the market for over 25 years?  Are they more concerned with their product or with the consumer with an inherited disease that needs treatment.  Again will try this for 2 mo. and hopefully it will do what it says-lower ones high blood pressure.

He's been taking it for a week and while it has significantly d/c his diastolic, his systolic is still borderline...great reading here that it takes a few weeks for the med to be effective. His Dr told him it would lower his bp within the first week (!)He's experiencing nausea and fatigue since he's been taking this-I saw that it was listed as a common side effect.  Anyone else feeling like this? Any hints on what he can do diff to help d/c the side effects? I was thinking that he could take it at night--the pharmacist said that it's important to take at the same time each day but that it didn't matter what time of day.Anyone taking it at night to d/c the amount of side effects felt during the day?Any info would be greatly appreciated!

Was on Lisinopril oral,lowered blood pressure, but started the cry cough, then into wet cough. Stopped taking the Lisin. Went to Atacand, too expensive for me even with insurance. Onto Carvedilol 6.25. Didn't like this at all, caused what I call &quot;scalp pain&quot;. Came to find out, this is caused by blood pressure droping. Carvedilol also caused my blood sugar drop. Now am back to the family of Lisinopril, am curious to see if Enalapril causes the same problem with coughing.

It drove me crazy.  Dr. lowered dose but still had palpitations. Now looking for another med.
Other	lindiloo22, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	45-54	4/14/2009 2:32:44 PM	I have hypothyroidism. I started taking this medication over a month ago. I was the lowest dose and at my dr. doubled my meds after only 4 weeks. It keeps my bp down. I had headaches in the beginning the first few days but I heard if you drink more water and get more excercise it would go away. I feel great now. I have pressure in my chest when I forget to take it. It goes away in about an hour after I take it.
Other	qhmamma, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	55-64	4/13/2009 2:54:06 PM	Dr. said I had a &quot;possible tendency to develop high BP sometime in future&quot; so prescribed Enalapril 2.5 as &quot;preventative&quot;. After taking this for a few weeks, I developed pain in joints, dry cough and my BP - which has ALWAYS BEEN LOW TO BEGIN WITH - dropped to 102/68. I have STOPPED taking this, as it seems unnecessary medication for me. NO ONE in my family, nor I, have ever suffered from high BP. I am 62. I think the Doc is just a pill-pusher.

High Blood Pressure	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Male	45-54	1/27/2009 9:44:38 PM	I am a truck driver, normally driving 1500 to 2000 miles a week. After starting to take the medication, I have developed severe pain in my knees. This is one of the infrequent side effects of taking this medication. It is said that this side effect does not occur to all who take the medication, but from experience, I can say that it does happen, and it is a very painful side effect.

It has helped greatly reduce the stress he had on his kidneys and heart due to the High Bp. He still has a bicuspidal aortic valve but the enalapril has shown no effect on it.
High Blood Pressure	wwilsontyle, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	45-54	1/13/2008 2:32:33 PM	After taking Enalapril 20 mg once a day for about three years after being switched from another Ace inhibior, due to the dry non-productive cough, my doctor increased my doage to one 20 mg. twice a day.  About two to three months later I began to experience terrible flatulence, but worse of all I hada change in my bowels and consequently changed my diet to include more fiber without over doing it.  The situation got increasingly worse and I was not getting anyhelp from my primary care physician who suggested with scare tactics that I needed to eliminated the possibility of cancer, which OF COURSE I did almost immediately.On two separate occasions-one before the colonoscopy and one post, I stopped takingthe Enalapril, then the anti-inflammatory(prescribed after the colonoscopy).  On bothoccasions there was a marked difference.  The second time I remained off Enalapril and all the mucosa and fecal incontinencedisappeared until I started another medication in the ARB category.  Needless to say I did not take it for too long; maybe six weeks before my bowels began to go for five to six days with no movement.Prior to the original malfunction mani-festation, my bowels would always move thoroughly at least every other day, andsometimes two to three times a day.  I would NEVER go five days without a movement.  Now, as a I am writing about it in hope of helping another poor soul, I see why so many adult diapers are on the market.  Dr. William Prather wrote the article on a study of Enalapril at HarvardMedical School that gave me the courage toquit the blood pressure medication, but myblood pressure is far, far from normal EVERY DAY. And I have to say that I feel better that I can eliminate normally, but I know my blood pressure needs down from 170/90.  Is there any hope for me knowing that I can not tolerate Ace Inhibitors orARB's.  Please Help Me (before I suffer too much damage)  BJW

I take 10 mg daily and am 40 years old.  I have taken enalapril now for 6 months.I have experienced some side effects, such as mild headaches and some lightheadedness.  It is not terribly bothersome or frequent, so I don't have a problem continuing with this medication.  However, other people may have different experiences and side effects, if any.

It has been quite effective in reducing my blood pressure which was 180/70 and is now maintained around l40/70. With exercise, diet and weight loss it is working. I have frequent doctor visits. It has been frustrating but I have a very understanding doctor. I monitor my BP at home &amp; take the log sheets to  him for review. He has checked my BP monitor also.
