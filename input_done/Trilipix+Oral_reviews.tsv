I had no symptoms of any kind, so my physician increased the dosage last week.  I have been on the increased dosage for 6 days now and the muscle pain in my legs and lower back is intolerable.  I threw the medicine away.

It is aggravating when walking up stairs, but more so when descending.  I switched back to Tricor less than a year after starting Trilipix and the pain has lessened but is about 75% still there.  I suppose that I will have to live with this for the rest of my life.  I am 61 years old, male.

No problems swollowing, no pains. Long term, I hope this pill is my answer. My pharmacy has told me there is a generic &quot;senosibrate 134mg&quot;, you may want to look into this, more cost effective.

Previously on Tricor with no problems.  Well now, I have gallstones and am having liver problems.  My liver enzymes are too high now, which I am trying to convince my DR. is due to the Trilipix.  But he is doing all sorts of $$testing$$ etc, and now wants to do a liver biopsy.  I am going off this crap before I die from liver problems!

I exercise regularly and my HDL is 66 and LDL 105.  But my triglycerides have remained high @ 275.  I was getting hassled at work with our wellness program so I asked my doctor to try me on Trilipix.  After 3 months my Triglycerides are now normal and my total cholesterol is 190 (the lowest it has ever been) BUT my liver function tests are now abnormal for the first time ever.  My ALT and SGOT jumped from normal to 3 times what the highest level should be.  I have decided, I would rather have a high triglycerides rather than liver failure.  I am calling my physician on Monday and I am stopping the medication.

I havent noticed the achy muscles that I experienced with SimCor. However I am wondering if it is affecting my blood pressure. It has been controlled by medication for several years but has been elevated in the  past couple of weeks. I am wondering if anyone else has noticed this side effect with Trilipix?

I have tried I believe just about every drug to lower the cholestrol on the market this one was pretty new so gave it a try. Read several other reviews and the side effects late last night and called the drs office and told them I am not going to take this anymore, lets see if my bp will come down. Sometimes I just wonder if the meds are worth all the side effects. At this point I have stopped exercising and even taking a walk as it increased the bp so much. I will continue to eat my almonds or walnuts daily which I was told will help lower cholestrol and will hopefully be able to get back to excercising. I have about 10 more lbs to take off to reach my goal and think that will also help. I find myself concerned about all the side effects not only with this drug but so many others. I hope that the muscle aches, headache, nausea, elevated bp and whatever else will stop once this drug is out of my system. Good luck to everyone taking this.

Started have bad dreams and waking up thinking I was having a heart attack or stoke, real dizzy feelings, and muscle cramps in my legs.  Stopped taking the med and now things are back to normal except for the high colesterol.  Think that is better than the side effecks of this drug. Going back to Dr. and try something else.

Sore to the touch and sore to move.  I am 60 and want to do the right thing, but I have had to stop this drug out of fear of doing more harm than good.  I go tot eh Dr. next week and I am not taking it again.  Sore muscles, tired all the time, no energy and  having to pee day and night - all stopped when I stopped taking this damn pill.  I have never had such pain in my muscles before.  I hope we can find a good alternative.

THUS...The muscle &amp; bone pain &amp; cramps!!! My Dr. convinced me to &quot;look into&quot; Trilipix because he said it wasn't a statin &amp; had NO bad side effects!? BULL CLOVER!!! After reading all 76 reviews...there were only 14 good ones??? Also, all you asking if &quot;this or that&quot; is a side effect OR that your Dr says it's not?! THEY ARE!!! Muscle pain, cramps, nausea, acid reflux, sore throat, lethargy (tiredness/exhaustion), headaches...ALL TRILIPIX SIDE EFFECTS!!! NOW...After reading them all &amp; actually KNOWING WHY my chol= 193 &amp; trig=256...I have changed my diet, am exercising more &amp; AM NOT going to take this drug!!! BUT I am also NOT going to tell my doc &amp; see what happens. He has also UPPED my Niaspan from 500 to 1000 mg a day. Which I am fine with.THE MAIN CAUSE OF EXTREME SIDE EFFECTS IS: NOT drinking enough water/fluids during the day! ALSO...MORE WATER= NO FLUSH with the Niaspan!!! Just an FYI paws4parker @ yahoo . com if anyone has other ???'s :) Oh, and I am 58 years old.

There is no generic and my insurance does not pay very well. Three month supply is over $200.00 for the first three months because I have to meet a deductable. I have been on this for more than a year and am also taking blood pressure medicine. This is way too much for me to pay. I have asked the doctor for a generic but he was not cooperative. I know it is working but I just can't afford it.

There is no doubt it lowers your levels. But I have never had such muscle pain, weakness, numbness of my extremities in my life. I am in the medical field and I am very active but this has almost incapcitated me. I have also had my Gall Bladder removed since starting this drug and I never had a gall bladder attack prior to taking this drug. I have never been in the hospital for anything but child birth.  This is a bad drug.

I tried Simvastatin but stopped taking it due to what I felt were side effects with really bad muscle pain to the point I couldn't walk or stand, which cleared up when I stopped taking it.  Then my dr. put me on Trilipix.  Well, I am having severe problems with an upset stomach, after I eat I am running to the bathroom and I am also nauesous.  I know I have a gallstone and wonder if I should have been given this drug.  After reading other reviews I am going to stop taking this for a few days and see if I feel better and then will have to approach my dr. but I can't deal with feeling sick to my stomach all the time and wondering if I will be O.K. if I leave the house!  I also believe it is causing darkening of my urine.

He has had SEVERE pain in his legs to the point he cannot hardly walk.    No one could find out what was wrong with his legs.  He has horrible problems with acid reflux, tired all the time, and has problems with holding his urine.  I (duh) just read the comments of other people and they have the same symptoms only he seems to have all of them.  I hope it hasn't caused permanent damage.  He had great blood test results from this drug, but who cares if it is destroying his body.He has had MRIs, been to all kinds of doctors who said his symptoms are not side effects of this drug.I am so thankful I read these comments.  He will stop taking it tomorrow!  God bless all of you.

When I first noticed the numbness in my hands and trouble walking I stopped the statin.  A month later the pain the hands and legs did not stop, but continued to get worse.  After going to a Neurologist and a new Doctor who ran test after test, my muscle enzymes are high and the damage to my hands and feet are permanant.  I am off of both drugs.  It was a pain I had never experienced before in my life.  I was retaining water from my kidneys shutting down.  Watch what your Doctor puts you on, take control of your own health.

I should not have been allowed to take as I am on prescriptions that interact with this medicine. I have been taking for 10 months. I have had gallstones and my gallbladder removed. I have had severe muscle pain in my legs and arms. I always have an upset stomach and had flu like symptoms. My Dr has ordered blood tests for every disease possible, not thinking it might be this. I could have helped but, my memory has gotten so bad, I forgot when I started this drug and had to ask.  I heard about the adverse affects of statins on the radio (Michael Savage Show) and was horrified to find out I was actually on a statin.  Again, my fault for not looking up what trilipix is. Ofcourse my Dr and pharmacist didn't do me any favors either. Please, read the insert. I am off this drug and hope to recover and get my memory back.

I was on Tricor, my Triglycerides were at 210 at the time and my doctor wanted them to be down more. Also really had no known side effects with Tricor. He put me on Trilipix, now within a hour or 2 of taking it( always early morning) my face starts warming up, and it last most of the day. I feel like I'm over heating and need to be in AC, some muscle tireness. Also slight headaches almost everynight. Now the sad part, the first check of my Triglycerides again and they were up to 250, and I always eat right, watch everything i eat.

I've been on Trilipix 3 mos.   I am now having tests done for gallbladder stones which may have been caused by this medication.   So from one problem to another serious condition.

No side effects noted.  Easy to take, I took it in the morning before breakfast. It dropped my trigs almost 300 points, enough to effectively measure my ldl, which was back to normal levels, hdl was also improved. I also lost 17# and increased my exercise level from none to some.  I feel very good about staying on this drug.

I tried going without it for a week, and everything returned to normal, so it was the Trilipix.  As soon as I started taking it again, I got &quot;bogged up&quot; again too.  I can't spend the rest of my life on laxatives!

The first month I never noticed much except musle pain. The longer I took it the worse I felt and then started having major physotic problems. They wanted to commit me to a mental instute but I refused but went off of both and all problems went away with in a week. I have now started back on Pravastatin and only have musle pain. No phycotic problems. Trilipix is a very dangerous drug and I recomend that it be taken off the market.

This drug is a next step for me as I have taken other cholesterol lower drugs in the past. Along with diet and exercise Ive been successful with those drugs however as I get older I'm finding this more difficult to do.  Im quite excited about significantly reducing my levels after reading about others in these reviews thatve had great success. Hopefully, I wont experience the severe effects others have.

I've given up on all statin meds and feel much better. Been on Trilipix for about a year with favorable results. I hope this review is helpful.Good Luck

My cholesterol is under control but never have been able to correct my high triglyceride levels,even with TRILIPIX.  My triglycerides are still over 2 times the high normal level after taking this medication for over 6 months. My doctor says I might as well go back to the generic of LOPID and save some money.

I do have a suggestion,for 1st time users why dont drs. prescribe 2 or 3 capsules only to see how it effects them. seems like the drug companies would be quite unhappy with thatkind of rational thinking as not any money in it for them. I now have a bottle of 29 unused trilipix that will soon go in the trash. I could go on, but fellowreader, Im sure you get the picture. what a waste....

Next check, my triglycerides were 153!!I do get heartburn approx.2-3 x wk. but attribute it to diet,i.e.coffee and stress. I take the purple pill for heartburn as needed.I do worry if or when this drug may affect liver function. I get blood work done quarterly.

Waiting for a six month blood test to see what effect it has on my triglycerides. None of the other triglyceride drugs have been effective over the last 50 years.

After 4 weeks started getting sick to my stomach, rash on my face, wild nightmares, constipated and dizzy to the point that I almost fell backwards down the steps a few times.  In the middle of the night I got up and searched the drug - called the doctor the next day and told her I am finished taking it. It has now been a week since I stopped and I'm still sick to my stomach all the time - sometimes I have pain in my stomach and cramps.  This stuff needs to be banned. I'm convinced medical companies don't care about anyone... now I'm thinking doctor's don't care either.

I'm commenting on the acid reflux that people are experiencing.

Finally I complained enough to be switched to Trilipix. Don't know if my levels have dropped yet, but I have much less pain after 2 weeks, especially my hands which ached enough at night to awaken me.

Combined High Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Level	Alabama_Tiger, 45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	45-54	7/11/2009 10:54:50 AM	So far (100 days therapy) it has worked wonders.  My triglycerides dropped from 375 to 113 and my cholesterol dropped from 229 to 174.  I simply FEEL better.  My cholesterol used to fluctuate between 200 and 230.  I was a gym/pool rat and had very good HDL/LDL  ratios so my doc said don't worry about it.  I quit the gym/pool for various reasons and my cholesterol and especially my triglycerides increased.  My diet is and has been very conservative for 30 years so I believe there's a genetic component to my situation.  One last note, my libido seems to be increasing at age 51. It is nice to have an increased urge again

I am improving my diet and exercising more (walking mostly) and have had no ill effects from the med. It's the only one I take. I take it at night before going to bed so maybe that accounts for the lack of side effects that so many others seem to have. I really could not be happier.
High Amount of Triglyceride in the Blood	peezee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/30/2009 11:37:54 AM	All I can say is WOW! My trig was 560 and in 6 weeks with this med and better diet my newest blood work put it at 143.  The lab guys actually did the tests twice to be sure of the results. I have no ill effects, but I take it before going to bed instead of in the morning so maybe that's the difference. Maybe those who have trouble with side effects should talk to their doctor to see if changing the time they take it would help them. I couldn't be happier.

I actually went to have the blood work done to see if my testosterone level was down because I was having severe mood swings, irritability and anger issues.  I took the Trilipix for 6 weeks with no difficulties or side effects; another blood draw was taken and the Dr. said my high levels had come down.  I will get another blood draw in 1 month to check my levels again.  The positives about taking this medication is that my levels are coming down, but even better is that my mood swings, frustration and irritability have all subsided.  My spouse and friends say that I am back to my old self again and it happened in just two weeks of being on the medication.  I did a complete 180!  I am not on any other medications.

They are too light weight.  I am into my second week and am unable to report if they have worked for me until I return for bloodwork.
