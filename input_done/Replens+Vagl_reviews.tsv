Other	RFK, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	1	4	1	Female	65-74	9/11/2012 2:16:12 PM	I have used Replens for nearly 2 years until as of late noticed a painful burning sensation after use. In the begining it was fine. I was using it for menopausal dryness and wanted a drug estrogen free. It also caused small white balls of discharge which I attributed to the binding of vaginal skin cells. However the more I read on the ingredients I realized that this product was thining the mucous lining of the vagina making it more susceptible to infection. With the thining of the vaginal lining it was no longer a mystery about the burning. The manufacturer on their website claim they have done research which consists of 50 women, 12 of which dropped out for various reasons leaving only 38 in their study. Basically they could find no negative effects. Hardly a scientific study in my estimation. What about long term. This product contains Methylparaben,which can be a serious problem for skin disorders. Parabens can mimic estrogen. What are the long term effects of this drug. This drug I believe is harmful to women and should be recalled and more studies done. I would never recommend it or use it again and hope I did not sustain any injury from using it. I plan on bringing this to the attention of the FDA and encourage others who have had similiar experience to do so. People need to be informed so they can make good choices.

I have used replens for a few months and have also continued to have a discharge.  It has gotten worse.  Clumps fell out of me the other day!!  and I have another UTI! Never thought the replens would cause that.  I will not use this anymore.   I have heard that using plain mineral oil is good for dryness and for sex. I am going to try that .
Other	Beth, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	5/2/2012 12:58:04 AM	Have used it twice. Is is easy to insert and does provide adequate moisture but chunks and clumps of white discharge are not acceptable. I don't think it is a yeast infection because there is no redness or itching but I don't want to be running to my Ob/Gyn's office every time this happens to make sure it's not an infection. Am strongly considering vaginal estrogen therapy.

YUCK and BEWARE it has PARAffinum in it, there should be NO PARA - anything re: sunscreens with Parabins, so, help us understand whether this ingredient is PARA FREE -Ladies look for BiO-Identical hormone estrogens, progestrone and testosterone, we don't need to stop being women, just because our hormones have slowed down. Vaginal dryness loss of elasticity is Estrogen. Be careful you are not at any Breast Cancer risk first.

Other	goober, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	7/25/2011 8:03:02 PM	Only been using it for about three weeks regularly, but it did make last sexual experience less painful (I am perimenopausal so experiencing dryness).  But today I passed a large thick, white, tubular shaped discharge and pretty bad cramping.  Looking on other websites, found this happens often.  The Replens insert says vaginal discharge happens with moisture replenishment, but this was horrible!  Alternative is Vagifem or compounded estrogen which is expensive ($75 per month to less than $8).

Advised to use Replens. Awful discharge and more spotting so returned to Doc. Bad case of thrush (never had before) and sent for intra uterine and vaginal scans. Scans fine, but since then I've had urine infection, another bout of thrush and blood tests now reveal abnormal blood count and possible underactive thyroid. I have never been to the Doc's so much.

I have been using this for about 5 weeks now waiting for the discharge to dissipate as the directions indicate.

I found out the problem I had was terrible dryness.  It burned and stung and was pain beyond discription.  Only another woman who has suffered from these symptoms could understand.    Thanks to the manufacturer who came up with this product.  I cannot express my relief, and you have probably saved my marriage.

Pain was excruciating. This product (applied 2-3 times per week) has been a lifesaver! Discharge only lasted through first 3 applications. Dr. advised that the &quot;clumps&quot; and slightly  pink discharge were normal and they both disappeared as she said they would. I'm living life again. Unfortunately, it has become scarce on the shelves. I've purchased several hundred dollars worth to buy me some time, but manufacturer (Columbia) has done away with it. Don't know what the future holds.

Other	carol, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	55-64	7/16/2010 5:34:43 AM	I have been suffering with stinging pain on intercourse for some time, which has ruined our sex life.  I finally realised it was simply due to vaginal dryness after coming off HRT a few years ago. A friend recommended Replens and the information on the pack suggested it was just what I needed.  I am sensitive to some chemicals in toiletries and am very careful not to use skincare products with petrochemical based ingredients.  Having looked up the ingredients of Replens, I was a little concerned about using something in my vagina that I would not normally choose to use on my face, and I find that even KY jelly stings, but was desperate to solve the sex problem and thought &quot;if so many women use it, it must be OK&quot;.  First use, I experienced stinging - but I had sort of expected that, but felt much moister.  Second use last night - woke up with stinging and burning abdominal pain, this morning still stinging and cramping pains like a period.  Just like a waterworks infection that the extra moisture is meant to prevent!  Was worried I had another infection so checked online for adverse reactions, while most reported a discharge (which the product info warns you about, so I was expecting it) I was &quot;reassured&quot; to read that others had the burning and cramping as well.  I won't be using it again - trying natural progesterone and other more natural products instead.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	6/28/2010 4:28:27 PM	I am surprised at all of the negative reviews. Perhaps those of us with a good experience don't generally check the reviews. I am 53 and have had serious vaginal dryness for several years. After five weeks of regular use, I am now juicy as a teenager! I follow package directions carefully: I use it every three days, and wait 12+ hours before having intercourse, by which time the creme is absorbed (the package says to wait at least two hours, but I can see that the creme might still be hanging around in that timeframe). Yes, I had significant cell sluffing in the first two weeks, and it was not a pleasant sight. While it was going on, I just fully inserted and removed three tampons in a row and they pulled out everything that was loose. At this point I am not noticing any more sluffing or discharge out of the ordinary. In any case, I'll take a few unsightly dead cells in exchange for leaving the lubricants in the drawer. I highly recommend this product.

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	6/6/2010 9:39:31 AM	First time seemed to work well. Tried it again two weeks later - within two hours I was drier than usual and inside were white, pea-sized lumps, consistency of cottage cheese. They were still there the next morning, when I used a warm-water douche to wash them out. I do NOT believe they were &quot;dead skin cells&quot;, as the Replens website suggests - I believe this was the product itself.

The product insert says this discharge will disappear over time - clearly it doesn't. And as the discharge passes it burns and itches. Burning and itching are the symptoms this product is supposed to alleviate. I would never recommend this product to anyone.

I will definitely not be using it again and was reassured to learn that a heavy vaginal discharge was a side effect experienced by many women, not just me.  The first two times I used it this was not so evident but the third time it was burning and horrible.  I will be throwing the product in the bin!!  Hopefully things will settle down and I will go back to using a jelly lubricant when required as I have no side effects with this type of product.

My doctor said she has had no complaints.  The menopause was settling down nicely apart from dryness, now I have bad backache, bloating and stomach cramps and a burning pain - oh yes and a discharge.  I've only used the product twice - never again. Does anyone else think the idea of a snap off top on the applicator is stupid?  Each time I had a sharp bit of plastic left which I stabbed myself with - must have been thought up by a man.

I haven't had the 'cottage cheese' like discharge others have talked about; but, after about one month of use, I am beginning to notice a strange odor.  It smells like something is decaying inside me. That scares me.   Also have noticed 'period-like' cramps and a slightly nauseated feeling within one/two days of applying the product. Came online to see if others have had the same problem as I am now leary about using it again. It has definitely worked fairly well for intercourse but I have decided to discontinue using it as my life is too busy to be interrupted every few days by stomache cramps. This website has been very helpful.  Thank you.

My doctor says there is a binding agent in this product.  If you have yeast problems it will bind the cells.  Because of this, I did not get any lubrication relief.  I do not like this product.

Dryness is gone and now my pap tests are normal. the shedding of accumalated cells is what your periods do and Replens replaces this process after Menopause. Result, no more dryness.

I suspected the Replens was causing the infection, but my gynecologist said that couldn't be true.  I continued to use the Replens for a year and continued to have a yeast infection (I'd never had one before in my life).  I finally quit using the Replens and have had no more yeast infections.  Fortunately, my dryness problem isn't bothering me any more, so I don't miss the Replens at all!!  DON'T USE THIS STUFF!!

The very next day after using this product I had an amazing amount of &quot;cottage cheese&quot; like discharge it was awful! I dumped the rest of the stuff in the trash!..From what I can tell from many of the other reviews of this product many people have had the exact same symptoms.

Cramping in lower and upper abdomen, back hurting, tired, etc.  I didn't think it was the Replens at first, but then I used it again in 3 days....symptoms were much worse...I am very disappointed in this product...I also had a cheesy discharge and foul odor with this product.. not good!!

All 3 times I had the cottage cheese like discharge, each time it seems to have gotten worse. Last night I had BURNING, itching and lots of gross discharge while having intercourse! I got online to check to see if these were the side effects of using Replens. I have severe yeast problems as well as very dry skin now that I am perimenopausal. I certainly do not need anything that is going to cause even more problems for me! I am very disappointed that Replens does not have these side effects listed on the box nor on the instruction sheet!  I had to go online to find out that others have also had these side effects.
