Allergic Conjunctivitis	Cameo girl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	1/9/2012 12:17:58 AM	I have severe dry eyes due to medicarion.  SOmetimes so dry I scratch my corneas.  I use RefrshPM ophthamic ointment at night time and Refresh liquigel during the day.  After one week of using Azalastime I developed this rost flu-like symtons and cough I have evr had.  I already had my flu hot 2 months ago and my doctor said it was not the flu.  The fever, cough and chills were casued by the eyedrops.  Since stopping them the symptoms disappeared.  I still use the Refresh dur to the dry eys symptoms, there is no medication, not even rstasis can cure that.  I refuse to pay 80.00 a mont for Patanol when I tried my husband's and they did nothing to help the itching.  It is something I have to live with until I can get off ht e pain medications after my spinal surgery.  Who would have thought a drop for allergic conjunctivitis could cause such a horrible flu like symptom, not to mention the but=rning an d the bitter taste.  Never had eyedrops like this is my life and I have had allergic conjuctivitis before.  The FDA needs to pull this drop off the market, whe one is ill already and had a weakened immune system the flu-like sympptoms can be horrible.  I was in the hospital for 2 days, all because of an eyedrop.

This eye drop has dramatically helped me for the past 5 years. The reviews seem to under rate its potential value. 
Allergic Conjunctivitis	fern, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/29/2010 12:55:48 PM	After trying every OTC eye drops for relieving my allergies (which aggravate my eyes relentlessly), I tried this and the severe itching and draining stopped.  I did, however, develop the awful taste in the back of my throat.

Other	sprotiepam, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/10/2010 7:55:27 AM	I have very dry eyes along with allergies. I tries pataday and patanol and neither worked. When I start with this medication it worked like a charm. Yes it does leave a small taste in the back of the throat, but mine goes away. I also do not use this on a daily basis. I use it the most in the Spring and Fall. I also have to use refresh tears and Restesis on a daily basis, but those did not help the itchy and redness I get in my eyes. Optvar has.

Allergic Conjunctivitis	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	5/6/2009 3:58:09 PM	I have the absolute worst eye allergies and have tried pretty much every medication, all of which never seem to work.  My doctor just switched me to Optivar instead of Patonal and I think I notice a slight difference.  It burns a lot when you first put it in, but stops the pain.  It also leaves a horrible taste in the back of your throat, which i have not been able to get rid of.  But I will suck it up if that means my eyes will stop itching.
Allergic Conjunctivitis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/19/2009 7:37:29 AM	I found optivar to work well for my allergies.  It helps my eyes feel better and most of all stops the red skin I get around and in the corner of my eyes.  
Allergic Conjunctivitis	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	45-54	10/26/2008 7:48:24 AM	Of the various prescription eye drops I tried for my eye allergies, Optivar was the one I liked least. I didn't seem to work any better than the others, and it left an unpleasant taste in my mouth. This, of course, reflects only my experience.

Allergic Conjunctivitis		5	5	5			2/21/2008 11:33:24 PM	this worked fine for along with other drops tho. it did remove the pain i had from the burning in my eyes but left them feeling dry. so i applied an over the counter drop along with it after about ten minutes and that provided relief for hours
