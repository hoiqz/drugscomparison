Cold Sore	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/11/2012 5:09:55 AM	My insurance paid half and I paid $211 for this little tube.  It was worth every penny.  Clears my cold sores in half the time.  Cold sores make me sick like having the flu but this heads it off.  More than happy with this medicine.
Cold Sore	Neon, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	12/29/2011 1:45:20 PM	This is my first time using Denavir. Usually I suffer the 10+ days w/ Carmax (with Campho) and ice. This time, my 1st blister wasn't gone before a second one appeared! I didn't know there was a prescription topical treatment, &amp; I wasn't getting them frequent enough to justify taking a pill to prevent outbreaks. I give Denavir 4/5 stars for Effectiveness b/c it didn't take away the pain or soreness on the first day I started using it. Although it seems to have cut the time of the cold sore to less than half, and that's AFTER the blister already formed. If I used this at the first sign I wonder how much quicker it would have worked.I gave 4/5 for Ease of use because the metal tube doesn't allow for the product to re-enter the container, creating wasted product to be excreated. I understand this packaging may be to prevent contaminants from entering the container, but it is potentially wasteful. Easy to apply with a Q-tip!

I put it on as soon as i felt the tingle and it lessened the severity of the outbreak. It did not really help treat it, but it helped a little. It went away in 5 days so I'm happy.

Then I switched doctors and he suggested the Denavir. It has worked wonderfully for me. 
Cold Sore	LKit, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/2/2011 12:08:20 AM	I finally sought the advice of a doctor after my most recent cold sore.  I get one, maybe two a year but they're embarrassing and I hate them so much!  Plus they always take like 10 days to heal and usually double in size in the first few days.My doc gave me a prescription for Valtrex (generic, $10 copay w/ my insurance) and Denavir ($40 copay w/ my insurance).  I started using both within 10 hours of waking up with it, though the cold sore had already blistered.I attribute it to both drugs, but it seems like the combination stopped the sore from growing in size and immediately started it in the healing process!  It's gonna take a few days to heal still, but usually 2 days in, it would be a hot mess!  I work in the public with many professional clients and even was able to visit my clients today without feeling majorly embarrassed.  I understand it's really expensive without insurance and there's no generic available... I'm not sure what I'd do if it wasn't covered.  But, it seemed worth it.  It is a very tiny tube though - a little goes a long ways!  It just sucks that when you remove the lid, sometimes you lose a little.  Seems like they could do something like Abreeva does.  
Cold Sore	oscarm, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/16/2010 9:37:53 PM	I've suffered from cold sores for years. Usually stress related, and I can always count on an appearance every December. At times it's been so bad I wouldn't go out in public.  This stuff is fantastic.  I apply at the first sign and while it never prevents it completely, it's nowhere near the swollen mess I used to experience.  My doctor also recommended Lysine.  I take 1000mg daily.  Bet that helps too.

Cold Sore	mlucero, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/17/2010 11:30:34 AM	I have always gotten cold sores since as long as I can remember, early childhood. I have been using denavir for about 10 years and it has been the most effective for me. However, it doesn't always work. I hope I am not getting immune to it. Its always been like that though. Most of the time it does work, if I catch it right away. I hate the persisitent outbreak where I am working on one that is wanting to come out but just lingers for a few days. Then a few days later it comes back. Wierdest damn thing, this virus is. I hate it, but have excepted it better these days because there is not a damn thing you can about it. The manufacturer should make the tubes out of plastic because when you use it so often the metal like tube rips in the sides because the tube gets smashed together. They should also make a bigger supply. Honestly they should make a commercial because people will buy this med because it really works at reducing the bad effects and increasing the healing time. 
Cold Sore	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	1/4/2010 3:19:00 PM	I get cold sores once a year-typically when i am sick- and as soon as the cold sore starts forming i start applying(with a clean qtip) every 2 hours-its powerful stuff and can help heal the cold sore much faster then without treatment. make sure not to apply with your finger. 
Cold Sore	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	12/22/2009 6:54:34 PM	I get cold sores very often i try everything to get rid oif them and nothing really worked without taking alot of time. I called my doctor and she perscribed denavir and it seems to be working fast and i would tell anyone with cold sores to ask there doctor about it.
Cold Sore	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	10/22/2009 7:31:32 PM	This medication works on cold sores and keeps them from becoming huge blisters. Apply at the first pain or tingling and you'll stop the sore in its tracks. Yes,it's prescription and yes it is a small tube but you really won't use that much because it actually works. I've used it for several years now.
Cold Sore	tallgirl101, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	19-24	10/20/2009 5:18:41 PM	I feel like this tiny tube was not worth the 35 dollers I paid for it. When I squeeze a little out next thing I know the alot of the medicine is out of the tube! I have tried Denavir and Abreeva and can't say that either one works any better. I will probubly stick to Abreeva because it has a pup aplicator and you dont waste the medicine and it is about 15 dollers cheeper. I wasnt impressed.
Cold Sore	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/12/2009 11:06:45 AM	I took my son to several doctors for an outbreak on his chin with no results. Finally a dermatologist prescribed him Denavir and it works great within a few days. I highly recommend it!

AH! My doc prescribed me Denavir and immediately the new sore disappeared AND the first one shrank so quickly. It was amazing. I just wish it came with a pump top so I didn't spill so much when I take the lid off to apply it. But, don't let that run you astray. It works great! I would definately recommend it to anyone with annoying cold sores.
Cold Sore	45-54 Male  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/27/2009 11:57:34 AM	Denavir is very good and works even better. Should be sold over the counter...

The only problem was that it came back with in two days of finishing the treatment. It is much smaller, but I am still dealing with it and hope that it is only temperary.

I have used it over the years as needed ( outbreaks spans from every 4 months and sometimes no outbreaks for as long as 1 year without an outbreak). Whenever I feel an outbreak coming I apply the medication sparingly a few times,the blisters stopped and healing begins almost immediately. There is no comparison. It is really effective for me.I have had no negative side effect so far.
