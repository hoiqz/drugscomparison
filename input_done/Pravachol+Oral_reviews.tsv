Increased Triglycerides and Cholesterol	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	35-44	7/8/2012 10:41:01 PM	I was taking Pravachol, as per my doctor. It was the third statin for me to try. Unfortunately developed severe neurological pains, twice went to emergency room thinking it was a heartattack. Numerous pains in neck fingers, thigh numbness, left side weakness and loss of reflexes. Caused my doctors and specialists to run numerous tests and MRIs to determine some other cause. After numerous lost days from work and running around to specialists, slowly reduced the doses myself and noticed all the side effects disappeared. Severe muscle pain, at night cannot help you sleep. Lead my pulmonologist to up my sleap apnea pressures, thinking it was a sleep apnea event. I seriously think people should evaluate whether they can take this drug. For me it was an extremely poor interaction.

Other	45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1		45-54	12/10/2011 4:33:10 PM	Like all statins, this drug is PURE POISON, and should be used ONLY in extreme cases where natural treatments fail!! How many of you reading this have tried natural treatments? Not just diet and exercise, supplementation? My husband lowered his cholesterol/blood lipids NATURALLY, with diet, daily fiber, Omega3 supplements, and colon cleansing 3-4x/year. He also dropped 25 lbs and kept it off once he adopted the naturally healthy regimen. Amazingly, because he once had high cholesterol, his MD still prescribed it. He ended up with dangerously low cholesterol (total of 92). His MD cut his Vytorin dose to half of one 10/20 pill per day. Then his cardiologist decided for some inexplicable reason to put him on Pravastatin, 40 mg per day, without any apparent reason (no new bloodwork, etc). Within days, he broke out in a rash all over his face, had several episodes of chest pain, difficulty breathing, and extreme vertigo. Stopped taking the poison and symptoms subsided.You need to be your own advocate, unfortunately in our disease-care system!
High Cholesterol	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		11/13/2011 11:02:54 AM	I'm 90 yrs old. Started taking pravachol on 9/14/11. On 11/25/11 I had a terrible pain on my right side under my ribs. My blood test revealed my liver enzymes were very elevated. I'm stopping it on my own. My doctor sent me to have an ultrasound and a nuclear goldbladder test. He shoudl have reviewed my chart and asked me to stop it. Lesson: do your own checking on all drugs and procedures.

High Cholesterol	Brian, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	2	Male	35-44	8/28/2011 7:37:50 PM	I got this Pravastatin Sodium 40mg from my doctor for high bad cholesterol and low good cholesterol.  I took it twice at bedtime as directed.  Upon waking on the third day, I noticed that my ankles and feet hurt a little, as though I had run a lot the day before.  I hadn't worked out for several days prior to taking this drug.  My ankle and feet joints hurt.  There was no muscle pain.  There were no other side effects that I could discern.  I have no other health issues, am in fairly good shape, and do not take any other medication.  This was my first prescription medicine that I started taking after I turned 40 and started worrying about getting old.I had read the other reviews, both good and bad, and had hoped that I wouldn't have any side effects.I have stopped taking this medication.  From what others had written, the side effects tend to get worse and take a LONG time to recover from.  No thanks.  I'm not taking that chance.I will try some Red Rice Yeast with COQ-10 tablets or just the COQ-10 tablets themselves from a healthfood store.  They are more expensive than this prescription which was only a $10 copay with my insurance.  But, I do not want to risk the side effects, including possible problems that I couldn't readily detect like liver issues.  No way.  Forget it.  These COQ-10 supplements are not controlled substances since they are not marked as statins as far as the Food and Drug Administration is concerned...but they are statins from what I've read.  So, I'll spend more money and try them.

I have Arthritis &amp; feel this med is causing it to flair up.  Stopped and will look for another med for my Cholesterol!
High Cholesterol	SarahSoda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	7/24/2011 10:42:23 AM	I was prescribed 40mg. Shortly after starting the drug I took a nasty spill and sprained an ankle and pulled a muscle in the other leg.  I mention this only because I really felt lousy long after the fall. I suddendly felt 88, not 58.. could barely walk at night time and had a hard time getting out of a chair. I was depressed and felt absolutely lousy. A friend mentioned to me that statins cause muscle pain, so I stopped taking the drug.  Within 2 days I felt like a new person!  No pain in my feet and knees and depression gone.  I will not take a statin again.  I'm not convinced after reading about statins that they are effective in woemn.

The good news is that it reduced my cholesterol from 270 down to 190 in about 60 days. The bad news is that at the same time I developed knee, wrist, and bottom of the foot pain that I never had before. I have excercised 90 minutes a day for 20 years with no problems. Now I have stopped due to these pain symptoms. I have stopped taking the drug for 10 days and am hoping the pain symptoms will stop. It may work for others but I will NEVER take a statin again.

I have taken it with tamoxifen and now femara for breast cancer.  All of these drugs can cause muscle/joint pain, tiredness, and headaches...but it doesn't effect me to the point of going off them.  I think the benefit outweighs the slight side effects.

I do have some leg pain at night and I am constantly fatigued but not to the point I can not deal with it. I have a family history of heart attack before age 50 and stroke before 65 and our family usually will run a total number of 275 or bigger. My is down to around 200 but the LDL remains a borderline high. I have a question though because I have a portion of hair that has quit growing. It started about a year ago and now I have an area where I am losing hair but I was recently put on atnelol and I am thinking that is causing the loss. Has anyone else experienced the hair not growing while on pravachol/pavastatin? It grows everywhere except one spot and not a spot you can hide, quite irritating. Is there something I can take?

Took one pill every other day. Afer first pill felt burning in calf but didn't connect. Took second pill as directed and major muscles were on fire in addition to achy joints and itching all over.  I won't take another one.  It's been two weeks and my leg muscles are still burning. Doc is now reccommending Welchol or going back to Zetia.

I became completely constipated and my urine production was half of what it was before I started it.  I could not be in normal lighting because my eyes became extremely red, sore and irritated.  I became very cold and could not be w/o a winter jacket.  I also experienced low back pain which I also did not have before starting this drug.  I always felt like I had to urinate but wasn't able to.  My face was starting to turn slightly yellow.  My doctor started me on Crestor which worked like a dream.  After 2 weeks I was doing great - but I can't afford the drug.  My insurance doesn't cover me for it.

All of them caused muscle pain in my calves and hands, severe tingling in my feet and hands, and various other problems.  Pravachol is the first one to cause severe nausea, which began after taking only 10 mg for two days.  I stopped taking the drug, but the nausea lasted five more days.  Looks like I'm gonna have to try something other than statins to lower LDL and triglycerides.

High Cholesterol	Roz, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	9/16/2009 4:48:14 PM	Took Pravastatin for about a year 40mg.  Handled lowing my cholesterol very well.  Over time I developed fatigue, mental fog, detachment, leg cramping, extremeties tingling/asleep, nausea, vomiting - overall not well.  At a doc visit - I was told to come off the drug until I saw the doc at the next visit - in two weeks (a test).  Within 5 days the symptoms started to lift and within days I felt like a new person.  Then - 1.5 weeks into the &quot;test&quot; I got head to toe hives/rash - extreme.  Doctor did not know why - but a friend of mine suggested that it was probably the &quot;cold turkey&quot; withdrawal from the drug.  Anyone experience anything like that??  I'm now looking for natural remedies.

After some months, I developed a chronic tired feeling. The last month I took it, iexperienced sever arm and chest pain/cramps. I also experienced short memory loss and emotional upset. I have since quit taking it once I realized the connection. I will have to see whether the symptoms decrease.
High Cholesterol	Phil, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	55-64	9/11/2009 10:51:58 AM	My total cholesterol is 200 or less but my doctor is concerned about the LDL which is around 40. I have been against taking any cholesterol medicine in the past. The doctor is concerned about my family history with my mother's side of the family dieing with heart attacks and strokes when they were approximately 70 years old. I have had the same family doctor for 15 years and 7 years ago he started to encourage me to start taking cholesterol medicine and potentially blood pressure medicine which I have resisted until this last May. I started taking the pravastatin in June this year and in July started having blood pressure problems and was put on Lisinopril. I have had headaches and don't seem to generally feel the same. Experienced some depression and since taking pravastatin for 3 months now have been put on Lisinopril which the doctor says has no relationship. I felt fine and my blood pressure was good prior to being placed on pravastatin. I am not sure the preventive maintenance is worth the feeling. I am not overweight, ride bicycle (14-20 miles, walk 3 miles in 45 minutes etc.). I thought I would share this with you. By the way I do think my doctor has my best interest at heart but I do think somehow the cholesterol medicine affected my blood pressure. It may have not been a direct affect but potentially the change in body chemistry may have created a stress which has indirectly caused the blood pressure increase.

I did try the generic version for a period of one year and my cholesterol rose to 222.  On the brand name, it stayed at between 169-180. I don't feel that generics do the job.

My feet and hands swell, feet tingle feel numb and muscles in upper leg hurt all the time.  This will be my last statin drug to try, it's not worth the pain.  I have terrible time sleeping at night for the pain in my upper legs.  Hope they come out with something that will work that is not a statin, because I am done with them.
High Cholesterol	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	3/3/2009 7:26:51 PM	I just came back from my ophthalmology and have been told that I am developing a cataract.  I am only 53. When I told my doctor that I have been taking Pravachol for the past 3 months, she said that was most likely the cause and for me to read the side effect warning.  Sure enough, there it was.  Now I don't know what to do.  Guess I have to find another drug or risk heart disease.  The Pravachol lowered my cholesterol from 234 to 180 after only 30 days.

For the same reasons as you, my Dr. put me on an Rx fish oil gel cap. Can't remember the name but she said it will not be as effective as RX statin drugs but there should be no side effects from its use. She steered me away from OTC fish oil because &quot;it's quality is not as well controled as the Rx version&quot;. Just started it so no lab results yet. Just my 2 cents for you. Regards.
High Cholesterol	augydog, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years	4	5	4	Male	65-74	12/7/2008 9:30:06 PM	I started out on Zocor (5mg, 10mg, 20mg), and had to get off of it because of aches to my arms and shoulders.I've been on Pravachol for almost 5 years and have a LDL of around 100, and HDL of 48. My total cholesterol is around 180.  I haven't experienced any of the known side effects to date. I also take CoQ10 100mg daily. If you take CoQ10, insure that you use the ubiquinol rather than the ubiquinone.  Ubiquinone is the oxidized form of CoQ10. The ubiquinol is utilized by the body faster. I would advise reading up on the two. Also, ask your doctor about CoQ10, before taking it.I guess I'll stick with the Pravachol as long as I don't have any problems.I just hope there won't be any long term negative effects from taking this drug.
High Cholesterol	Donna, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	12/2/2008 12:55:25 AM	I'm a chicken to take this drug. After reading all these reviews I am not comfortable to do this to my body. My Dr. has prescribed 40mg and my cholesterol is 268. Got any ideas of what may work that is not drugs? I work out for 2 hrs 3 times a week and I am lean 5'4&quot; 120 lbs. I am also gluten intolerant, so don't eat any wheat. There must be alternatives to drugs that do this to you!

Just recently I've been experiencing weird pain in my legs...stabbing, vibrating (only way I can explain it) pains in my right leg (mostly thigh).  It lasts about 1 - 2 minutes then gone.  Pain reoccurs but not on a daily basis.  Is this something I should be worried about?  Do I need to discuss this with my dr?  Not sure what I'm looking for.  I was on another statin and my legs hurt badly all over.  This is not the same pain.

He blamed the medication for his pain/stopped taking but too late...his muscles were so weak that his heart gave out in his sleep..I don't trust this medication at all!
