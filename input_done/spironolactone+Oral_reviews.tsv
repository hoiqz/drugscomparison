Helped the acne quite a bit and the hair a little.  Ended up getting laser hair removal on chin so not an issue any more.  Had very few side effects - slightly irregular periods (when I was still having them) but nothing else.  Still taking 100mg/day after almost 10 years.  Now that I'm in menopause, I'm considering lowering dosage or stopping altogether - need to talk to doctor first.

I think if u eat right, you can minimize any side effect.  My cycles were already heavy due to PCOS and fibroid tumors which have since been removed..I feel great!  Skin is clearing, I have lost weight and my blood pressure remains low!

I swear dermatologists are tied to the drug industry and wrongly Rx non-generic things (like Dorax and Finacea.  The redness of my face decreased but my period is haywire and heavy and frequent (2x month) and I think its due to Spiro.  I am so tired as a result.  I also hate getting the frequent bloodwork (which dr. office probably likes extra visits $$). I believe my acne is hormonal and spending tons of money at dr's office will little holistic advice.  I plan to stop Dorax and Spiro and just use topical treatment and natural progesterone cream to control my heavy period bleeding.  A good read at my age (47) is What Your Dr. May Not Tell You About Pre-Menopause. I also think its messed up when more hormone meds (birth control pills)are prescribed in tandem with Spiro to balance the irregular periods.  It is toxic to body, so much synthetic hormones ...

If you are taking this for hair loss, acne or other reason, STOP!!! I stopped taking it because it made me very sick, but it is ONLY made to be used for high blood pressure and on rare occasions, male hair growth in women due to ovarian cysts.  The side effects are terrible and it WILL NOT help with balding or acne or fixing hormone imbalance.  GO TO A DIFFERENT DOCTOR.  Use drugs made only for the illness and insist on not taking anything until you research the drug.  Google or use any search engine, type in the drug name and see what comes up.  Then do the same with your illness and look up what drugs will work.  Check for interactions with anything else you take, even herbal medications, OTC medicines.  Look at food interactions.  I have 26 diseases all because of thyroid cancer and graves disease, Doctors have almost killed me because of medication errors.  Only you can be responsible for what you take, dowble and triple check all medications and diagnosis.  Hope this helps!  Your doctor could have killed you by treating you with a heart medication for acne and/or hair loss!  Good gosh, it lowers blood pressure drastically and causes hair to stop growing!!!

It definitely cleared up my acne and made my skin less oily and my hair as well.  But I am definitely having pain and soreness in my under arms and chest.  I have noticed a slight increased in size of my breast,but nothing to be that happy about.  I have been more tired, but not dizziness, or need for frequent urination.  I have gained weight about 6 pounds or so. I was taking 50 mg twice a day then went down to once.  I am going to try every other day because of the pain in my chest and arms.  I am also going to get my breasts checked just to make sure with my gyno.  I am glad that I am not the only one with these symptoms.  I was starting to worry.  I have yet to have my period, because I am on the seasonel pill where you only get your period every 3 months.   I am hoping I will still have the effects of decreased acne going down to one pill every other day, otherwise it might have to go off the medicine.

I had too much testosterone from taking a supplement.  Within a week, the hair loss ceased quite a bit, but now, a year later, I am having the same hair loss again even though I am still taking the medication.  So I stopped taking it in the hope that because my B-12 levels and hormone levels have come back to normal, that maybe I don't need it any longer.  Now I am wondering if I should instead double the dosage.  It was prescribed for me, but am not certain what to do. The dr who prescribed it had doubled me up on the supplement that caused the hair loss in the first place.  I am not confident that he is accurate. in doubling the dosage.

Male Pattern of Hair Distribution or Hirsutism in a Woman	liftergirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	12/8/2011 1:41:29 AM	I began taking this 2 months ago, 200 mg/day, for PCOS and hair growth/loss. I'd been on b.c. for years but had stopped due to $ for about 3 yrs, and during that time I noticed the male-pattern hair growth increase terribly, along with hair THINNING on top of my head. For about a year I was really upset at how thin the hair on my head was getting, especially up at the front. I began taking b.c. again about a year ago, and it helped with my periods, but it wasn't doing much else. Well, after about a month on spiro, the hair on my head was obviously coming in again, and overall it is much thicker and healthier, kind of back to how it was before. Up front is taking more time to regenerate, and I doubt it'll ever come back 100%, but I am really, really pleased with what it has done so far. As for the male-pattern growth, I have not seen as much change as I wanted to, but before beginning spiro it was definitely coming in darker and there was more of it than before; spiro has put that to rest. Also, what is there is somewhat thinner and easier to remove now. In fact, some areas it is so fine now that it's not even noticeable unless you're seriously studying it up close. I also lost about 10 pounds in the first couple weeks of taking it. I have not gained any of that back, but I haven't really lost much else, either. I think that in those two weeks, I kind of lost my appetite as the drug started working, so I just wasn't eating as much. My skin is the same; I don't usually break out anyway, though. Some days I have to pee like every two hours; other days it's normal. Oddly, the more water I drink, the less I feel like I have to pee all the time, so maybe staying hydrated while on this drug is really important. I have noticed that I'm running a little warmer than I ever have before. Anyways, it's not a wonder drug, but it definitely helps, and I'm really happy about my scalp hair.

I stopped taking it after a while because I wasn't seeing any results at all!! But then 4 months ago I asked my OBGYN to refill the prescription and said that I wanted to give it another try... She bumped the dosage up to 100MG 2 times a day and here I am 4 months later with WAY less hair, way thinner hair, and way less noticeable. I used to look like a man, seriously... This helps alot, but you have to have the dedication to keep taking it 2 times a day, and EVERY day.. I love the results. I would encourage everyone to try this,and if you didn't see results ask to bump up the dosage. I do pee alot, but thats also from the nature of the pill.. its a dieretic...

Other	JenJ, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/15/2011 5:53:54 PM	I had clear skin my entire life until I hit the age of 21. Suddenly I  had horrible acne all over my cheeks, jawline and around the sides of my mouth (at all times, not just during period). It was so bad that I rarely left my room, and I wouldn't even let my boyfriend see me unless the lighting in the room was extremely dim. Suddenly, I stopped hanging out with friends and couldn't even bare going into the grocery store. My face itched constantly because of the severity of my acne and the irritation it caused. I literally felt that if this condition continued, life wasn't worth living. I felt like a monster. I dealt with this for a year, accumulating pitted scars and hyperpigmentation, until I decided I needed to take something orally. After reading many reviews I took the leap and asked my dermatologist for spiro. I was afraid of the side effects I'd read about, but I personally didn't have to deal with them. The only side effect I've noticed is a slight breast enlargement (I was a medium A cup, and now i'm a B cup..so it was nothing too drastic), which I actually am happy about. It took about 2 months of taking 100 mg at night for me to begin to see results. My skin began to clear and the size of my acne decreased. At 3 months, things were looking much much better. I've now been on 100 mg for 5 months and my skin is 90% better. I still get an occasional pimple, but i'm not complaining. I can now live my life without obsessing over my skin in the mirror for hours each day. If I had known about this medication earlier in my case of acne so I wouldn't have to deal with the ice pick and boxcar scars I now have acquired. I hope my review is helpful to someone out there who may be experiencing a loss of confidence due to acne. It may not work for everyone, but It worked amazingly for my type of acne (adult onset, more acne each day). I will continue to take spironolactone.

For a female of 43, it is a miracle drug, and I wonder why it is not being marketed for more people, as it seems to answer a lot of issues that so many women suffer with!

After lots of research it seems to take a few months. I've had a headache since I started, some stomach cramping (not too bad), dizziness all the time, but the side effects seem to be decreasing, I think if I tough it out, I'll be fine. I have suffered from cystic acne since I was 12, I am now 29 and need an answer. I've tried every topical available, antibiotics, herbal remedies, proactiv, everything except accutane which I'm too afraid to even think about trying. I hope I see some improvement soon, sounds like I will, I just have to be patient.

I take it for edema in my legs due to the side effects of taking BP meds. I am not sure it is working. Somedays it seems like the swelling is down but other days it seems worse. Now my hands seem to be swelling too (a ring I wore all the time now does not fit comfortably). I have not lost any weight, I think I may have actually gained some. I took 2 pills so today as my Dr said to take two if needed. Missed my period last month too, that could be my age but I have no other symptoms of menopause so I doubt if that is it. No other problems but not sure if I will continue to take it if it is not helping the problem for which it was prescribed. My pharmacist said that it is highly unlikely that this med is causing the additional swelling but I am not so sure.

I am 30 years old and have always struggled with cystic acne which was only made worse by the removal of my left overy, fallopian tube, and a 14cm cyst a year ago. My skin is completely clear and I have not had a break out in months. I also have noticed that I had some dark hairs starting to grow around my chin and neck. The medication seems to have slowed down that process and it is hardly noticable now. The only down side is that I find myself running to the bathroom frequently to urinate. I feel it is a very small price to pay to have my confidence back.

I have been taking 100mg a day for the last two months and my skin has almost completely cleared up, so I'm very happy with the result (getting rid of the scarring is another issue). I did start noticing some of the expected side effects after taking it for a couple weeks which included: more frequent urination, decreased appetite/slight nausea (which has resulted in a little bit of weight loss. Yay!); and extreme fatigue. I don't exercise nearly as much as I used to and often needs naps to get me through the day. The fatigue has been the most dominant side-effect. The pill tastes almost minty, so it's not pleasant to swallow. But overall I've felt this drug is very effective and the side-effects are worth it. 
Other	mepama, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	2/10/2011 7:50:16 PM	I am 45 years old and was prescribed Spiro for the onset of some agressive rash along my jaw and neckline that I got a couple of months after stopping my YAZ dose.  I had never really suffered any type of severe acne.  I used to take YAZ for my skin problems and chose to stop taking it due to some ciculatory problems.  I used to have mild skin problems as a teenager and this seemed to disapper once I started taking my first birth control medication at the age of 21.  My derm prescribed 50mg of Spiro twice a day.  This medication has really made my skin look and feel better.   I too love that I do not have to wear makeup at times.  I really love this medication.  I went to my regular doctor about a month ago and she questioned why the derm had prescibed it.  I explained the reason for my taking it and she then suggested that I reduce the dosage to once a day.  I did this and had no problems until my next cycle.  I was shocked to see that I developed cyst like breakouts like never before.  I was not about to go there.  I have returned to my original dose and will go see the derm if I have to get a new prescription.  I do not have any other side effects other than the urge to urinate at night.  A small sacrifice when you consider the emotional and physical pain of chronic skin problems.  I really am grateful for this drug and hope and pray that we can all continue it if it benefits us as much as I have read it has.  Good Luck All

It was a godsend from day one- I lost some weight, stopped losing as much hair, my menstruation was regulated, my sex drive was contained. I feel a difference if I'm even a few hours late taking it. Sure it will make me a little sleepy sometimes, and make me have to pee, but not to an intense degree. And yes, sometimes my stomach gets upset, but it's been worth the benefit.HOWEVER. Last week I got a refill, and the manufacturer changed. Suddenly, I'm flushed and overheated, and have a horrible rash. I'm on a few medicines and couldn't figure out what the heck was going on- it felt like the reaction I get when I accidentally eat food with MSG.I stopped taking all the other medicines, thinking the new ones must be the issue, but the symptoms got worse. Then I remembered the manufacturer change. I stopped taking the drug yesterday, and the allergy is subsiding.I'm terribly upset, because this drug has been so effective, and it's probably some minor ingredient. Is anyone else having this happen???

In addition, have occasional, cystic pimples that are difficult to get rid of.   Dermatologist prescribed 50 then 100 mg of this med, as I was discontinuing the other one which caused the hair loss....I couldn't take the 100 mg dose at all...even at 50 mg, I can't make it through the night without getting up to pee....in addition, I have significant pain in my arms, as well as an increase in my headaches from post concussion syndrome, huge amounts of breast pain and seemingly enlargement, an unexplained chest pain for the last week and difficulty sleeping.  In addition, I have gained 9 pounds in 1 month on this medicine.  I am of a very steady weight. I workout....vigorously 4 times per week....I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A QUICK WEIGHT GAIN BEFORE.  There is NO MISTAKE and no other reason for the weight gain other than sprio. It is in direct correlation with me taking this medicine; and I'm shocked at my seemingly &quot;opposite&quot; reaction to most everyone else.   Obviously, it hasn't been long enough to even tell if it's doing it's job in the hair and/or acne department...but I am DONE with it!

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	9/15/2010 3:36:12 PM	I've been on this medication for acne for over 6 months now. I switched from Doryx, which worked wonders on my acne but within a couple months from switching I noticed my acne flared up again. For the first couple of months my dermatologist had me taking 50 mg. I was a little upset that my acne had gotten worse, and felt like I urinated or had the sensation to urinate much more often, but brushed this off. A couple months ago my doctor increased my dosage to 100 mg and although my acne has substantially subsided, I have to urinate constantly. I'm a student and I can barely sit through a 50 minute class, let alone an 1 hour and 15 minutes. I always have to get up in the middle of class to go to the bathroom, even if I use the bathroom before I walk into class. I make sure to stop drinking fluids well before my class, but still have to urinate. It's embarrassing and it prevents me from doing certain things because I'm afraid I'll have to go to the bathroom too often (long car rides, being somewhere where there isn't a bathroom, etc.). I can't say that I recommend or don't recommend this medication because everyone's experience will be different - mine just happens to not be the best experience. I will be making a phone call very soon to see if my dermatologist can switch my prescription.

I have noticed fewer and smaller acne but not gone.  Major side effect for me has been increased sex drive.  I can just think about sex and have an orgasm. I never knew what I was missing. Is anyone else having the strong sexual side effects?  Also increased urination and breast tenderness.  I have lost weight and less hungry.  So I`m going to say on it.
Other	Rachel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	9/5/2010 2:42:17 PM	I took this for acne.  I developed erosions of the esophagus and stomach and also gallstones, all have been reported to be linked to this drug.  If you get stomach pain, see your doctor right away.  I wish I had never taken it.  They made a chemical copy of this drug and put it in the Yaz birth control pill, and it is this &quot;Spironolactone analog&quot; component of Yaz that is reported responsible for many health problems, like gallstones, and resulting Yaz class action lawsuits.  Not everyone is effected.  Many have no problems taking Spiro or Yaz and consider the drugs great. Do your research before taking any drug and weigh the risks.  Spironolactone is not FDA approved for acne and it is an important drug for seriously ill heart, kidney and liver failure patients, but is considered a drug of last resort.  While it cleared my pimples, it wasn't worth the pain I've endured.

The first week was rough as far as side effects go- nausea, upset stomach and insomnia. I still have a decreased appetite and have lost 10 lbs. I am 26 years old, 5'8, and went from 168 to 158 in 2 weeks! I needed to lose some weight, but I'm curious about long term. I agree with the increased urination as well. The good thing is that I have no swelling in my legs like I use to.

It's also cheap and won't break your wallet.I've noticed no side effects that others have mentioned, other than an increase in need to urinate.  I had to tell a friend of mine while we were on vacation that I didn't have some sort of bladder problem - it was just a side effect of my meds.  Other than that, no noticeable bad effects.

I always had nice skin, save for the occasional breakout here and there that could easily be covered up by makeup. However, something happened when I turned 27, I started getting these huge, painful cysts on my chin that would last for weeks and leave a red marks for months after.  I have tried all topicals rx, and oral antibiotics, and spiro has worked AMAZINGLY.  It took a little over a month for my skin to clear up.  I am still waiting for a couple of red marks to fade but once they are gone I will feel completely comfortable going without makeup for the first time in ages.  I have not had any increase in breast size or weight loss.  In fact, I think I have gained 5-7lbs since I started this med.  My diet and workout regimen has remained the same since I started (if anything, I have been working out more frequently to counteract the weight gain) so I am a little dissapointed about that. But I'd rather take a slight weight gain over cystic acne any day.

Go figure, it's also helping my BP and edema.  I've been on this med (50 mg 2x per day) for several months now and have already lost 10 lbs.  I'm 38 and haven't had a period since my early 20s, so it doesn't affect my period whatsoever.  As far as fatigue, I was always tired before I started taking the meds.  It DOES cause naseau and suppresses my appetite.

It took 2 months but now my skin is perfect (way better than it has been in my whole life)! I experienced some light headedness when standing after sitting for long periods, but I have experienced lighter periods and increased intensity of orgasms. I take it at night even though it suggest you not due to urination frequency. I usually have to get up anyway so no changes there.

I believe my cardiologist should have ordered periodic blood tests and paid attention to by decreased kidney function.  Now, instead of just having to deal with heart disease, I also have to deal with kidney disease.  I have an appointment to see my nephrologist in a week...I just hope it isn't too late.

Did have increase in dizzy spells not r/t to electrolyte changes. Dizzy spells would vary and then be very brief. Definitely had more fatigue/tiredness, seemed a little worsened by this med. After 4 months started to have decreased SD, not like me!! Decided to stop med since my acne is gone and side effects started to creep up. Side effects of cycle changes,dizziness, fatigue and SD issues went away in about 3-4 weeks.

Had very irregular periods, endometriosis and then DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma Insitu).  My belief is that the imbalance in my hormones during my life has caused most of these problems.  To finally control my cystic acne (post menopausal now), my dermatologist started me on 50mg of Spironolactone (a drug originally used as a diuretic).  After several weeks, we increased the dose to 100mg at night and that has cleared up my skin dramatically.  I feel that the good result is due to two things a) Spironolactone b) lessening of estrogen in my system due to menopause.Side effects:lost about 10 poundsdry mouth (make sure you brush your teeth and tongue often and drink plenty of water if you don't want bad breath)a little bit of tirednessI usually walk to work two to three times a week (4 miles one way) so my exercise habits have not suffered.I have not seen any changes in my hair.I have noticed some dizziness but very infrequent and it does not last long at all.I think this medication has been excellent for me due to what I believe to be the underlying cause of my acne.

However,I discovered that on lab rat testing, this drug was found to be a TUMORIGEN (TUMOR CAUSING)!!! Tumors were found to manifest on the endocrine organs and liver, and a &quot;significent increase&quot; of leukemia as well as thyroid, testicular, and mammary tumors, and uterine polyps in females.  This is VERY scary to discover! My doctor did not warn me of any of this before prescribing it to me nor was it on the caution insert from the pharmacy.  Although this drug has worked wonders for my acne, these risks don't seem worth it.  I found this info at rxlist.com 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	35-44	11/2/2009 7:59:19 PM	I take 100 mg of spiro a day for cystic acne.I have been taking it for a year. It seems to clear up my acne when nothing else has in 20+ years.  You must get blood work done while on this drug, too much potassium built up in your body could be fatal. I also notice that this med is very hard on your stomach, I believe I have developed an ulcer because of it, make sure you take it with food. Also if you don't drink enough water that is when you will get dizzy, drinking more will resolve that. It does work but it is a serious drug and not without side effects. I would only use it for moderate to severe acne not mild. One other note there was a study done that showed this drug caused cancer in lab mice in very high doses so if you are able to clear your acne up with a lower dose try to start out low. I am on 100mg but hope to drop down to 75mg and eventually 50mg.

My doctor stared me out with 50mg a day..  In the begining I was urinating a lot and was gettting quite dizzy upon standing up.  This was due to the lack of water..  You can correct it by drinking plenty of water all throughout the day..  2 yrs later, my hair started falling out so much..  Went to another doctor and he started me up at 200mg a day..  Since the day i started this medication at that dosage, my life has completely changed..  The side effects have been horrible..  I have shortness of breath, anxiety which leads to pannick attacks..  The medication gets my very tired and am now scared to do my everyday life.  I cant breathe so good so am scared to do anything that will make the breathing worse..  Xanax is the only thing that calms by shortness of breath..  I get sharp pains through my chest while breathing..  Have been to the hospital numerous of times cause of this medication..  I jsut wish I knew why it gives me the shortness of breathe..  I have been depressed cause of this.  I feel like Im not me anymore..  I am trying soooo hard to try to be able to cope wit hthe side affects, but I just cant anymore..  I have stopped the Spiro from time to time cause Im scared it would give me shortness of breathe at work..  I see new hairgrowth in my head, but still have a good amount of hairloss too..  I wish i didnt have this side effect..

It has not helped AT ALL.  Been on the medication for about 12 weeks and have noticed no changes.  Have not lost any weight -do not have to urinate anymore than usual, not really any more fatiqued either.  I have had some of the itching symptoms mentioned - but that's about it.  Going back to the endocrinologist in 2 weeks - hope she gives me something else because this just isn't working for me.  It is not bad - but definitely not good either!

I am 35 and have been taking it for just a few weeks now, but the side effects are so strong I am thinking of stopping.  I did not have bad acne before, my face does seem to look a bit clearer.  I seem to have lost a pound or two.  I had problems with dehydration before and was not sure about those meds.  I am constantly fatigued, I have shortnes of breath.  The smallest tasks takes a lot of energy out of me.  I get dizzy easily. If I get up to fast I see stars or loose visual, as of now I have not past out ...yet.  I do pee a lot more, and I am more thirsty.  I work out 2 times a week and after starting the meds almost was not able to finish my workout.  I had to stop frequently because of fatigue.  My chest felt tight, my heart raced (I am going to buy a heart rate monitor now).  I started skipping my meds the night before and morning of the workout, just to be able to make it through.  It helps, but I still have a really hard time.  I do seem down a lot more too.  I am on birth control pills, so my period only seemed a bit lighter this time around.  I try to stick with it for at least one or two month and then try to figure out if the benefit is worth the side effects....right now I feel the side effects are two much to deal with on a daily basis.

Disease of Ovaries with Cysts	SFgal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/29/2009 1:46:16 AM	I was diagnosed with PCOS about 15 years ago and after much trial and error with other medications, finally settled on Spironolactone as the best treatment for me.  I have been on this medication at least 12 years.  Initially I took 200mg/day but after about eight years it became less effective so my dosage was increased to 250mg/day which I'm still on.  While I'm concerned about the risks of long-term usage of this drug, the benefits have been significant enough that I keep taking it.  My worst symptom was the facial hair on my chin (looked like acne but was in fact infected hair follicles) that I plucked every night.  Spironolactone reduced the amount of hair by about 50% but not more.  Even after all these years I still have to pluck daily but its not as bad as it once was.  The other benefits are that it controlled my excessive testosterone levels which in turn let to weight loss, not as much depression, and no more excruciatingly long and painful periods (in fact I only get a few periods a year now which is fine with me!).  Ultrasound tests have shown my polycystic ovaries have less cysts than in the past before I started taking this drug.  My doctor's plan is for me to continue on 250/mg day until menopause.  However it is important to  keep up with the latest research on this drug to make sure it is not causing any long-term damage.
Aldosteronism	howardinla, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	65-74	7/22/2009 9:40:28 AM	I am a 69 year old male. Spironolactone is a very effective drug for me. After 20 years of treatment for hypertension, I was taking three different anti-hypertensives and four large (10 meq each) Potassium pills per day, and yet my body showed lots of edema, especially in the lower legs, and my BP was at best 150 / 90. The endocrinologist that I consulted initially had me take a number of tests for hyperaldosteronism, including an expensive CT scan to test for any adrenal tumor. All these tests came out negative. However, based on my hypokalemia, combined with high BP that was resistant to control, she tentatively diagnosed hyperaldosteronism anyhow, and then treated me for it with great success. I am now taking 100 mg of Spironolactone and 80 mg of Diovan (no Potassium). My BP averages around 120 / 80, and was lower previously at a higher dose of Diovan. My ankles are slim and trim, my Potassium level is in the normal range. In my case, it seems that the best diagnostic for hyperaldosteronism was a dramatic response to Spironolactone.  I experienced some breast development and tenderness, but that is now under control after my GP added Tamoxifin to my treatment regimen. I am also taking Byetta, an increased dose (40 mg) of Lipitor, and Androgel (Testosterone gel). The combination of Spironolactone plus the other medication changes have contributed these results: Weight 207, down 62 pounds. I no longer snore. My energy level is greatly improved. My recent blood test results included Triglycerides 39 [reference range &lt;150], Total Cholesterol 122 [reference range &lt;150], HDL Chol 44 [&gt;=40], LDL Chol 70[&gt;=40] , A1C = 5.7[reference &lt; 6 non-diabetic], Testerone, serum (total) 685[350-1030]. Of course, Spironolactone, Tamoxifen, and Byetta are drugs that have been variously been associated with risks of many serious side effects, but at my age these risks are worth the benefit.

Other	savvy1130, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	7/11/2009 12:38:11 AM	I began taking Spiro about 2 1/2 months ago for acne.  My derm prescribed it with a couple of creams (duac &amp; retin-A micro).  I'm not sure if my face is better because of the Spiro or the creams but it is better. Although, I should mention it was never really bad.  My problem with it...I'm experiencing lots of side effects in addition to the &quot;expected ones&quot; and contemplating stopping taking it. Here goes: muscle fatigue/soreness, joint pain, tired all the time, headaches, shortness of breath (only on occassion), trouble remembering things, irregular/missing periods, depression, and the most frustrating of all- crazy weight gain.  My body fat has increased about 10% and I've gained roughly 15 pounds. (I am a very active person and can definitley rule out nutrition/exericise as the cause of that).  I guess I don't know if what I'm experiencing is because of the Spiro or something else.  My general doctor is sending me to an endocrinologist for further testing. She thinks I may have poly-cystic ovarian syndrome, which has all of the symptoms I listed.  I guess part of the reason I'm so confused is because 1) my symptoms started about the same time I started taking Spiro but 2) Spiro is actually a medication used to treat PCOS.  My endo app is not for another month and a half.  I don't want to further confuse my body by stop taking it if I am going to end up taking it again in a couple of months. If I keep gaining weight though, I am going to have to stop.  I won't be able to take it.  Probably the reason I am depressed.  Anyways...Is anyone else experiencing this?  Thanks!!!

Male Pattern of Hair Distribution or Hirsutism in a Woman	hokiejean1010, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	55-64	6/13/2009 9:33:12 PM	This was prescribed for hair loss that started out of the blue when I turned 57. I only took 50 mg once a day and in 6 months, hair loss has reduced and some regrowth has occurred. So that's great. But in the same 6 months, I gained 15 months with no explanation. No increase in food intake and same level of exercise. I have to stop the pill in order to get weight under control. Has anyone tried something else for female hair loss that works? Weight gain has been awful as clothes don't fit and terrible for morale and mindset.

This was my second try at this medication with the same results. Sweating, extreme fatigue, bad thoughts, restless legs with obvious aching, no energy, disturbed sleep (frequent waking and getting up); with constant running nose, you know. These symptoms declined very much the very first day I did not take Spironolactone.

Other	Tree, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/26/2009 5:24:33 PM	I have been taking this drug for one month and I am overjoyed with how well it has cleared up my acne.  I read the posts because I have had a few side effects that seem to be consistent with the reviews.For instance, I am 30 y.o. and run marathons.  Since taking the medicine I have lost 5 pounds from 122 to 117 (I am 5'5&quot;).  I have no appetite. . .  at all. Therefore, I am having a hard time running.  I am not sure if it because I am not eating as much or because of the medicine.  I also had a crazy period this month, I was bleeding to death for one day, and it was non existent for the other days.  However, PMS is now completely gone which is awesome!  Hangovers are insane ever since I have been taking this drug.  I guess I should just stop drinking.Overall, I am just concerned that I am not going to be able to keep my active lifestyle.  Has anyone else had this problem?

Kinda freaked out when derm told me that it would &quot;feminize the fetus&quot; if taken during pregnancy, as it blocks male hormones, altering the devlp. of a male baby. This bewilders me! Never heard of such a thing. Has anyone become dehydrated from this as it is a diuretic? I read it causes tumors in lab animals...any experience with this?  Will it work as effectively if taken at night to avoid the sleepy factor? Why do some people report weight gain while others report the opposite?...so frustrating to know what to expect and what is at risk!

My blood pressure has increased greatly (from low to prehypertension), which I'm assuming is from the birth control, I have to urinate frequently, get dizzy spells and occassional headaches.  I lost five pounds when I started taking spiro.  I'm going to talk to my doc and see what other options there are.

I am allergic to most antibiotics and am trying to avoid taking Accutane, so in July 2008 I started taking Spironolactone 100mg/day, Evoclin foam in the morning, and Retin-A Micro at night. At first my face erupted with acne but after about 1 month my face cleared up beautifully. It took about 6 months for my period to regulate, but over the past 9 months of taking it, my face has never been more clear, my breasts have enlarged, I lost about 10 pounds, and I don't have the raging PMS anymore. Now my dermatologist wants me to lower the dose to 50mg/day...she says the recommendation is to take the lowest dose possible, so she wants to lower it and see if the acne comes back--if it does, she will raise it again. I don't want to lower the dose because I've never looked and felt better. Has anyone else had long-term problems with this medication or lowered their dose like I am doing?

I have been taking Spiro for 6 months (100mg/2x day)for hair thinning and adult acne. After 3 months I could tell a big improvement in my acne. After three months, I added a low estrogen Birth control Pill, Yasmin, for Estrogen supplementation (I take them for 3 months straight without taking the light colored ones, no period for 3 months). . The results have been clearer skin, thicker hair, several pounds of weight loss, and my breast increased a full cup. I could even tell a sottening of my facial. The side effects are bad foot/leg cramps periodically, going to bathroom several times a night,some hot flashes at night and some spotting due to not taking my Birth Control at a consistent time each night.

Before I had been taking HCZT for my blood pressure, and that had depleted my potassium.  I have noticed no negative side effects, and some positive ones: such as, a decrease in stray facial hairs and a decrease in menstrual flow.  I am very satisfied with this medication.  Also, occasionally, I've taken my second dose after 6 pm, and I've never yet, had to get up in the middle of the night to urinate.

However, negative side effects for me are dry skin, sleepiness and dry, dark period.  I'm going to speak to the derm about the period issue as that concerns me the most. The best side-effect is that the &quot;angry pms&quot; ceases to exist and no painful bloating.  I hope there are no long term side effects.

As another user related after 4 months it caused an unrelenting burning itch like millions of fire ants dancing on my extremities.  This was relieved by an injection by MD.  In 4 months it returned with another injection by MD for relief.  MD recommended twice to reduce to 1/2 but I quickly ballooned so he had me resume 1 tablet.  I will begin tomorrow to reduce 25-25 TMYL to 1/2 tablet and then stop the medication if no adverse effects.

I was diagnosed with it when i was 16, i had lost almost half my hair. We had tried everything else before that, checking the water that runs through the showers, to taking more calcium, protein, iron etc. nothing worked. Switching shampoos does not help. Rogane is not going to work unless you leave it set in your hair over night. Otherwise you wash the product off before it can react. Im now 18 and my hair has grown back, not completely but more than 1/2 of what i lost.

Other	desi08, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	1/18/2009 12:32:35 AM	I was prescribed spironolactone for adult acne (I'm 28), along with Bactrim (antibiotic), and I've been taking it for about 3 months now. Before this I had tried several different types of antibiotics and almost every topical cream and nothing worked well. I've been really happy so far. I used to get cyst like acne on my chin and after about 1 1/2 months of being on spironolactone, this went away and I haven't really broken out since then. I do still have marks from old acne that hasn't faded yet, though. For me, I didn't experience things like my acne getting worse before getting better or any side effects. I also started Yasmin about a month into taking spironolactone, so I think it may be the combination of both that worked for me. I would recommend trying it.

It did make my skin less oily and controlled acne along my jawline. But certainly not worth the side effects. And I wouldn't recommend drinking alcohol with this drug. It can make you very sick.

It also seems to have been the reason why Im so sleep all the time. Im not sure I could handle an increased dosage but I may stay on the the drug for the acne as it has helped so much

My gynecologist is the one who actually prescribed it after I was just mentioning my problems and never finding a cure with a dermatologist.  My family doctor, however, did not really approve of this drug for acne and said it was not common to prescribe this drug for acne.  I agree or it wouldn't have taken 10 yrs. for someone to finally recommend it to me!!!  I love it!!!  The only side effect I've experienced is breast tenderness and that didn't start until about 4 mos. into taking the medication.

My dosage is 100mg once daily. when my Dr. prescribed this drug I believe it was intended for dual use to work in conjuction with a beta blocker, 10mg of Propranolol 2x daily and both together, if I have my information correct to help keep my Systolic pressure to 90mmHg or lower so the pressure in the varicies veins that I have in my esophegess and my stomach will remain low to avoid any upper GI bleeds which have already occurred twice. But, I guess the point I originally started to make about this drug was that I believe I was told at some point that there is a small amount of estrogen in the Spironolact. I am a 49 yr old male, I am 5' 8&quot; weigh 147 lbs and I don't know how else to say it except I am starting to grow prubesent boobs that are sore as hell and I cant get a Dr. to give me a straight answer on this! I think its funny to them! I admit I've had to laugh, but honestly it's not really funny and hurts like hell. So by all means Men go ahead and use this drug, just be careful of the dosage or we might be seeing each other in the women's undie isle at the local J.C.Penney! Sad but true, besides the Cirrhosis i am fortunate enough to have a laundry list such as Emphasema, Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis,And was back in the hospital last week where they gave me a new diagnosis of Diabetes! I guess there is the possibility that with all the med's I take , not just the Spironolact that the combination could be causing my &quot;unusual condition&quot; Lol! sorry to end on a sour note but at least I'll more than likely be taking my dirt nap before I have to worry about a &quot;B&quot; cup!

Before Spiro, my face would be covered with deep and painful cysts due to acne.  I especially had problems on my chin, forehead, and hollows of my cheeks.  I take two 75 mg doses a day.  The acne and redness has been reduced drastically! I get a few pimples with PMS but they are not painful and clear up quickly.  My forehead and hair are not as greasy as they used to be.  No side effects to speak of except dry skin on my hands/feet.  Plus, I need to make sure I stay hydrated. It did take 2 months, taking the medication daily, for me to see real results.  Overall, I'm extremely happy with this medication.  I just wished I would have found it sooner!  P.S.I do not have insurance but was able to purchase a 50 day supply for $22.  It's pretty reasonably priced for a prescription medication.

I now have people telling me i have porcelian skin! Never would I thought I would hear this in my lifetime! It is amazing! Although, my dermatologist told me that when I plan to have kids, I need to go off of it because it blocks the make horomone, and if I were to get preggo with a boy, it would not exactly be a boy. So I am now doing more research seeing how it can affect you in the long run, seeing as I take it everyday. Has anyone ever heard of this being true before? I have also never experienced the side effects of this drug!

Lowers my systolic by 6 mmHg and diastolic by 2.7 mmHg. Indapamide lowers my K so I needed more Aldactone but my doc refused claiming that I will not like its side effects higher than 25 mg doses! Doc added to my potassium supplements instead. But my analysis shows only more Aldactone will be able to keep my K&gt;4 mmol/L. My target K is 4.5-5 mmol/L. i need higher K in order to lower my serum glucose (GLUF) and have to experiment with 13500 mg/day K supplement for a month to know if my K will stay &gt; 4.5 or i must increase my Aldactone or lower Indapamide.

I was also prescribed Finacea 50 grams to apply on face once a day.  My lower part of the face is full of acne around my chin, and to each side of the chin.  Also one or two on my neck.  I've never broke out this much even before, when I felt I had acne issues.  My doctor says it sometimes gets worse before it gets better, it's normal.  I'm hating life right now!  Since they were coming up in bunches she thought it might have gotten infected and for 10 days she prescribed me Cephalexin 500 mg.  Today I took the last of the Cephalexin.  Please someone tell me if they started off this way and now have a clear or almost clear face.  Side Affects-I pee a lot, I get head aches once in a while, light headed if I get up to quick, and my breasts are tender.  None are too bad, but noticeable.

Male Pattern of Hair Distribution or Hirsutism in a Woman	virgolove, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	11/28/2008 8:27:28 PM	I have been taking this medicine (100mg/day)for two weeks. after depression, insecurity, and ruined relationships I am so relieve find a hope for all of this manly hair (hirsutism). so far it has been working great. i take sprintec so the two are a great combo. the hairs on my face are so much thinner and the hair bumps (from years of shaving &amp; plucking) on my chest are flattening. im just keeping my fingers crossed that this is it. 
High Blood Pressure	sherried, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	11/17/2008 7:37:10 AM	It seems to me that all Spironolactone is not created equally.  My experience with this medication was very different depending on the lab that manufactured it!  For three years I have taken 50mg twice a day made by MYLAN lab without noticing any side effects except urgent urination.  Recently the pharmacy gave me Spironolactone manufactured by GREENSTONE LTD. and I have a whole host of new symptoms. They include extreme thirst, headache, joint and muscle aches &amp; pains throughout my body, severe lower back pain, and dry eyes.  If you're having side-effects I'd suggest trying a different manufacturer!

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	19-24	10/27/2008 12:06:27 AM	My dermotologist perscribed this for my acne. Everything was going fine for the first 2 1/2 weeks that I was taking it (100 mg per day). I did have slight muscle soreness in my legs and you definitely pee a lot, but there was nothing to be concerned with.  BUT, after taking spiro. for 3 weeks, my whole body started itching very very intensely. The itching was so bad that I couldn't sleep or do anything other than scratch for days. I obviously stopped taking the pill immediately. In the past, I have been very sensitive to medication (especially antibiotics)...so if you are sensitive to medication, I highly recommend being cautious while taking this medicine. I will definitely be sticking to topical creams and other treatments from now on. 
Other	kiki, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/21/2008 5:30:00 PM	This drug is horrible! I was put on by my dermatologist for acne. After three weeks, I need to stop. I have had severe cramping, vomiting, dizziness and tiredness. The final straw was a second period within a week of finishing my first one. I will find another (topical) way of dealing with my acne. This is not worth it. Beware! 
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	10/8/2008 10:28:51 PM	I has opposite side effects.I was perscribed the medication for acne and was only able to stand taking it for about 3 weeks.  My abdomen hurt all the time, I urinated alot but my bladder never felt empty.  My breasts got so tender that I had to stop running at the gym for a while.  The last straw was gaining 12 pounds in 2 weeks.  Since stopping the medication 2 weeks ago I am beginning to feel better.  The weight is just starting to go back off.  Another side effect is that I just began my second period this month.  It has really messed up my system and I regret the day I ever took this medication.
Other	Are generics the same?, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	25-34	10/2/2008 3:02:44 PM	Have been on 100 mg/day for couple of years - prescribed for hair loss - Ok results, but also cleared up my skin beautifully.  Began taking generic version (white oval pill, mint flavor), then because of insurance change had to take a different generic version (round white pill).  The round pill did nothing - my face began to break out badly and i noticed soem hair loss.  So now my doc prescribed the non-generic (expensive) pill (round, peach-colored) and my face is cleared up again.  Has anyone else gone through this knid of experience with spironolactone/aldactone?  i had always thought that generics were idenital to the name-brand, but apparently not.

I wanted to stop taking after the 1st few months b/c of dizziness and popping ears. I figured out the key, though, is making sure you're drinking PLENTY OF WATER daily. I haven't had those side effects since. It takes a while for the drug to show it's working, but after 6 months I am starting to see significant improvement. It also cleared up my skin! I do get night sweats sometimes, but I just sleep with the fan on. I haven't had any sexual side effects at all. I can't stress enough how important water is in helping the side effects! Maybe that will help you too!

It &quot;blocks&quot; hormones from the adrenal glands and has worked well.  Dose of 50 mg/da BPs finally well under control after trying different BP meds over the years.  Gynecomastia, cough, dry throat,loss of labido, increased blood sugars all side effects for me.  Now diagnosed with diabetes.  I also take only a 25 mg dose of Atenolol and wonder about interactions.  I am on no other medications.  I also just had an abnormal EKG and see that listed as possible side effect.  Unsure of long term use resultant problems.  Blood pressures are great, but at age 60 now, wonder if I am experiencing problems caused by using Sprionolactone or am just &quot;falling apart&quot;.  I am active and hope to remain so.  Now my doctor has added Metformin for the blood sugars.  Still I question possible side-effects from the Spironolactone having been on it for so long now.  Have to weigh out benefits versus side effects.  Maybe it's just life after turning 60!  Hope not.

But dropped Maxize because I was diagnosed with gout recently. I only take 25mg but it doesn't  work. My doc added more pills to control my BP. Now I take this one, Atenolol and Lisinopril and my BP is still around 150/95.I've on Spironolactone for about 1 month and with the others for more than 2 weeks. At first the side effect was so bad, dizziness, headaches and hot flash/night sweat. I could barely function. It went away about 12 days later. I want to go back to Maxize but I have had 3 gout flare-ups since 12/07 withvery careful diet for gout. Doc said to give it time to see if it can lower my BP.

Big mistake!  I've had lots of head and neck pain, lightheadedness while working out, irritibility that I'm about 90 percent sure is due to the meds, and worst of all lost the capacity to have an orgasm.  Whoever mentioned that their clitoris basically became numb, well, mine too, in a matter of about four days!  I won't be continuing;  I'm a little worried about what might happen next, and I'd prefer to be bald and sexually functional...

High Blood Pressure	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	7/3/2008 12:43:43 PM	I have been on Spironolactone for a few years when my other diaretic taken for HBP caused low potassium.  I too have had pain in my back around my kidneys that I attributed to age, and activity.  I have also developed a cough, that is very annoying. A few years ago I had developed the same coughing which a PA diagnosed as reflux,she put me on Prilosec 2X day for 6 weeks. It helped only a little, and a barium swallow test showed no reflux.  I stoped the hydroclorathazide and it went away.  I am wondering if the spironolactone is doing the same thing.  Also have decreased sexual drive, very tired, and back ache around my left kidney, again attributing to being age 58.  I am now rethinking all my side effects.  My BP is definately under control. However, I think that a very low salt diet would be better than all this coughing all the time.Back to different ENT soon, will be interesting to hear his diagnosis.
Low Amount of Potassium in the Blood	AB, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	6/9/2008 12:32:31 AM	I was changed from Maxzide to this drug to stop the problems with low blood potassium (I take 3-20 MEQ tabs a day--this is hereditary).  The Maxzide was originally prescribed to prevent migraines (symptoms of my brain floating in water in my head, swelling of fingers and feet) but my new Dr felt that the Maxzide was contributing to my low potassium problems. I started to take this drug with Lyrica (yes, I have had fibromyaligai for 30 years and IBS).  To make a long story short, this drug caused extreme lightheadedness and dizziness.  At times I felt I couldn't focus and I wasn't in control of my mental state (I've never had that feeling except for one pain drug--vicodin--that I was given for migraine pain 20+ years ago. It also caused swelling of fingers, hands, feet, and legs, and headaches. I blamed all of this on my Lyrica and just needing to get used to it.  But, even though I only took 25 mg one time per day it really did interact with me. It really seemed to interact with my Lyrica causing disorientation-I'd get up at night and be so dizzy I couldn't walk, I'd end up in the wrong place in the house, bash into into things and almost fall down, have difficulty waking in the morning. I also woke up with a sore throat every morning like some reported. I also had some swelling in areas I certainly did not expected (sexual organs).  After a month, I went back to the Maxzide.  My only problem left--tension headaches, probably caused by the stress I am under and my fibromyalgia.

Surprised to see so many others have also been prescribed it. Use for acne is never listed as one of its uses in journals and no healthcare professional has heard of this use (except for the one who prescribed it.) Only bad side effect for me is the peeing. Can't take it before road trips and have to get up once during sleep regardless of how much I've had to drink. Otherwise would highly recommend it. Don't use Accutain unless you truly have bad cystic acne. I was given Accutain prior to aldactone and my acne came back and on top of that I'm always hot ever since I took Accutain. It changed my internal body temp and it's awful being hot when all the other women are cold. What's up with that anyway? I can't stand all these cold girls. Go put on a sweater!

No problem side effects at all. Realize that while the drug does increase urination, you can't skimp on water intake as a way to avoid this!  The oil production on my skin is dramatically decreased therefore I my breakouts (mild and cystic) have stopped.  I am definitely keeping spiro as part of my anti-acne program.

One night extreme vomiting with headache and leg cramping.  Dizziness so bad that I fell off a ladder in my living room cleaning a high shelf.  Felt about two feet on my rear end.  Extremely unhappy with this medication, and would rather have high blood pressure then continue with it.  Sexual desire disappeared.

Other	29olives, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/21/2008 10:57:28 AM	I was prescribed this medication for acne and have been on it for less than a month. While it works slowly, it does work.  You just have to be patient as it builds up in your body.  My dermo also prescribed me prednisone (steroid) so the acne goes away faster and gives spironolactone time to work.  While prednisone is a miracle drug (acne will go away within the 6-day taper cycle), it has side effects with the spironolactone.  I just got a UTI and started to have blood in my urine that I'm having checked out today.  Just be careful if your doctor prescribes these two drugs together.  I never had problems when I did prednisone but with the spironolactone, it has a strange reaction.

It has reduced the redness and swelling of the large cysts and the redness associated with my topical meds. I also take an antibiotic and use Retin-A. It does make me urinate more frequently but not to the point of being a problem. It did reduce/eliminate some of my chin and lip hairs. I don't have a huge problem in this area but it was a nice bonus to taking this medication.

The downside is that I wake up in the morning and I have the worst sore throat in the world.  The medicine tastes like mints, but you have to take them with a full glass of cold water. I would recommend this medication to anyone who has acne problems.  It has taken the redness out of my skin and the benefits outweigh the side effects.

My heart tried to stop beating and my body was shutting down. I'm taking 100 MG twice daily and am keeping potassium levels up thanks to this med.

It is used to treat an increase of fluid pressure in my ears which causes constant vertigo.  My doctor and I finally found this drug and it helps control my vertigo on a daily basis.  Although it effects my mentral cycle I have been quite happy with having virtually no symptoms while taking the drug.  The only part I am not crazy about is the fact I have to take it twice a day.  I usually forget the afternoon dose.  I use this medicine and I have been going to Physical Therapy.  I don't think I would be as successful at PT if I didn't use this medication at the same time.
Male Pattern of Hair Distribution or Hirsutism in a Woman	Karen, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	10/26/2007 11:19:48 PM	I never felt that I had side-effects.  My hair was falling out - had a tubal ligation and all my hormones went wacky.  After 6 months, it did stop my hair from falling out by the handfuls.  I have been taking it for about ten years.  The first thing I noticed was that where before I had PMS that I wanted to kill someone.  I immediately stopped with this.  I never saw it as a treatment for PMS, but I highly recommend it.  This shouldnt be a consideration, but if you feel puffy - it just takes care of all that.
