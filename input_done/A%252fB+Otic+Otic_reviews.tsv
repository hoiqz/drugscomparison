Earache	7-12 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	4	5	Male	7-12	4/23/2009 9:08:43 PM	My 11 yo son had an ear infection and fluid in his ear.  He has a high threshold of pain.  When I took him to the doc he was mad because he thought I had waited to long to bring him in it was so bad.  But, he had just started complaining the night before and he was in a lot of pain (quick).  Very unlike him to be in pain.  He also has a lot of earwax.  I gave him the drops and within an hour he stopped complaining and crying.
