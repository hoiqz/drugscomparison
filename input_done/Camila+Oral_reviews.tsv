Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	7/16/2012 2:41:22 PM	I had been on the combination pill before taking Camila but it gave me many side effects. Headaches, vision problems, sore breasts, and bloating. I even had a possibly TIA incident using the combination pill so I decided to try a mini pill instead. My doctor prescribed me Camila and I have had no side effects with this pill. It is however very important that you take it at the exact time every day. I took mine 1.5 hours late one day which resulted in about 5 days of spotting :-( Other than that one time tho I have no bloating, no headaches, and my mood swings have no ended!Very satisfied.

I love this pill, I have had zero side effects and nothing to complain about. I think it's a lot easier on the body than the 'regular combination birth control pills'. Just set a time to take it daily and you'll be fine. I'd rather remember to pop a tiny pill every day than have a baby - just my take on it.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	19-24	6/10/2012 2:38:58 PM	Four days ago I went to the pharmacy to pick up my normal refill of the nora-b tablet. They gave me Camila instead, but noticing it was also a PoP I figured it was nearly the same and said nothing. I started taking it Thursday and the past four days have been a nightmare. I can't concentrate on simple things, I'm crying for things I normally would never cry about, I'm easily angry, I feel &quot;off&quot; like I'm about to either get sick or get my period, and I am just...totally not myself at all. I don't feel like moving, I have a rash on my knee, and this is all since I started taking Camila. I called my pharmacist today and he told me that sometimes its common to have an allergic reaction to its inactive ingredients and to stop it and call my gyno tomorrow, which is what I'm doing. 
Birth Control	Shy1_2007, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	6/6/2012 8:28:11 PM	I was on this pill for 4 months. My gyn put me on it because when I went to see her I always had high blood pressure. After reading about it on here and other sites I noticed alot of people having the same problems as me. My hair was falling out in handfuls, I was always EXTREMELY moody(one of the reasons I went on Camila was because I was VERY moody a week before I'd start, I'd cry at the drop of a dime, I had headaches all the time(I had rarely had a headache before), and I had HORRIBLE cramps(before they were bad but with this bc they were untolerable.) The only pro was that the longer I took this bc the shorter my period got. I went back to my gyn and she told me to try a gulten free diet. I went to my regualr physican who took me off and we are trying out YAZ, he said there is alot of bad rep but he hasn't seen any problems. I've been on it for a month and half and so far no problems and my period is only 3 days and my cramps are bareable!!:) 
Birth Control	AbbyT, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	5/2/2012 11:20:31 PM	I switched from the Nuva ring (which I used for 4 years) to Camila and am very happy. For some weird reason (probably b/c I am now over 35), I started to have a decrease in energy while using the Nuva ring and severe bloating around the time my period was to start. Now, since switching to Camila, my energy is way up, sex drive is much better, and it has curved my hunger to where I have to remind myself to eat. I would have to say that the only two negative things I have noticed is that I am a little more snappy (irritable) at times, and it is a pain to remember to take my pill at the same time every night. Other than that, I like it.
Birth Control	Addy, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	4/26/2012 7:21:32 PM	I have been on this pill for about a month and a half now.  I was on Sprintec before and switched to this to up my libido.  I feel it has a little.  However, I do get slight headaches every so often and nipple tenderness.  What freaks me out a little is how emotional I have been getting.  Either ready to cry in an instant or ready to punch someone (little exaggerated) who stole my spot at the aerobics class.  SO unlike me!!! I am gonna stay on it for 3 months.  No hair loss.....yet....I have long straight hair that normally comes out.  Can feel my ovaries towards my period.  My boyfriend has been noticing that change too.  I keep telling him that the time may come where forms of protection may have to fall into his hands and not mine.  So sick of pills!
Birth Control	Sleepy pie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	4/12/2012 12:27:55 AM	Okay, this may be a little to early to comment. But I am in week 6 of taking this pill, I recently switched from ortho-tricyclen lo due to severe migraines and cramping. My doctor recommended I should try something without estrogen to lessen the migraines.Since I started this pill I have had only one migraine, a few days after the switch, it was not anywhere near as severe and also did not last as long. Compared to the frequent miserable migraines I had previously, this has been Heaven.There has not been any cramping either.My libido has increased and sexual anxiety has decreased.I am finding self-lubrication is increased when before I could not self-lubricate for sex.I have not had my period or any spotting. And I consider this to be a plus as I never enjoyed having a period anyway.Additionally, I am not experiencing more discharge, as was mentioned in other reviews. But I have noticed that my vagina is more fragrant so I am choosing to shower more frequently.I have not had increased hair loss or increased facial hair, as some reviewers mentioned.I have no symptoms that are newly acquired since I switched to this pill, including pregnancy.So I'm happy with it's effectiveness.I will say remembering to take it within at the same time each day (within one hour) is somewhat miserable, but I have managed.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	4/2/2012 3:17:07 AM	Switched to this BC because of high blood pressure. Didn't get my period for the first 4 months, which was awesome. But then Karma struck and had it 4 times in one pack. Also broke out everywhere and started losing my hair. It was an awful experience switching asap.

Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	3/21/2012 9:50:07 AM	I started on Camila because of my high blood pressure.I started the pill on the first day of my period like the directions said. I've always had a regular cycle until starting this pill! Since I've been on it for a few months I havd taken 2 pregnancy test. One month for not having a period and a couple months later for being over 10 days late. I decided to get off the pill and take my chances with other forms of birth control. I stopped taking them the first day of my last period. Now I am still waiting for this months cycle and I am 10 days late. Guess it's back to the store for another pregnancy test! I thought getting off the pill would bring my cycle back to normal. I don't know about you but I don't like not knowing when my period is going to come! 
Birth Control	HirEdu, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/14/2012 12:03:36 PM	I take this pill because the regular birth control pills cause extreme nausea. I have been taking this medication for almost three years. While I did experience slight hair thinning initially, that has since dissipated. I take it every morning as soon as I wake up. If I don't, I get a littly testy. That's when I remember to take it. I have a regular period every 28 days, like clockwork. I am happy and pregnancy-free. 
Birth Control	crystala, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	3/8/2012 7:40:52 PM	I've been on this pill for 5 months and have had no issues other than irregular periods.  I am now 2 days late, and freaking out, although my pregnancy test was negative.  My last 3 periods were erratic, 2 within 2 weeks of each other, so I'm wondering if I will stop having a period with Camila.  I went for 5 years with no period when I had the Mirena IUD. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	19-24	3/3/2012 4:47:05 PM	For the first month on this pill I had my period every two weeks and they lasted a very long time.  It felt like I had my period for the entire month.  My doc told me to stick with it so the hormones can even themselves out.  I havent had a period for a few weeks so its looking good.  I have had a lot of nipple soreness and cramps w/ no period, and based on these reviews it seems this is fairly common. 
Birth Control	eyeballs, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	2/29/2012 2:01:42 PM	I take Camila because I am at a high risk for throwing blood clots and need a birth control that does not contain estrogen. I'm 20 years old and am on week 6 of the pill. What I noticed right away was a complete change in vaginal flora. Forgive me for sounding all spiritual and hippy-dippy, but my vagina doesn't seem like my own anymore and I cannot 'connect' to it, which is very distressing to me. The other &quot;big thing&quot; that makes me want to discontinue use is the crazy headaches Camila produces. I am a person who is not very headache prone, and has never had a migraine. Within the past 2 weeks I've been getting headaches 4 - 7 times a week! Just the other day I had to stay home from work because my head hurt so badly I could barely open my eyes. Another distressing side effect is my decreased sex drive. This may not bother others, but it is important to me. Also, I pretty much feel as though I'm PMS-ing all the time, though with this particular birth control method you never know when your period is coming. I also have VERY heavy discharge on this pill, which bothers me because I typically discharge a lot anyway, and with Camila it's increased so much and I think it's pretty gross. Even with a pantiliner I feel 'wet' and gross all the time, it's quite unpleasant. The side effects I've experienced that I consider deal breakers are: change in vaginal flora, severe and frequent headaches, lowered libido, depression, chest pain, one breast is more swollen than the other causing them to appear uneven, backaches, acne on my face and back, increased discharge, and an increase in moodiness. Some side effects that don't bother me as much: change in appetite, mild weight gain, mild nausea, and sore muscles. I have had one period on the pill, and it was the heaviest period I've ever had, but it only lasted about 3 days. During my next appointment with my gynecologist, I am going to explore other options, perhaps the shot. At least I'm not pregnant, though!!!!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	19-24	1/4/2012 6:39:27 PM	Was on Camila for 4 months. Light breakthrough bleeding for the first few weeks, then I had my period when I was supposed to. Then I didn't have my period through the next 4 months. After about month 2 my sex drive started to go down and I got extremely dry so much so that I couldn't have sex. I went off of this pill because there was no point to being on the pill when I couldn't have sex! Other than that, my hair was starting to thin, my skin and eyes were also dry, and I felt kind of moody/emotional.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	12/30/2011 7:52:24 PM	I have been on this pill now for 4 months to treat the beginning stages of endometriosis. It has made my period so much lighter and my cramps almost disappear. The symptoms of my condition are under control and are not nearly as painful as before. I have not gained any weight or had any other serious side effects from this. Like many other users, I do often feel irritable and on edge, but nothing extreme. I am very glad my doctor prescribed this to me. 
Birth Control	UnHappy Mama, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	19-24	12/2/2011 11:11:33 AM	I was put on this pill until I could get the implanon put in. I have been on this pill for 4 months. I have a 4 month old daughter. I took my pill like it was my job. My doctor informed me at a visit the other day that I am pregnant. I am very unhappy with this method of BC.
Birth Control	lbruno, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	5	3	2	Female	25-34	11/30/2011 10:25:36 PM	Ladies, I was put on this pill b/c I get bad migraine's. The only other option, that I am aware of, is an IUD, which my GYN said came along w/3 months of bad cramps, comprable to after childbirth cramping... I've been on this pill for a little over 1 year now, I have gained over 65lbs. w/no changes in my diet or physical activity. I get so tired, worse than when I was 9 mos pregnant. &amp; at times, most of the time, I am ready 2 snap, always on guard, always defensive, always feeling lonely or like i'm being attacked, I have no social life, I have lost many friends simply b/c I feel either 2 fat 2 go out or I am so stressed out that I just don't feel like hearing about anyone else's day. This is a horrible experience &amp; I would not recommend it to anybody. Is there any other options besides the IUD?
Birth Control	Ruthie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	25-34	11/26/2011 11:47:59 PM	I started taking Camilla the first day my period started.  My period was heavy and painful.  I have taken the pill within the same hour faithfully for a full 28 days and started my period like clock work and it is much better than last month.  I have never experienced a period with so little cramping!  I had no spotting in between although I have experienced an increase in normal discharge throughout the month.  My libido has not been effected.  I am happy with this pill.  I am taking it because I have migraines and can't take estrogen
Birth Control	Red, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	11/9/2011 2:32:37 PM	I've been on this for three weeks and it's awful. I'm super bloated, have headaches, and have been depressed since I started it. My breasts were very painfully tender and I've been bleeding for the whole time I've been on it. My doctor said my body is adjusting, but this is crazy. I'm going to quit it. 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/7/2011 2:38:09 PM	i'm on week 5 of this drug.  i started taking it as soon as i got it from the pharmacy, which was mid my original cycle.  i got my period like normal.  two weeks later and i'm spotting, but, nothing different from other pills.  i get spurts (one or two days of spurts of tears and anger) of 'hormone craziness' as my bf calls it, but other than that i'm pretty happy.  my boobs have grown and i have normal cravings as is always the case with new bc pills.  this is the definitely the best pill i've taken.
Birth Control	The Lex, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	25-34	10/27/2011 11:53:06 AM	I've been on Camila for 3 weeks tomorrow. I had the Implanon removed due to bad headaches and loss of libido. I've been experiencing horrible cramps lately but no bleeding yet.  Also I gained almost 7lbs in 10 days (not normal for me). I'm extremely bloated but my libido is coming back slowly but surely.  I'll still continue to use it as I need more than 3 weeks to see if this is a keeper.
Other	me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	10/26/2011 1:14:54 PM	it did not work, my piriod come every other week in less than a month and the doc. give me this to bee regular. (realy)  I stop after 1.5 pack
Birth Control	Lilly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	25-34	10/14/2011 11:58:58 PM	I took this for a month and stopped. I started bleeding the day after I took the first one- when I'd just had my period the week beforer- and didn't stop until I quit taking them. Had horrible cramps and felt like I was losing my mind within a couple of days of starting Camila. Mood swings (which I'd never had before) and headaches every day. Not worth the trouble. There are too many other options.

I got switched from a combination pill because i smoke and im over 35. Im bloated, crabby, and balding. I also got my period a week before i was supposed to and it lasted longer than normal. Needless to say i threw out my two remaining months. don't know what im going to do now but at this point i would rather be celebate than take this awful pill!        
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	9/21/2011 3:11:31 AM	My doctor prescribed this to me because I have a condition called Erythema Nodosum which causes large red bumps (similar to fresh bruises) to appear all over your legs, usually due to excess estrogen. It cleared that up no problem, but everything else it caused was much worse. I had heavier periods, the worst cramping of my life, terrible acne the week before my period, mild depression, and if I missed a single pill, I could guarantee my period would hit within 36 hours. Talk about an irregular cycle. I switched off after 9 months and I'll never be going back. I'll take a few red bumps on my legs, thanks.
Birth Control	K. M. , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	19-24	9/15/2011 6:14:43 AM	While I did not get pregnant, I will not be continuing this.  Here are the side effects I had that I could have endured:  decreased breast size (1 cup), moderate breast tenderness, slight scalp hair thinning, slightly increased facial hair, and increased mood swings during mid-cycle.  These weren't too bad for me, and if there were the only side effects I probably would still use it.  I switched to a different form of birth control for two main reasons.  First, I had amenorrhea (no periods)for 11 months followed by a heavy period that lasted 9 days with severe cramping.  On the first 2 days of the period, I took ibuprofen but still was doubled over in pain for about five hours each day. My gyno told me that I could expect irregular periods or amenorrhea, but the surprise period after 11 months was annoying, and I found the cramps nearly unbearable. I would not want to continue if all my subsequent periods were so heavy and painful.  Second, I developed pretty severe cystic acne on this. Without medication, my skin was usually clear with mild breakouts of 2 or 3 small pimples before my period.  On this, I developed oily skin that was also very sensitive to acne medications.  I had multiple blackheads and whiteheads all the time, even with moderate strength treatments that included salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, retinols, and sulfur. I usually also had at least one very inflammed, painful, and red cystic pimple at all times.  Sometimes I would have 4 or 5 at once!  These did not respond to any treatments my dermatologist and I tried, so he recommended I change birth control.  This may seem minor, but I have pale skin, and now it is speckled with red ghost-like scars of these zits.  I have never had acne that left pitted acne scars before, and now I have at least 5 scars.  It may seem superficial, but this was honestly the deal breaker for me.  It's also annoying to worry about taking it at exactly the same time.  If you vomit or have diarrhea, it doesn't protect.
Other	Endo girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	9/3/2011 12:38:13 AM	I take the Mini pill to halt the growth of my endometriosis.  I'm unable to take birth control with estrogen because I suffer from migraines. I just started this pill last month and am about 2 weeks into my second pill case.  I've had been bleeding non stop since August 15th and today is September 3rd.  Has anyone else had this problem?My doctor said this can be a side affect and it should regulate soon but I can't take the bleeding anymore....its enough blood where I soak super tampons in a couple hours.
Birth Control	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1		25-34	8/31/2011 4:41:07 PM	At first I had my period every other week on Camila.  I figured it would just take time for my body to adjust and then things would regulate.  Then I went for a month and a half with nothing.  Now, I'm on my second 2 week period in 5 weeks.  This pill has been an absolute nightmare and I would never suggest for any one with options to use it.  Before viewing the other comments on this page I figured that my hair had gotten more course because I just had a baby.  But, now I think it probably has more to do with this damn pill.

My Dr. recommended this because I have High Blood Pressure and Migraines. On top of me getting breakthrough bleeding, my periods are longer and heavier. If I miss a day and double up the next day I start bleeding. I'm not sure of what my normal schedule is anymore and it is so frustrating. I have hair loss in the front and acne on my face. I have gained so much weight and always feel bloated looking as if I'm pregant. It's suppsed to decrease cramping but it seems to have gotten worse since I started Camila. I am going to see if my Dr can recommend something else because this is not worth the HEADACHE!
Birth Control	ngshdnclvr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	5/24/2011 1:41:24 PM	I was prescribed a progesterone only pill due to High BP issues on pills with estrogen and of course the insurance DOES NOT cover Mirena...I really have no other option. I have been on this med for less than a month, and my period has not even remotely showed signs of stopping...It is very frustrating for me because of constant &quot;accidents&quot;  because my periods are just ungodly heavy (always have been). Someone please tell  me it will  end soon!! 
Birth Control	annk, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	45-54	5/20/2011 9:34:21 PM	Positive - My boobs went from an A cup to a B cup.  Negative - Just stopped today after 2 months.  Mild depression, edema, no sex drive, nipples hurt, gained a pound a week,I look pregnant, moody, muscles and joints hurt, exhausted, can't have an orgasm, first month a ten day period, this month nothing.  I could go on with more symptoms, but why?  Forget Camilla.Off to a doctor that will give me a low dose combo pill...I healthy as all get out, but no children yet and I'm 46.  Conmsidered risky I'm told.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	25-34	4/19/2011 2:07:05 PM	I posted a 4-star rating of Camila sometime ago... now I regret ever taking it.  About 6 months after starting it, I experienced crazy hair loss (telogen effluvium) and it's possible that it also triggered/sped up genetic hair thinning (my hair was absolutely fine before this). I finally went off the pill after 9 months and have since been dealing with 6 months of hair hell. While the I'm not losing as much hair as I was before, I still have a near bald spot at the back of my head and have no idea if it will ever fill in.  If you have ANY blood relatives with hair loss, the American Hairloss Assoc. advises AGAINST using ANY hormonal birth control.  Trust me ladies, the trauma of having handfuls of hair fall out everyday is not worth the risk of taking this pill or others. Hair loss is side effect of birth control that is rarely talked about, yet fairly common. See the womens hairloss project website for the stories of other women dealing with this problem.

The first month i had slight bleeding. I haven't had a period since.  The first couple of months I took a pregancy test, all were negative. I feel great, no weight gain, no acne (actually improved my skin). I usually take the pill within an hour or 2 every morning, and haven't had any issue. I definitely recommend this pill. 
Birth Control	StephGM, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	4/6/2011 4:19:58 PM	I have been taking this medication for about a year, maybe a little more. I have not had any undesirable side effects, aside from occasionally late periods. I was prescribed to Camila because my body cannot handle estrogen-based pills/patches. They made me so sick! I also used to get bad migraine headaches, and so far, since being on Camila I have not had 1 migraine. I used to get them at least once every month. Taking it every day at the same time isn't hard for me. I have my cell phone's alarm set to go off at 10pm every night. I just have to remember to keep up with my cell phone but that's not ever an issue for me. I have had a few instances where I forgot to take a pill, but all you have to do is take a pill as SOON as you realize you forgot one and use a backup method of birth control for a while. Overall, I've been very pleased with it.
Birth Control	Alex, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	1	4	Female	25-34	4/5/2011 1:42:26 PM	I am taking this birth control because I am still breastfeeding.  When I first began taking this I would get intense night sweats, I called the Dr. and I was told I should take the pill at night rather than in the morning...and that worked.  It is difficult for me to remember the pill at night as opposed to the morning, but I would rather avoid night sweats.  Other than that I haven't noticed any side effects, and I get my period about the same time every month.

I started bleeding a week into my second month and have been on my period for 6 weeks now. I'm having to take 2-3 pills a day to control the heavy bleeding and now my gyno is putting me on zoladex to stop my pain and bleeding. Hopefully the Zoladex works. I hated this birth control and will never try it again
Birth Control	alexiwildchild, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	3/22/2011 7:17:52 PM	I have tried many different birth control options, and as far as the pill--this has been the absolute worst.  I was changed to this due to migraine with aura by my ob/gyn.  I gave it a full 3 months, and I couldn't take the side effects any longer.  Horrible breast tenderness--especially nipples. I broke out all over my upper back, scalp, and on my face as well.  I lost a considerable amount of hair just during the 3 months--I would've been bald if I kept taking this.  And then there was the bloating...I looked like I was about 4 months pregnant every day.  All these ridiculous symptoms, along with the fact of having to set an alarm, were just too obnoxious to handle.  Horrible experience. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	3/2/2011 11:49:00 AM	I am 20 years old, This is my second time on Camila. May 2010-July 2010 I was first on it, but I insisted that my doctor switch me back to my old pill because my periods were all over the place and I didn't like having surprise bleeding in the summer. In September 2010 after further tests were done on me, it was determined I cannot have the hormones of a regular birth control due to migraines with an aura. On this pill I have had ovarian cysts, though I don't know if they are connected, I just know that full hormone pills prevent ovulation so cysts are less likely to occur. At first, I had my period twice in the same month (only once though) and after that I used to get my period every 5 weeks, and lately it has been changing to every 6 weeks. They last 3-5 days and aren't very heavy, but the irregularity drives me crazy! I miss being every 4 weeks, precise down to the hour. I have to keep track of taking the pill, when I have bleeding/spotting, when I have sex, when I have cramps, etc., just for my doctor visits, but I find it helpful to keep my anxiety about &quot;missed&quot; periods at bay. I don't have many side effects, and I don't find it hard to take the pill at the same time every day, I use an alarm on my phone to remember, and since it's really my only option other than a Mirena (i tried to have the procedure done, it didn't go well but that's another story!), then I am going to stick with it for now. I might consider switching to an Implanon later, but I haven't decided if that's the route I want to take yet.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	2/22/2011 9:38:05 AM	The pill was great for me until I noticed significant hair loss. My hair has gotten so thin on the top of my head that you can see my scalp. I would not recommend this pill to anyone
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	25-34	1/25/2011 10:04:10 AM	My doctor recommended Camilla, or mini-pill, since I am currently breastfeeding. I have been on it for almost five months and havent had a period; which could be attributed to breastfeeding I suppose! My hair was falling out like crazy for a while, but has calmed down now; however, after being pregnant and giving birth, its completely normal for a ton of hair to fall out, since pregnant women stop losing hair sometime mid-pregnancy and the body just plays catch-up postpartum. So I figure my hair falling out was pregnancy related, not pill related!Overall Im happy so far with Camilla, although I assumed I would get regular periods (even without an off week) and had to take a few home pregnancy tests in the beginning for peace of mind...that would be something pharmacists should include with their make sure you take ALL the pills comments =) Taking the pill at the same time isnt too difficult for me, I just take it before bed and if we plan on being out past 9:30 pm, I just grab my pill for that day and take it along.
Birth Control	zero, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	35-44	1/22/2011 6:04:35 PM	a period every two weeks and I went thru 9 super tampons in one night 2 nights ago....so it is NOT for me!! stopped takin it 2 days ago F THAT!
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	35-44	1/19/2011 3:15:13 PM	I switched to this form of BC from the combo pill due to migraines. I have only been on it for 3.5 weeks and have had less headaches and a HUGE increase in libido and no moodiness. I love this pill so far. I am however a tad nervous as I ovulated.....hopefully all is well.  I did have to set my cell phone alarm, as I was late 2 nights in a row, but it was after I ovulated. EEK. I have not gotten a period yet, but this being my first month I am not going to worry about it.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/11/2011 3:42:42 PM	I am 32 years old and my Dr. put me on Camila to help regulate my migraines. I've been getting migraines for years but the last couple years they've been getting worse. I've tried everything from blood pressure medicine, topamax, and even an anti depressent that was suppose to help with the migraines. Nothing has worked. I was put on Camila 3 weeks ago after first trying another birth control med that made my headaches worse. I have only had two migraines when i would've had triple that by now. I can't tell you what a relief this is. I know everyone is different but this medicine definately worked for me, i just hope it keeps working. I have had really bad cramps but nothing like the pain of a migraine. If you're having trouble with headaches i would definately recommend giving this medicine a shot.
Birth Control	25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	1		25-34	1/6/2011 1:14:11 PM	This pill is making my hair fall out. I am having a very hard time losing weight even though I diet and exercise everyday. I have chronic trouble sleeping and I have mood swings. This is not worth the trouble!
Other	rek, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	12/1/2010 5:55:20 PM	I was put on Camila to regulate my bleeding due to a serious iron deficiency (My boyfriend has a vasectomy). The first 2 months were great, I actually had a sex drive increase which is always good but did experience major breast sensitivity off and on. I had very mild periods,and no spotting, up until the beginning of the 3rd month. I started spotting at the beginning of the month, and haven't stopped, I've also gain about 20 lbs in the last 5 weeks, I also start feeling really bloated and sluggish and no sex drive. It started out great but I think I'll stop them now. The weight gain and sluggishness, and lack of libido is not worth it.
Birth Control	steph mo, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	11/23/2010 8:57:33 PM	This is the 2nd time I am taking this b/c pill. The first time I stayed on it for 6 months while breast feeding and now 3 months and am getting off it. I have been an emotional rollercoaster, getting bad headaches and lossing my hair in clumps. I stayed on it longer after my baby #1 because I didnt know any better. I thought it was &quot;normal&quot;. I feel like i cant stop eating as well. As soon as I stopped taking it after baby # 1 I lost 5 lbs the first 2 weeks. I just dont like the way I feel on this pill. Hopefully my hair will stop falling out as well soon.
Birth Control	SK, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	11/2/2010 1:24:01 PM	I started using Camila because other B/C pills made my blood pressure skyrocket! I have been very PLEASED with the pill overall. I enjoyed not having a period for 6 months, however there were a couple pregnancy tests needed.  After the six month mark... my periods and breakthrough bleeding are somewhat frustrating however my periods were never normal so its not a huge change. I have noticed acne on my face which was never a problem prior to the pill. Taking a pill the same time every day isnt so bad...set an alarm people (its just like making it to work on time)!  I guess the biggest plus is that my heart doesnt feel like its beating out of my chest on this pill and that im NOT PREGNANT! I would recommend this pill to most!
Birth Control	rsrmohunt, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	45-54	10/29/2010 1:44:14 PM	I'm in my second month taking this pill. I have experienced bloating and breast tenderness, muscles aches. I don't take it at the same every day because some days I am running late and forget. I'll either take it at night or the next day with that day's pill. After reading the reviews I will make a greater effort to take it at the same time. See if that helps to aleviate some symptoms. I am 52 and have been on the pill my entire life with no side effects until I tried to change once due to cost. Now I'm on Camila with reasonable results.
Birth Control	Heilei, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	10/12/2010 7:02:14 PM	I read all the reviews and was a little worried, but I am so glad I went on this BCP. I've had no cramps, no bloating, no depression, and best of all no weight gain!! I have not gotten a period since being on the pill, but I talked to my Doc and he said I as long as I don't have pain, tenderness or anything other symptoms that it is fine. To be safe he told me to go off the pill for a week and see if I get a period. I would deffinately recommend this BCP to my friends and strangers. =] 
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	10/7/2010 10:06:02 PM	I was put on Camila because I'm breastfeeding and haven't had my period in the 5 months I've been on it.  No apparent side effects (noticeable hair loss, but I've attributed to post-pregnancy).  Will likely stay on it until I'm done breastfeeding in a few months.
Birth Control	phoenixx, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	9/5/2010 5:10:14 PM	hair loss, bloating, irregular, longer periods, low libido, headaches, irritability, weight gain....why bother... i'm not taking one more tab.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	8/1/2010 9:48:29 PM	I've had a great experience with Camila. Having read countless reviews before starting it, I knew to expect that the first month or two might not be the best. Indeed, I had really sore breasts with my first 1-2 periods, but everything evened out after that.  I really think the key to success it taking this pill at *exactly* the same time every day (I even adjust for time changes when traveling). I set an alarm on my phone and have another watch set for 15 minutes later (in case I missed the first alarm).  My only complaint is that my periods used to be very regular and now it's less predictable. I had 21 days between two periods, then 37 days before the next... Still, I will gladly put up with that to avoid the risks of the estrogen-combined pill. 
Other	Dolly,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female		7/21/2010 8:47:36 AM	For the 1rst 5 mo's it was fine, but in the 6th mo., I suffer from migraines, &amp; I had a very bad episode &amp; no period.I also got a yeast infection,back pain,abdomen pain, gassy &amp;weight gain.  What a mess!
Birth Control	private, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	35-44	6/15/2010 2:34:27 PM	While I did not get pregnant, I did get many of the symptoms including missed periods, emotional, weight gain, nausea, etc. The last straw- I just had to get my hair all cut off (was down to my butt) because most of it fell out in my 5 months on this pill. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	19-24	6/7/2010 2:19:16 AM	I was a bit disconcerted when I bled and had horrible cramps for the first month of taking Camila. However, I decided to continue and have been very pleased. My cramps,bleeding, and breakouts have all essntially gone away. I haven't noticed any weight gain, but I'm also fairly actve. I defintiely have to set an alarm to take it at the same time every day.  
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	2	Female	35-44	5/12/2010 8:34:01 PM	So here it is 1 month into this new pill. I feel huge! nothing fits,  I was doing so well with the 3 hr window until that one day..I was 4 hrs late and freaked for like 4 days,until I got my period. I just feel so sluggish and cant say my libido has increased.  Is it too vain to say that I am opposed due to the weight gain... I wanted to do the mirena until I read some of those reviews! I guess I will stick it out another month.
Other	beansmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	5/12/2010 2:31:02 PM	I've been on Camila for 7 months.  I switched to Camila to help contol the pain from my endometriosis.  It has helped tremendously with the pain, hardly any at all.  On the other hand I have acne all over my back and in my hair.  I have never had acne like this, it hurts. I have also had my period 4 times.  Each time lasted for over a week and the bleeding was very heavy.  I'm switching back to my old pill and will deal with pain from my endometriosis.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	1	Female	25-34	4/17/2010 2:27:11 PM	I began taking this medication for birth control while breast feeding- I experienced bad sinus headaches- and a severe migraine. I stopped taking the medication after 3 weeks.  
Other	khd, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	4/11/2010 7:36:36 AM	I am 43 and have suffered from migraines, extremely heavy bleeding and clots since having my twins. My periods were lasting 7-12 days.  My OB suggested trying Camilla. I've been on it 90 days and am very happy with it, although it has been an adjustment. It does take time to adjust. At first I did have some moodiness but that seems to have subsided.  Immediately I saw a significant decrease in clots and bleeding. 90 days out I'm getting my period almost every 10 days and it lasts 2 days with extremely light bleeding. So refreshing!!!!!! From what I've read I expect it will go away. My migraines have not disappeared however they are less intense, such that I can still function.  I gained 3-4 pounds the first 60 days but now that things have settled down I am following Weight Watchers and the weight is dropping. In total I have 10lbs to lose. I think Camila is worth a try but be prepared to give your body time to adjust.

Birth Control	GapGirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	3/31/2010 8:26:11 AM	I've been on Camila for 8 months now.  I've had my period once while taking Camila but was a normal period.  I definitely like how it doesn't make me depressed or slugish like other BC do.  The only side effect that I've noticed is the increased headaches/migraines.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	3/10/2010 9:01:02 AM	I was prescribed this medication to relieve pain associated with endometriosis. As a result of taking it, I still have severe abdominal pains (which now last longer than before) along with new symptoms of head ache, bloating and painful breasts. I wouldn't recommend this pill if you are looking for pain relief.
Birth Control	Lindsay, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	25-34	2/21/2010 3:33:18 PM	I have been taking Camilla for about 7 months now.  I went on it because I have a high risk of blood clots.  So far, it's been alright. My periods are rather heavy, but very short in duration.  I get breast tenderness quite often, but that doesn't really bother me.  I've also gained some weight and have a small amount of acne, but I'm a PhD student... so it's hard to tell what is stress and what is the pill.  The BIG problem for me is taking it at the same time each day.  Right now I take it whenever I go to bed - so usually within a 2-3 hour window.  I know this isn't how you are supposed to do it.  I'm incredibly anxious because of it and so my boyfriend and I always use condoms.   Am thinking about an IUD because I hate the hassle of taking the pill at the same time everyday, but the pill itself hasn't been too bad for me.

It's causing severe diarreah and abdominal cramping. I went on it because I am still breastfeeding, but it doesn't do me any good if I'm too sick to take care of my baby.
Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	35-44	2/9/2010 8:01:38 AM	I have been taking Camila for the past 4 months after many years on the combo pill. At first it worked well, only had a few days of spotting the first month and then normal periods the next two.  All changed the 4th month, I have had my period for 12 days now, I was an hour late taking one pill and it completely threw me off...that is crazy!  I stopped taking it yesterday, knowing that it will throw me off for a few more days, but I am hoping that I can restore my schedule (and life)  before I try something new.  My doctor suggested Jolivette, I am going to try that one next.

I, like most others, wish there would have been a little more info that I may have a 2 month span with no period. But so far so good. If you are just starting the pill hang in there, it may feel like your period is all the time but its gets better.

What a nightmare! Bled for 2 mos. straight, then every 2 weeks for 7-10 days! Had that thing removed after 9 mos.&amp; went on Camila. No period since &amp; I'm on my 2nd pack! Actually lost 5 lbs! Love it! It is difficult to remember to take @ exactly the same time, but that's a small price to pay considering my previous experience.

Birth Control	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	1/2/2010 9:59:11 AM	After being on combo pills for 20 years I felt that I wanted a change.  I was very happy with the triphasil/trilevlen but didn't care for the trivora that replaced them.  My doctor suggested that I try a mini-pill and prescribed Micronor which I was given the generic Camila.  I spent weeks reading all the negative reviews on the pill and it caused me to delay starting Camila for 3 months.  After getting tired of heavy periods I thought I would give it a try.  While the first month I did have some spotting, this month I did not have any.  I have continued to get my period very close to when I normally would and it has been extremely light.  I have not had any of the acne, headaches, weight gain or other negative side effects that others have experienced.  My only problem is taking it at exactly the same time so I set an alarm on my cellphone.  To date I have only missed it 2x and only by no more than an hour or so.  While I like the regular schedule of the combo pills I find that these pills while unpredicatble in timing offer lighter, shorter periods.  I would recommend trying it out to see how your body responds to it before completely ruling it out.

After my first son was born my doctor put me on Camila while I was breastfeeding.  When my son was 10 months, I got pregnant immediately after going off Camila and at 6 weeks miscarried.  I had another son a year later and again went on Camila while breastfeeding.  I again got pregnant immediately after going off the pill when my son was 8 months and miscarried at 7 weeks.  I am absolutely certain that I miscarried because of this pill.  I wish I had known this and I want to tell everybody I can.  DO NOT TAKE CAMILA FOR BIRTH CONTROL.

My periods was just about done &amp; i started this new pack of camilla &amp; after a week i got my periods which was heavy as well stayed for a long time. I would not recommed this pill to anyone who is not interested in frequent prolonged bleeding. there is no purpose of taking this pill if it gives bleeding for almost3/4 of a month. It is really tiring &amp; frustrating. Please don;t take this pill
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/14/2009 11:46:29 PM	I started this pill a little over a year ago because I am breastfeeding and it's known to be safe for the baby.

I actually started off taking Nora Be then my pharmacy switched the brands on me to this one, thankfully no complications. I don't like having to take this everyday at the same exact time, because I am only human and if I forget for an hour or so it throws everything out of balance. My periods used to be down to the day where I could calculate them and with me attending college right now, I don't need to be worrying about a baby on the way. I haven't had to deal with increased weight or outrageous acne but I wish things were a little bit more set in stone.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	19-24	11/24/2009 2:04:57 AM	I like this birth control except I don't get my period at all.  No spotting, nothing.  You would think that would be nice but the anxiety makes me nervous all the time that I'm pregnant.  Every month I take a pregnancy test.  Other than that the mood swings I had before seem to be better for the most part.

My period was lighter than usual, less cramping, and longer between periods.  I would get anxious after a couple months with no period but a few extra dollars for pregnancy tests was worth it.  I always took before bed so I only had a missed dose once.
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	11/6/2009 3:37:26 AM	I only took this for two days. Both days were followed by extreme confusion and paranoia. I'm going to change to something else when I see my Doctor but I will NOT take this again.
Birth Control	35-44 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	3	4		35-44	10/20/2009 3:51:26 PM	My Dr. prescribed this &quot;mini pill&quot; as a birth control method after I was done &quot;procreating&quot; and also to keep my Endometriosis away. Happy to report it has done its job concerning both reasons. My periods are pretty unpredictable and very lite (3 days). But I suffer from no weight gain or acne like the other unlucky ladies. The only negative side affect I've noticed is breast tenderness. I am curious if I'm ovulating or not (they say 50% of the time you don't). But this BC pill has really been a good fit for me.

In the last 4-5 months I have noticed a sharp decrease in libido (I just don't have any desire), I lose a lot of hair and my periods are irregular (sometimes nonexistent).  Also, my get up and go has gotten up and went without me! Is anyone else having these issues?
Birth Control	Alycia L., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	2	1	Female	25-34	9/18/2009 9:48:04 PM	I have been taking this pill for 8 months and just realized by reading some info online that there are no placebo pills in the pack.  Guess I haven't ovulated or had enough sex yet to get pregnant. I'm still breast feeding, but haven't gotten my period yet.  I am experiencing major fatigue, more facial acne and my hair is falling out by the handful.  I wish someone(my doctor or pharmasist) would have told me about taking all the pills.  Anyone else have that problem.  I feel stupid, but fortunate that I'm not pregnant for number 4.
Birth Control	lilly, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	19-24	9/14/2009 12:17:33 AM	I am taking this instead of normal birth control with estrogen due to family history of breast cancer. I have no children, and don't want any for a few more years. I was on this for a long time, then switched to the off-brand &quot;Nora BE&quot; but Nora was awful, so I switched back to this. It was different, because there were no placebo pills during the last week. I had one month where my period was a week late, and it was really frustrating. I use both condoms and the pill, but I was still worried. I don't really like the idea of taking it at the same time every night, because if I'm not home at 11:30pm, it could mess up my whole month. Other than that, it's been a good pill. No extra weight(thank God), no more acne than usual, and my period lasts 3 days. 
Birth Control	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years	4	2	3		19-24	9/6/2009 5:25:16 PM	I take this form of birth control because I have an increased risk of forming blood clots. I've been on it for about a year now-- The Bad: I didn't realize there wasn't a placebo week, and skipped the last week of the pills the first time I took it. Luckily, I was okay.  I have back acne, which I've never had, and it causes my period to be weeks late which causes HUGE anxiety.  The good: I haven't become pregnant.
Birth Control	lensmcb, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	45-54	8/11/2009 9:24:05 PM	My Doctor recommended this because of my age. I am entering the menopause age and did not want the issues with estrogen. So far no problems. No periods, have gained a little weight though. I take the pill every morning when I get up just as I did with my last pill and have no problems with remembering it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	7/29/2009 9:38:37 PM	I was prescribed this medication after the birth of my daughter since I had decided to breast feed.  I feel scared taking this pill since you have to be so precise about the time that you take it.  I also have had increased acne and have gained a substantial amount of weight.  I actually weighed less the day after I delivered my daughter than I do now.  It's really putting a damper on my self esteem.

Birth Control	zophia, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	19-24	7/21/2009 4:58:14 PM	I started taking this by doctor recommendation because i was breastfeeding my daughter.  I have never had Irregular periods , cramping, or any problems with my period, nore had i ever had acne i now have all of these problems! My periods comes every month still but sometimes 7 days late and sometimes 25 days late! Im always terrified that im pregnant!Since i have started taking this pill it seems to be normal for me to take a pregnancy test every month because my period is seriously that late every month! i think its annoying that you have to take it at exactly the same  time every day! but i dont have a problem with it! However now that i have stopped nursing i wont be taking this any longer nor would i reccomend this pill to anyone just for the anxiety alone!
Birth Control	cchill, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	7/1/2009 10:09:29 AM	i was put on camila due to breastfeeding after 3 weeks of being on it i had to come off due to extreme bleeding dizziness my jaw has swollen and is very painful im weak due to blood loss and my chest had severe pain i thought i was haveing a heart attack i do not recomend this drug to anyone. 
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	19-24	6/22/2009 8:32:22 AM	the pill is more gentle than my previous birth control. my periods are definitely lighter, but i've had my period for over a week now!
Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	19-24	6/19/2009 12:23:30 AM	Just started on this pill after some problems with the combined pills.  I have gained weight and have not had my period since I began taking it two months ago.  Very annoying to have to take it at the same time-causes extra anxiety.  I also experienced a decrease in libido and an increase in acne. Not happy and want to switch back to combined.  Would recommend this only if it is the only option for you.
Birth Control	bcpiller, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	6/4/2009 6:43:22 AM	When I started taking this birth control, I started getting headaches, bloating, and now my period comes late.
Birth Control	Country Girl,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female		5/29/2009 10:30:52 PM	In a nut shell:The good - no more bloating with my periods, less bleeding with my periods, and less cramps and headaches.  The bad - odor from the vaginal area on and off of my period, increase in mucus discharge, periods are not on time, I spotted once between periods, my bleeding during my period is a dark brown color for several days, and horrible breast soreness for a week to two weeks.  The drug is supposed to help with my migraine headaches and I have already had one within 3 months.  Most of the time, it's not too bad.  But not knowing when my period will come really irritates me.  I am sticking with it because the bad symptoms have gotten better.

Birth Control	Me, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	5/19/2009 7:24:40 PM	I decided to start this pill after years of only using condoms.  I wasn't too keen on putting any extra estrogen in my body so I really wanted to try this, it also seemed like it might have less side effects.  I've been on it for 5 months and I love it.  Absolutely no side effects, and the nice surprise is that I haven't had a period since I started it.  I occasionally have some light spotting (I mean what looks like a pen slightly leaked - almost nothing).  Otherwise, this pill is great.  I've accidentally missed it twice, the first time I did have sex the night I missed but I think I had just ovulated, so I was lucky.  The second time I used a condom for several days just in case.  I highly recommend this pill for people that don't have a problem making sure they take it at the same time every day.
Other	sdean09, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	13-18	4/15/2009 4:31:41 PM	When I was 16 I started birth control to regulate my periods. They were just awful I have my period for a month and be off for two. Now I am 18, my doctor has discovered that I have high blood pressure and I have terrible margins so he suggested I try this medicine. I have only been on it for a month and within the first week I was sick. Stomach cramping, moodiness mainly, then I had spotting for days. Now, I am on the week where I usually get my period and nothing yet. I havent had sex with this pill yet and I wont until I see what happens with my period. My greatest difficulty with this pill is remembering to take it on time every day. My main concern is getting pregnant I DO NOT want kids yet and my husband agrees with me. He isnt worried about this pill but I am. I know numbers can mean nothing but I guess its a risk youll have to take if you have sex. Ill let you know what happens with my period. If I dont get a period at all while on this pill, I will be VERY happy.
Birth Control	orthowasbetter, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	4/15/2009 3:56:50 PM	I have been taking this pill for the past 5 months. It is hard to remember to take it at the same time every day, but I do very well setting an alarm since I DO NOT want any babies. I had spotting at first. Now no periods. Odor that I have NEVER had before - does anyone else experience that? That's a problem. My main concerns for not taking this pill are: no periods, odor from the area, and ability to take at the exact time every day. Otherwise, my libido is UP, no weird acne or hair falling out, general moodiness at times, no weight gain (though I am diligent). I don't like the idea that it &quot;changes the mucus&quot; of the vagina. I think that's why I have the odor. I hate that part! :(
Birth Control	FeatherPluckinInsane, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	2/18/2009 5:31:35 PM	I switched from Yasmin, because the estrogen was thought to be giving me headaches. I am diligent with taking the pills on time and I had breakthrough bleeding the first 5 days of taking it but now I haven't had a period in almost 4 weeks. I'm starting to get scared because my boyfriend and I didn't use a condom once. It looks like no periods are common, though.
Birth Control	katrina, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	1	5	Female	19-24	1/5/2009 1:11:04 PM	I have had no problems with Camila besides remembering to take it at the same time every day.  I do not have a period at all unless I forget to take a pill- then I have spotting.  Interesting to know- I quit taking this pill for a month and my appetite decreased greatly causing me to lose weight and also I started getting acne. I started taking it again and everything is fine.  This is the best birth-control I have ever tried. I love not having a period.  I have been careless many times on taking this pill at the same time every day and I remained sexually active with my boyfriend and I never got pregnant. 
Birth Control	sophia1024, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/14/2008 10:32:19 PM	My doctor recommended this drug for me because my blood pressure tends to get very high with other birth control pills due to the estrogen. I know everyone is different, my experience with this pill has been great. I havent had any break through bleeding or any of the side effects others who have left reviews have had. I recommend it.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	3	2	Female	25-34	12/4/2008 5:12:18 AM	My Dr recomended this pill for me , while I was breast feeding. It was great at first then, my cycles are completly irregular, Then I bleed for a week then off a week then bleed a week. I do not recomend this pill.I also am always extremly exsosted.
Birth Control	kellygirl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	10/21/2008 5:24:40 PM	I was offered Camila by my pharmacy because it was a lower price than the brand name. I have been satisfied in every way with it, and aside from a few episodes of breakthrough bleeding, it has been great! Breakthrough bleeding is a common side effect of any &quot;mini pill&quot;, so I know it's not because I changed to Camila. I would recommend this generic 100%!
Birth Control	Watermelon, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	2	4	Female	19-24	9/10/2008 3:28:40 PM	My doctor put me on Camila because I was so sick when I was on Yasmine. I have felt so much better since. Camila actually stopped my periods all together, but I guess everybody is different.  It has been very effective for over a year for me, but it is difficult to remember to take it at the same time. I was late on one pill and now I am pregnant, which has turned out to be a nice surprise for my husband and I but that may not be good for somebody else.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	9/10/2008 12:02:51 AM	I was on Camila for only 10 days when the side effects became too severe to continue.  I started the drup to control heavy  bleeding with my period.  Nausea, Dizziness, Abdominal Swelling and extreme Breast Tenderness started asap.  I stopped taking the pill  after only 12 days and have been bleeding for 14 days straight. My periods have been clockwork for the past 23 years and this is the first birth control to wreak havoc with my entire system.  I DO NOT recommend this pill.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	9/3/2008 8:01:31 PM	I have a clotting disorder which prevents me from using more conventional types of birth control, so my Dr. opted to use this drug (which happens to treat my endometriosis as well).  It has caused my periods to be heavier and longer, I am having crying spells and it has caused acne not only on my face, but my back, shoulders and arms as well.  I would rather not take anything at all than have to put up with the side effects of this drug!
Other	kelso26, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	8/25/2008 4:18:28 PM	I've was taking Camila for 3 months and it was horrible! Periods were very unpredictable, longer than normal, spotting and cramps. I'm a very happy person and while on this pill I became very moody and unhappy. Oh...acne too was bad.
Other	KJ, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	5	Female	35-44	4/20/2008 6:50:41 PM	You have to take this pill on time!  Otherwise you do get some spotting. But other than that it doesn't carry some of the more unsettleing side effects of combo pills.  
Other	daisy317, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	35-44	4/18/2008 7:39:33 AM	Have been taking Camila for 8 months and I haven't had problems with spotting.  I am very diligent about taking it on time.  No side effects
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	3/24/2008 12:09:38 PM	Not a good choice for the busy woman. I have only taken it for about 4 months and each month I have thrown off my cycle by forgetting to take it. I have forgotten to take it from 8 hours to 2 days. Obviously, not the right choice for me (moving to the ring).I have no clue when my period is supposed to come anymore. I think it's caused me to gain weight, as several pairs of pants fit much more snug than before. When I first started it, I felt tingling in my breast (almost like when breastfeeding). The ONE POSITIVE thing about this, for me, was that it gave my libido a super-boost!
Birth Control		2	2	1			1/16/2008 11:42:14 PM	I am currently on this was on the errin tablet before i missed by 2 hrs on one day and my period did not come for 2 weeks. Its very unpredictable.
Birth Control	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	11/4/2007 1:05:24 AM	My doctor told me this wasn't as effective as combo birthcontrol pills. However, I have taken camila for a awhile and found it effective. My one dissapointment is if I take Camila late, but within the two hours to be considered still effective, a few days in a row my menstural cycle was thrown off. When I took my medication on scheduale my menstural cycle came like clock work.
