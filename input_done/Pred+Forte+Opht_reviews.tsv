Other	mistique2u@aol.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	9/5/2012 9:34:41 PM	Had PRK surgery, the medication little by little was making me dizzy each day I got dizzier.  My sugar was ALWAYS 120 everyday it got higer and higher over 240.  I stopped using this medication after 7 days the doc wanted me to use it for a MONTH.  If you use this med and feel dizzy get off it ASAP and call your doc. ALWAYS READ REVIEWS AND SIDE EFFECTS.  MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE!!
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	55-64	8/12/2012 12:55:22 PM	I had cataract surgery and a limbal relaxing incision to both eyes.  I have been on this medication for nearly two months since I had both eyes done separately.  My only complaint is the burning following placing the drops in my eyes.  My vision is milky at first. I like that you slowly decrease the dosage.  I had no trouble with bad taste, etc. as others reported.

I'm sure it's doing the job it's supposed to but in the process......the bad taste, sick to the stomach, burning as it goes down feels like indigestion. I hate thinking about taking it because the taste in your mouth takes forever to go away. My stomach has been hurting for the past couple of days with a burning feeling. Will call the doctor monday morning.

The benefits outweighed the bad taste and the price. It's expensive. Weaning off of the drug is not easy, however.

I am back on the pred-forte 1 drop 4X a day. The pred-forte makes me swell up. My cloths are tight, my joints are swollen, and I'm sure that my pressure is up in my eye. I am not happy about taking this medicine. As the side effects for me are getting unbearable. My feet were so swollen last night i couldn't get them in my sandles I can't imagine how I'll be in 3 weeks from now.

OD says that it will slow healing but reduces risk of vision regression following surgery.  Will be taking for 8 weeks following surgery slowly weaning from 6 times/day to once a day.  Vision gets a bit milky for a minute after application and drops sting for a few seconds.  Discomfort and vision blurring is well worth my long term eye health and vision!
Inflammation of the Uvea of the Eye	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	9/6/2009 1:50:26 PM	Diagnosed with iritis, took this med along with dilating med (AK-Pentolate, or cyclopentolate) over the course of approx 3-4 wks.  Main discomfort appeared from the dilating med, which also caused blurred vision.I kept the remainder of Pred Forte (prednisolone) after course of treatment and have used a drop on occasion when experiencing various eye irritations.  However, only 1 drop at night before bed will usually do the trick.  I wear contacts and try to make sure that I don't get any uptake from the contacts.Overall, this has been a very helpful med.

It still burns periodically. After a couple of days, I was able to taste the medication and it gave me a bit of an upset stomach. After unsuccessfully searching for reviews or feedback that would support my experience, I decided to post my own. I havent decided if I'm going to complete it as prescribed or if I should just make an adjustment.

Other	Didi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/8/2009 11:30:45 AM	This medication was prescribed to me after I had PRK (lasic) surgery.  It took awhile for my vision to get better but it was due to the dosage.  I went from 4 drops a day to one drop a day.  The good thing about all of this is that I have severe allergies combines with sinus pain and pressure. Since I've been on these drops, I have not had any issues.  I have actually been able to enjoy the nice weather without any discomforts at all.  I will be talking to my doctor to see if I can stay on them longer to control my allergies.

I was diagnosed 4 years ago, when it flares up, I have runny eye, light sensitive, redness,headaches, runny nose they say its an inflammation of the iris.  It keeps coming back each year. I was told that i can rotate from eye to eye which I have not experienced (thankful for that).They always put me on this steriod eye drop Pred Forte.  All I can say is that it works for me and I hope it always will as long as this mess keeps popin up.

It was prescribed to me for GPC (giant papillary conjunctivitus) after using Lotemax, which did not cure the infection.
Other	mawells, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	10/11/2008 12:15:22 AM	I just recently had Lasik done.  This medication gave me a stuffy nose.  Everytime I use it I cant breath out of my nose.  I had to purchase nasal decongestion spray!  I have to use the spray everytime I put the drops in my eyes.  Also, after I drop the medication into each eye I can taste it in the back of my throat.   It has a very bitter taste. Being able to taste the medicaton is very odd to me...I didnt know your eyes were connected to your throat?

Could be due to steroid use.  Also I didn't realize you need to hold the eye shut for a couple of minutes to keep the medicine in as much as possible.
