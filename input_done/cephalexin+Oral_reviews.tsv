Skin Infection	sarahlee84, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	8/9/2012 4:06:36 PM	I was prescribed this aftervan absess removal. 500/mg 2x per day. Definitely feeling jittery and a bit dizzy sometimes. Really mild diarrea and occasional nausea. On my fourth pill out of 14... Really HATE pills and tempted to stop taking it already. Absess is healing well, already starting to get itchy... was given IV antibiotics in hospital... Blood cultures were negative for infection definitely going to stop taking it soon. Ready to feel like my old self again!

He prescribed a ten day regimen of cephalexin - 500mg, 3x per day.  It did the job quickly and effectively with no side effects or other distresses.  I'm surprised that others had so many problems.

I have one day's worth of the prescription left, and I'm hanging it up.  I've had flu-like body aches and pains  for the past 48 hours.  This was so severe I had to miss day of work.  My lower back is still aching (kidneys?), I've had diarrhea for 6 days and I'm dangerously dehydrated.

Middle Ear Infection	Beccalb1, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	2/11/2012 5:29:30 AM	I started with a cold/sinus pain and as usual it went into my ear. I had fluid on my ear and could not hear out of it. I usually take an antibiotic and within 2 days it will clear up. I have been on this antibiotic for 5 days and the fluid is still in my ear and now my neck/ gland area is swelling. Not sure if this antibiotic is the wrong one for my symptoms or if this is just not as effective as other antibiotics on the market. 
Skin Infection due to Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteria	Alternativemeds, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	45-54	1/29/2012 2:43:11 PM	I rarely take meds.  When I went to the doctor for an infection because of slivers, I was given cepalexin 3x a day=1500 mg and Bactim 2x a day = 1600 mg - for a total of 3100 mg a day.  I don't know if I've ever taken 3100 mg of anything. I took this prescription for 3 days and 3 days I was in bed. (That is 9300 mg in 3 days). I felt my heart would stop. I had non-stop headaches, my joints hurt, I have pains going up my back and at times different places in my body will tight up. I have a yeast infection and hemorrhoids. I feel like crying all the time. I came to conclusion that I am overmedicated as I've been here before. I rarely take meds, I'm into alternative meds. So when my body gets 3100 mg of medicine, I felt really messed up. I reduced the medications and still felt bad. I stopped taking the meds and felt better. I have never had an antibiotic make me feel anyway at all, and certainly not worse than the problem.  This is a terrible medicine. I've killed every bacteria in my body and now will spend weeks bringing my body back to health.  I would not recommend this or Bactrim.  I'm going to use garlic to fight this, which will take longer, but at least I'm not killing my body. Your body tells you when something is not right. Listen to it. If a medicine makes you feel so bad and kills every bacteria, good and bad, how can it be good for you. Ultimately you have to cure what it has done to your body when you are done with the medicine.  Thank God for alternative medicine because they don't kill the body, they heal the body.

I started off by having flu-like symptoms (severe achiness, nausea, diarrhea).  Went to the MD and got a prenisone injection and pills for 4 days.  My flu-like symptoms went away but I then got a severe skin reaction that started on my legs and slowly spread all over my body &amp; face with welt-like red spots, swelling lips, eyes, throat.  I stopped taking this drug on Thursday and it's now Tuesday and I'm still battling the skin reaction.  I'll never take this drug again.  I don't know why it took so long before the symptoms showed up??  I took this drug almost a week before these reactions cropped up!!!!

I'm taking 500 mg twice a day for 7 days.  I don't detect an odor from the pills but even if I did I would take them anyway because it would be the lesser of two evils between the smell and the uninary pain.

I am not sure of the effectiveness sense it is to prevent infection, I can say so far seems there is not infection. Easy to use, sense it is oral. The worst part of it is, causes upset stomach, horrible indigestion, bloating and horrible smelling belching along with what now seems to be diareha. The cons are enough to prevent me from taking it. Multiple trips to the bathroom day and not are not fun when dealing with crutches.

Very bad nausea, dizziness, and an itchy bumby red rash on upper abdomen and chest spreading out to sides and underarms.

Skin Infection	Brandy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	10/29/2010 10:39:07 AM	I was given Cephalexin 250mg for a a spider bite on my leg. Started itching 2 days after starting to take the medicine and started seeing a rash on my stomach within 4 days, the rash has continued to spread and cover my breasts and stomach and from my upper thigh to shoulder on left side of my body, but the worst part is the itching, you just want to claw your skin off. The Doctor took me off medicine after 6 days and I am now using Benadryl to counteract. 
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	19-24	10/28/2010 12:15:59 PM	I was given this medicaton by my dentist after having a tooth pulled. I only took 2 pills out of the 4 he was wanting me to take. I started throwing up that night before bed and then i woke up the next morning and couldn't stop throwing up couldn't pick myself up off the floor had a migraine and eventually had to have an ambulance take me to the hospital. I am allergic to amoxicillin and i have made thsi very clear to all my medical providers when they ask about my allergies. So after that i looked up this medicine and says not to take if allergic to any penicillins, so when i tried to ask my providers about why they would give me this when it specificly says not to a take if allergic to the penecillins and i am allergic to amoxicillin they all told me i was not having a allergic reaction. So long story short dont take this if you are allergic to any type of penicillin because it may be as bad for you as it was for me.

I was given Cephalexin 500mg 3x day for a week for a bad cut on my ankle to fight infection. I've only taken about 3 of these pills. They do smell like rotten eggs in the bottle. I just took 1 and it got caught in my throat and I burped it back up and gawd what an awful taste it left in my mouth and could not get it out.

Taking 500 MG every 6 hours.  Is helping my infection problem but I have developed sever thigh aching in both legs to the point that it is about to drive me crazy.  Never had my thighs ache in my life.  They get aching so bad that I cannot get them comfortable at all, even when I go to bed, absolutely terrible.  I am NOT positive that it is the Cephalexin but have only been getting these aches since beginning the product 5 days ago.  After reading the posts here, I am quitting the medication right now as I am nearly ready to go to the hospital and have a ultrasound done on my legs.  Can't afford that!!!!  My lower back is also killing me all of a sudden...  Thank you for all the posts!

Although you're not supposed to stop taking until gone, I'm going to stop taking the antibiotic now. My voice came back on day 3 or 4. I'd had a steroid shot, too, plus drank GALLONS of water and rested my voice. Who know why it came back really.

This was treated for nearly two years with amoxicillin.  Then a Stap infection occurred, and Cephalexin did the trick in 14 days.  But, the bacteria keeps creeping back.  I am very ill from this, and same symptoms as two years ago.  Back to square one; just what am I facing here?  The specialist is stumped.  I have a coated tongue, teeth, mouth with &quot;pus-like&quot; cheesy white stuff each an every morning.  Head/facial aching, and the works.  Superbug??  resistant to all anti-bacterial remedies.  Two years ago, I had a toe infection that led to staph and it had also grown into the bone.  A surgery took place, and I was put on a specific antibacterial medication (?) and a portable pump for 6 weeks and under the watchful eye of a doctor who specializes in this type of ordeal.  Staph again nearly 4-years later!  My doctors have to wake up and put me in the hospital because my ears ache, I have vertigo, and have stumbled and fell, I am pale with eyes swollen shut in the AM.  I seem to rebound as the days go on but, sleeping causes big issue the next AM. HELP

What worked better for me was Cipro, which I rate as 4.5 stars. Yet strangely, the 5-star rating was Amoxicillin.  Being a common penicillin derivative, I would have thought it would come in third place. I guess it all depends upon the exact bacterial make-up.

I'm suppose to take this drug 4X a day for 10days, I was also told to take this vitamin called Natures Bounty:Probiotic Acidophilus to help prevent a yeast infection and I have been eating yogurt...maybe that why I have not got any itching in vaginal area.  So far I think this drug helped my swelling infection in my pinky from a metal splinter, but I will not use this drug ever again because of this rash...for the rash I am taking Benadryl and I have stopped taking this drug.

My body feels as though I have the SWINE FLU but do not. Stomach feels as though my insides are wanting to crawl out of my body and that is putting it mildly. There is so much wrong that I would be here for days telling you.

Skin Infection	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	11/5/2009 3:09:27 PM	I am actually taking this medication because I have really bad eczema which causes my skin to get inflamed in my hands and fingers with blisters. My Dermatologist prescribed Cephalexin 500 mg.  It has worked by stopping the blisters in my hands. In the past few weeks of taking it, I frequently feel sick to my stomach.  I feel shakey, light headed, slight headaches. Experiencing some joint and muscle weekness. This past weekend I had two lumps under my neck near my glands.

Noticed immediate improvement with my infection - fever and pain decreased after first day.  Side effects have been very mild - some slight light headed-ness.  Have increased my consumption of yogurt to avoid any digestive problems (For those who don't know - antibiotics kill off the beneficial bacteria in our gut that helps us digest our food. They also make it possible for yeast to grow in a woman's vagina.  Consuming yoghurt, drinking fruit-juice sweetened cranberry juice and increasing water intake can help prevent such problems.) Hopefully, side effects will continue to be mild, as I have to take this for two weeks.

Of all 3 meds I like this medication the most. the other ones made me sick or gave me side effects that were very unplesant. Bactrim made me throw up. Amoxicillin gave me a yeast infection. I am on my second day of treatment and so far no side effects.
Skin Infection		4	5	4			9/29/2009 3:14:10 PM	Read some of the reviews before I started taking this medication and was alarmed, but have had no major problems. Like this medication over other antibiotics for its ease of use, and ability to take with or without food. Have taken this with coffee and after a few alcoholic beverages and felt fine. Infected cyst seems to be getting better, in one week. Too bad about the smell of the pills, but oh, well.

Dr. perscribed Cephalexin to take 1 every 6 hours for 10 days.  Side effects, some diarrhea and the last few days have noticed extreme vaginal itching (though no noticed if much discharge). I still have several pills left, but the vag. itching is insane and makes me feel much too uncomfortable to continue.  The sting has disappeared pretty much completely (very faint) now.

My doctor was aware that I had an allergy to Penicillin when younger but that was maybe put on file because of my mother's allergy to such.  He said I would likely break out in a rash at the most.

Other	pocket, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	5/14/2009 11:40:49 AM	Was in the ER with a severe kidney infection and kidney stones, one which was in my ureter. They sent me home with Cipro which apparently my body/ the bacteria causing my infection is resistant to. So they put me on cephalexin. I've only been on it for four days so far, 500mg 3x a day and I haven't had any problems, really. Slight bouts of dizziness every now and then but nothing major. I have noticed the gassy/wierd/foul-smelling bowel movements that were mentioned once on here, but nothing to complain about seeing as how every time I get a kidney infection I get constipated. So it actually helps in a wierd way. So, no real complaints so far, hoping I don't run into this skin condition most are complaining about. I make sure I keep my fluid intake way up and eat something when I take it, which seems to work for me.

My blood pressure was extremely high 210/100 (never before bothered with HBP) and a constant pounding headache. In conjunction with the BP med I am now taking I feel much better. The only problem I'm experiencing is light headedness which I believe to be the result of the BP med. Thank God, I have not experienced any of the negative side effects offered by others and I never noticed the smell until after reading others comments (I don't make a habit of smelling meds). I wish the best for all of us on this med, thanks for sharing.

About a day later I started experiencing anal itching and finally now vaginal itching. I purchased over-the-counter hemmoroid creme and vaginal itch cream. Whatta pain!

Strep Throat	hatestrep, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Female	45-54	3/15/2009 5:44:48 PM	This drug was a real chore to take. It gave me bad stomach problems even though I was sure to eat beforehand. By the tenth day it seemed like my throat was clogged and food had a hard time going down. I made sure to swallow water first before taking pill as it had the type of coating that would stick to the inside of your throat. This could be what caused my throat feeling clogged as I would take it and then go to bed right after so I'd be lying down. Be sure you feel the pill go down, even if it means you have to eat something after to push it along. I won't be taking this drug again..the side effects were too severe and something else must be better. I also experienced heartburn and burping like some of the other posters. I am SO glad I took my last dose this afternoon!

About a day after I ended the dosage I have a rash over my entire body, not the face, with extreme itching on my toes and knees - anywhere that becomes warm, but not genital area as others have stated.

I didn't suffer from diarea but my stool was softer and gassier and had a smell I wasn't used to (I mean come on stool never smells good but normally you know YOUR stool smell.. Well you probably won't know your stool smell anymore... I found it worst (and kinda weird) smelling by far). My upset stomach was very mild, I also noticed belching and heart-burn. But by far I'm nit-picking. My throat was so sore and swallowing so difficult, all I did most of the day was lay down in agony. KeFlex got me up and enjoying life again with minor side-effects that are so far quite tolerable and noticeable but honestly minor. Take the good with the bad (reviews) but trust me you won't know how KeFlex works with you will you work with it... first hand.
Other	weo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Male	45-54	2/2/2009 4:14:46 PM	Prescribed for an infected gum around a new crown. On 500Mg 4 times per day. Could only make it to 4 days before the intestinal cramps got so bad I stopped taking it. Also seems to have flaired up my diverticulosis.Couldn't sleep, developed a low grade fever. After 4 to 5 days my GI Trac still hurts. Horrible. It did seem to help the gums a little. However rhe side effects were too much.Strong and apparentley dangerous stuff to some, and I have never had a problem with an anti-biotic in my 50 years on this eath...until now. Beware.

Infection of Bone	rose, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/25/2009 9:46:29 AM	I had surgery for a bunion and was given this antibiotic for 3 days 500 mg.  I know that antibiotics do a total cleansing of the bad and good bacteria so I take a daily probiotic and will continue to do so afterwards to prevent any loss of good bacteria needed by my intestines, etc.  So far, no back effects.  I'm glad it is only for three days.  I don't experience the smell or vaginal itching others complain about.

I am worried if it will persist after I am finished taking it, I only have two more days.

Strep Throat and Tonsillitis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	12/19/2008 3:23:26 PM	Right from the get-go, this med made me extremely tired, although at first I wasn't sure if it was from the germs or the med itself. After the 5th full day of treatment, I realized my urine output had decreased significantly. Within a half-hour, I got dizzy and fainted, and had to go in an ambulance to the ER. It's been 2 days since the ER helped me out, and I think I'm still feeling the after-effects of what this horrible med did.

Still in 10-day period and so far so good, but noticed some discharge from urinary tract. Usually with antibiotics, I'll drink PLENTY of water, eat yoghurt and additional fiber. Also, purchased mega digestive bacteria from health food store for after. Antibiotics do a scorched earth policy on even beneficial bacteria so expecting some digestive discomfort until I get a handle on it again.  Looks like I need to add cranberry juice to my mix as well. If it works it'll be worth it. Had this infection for a while.

Bacterial Infection of Breast	JB, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	35-44	7/17/2008 8:24:27 PM	I commented earlier on that this drug seemed to take a while to kick in. When it did, it seemed to work. However, at the end of my 7 days I still had pain, hardness and swelling. The doctor had to extend treatment for an additional 4 days. I was not amused. Since I had to take this 4 times per day, it was hard to do what with the eating at odd hours, etc. 6a.m. and 11p.m. being the worst. But, also, after a while I found what others were saying about feeling sick after taking these meds. Also, one day I didn't take it with enough water and it stuck just below my throat. I just stopped to finish one thing before going to get more water, but by then it was too late. I had to suffer with the ill smell and probably foul breath along with the taste all evening! Yuck. Drink lots of water with this. Mark my words!

Skin Infection due to Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteria	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	25-34	7/16/2008 2:35:39 AM	I was bit by some insect and developed a staph infection from it.  This med worked within 18 hours of taking the first dose.  It has given me some stomach upset and gas, and I am a bit tired from it (on 2K mg/day though).  Nothing too bad and, frankly, I'd rather have a few side effects than an antibiotic resistant staph infection.  I've had worse antibiotics.  I didn't notice the smell until reading posts on here.  Also, side-effects are lessening after day 5.  Really, in my case, when dealing with staph and how scary it is these days, I was glad to have it work - even with a few side-effects.  It is really stinky though, pew!
Bacterial Infection of Breast	JB, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	35-44	7/5/2008 11:55:44 PM	It may be a bit early for me to review this drug as it's only been 36hrs. I had severe severe pain and swelling. The redness has reduced somewhat but am still in pain and the swelling has not gone down. I'm hoping that by day three it will be much better, but was hoping for faster results. I must admit I apparently have an uncommon problem to begin with, especially since I'm not nursing and was not pregnant.

After 10 days nail is still sore to touch. In the beginning I had stomach upsets and diareah, however subsided at the present. This morning woke up with a small dark vaginal dischage which scared me as I haven't had my period for over 17 years. Going to doctor on Monday to check.

Other	Michael R, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Male	25-34	1/5/2008 2:23:40 AM	I had what appeared to be a nasy cold for several days. It got to be where I almost was unable to talk because my throat was so irritated. By the end of day two on cephalexin my cold was almost gone and I could talk normal. The morning of day three I had a severe breakout in hives over most of my arms and legs. The doctor confirmed I'm allergic to this drug. A strep test conducted after, well, during my first hive outbreak came back negative. I started antihistamine and steroid treatment. The following night an even worse outbreak occured that also included most of my back and neck. I have used a different type of penacilin in the past with no adverse side-effects. This little $8 prescription has cost me several times that amount in other counteractive drugs along a bunch of suffering. And after all this, my cold is not completely gone.P.S. Why the doctor didn't do a strep test on the first visit I don't know.

Not sure what I am taking this for exactly, but the side effects are not worth it to me so I will probably stop treatment early..not sure yet.
