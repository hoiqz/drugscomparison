The same thing is happening again. AM sugars down from 190 to 130 and PM sugars from 240 to 180 in just 4 days. Starting at 25 units and adding Victoza to see how that does. Had a good bit of nausea the first two days but its sibsiding already. Feeling fuller quicker when I eat and having to make myself eatg snacks and more at meal times since its curbed my appetite. Will review again after a month or so.
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus	55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	55-64	10/25/2011 10:02:50 AM	I have been diabetic since 1958. I have used many types of insulin, but not one of them has served me as well as Lantus combined with a fast-acting insulin.My HbA1c is nowadays less than 7%.

Diagnosed at age 48, I used Metformin XR and Prandin for several years.  Those quit working and after trying nearly every drug available, I resorted to Lantus along with Kombiglyze.  The Lantus is working; so well that I have hypoglycemia during the night, a couple of times a month.  In only 5 months I have put on 10 pounds inspite of INCREASING my strenuous exercise routine in an effort to keep the weight off.  I plan to ask the Dr to consider another alternative as I cannot afford to replace my clothes and pay for my meds.

I started on Metformin 500mg 4/X day. If I stick to an Atkins diet, I can control my BS but I'm addicted to sugar. My BS increased to 400-500 eating sweets and carbs and I started on Lantus. I'm now taking 40 units a.m. and 30 units p.m. I initially used the Pen but I had two of them jam up and I switched to the vial and syringe. PROS: None that I can think of. If I stick to low carb, BS in &lt;150 but probably would be without the insulin.CONS: 1. I gained 15 pounds in 2 weeks after starting and I was losing weight at that time. 2. Water retention. 3. Intermittent chills without fever (I noticed this on another posting and didn't connect it). Increase in resting pulse by 20 points and I worry about congestive heart failure with the fluid retention and faster heart rate. No known heart disease at this point.POSSIBLE SYMPTOM RELATIONSHIP: Some difficulty passing urine. Intermittent anxiety. Joint pain.  I'm also concerned about the cancer relationship study. The preservative, cresol, is a carcinogen. 
High Blood Sugar	Gunther, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	4/18/2011 9:39:15 PM	My sugar was up to 513 &amp; Dr. put me in hospital which I was put on 2 insulins, lantus &amp; humulin. Was doing gooder then about a week later my vision got blurry, I was cold, itchy &amp; shaky. This past Friday Dr. took me off lantus to see if it would take blurry vision away, but so far not, so I`m wondering if it is the humulin doing it. But with the 2 insulins my sugar was gooder, but it is very scarey not being able to see very gooder. Does anyone else have blurry vision? But since I have been off the lantus for 3 nights now, I am not cold, itchy or shakey anymore, but I still have the blurry vision, I can`t drive or go any place by myself &amp; like I said, it scares me. Before I was put in the hospital I was on 2 500mg. of metformin a day which I also still take too.

High Blood Sugar	Harnag, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	3	5	Male	55-64	3/9/2011 9:46:37 PM	Originally prescribed in hospital to offset side effect of prednisone treatment.  Worked well in temporary combination with normal insulin.  Dr. continued Lantus after hospital.  Has helped keep A1C below 7.0 for the first time in 6 years.  Used in combination with Actos and metformin.  Only objection is occaisonal pain from injection into a nerve, more an issue with the length of needle and injection site than Lantus.  Easily tolerable in the arm with a short needle or in the belly with a longer needle.  Overall, Lantus is quite helpful.

Some effect, dropping from &quot;normal 380-500&quot; range to fasting of 210-295. Very expensive for very little results. No assistance as I am on medicare.In donut hole, costs over $1000 a month. Not good for me. Will settle for old 380-500 range.

I highly recomend lantus for good control of blood sugar. I've had no side effects on lantus. Lantus hasn't caused lows like other insulin because it doesn't peak which is real nice. Lantus works extremely well!

I reallly recomend lantus to everyone with diabetes who need insulin. Lantus has lasted for a full 24 hours for me. Its important to get your correct dose with lantus.once you have your correct dose it works perfectly! It dosent cause low blood sugar either like other insulin because it doesn't peak. I give it a all star rating! Lantus really works for me!
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Net, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/7/2010 11:47:47 AM	I use lantus solo star pen for my injections. It has been amazing at controling my high blood sugar! The pen is extremely easy to use and mostly pain free. After priming the pen you must make sure there is not any insulin left on the tip of the needle or this will cause a stinging sensation at the injection site. This is the only time I've found lantus to be uncomfortable to inject. So if you make sure after prime the needle tip is clear of insulin, the injection will be toatlly painless! Also make sure your pen is at room tempature before injection. Lantus pen is much more convient than an insulin vial and syringe. You just dial your dose in a clearly seen window and it delievers your percise dose! No more drawing up from a vial! The needle is so small its been painless! I love the pen , its so descret you can take it anywhere and it looks like a marker pen! All in all for me lantus gets a five star rating! I'm very satisfied with this product!

I did NPH/Regular insulin injections for years, suffering extreme highs and lows (lows at night while asleep). A couple years ago, I switched to Lantus in morning and Apidra before each meal to cover carb consumption. Getting the basal Lantus dosage right was hard. But after that, I've gotten great results 'specially since Lantus doesn't peak much at all for me. I'm no longer afraid of hypoglycemic episodes while I'm sleeping at night. Best of all, my A1C level has improved over the last several months. So far, I love this med!

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	5/10/2009 3:52:36 AM	I was diagnosed with Type 2 about 10 weeks ago.  Dr. put me on Lantus.  I am taking 24 units each night (and Humulin in the a.m. if glucose is below 150 per dr.'s instructions).  So far, I've only needed the Humlin four times.  Lantus seems to do a nice job keeping my glucose levels under control.  Occasional spikes and lows seem to be attributable to diet choices and exercise patterns.  My only minor complaint is that my skin sometimes stings at the injection site, but this goes away within a few minutes.  Since taking Lantus, I also sometimes experience significant sweating in my sleep - so much so that it drenches my shirt (although I cannot be sure this is attributable to Lantus, and not some other medications I began taking around the same time).

Diabetes	disgruntled, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	45-54	2/16/2009 1:01:58 PM	Regardless of what I eat or exercise, this insulin does not help.  I'm pretty consistent on diet &amp; exercise.  Sometimes I think the sugar levels get worse because there is something wrong with the insulin.  Let's face it --it's shipped from Germany where it's made; how do we know how it's handled in all climates.

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	35-44	1/22/2009 12:32:21 PM	I am a newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetic and have been on Lantus for 2 months.  It has been a struggle to find the right dose.  However, since changing my diet to a low carb diet my Lantus dose has been reduced to once daily.  It has been very effective and no side effects.

Just don't think this is working for me maybe need to go back to my old NPH doses
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	12/9/2008 3:07:28 PM	I take 80U of Lantus every night now.  Started out at 40U which helped for awhile, but now everytime I go see my Doctor the dosage goes up, as my A1C's have been always high.  Since increasing my dosage I have put on 30lbs, which I am not happy about.I also take 1000mg of metformin as well being on a sliding scale for Novalog.I eat smaller meals now and to a certain point I try to avoid eating if possible as my bloodsugars will go through the roof.

I started with Lantus approx 3 yrs ago. It controls my blood sugar very well. However, the only negative is that I was bottoming out on a regular bases at the beginning. Once my dose was regulated  I haven't had any side effects. Would recommend this medication.

The only thing bad is I've gained 42 Lbs. of water weight.  Somedays I'm a whole size larger than the day before.  Since I'm in my 30s my Dr. won't give me Lasix for fear of Kidney problems later.  Its frustrating but other than that it works very well.  It is very strong and took a while to get the dosage correct.

Diabetes	Byetta, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	5/21/2008 8:26:49 PM	I have been taking Lantus for 2 years now and my blood sugar is under control, and I dont find it hard to give myself the shots, I have a scar on my stomach so I dont feel it at all (unless I miss). The only problem I have had is water gain of 45 lbs in the last two years. I dont find Lantus to make me sick or tired.So alitte Lasix compaired to a stroke or another heart surgery is ok with me.
Diabetes	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/12/2008 10:27:06 PM	I have been a diabetic (type 1) for 34 yrs and this works good for me I only take 10units and morning and 10 units at night.....YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER ITS ALL IN WHAT YOU EAT!!!!!!!!!!! If you dont eat right then your blood sugars will not be right !! lows and highs !! i USE 1 UNIT OF NOVOLOG FOR EVERY 10 CARBS.. SO IF I EAT A BAGEL WITH CREAM CHEESE THAT IS APROX. 31 CARBS SO I TAKE 3 UNITS OF NOVOLOG. Look for this book &quot;Calorie Fat &amp; Carbohydrate Counter&quot; works GREAT. It has in this book, Diabetes Diet Guide and 200 fast food restaurants and every thing that you could think of in this book to look up the contents of it. AGAIN ITS ALL IN WHAT YOU EAT!!!!

As long as I'm healthy and not stressed or the weather doesn't change to much, the insulin works great.

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus	blue1985, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	19-24	3/1/2008 6:31:50 PM	I have been diabetic for almost 8 years and started using this insulin a couple years ago. I started out taking 14 units and I have been knocked down to taking just 4. I am concerned though because even with 4 units, I have to almost triple how much I eat before I go to bed. It is quite convenient because I only have to take it once every night before I go to bed, but the side effects can be crazy. In my opinion, this stuff is ridiculously strong.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	philip, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	1/28/2008 9:04:32 PM	I have had great results with this, since I was diagnosed 11 months ago I have been on numerous different medications. My A1C b4 beginning this was 10.4, but now my b/s stays in the low to mid 100's 2 hours after a meal with a lower carb meal plan. The only problem I've had is getting properly adjusted, I take 28 units a day and have dropped below 70 and became disoriented twice, but lower dosages than that don't seem to work near as well. I cannot wait until I get my next blood results in a couple months because I finally feel as though I've gained control of my blood sugar. I hope this helps some of you.
