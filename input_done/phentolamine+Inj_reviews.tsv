Pretty effective, but injections are painful at times. Think I 'blew out' 1 side when I upped the dose for better results. It's still a tricky proposition for me. Cialis &amp; Viagra are still way too expensive for a fixed income.

I have used Cialis, Levitra, and Viagra 100mg. The Viagra worked the best of the three for me. The only problem for me is storage (refrigerated) until use. I used 3.5 worked great. I weight 232.

The pharmacist says no interaction between allergy meds and phentolamine I am not convinced. I was using .1 but they said to increase I have had problems with penile pain also the injection is easier when I started using the autoject shot giver that my wife uses for her ms injections.

Pharmicist suggested trying mixture, leaving off prostaglandin as it has an alchol base which causes pain when injuected.  Will report later.
