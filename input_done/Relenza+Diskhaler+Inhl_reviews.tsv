The Flu	Lisaa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	4/22/2011 6:52:10 AM	I was diagnosed with swine flu 2009 Pharmacy did not have a adequate supply of tamiflu so they gave me relenza.  I was really ill for 45 days, and now I have COPD!  I hate the fact that my life will never be the same.  It attacked my lungs and respiratory system.  I have a difficult time breathing, and cronic seasonal issues allong with my senses have been hightened.  I cannot be in certain places that have strong smells, used to love candles and fragrant oils, no longer can I do that.  I cannot even go outside durring spring because of the pollen that never used to bother me.  I am now on a controlled medicine, which does not really controll my sysmptoms at all.  I am considered handicapped.  I have not had any health issues before.  Please do not take this medicine I can see how older people and people in poor health die.

The Flu	Ken, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	2	Male	55-64	11/13/2009 9:45:38 AM	Extreme outbreak of facial cold sores on second day of use. This outbreak was so bad and widespread, I had to seek medical attention. Very painful condition. Didn't have the flu (misdiagnosed) or any other condition to cause outbreak. Suspect the Relenza. This is not a listed side effect but I will never take Relenza again. 
Influenza Prevention	Durlaw, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	11/1/2009 10:41:52 PM	My husband has the 'flu so when I started sneezing and having a runny nose I saw the GP who prescribed Relenza to take if the symptoms worsened.  They did worsen and I started the course.  I have some ear-ache and have had some stomach cramps, I am tired at the end of the day but I can function so I am satisfied.  My husband who started taking Relenza possibly just past the initial 48 hours of symptoms has not fared as well, his overall symptoms have improved but he is very fatigued.
The Flu	Abby, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	10/30/2009 5:37:41 PM	I started this after I was diagnosed with the swine flu.  The side effects are worse than the flu.  I wish I never took it!  The abdominal cramping is VERY uncomfortable. Use caution.  I am still very ill and this medication has only made things more complicated.

The Flu	Concerned Mother, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/16/2009 11:35:13 PM	My 18 year old daughter with no previous health issues had the flu/symptoms and after 2-3 doses of relenza began experiencing pains in her heart and headaches. The pains in her heart hurt every time she breated so I had her stop the medication. I think it could be dangerous if it affected a perfectly healthy teenager this way. We may go seek alternate medical advise to be sure there are no implications from the medicine.
The Flu	suntracker33, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	45-54	7/2/2009 10:50:14 AM	Although the medication was effective in treating the majority of my flu symptoms, it did nothing for my runny nose, and the side effects were not pleasant. I lost my sense of taste and even 2 days after stopping the medication, I still have not regained it back. I had diarrhea, felt very dryed-out, occassional shortness of breath, and some abdominal cramping. I would not take again if another option were available.
The Flu	Sick Girl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	5/2/2009 3:28:28 AM	Although this medicine did bring my fever down &amp; get rid of the joint aches, the side effects have been bad!  The headache &amp; diarrhea are worse than they were prior to taking Relenza &amp; seem to become more severe with each dose.  Not sure if that's happened to anyone else.  The dizziness is pretty amusing, though!  Hopefully this RX it works for you, but make sure to have lots of Pedialyte &amp; Excedrin on hand.

The Flu	elly, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	4/9/2009 11:37:38 AM	This medicine made me sicker.  I felt severe abdominal pain and nausea for many days.  It felt as if I was being poisoned.  In my opinion it was not only ineffective but harmful.

The Flu	55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/25/2009 11:20:44 PM	I couldn't believe the difference just 36 hours made after starting this medication.I was down in bed the day before yesterday with severe pain in my bones and also fever and chills.  This particular flu hit me like a ton of bricks. (Yes, I had a flu shot this season) I got the OTHER flu.Tonight I am up cleaning the kitchen and almost completely pain free, but still taking medicine for stuffy nose and congestion in my chest.I still have two days to go on this medication and have had no side affects.
