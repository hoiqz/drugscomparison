Panic Disorder	kentucky girl, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/29/2012 6:06:42 AM	I never wanted to do anything with my family that didn't involve being around a hospital. They like to do hikes, hunting and a lot of outdoor things which I wouldn't do. We own a boat and I was scared to go out in it. It was life altering so I changed doctors and he put me on this. What a god send I now do everything with them and and as a result lost 73 lbs because I began working out and living again. This is the drug for me tried many others but I'm a very happy woman now.

With poor results. Used this generic for 2.5 months and relized I was slowly becoming depressed again.  I was surprised as I have take other generics and have not noticed any difference from the original manufacture. 
Depression	just me, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	3	5	Female	35-44	8/4/2012 12:13:12 AM	It took around 5 weeks before the total effect kick in..and did it kick in!  Helping me thru death and divorce.  Thank God for my doctor for putting me on it.  Was reluctant to take at first.  Cleared my foggy head, confusing, lost weight, able to deal with one problem at a time, putting life in perspective.  Sex drive, well, sex is overated anyway, have had somewhat of a decrease but thats due to the everyday stresses.  It comes and goes.  Am a funeral director, lost my dog this year, currently going thru divorce, and a life or death surgery coming up for my mother.  Thank God for God's grace and this pill.  Everythings gonna be alright.  
Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	etmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	8/1/2012 1:22:19 PM	I switched to the generic in March when it was first available.  In the last 2 months I have noticed increased sweating/ hot flashes...so much so I thought I might be going through early menopause.  Blood draw showed normal levels of hormones, etc... so have come to the conclusion that maybe it is this generic form.  Definitely a noticable decrease in sex drive (even from regular Lexapro)

Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	4/30/2012 7:22:35 PM	I have taken Lexapro 20mg for 10 years with lots of success. A month ago the pharmacy gave me the generic. I do not feel like it works as good as Lexapro so doctor increased another 10mg, started 2 days ago. So far too early to tell. Would like to go back to Lexapro but doctor wants me to give generic some time. For the past month I have had moody swings and suicidal thoughts. Hoping things improve.

Depression	aiminghigh, 45-54 on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	4		45-54	4/27/2012 12:10:17 PM	I have been taking the brand name (Lexapro) for over 8 years with excellent results for my depression, and no real side affect except some loss of sex drive.  Without it , I have trouble thinking, get very depressed and suicidal.  However, recently the pharmacist switched the prescription to the generic, and the sex drive has gone down to none existent. It costs me $30 less to have the generic, but I am going back to the brand name because of the affect on the sex.

Repeated Episodes of Anxiety	 (Patient) 	2	5	1			4/6/2012 10:14:10 AM	Since switching to this, my level of concentration is non-existent.  I cannot focus on anything.  This was prescribed to control my anxiety.  Not being able to focus and complete a task has only increased my anxiety level.  Very frustrating.

Depression	dodiel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	1/16/2012 3:05:25 PM	My doctor took me off Prozac which was a blessing!  I have not found any nasty side-effects since I've been taking it for about 4 years.  I holds me together.  Without this med I can't seem to handle things.  I am much more in contral and able to handle life's situations.  Without it I seem to fall apart.   For me it has benn a god-send.
Other	Windy Brenda, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	10/27/2011 2:00:38 PM	I started this medication after I quit smoking and found myself screaming at everyone. My anger was so great I wanted to hurt people, I would just shake trying to control myself.  If there is a lower sex drive, I haven't experienced it. But my husband is not really into sex anymore.ED from Diabetes. So that is a seldom thing. Works great for me!  After 3 years I had to up it to 20 mg. But my anger is under control.

Then clonazepam was reduced and stopped. Now I am taking one tablet of Escitalopram in evening. Two buspirone in evening and one buspirone in morning. I am regaining the interest in work and feel my mood elevated with this drug. I do not have any side effect so far. I have been taking it for about 7 months and doc says she will continue for about 7 to 8 months more.

I gained about 15-20 lbs, however, I did have eating disorder issues that have mainly disapeared which could be the reason for the weight gain. Major loss of sex drive, extreme night sweats and nightmares when missing a doses, as well I had SSRI discontinuation syndrome so bad that I felt suicidal. I am supposed to be on 1 1/2 pill dose but found I was sleeping constantly (my brother is also taking this and experiences extreme fatigue as well). Consistency is definitly key when taking this medication as it is highly effective but has undesirable side effects when you miss does or try to stop taking it. I experienced electric shock sensation, vertigo, as well as extreme anxiety and irritability when I attempted to discontinue.

I have been on regular treatment of one or the other medicine. I had nervous breakdown 3-times. Thanks to this medicine, I have great improvement in my personality after I have started this medicine. I am taking 10-mg per day in the night. All other medicines are stopped. Had I got this earlier in my life, my life would have changed for better.

OK with hubby as he doesn't want me to kill myself than just losing sex drive.

It was effective, but only at that mega-dose. I tried to transition to Cymbalta which proved effective only at like mega-dosage so I reverted to Paxil.  A year ago I transitioned to Lexapro at 10 mg./day with great success.  The sexual side effects are GREATLY reduced.  My suicidal depression has not reared its head. The weltanschauung that makes me want life to be over is still there, but I accept it as existential, and tolerable, rather than as damning.
