Arthritis	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/23/2012 5:02:21 PM	Recently began taking this medicine for worsening wrist pain.  The pain eased after the first day.  Wish I would have talked to my doctor about this sooner.  Could have avoided the pain I've had for the last 2 years.

It keeps me feeling good enough to do regular household chores comfortably.  It is a big help.
Arthritis	weathergirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	12/21/2011 7:18:50 PM	I have taken Voltaren for my plantar fasciitis pain.  I am careful to take it on a full stomach and usually have no stomach upset.  On the downside, I have noticed increased hot flashes when using this regularly for more than a few days.  Although I do not like the risks associated with NSAIDS, this medicine worked to alleviate my foot pain when nothing else did.  
Arthritis	pg,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/30/2011 1:53:58 AM	I use Volteren Gel 1% in addition to a brand name anti-inflamatory.   Voltaren Gel is very effective used in areas that may need a little extra anti-inflamatory help.  However, my insurance company suggested I try another drug similar to the name brand  The perscribed med was diclofenac sodium ec which is generic for Voltaqren.  Sorry to say that without the name brand anti-inflamaatory I have many areas that have become stiff and hurt. My left hand was under control &amp; now it hurts to open &amp; close my hand.

When I forgot to take it one night, I felt it the next day. Started taking it in the morning instead of at night, and have had lots of stomach pain ever since. Going to wait a few days and see what happens, but my knee sure hurts without it.

Although I do not have RA, I have many similar debilitating symptoms.  I take 50 mg twice daily, and while I'm afraid I may need to either increase my dosage or change to a COX-2 inhibitor, Voltaren has been life-changing for me for the 8 months I've been taking it.

I've experimented with it, and will stop taking it until further discussions with my doctor. I have taken it for a couple of year so I may have built up an intolerance to it..

This is among the $4.00 drugs at any drug store and as an anti inflamatory, you cannot beat it!  I was on this drug for over four years, and no problems. The doc took me off it when I was put on coumadin to prevent a major bleed out, and my pain is at a level 9 now! Horrible pain.  I will be going  off coumadin to go back on Volaren permanently.

The reason I know this, is I stopped using it after a month of taking it and started to experience excruiating pains in my hips. being very difficult to walk. I started up with it today and after one dose I already can feel the difference.. Hopefully I'll be able to take this med for my RA.. As for my heel spur, I think I'll always have a problem with them, As i am a cashier and am on my feet 8hrs. a day...
