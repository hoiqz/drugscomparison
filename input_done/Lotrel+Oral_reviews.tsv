High Blood Pressure	NOLA Girl, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	3/6/2012 11:36:50 AM	While this treatment was optimally effective in treating my hypertension, I did experience a few side effects:  constant briny taste; dry eyes and mouth, tiredness and nausea (until intake of nutrition -- at least some saltines). Have been of of the med for 1 month and all the above symptoms have ceased, HOWEVER, my blood pressure was back up to a dangerous level.  So, would rather take the med and deal with the side effects which are minor compared to the alternative if I don't take the med.  All in all, I would be willing to go back on the med if there are no other viable alternative options available.

High Blood Pressure	Snorkel, 55-64 Male  (Patient) 	4	3	1	Male	55-64	1/18/2012 3:21:45 PM	I'm not rating the effectiveness or side effects of the drug here. The other reviews seem to cover that. But I want to advise everyone that there is a much cheaper way to get the same medications. When my doctor first prescribed Lotrel for me, I priced it at Walmart, and it was something like $72 for a month's supply. It may be more than that now. Folks, it is nothing more than a combination of amlodipine and benazepril. Get your doctor to prescribe the two drugs separately (mine had no problem with that). That way, the price drops to $4 each, or $8 per month total for EXACTLY THE SAME medication.

I drink a cup of coffee and if I have a stressful day the dizzyness is worst. Tried going to decaf coffee but still have dizzyness. Going to talk to Dr about changing to a differnt medicine. It has lowered my BP but the side effects are bad.

I have a family history of HBP eventho I watch my diet. I have dry coughs while taking this drug. I was diagnosed with Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) and I think taking this drug has excelerated the disease and a decline in my kidney functions and increased the size of my kidney cysts. I am scheduled to visit a urologist because a small hard mass was discovered during a recent ultrasound that may/may not be kidney cancer (god I hope not) but I am going to request to be taken off this drug...I am very anxious about my upcoming urologist visit.

Palpitations were intermittent. I also began to inch profusely. Welts and swelling appeared after scratching. couldn't figure it out till I started researching this drug. Stopped taking it for one day and palpitations went away. Needless to say, I am done with Lotrel. Dr switched me to Lisinopril. We'll see.

When I told my doctor of the side effects of which he was not concerned, and especially the fact that, &quot;does not work well in blacks&quot; he replied &quot;most medicines don't&quot; how encouraging that was to hear from a doctor. My blood pressure rose to 193/92 and when I told the doctor he was not concerned and had the gall to say that &quot;he does not care about the bottom number&quot;.  Should I leave this doctor??

BP under control and allside effects  gone after the first month or two, I notice some reviewers jump into the wrong conclusion only because they don't allow enough time to become adapted to this medication. My review is based on aprox. 14 months on it. Give it some time and you will see most of the side effects go away.

I coughed so much, I had a horrible constant cough, vomitted/threw up and pissed myself in the process on the job. I was given medication to help control my reaction to Lotrel, and had to remain home on sick leave until the reaction, my cough had subsided. This was really a horrible experience, and at the time I was unaware that it was a reaction to Lotrel. It wasn't until I checked around and had read the warnings that I have became aware that that medication. In addition I had spoken to a co-worker who has had similar but a lesser reaction to Lotrel. I was shocked to as to the severity of my action and hope not to experience this ever again. Until this day I am left with this on and off uncontrolable cough, and I have kept this medication as a reminder of my experience and as a warning to others who are unaware.

My DR is closely monitoring this drug for side effects, which I'm now experiencing in less than a year. I've had a noticeable swelling of my ankles which subsided overnight after elevating my legs. During the night I experience some leg cramps. Getting severe back muscle pain as if I injured my back, but pain is not constant. However, the intense pain stopped me from getting up from the couch and chair I use for the computer. Starting me thinking I might have a tumor or is that just belly flab extending around my back I can't get rid of. Got sagging jowls in my face I didn't have before. Back pains so severe I stopped taking every day, will try every other day along with one Alleve over the counter. Planning to ask my Dr for an emergency consultation and ask for something else.

I take 10mg lotrel (this is new, i used to take norvasc 10mg)  with a half aspirin.  My Dr said take xanax and then clonidine if it goes over 160.  At night it is 178/83 and in the am 156/77.  These numbers do vary, but that approx.  During the day I average 143/72.  Last night my hands were very tight?? and woke me up??? What does that mean?

On my own I went off it for 3 days (pains subsided and bp went up again); Dr said it couldn't be the lotrel, see my GP.  Went to GP who ordered ultrasound and upper GI...everything was normal!  Went back on lotrel again...same side effect.  Not worth the adverse side effect for me.  Hoping Dr will prescribe something else that will be more gentle on my stomach.

It has lowered my high blood pressure tremendously. I'm talking 180/100 to 135/70 and that is absolutely great for me. One other benefit that I receive from it is I no longer get migraines. If I get a migraine, it never is full blown and nowhere near as strong as before. I think if I get lower my blood pressure naturally, I would want to stay on it anyway to keep the migraines away. The only thing I don't like about it is that sometimes after I take the capsule, it causes some type of a weird burp after it is in my stomach or something &amp; not very pleasant but that doesn't happen all the time and I think it might be more my GERD than the pill itself.

Over the course of the 6 months, my tongue was swollen to the point where it was effecting my breathing, my eye has swollen up a few times and my muscles were constantly fatigued.  I'm not taking Lotrel anymore, I'm on Azor, iron supplements and the doctor prescribed Benzonatate for my cough. I'm tracking my progress.

I have experienced side effects in varying degrees, such as leg/ankle swelling, dry cough, weight gain and worst of all, fatigue and muscle weakness. HOWEVER, this drug has also made my severe and frequent migraines virtually nonexistent now (doctored for migraines for over 10 years). Because of the side effects, I recently tried a different drug to treat the HBP. New drug side effects seemed minimal, but within a few weeks, I started to get migraines again.  Sooo, back on the Lotrel, now with a second (water)pill for fluid retention symptom, and dealing with the rest.  Anything is better than having my life ruled by migraines, ever again!  Blood pressure continues to be well controlled.

Medicine was stopped and was told I can never take an Ace Inhibitor again!! There is an substance in the pill which can cause an allergic reaction, like tongue swelling, in some people. I was lucky to find out the problem and stop this drug before it stopped me!!! I am on a test drug of Bystolic 5mg.. hope it helps my BP..

Since taking it I have experienced severe ear infections and break out in a rash that covers my entire body from head to toe. I have been to a dermatologist and allergist and had numerous tests done but no one seems to be able to find out what is causing the rash. HELLO?????? My doctor refuses to believe that it is the Lotrel that causes these other problems, but it seems too much of a coincidence to me. I itch so badly I scratch myself open. I'm sick of these side effects and am seriously thinking of not taking it anymore and returning to Cozaar.

My GI dr said antibiotics damaged digestive system in 06. When my new primary care dr double my Lotrel dosage to 10-20 I lost my ability to speak normally along with the extreme energy drain and fatigue (felt very ill) Asked several drs could a med be causing this problem. Was too quickly dismissed by them.  I read the med summary on rxlist.com about how you should not take an ace inhibitor if you don't have edema. I told my dr that I became very ill when she doubled the dosage of Lotrel. I stopped taking the ace inhibitor and after 15 months of not being able to speak normally my voice immediately returned to normal. The severe energy drain improved considerably. I am now taking just the calcium channel blocker that is in Lotrel(Norvas generic version). I have now developed ocular migraine episodes and eye pressure at the 10mg level with the calcium channel blocker. I have lost 17 lbs. doing Atkins hoping I can get off blood pressure meds altogether. I never realized how harmful antibiotics could be to your digestive system and how bad side effects could be using a blood pressure med. As a patient, it is wise to do your own research and  check out meds before you take them. My dr wants me to report to the FDA what happened to me using Lotrel.

I have not noticed the dry cough other users complain about nor do I have swelling around the feet.  I just had my dosage increased but it has only been a few days since the upgrade.  If I noticed anything abnormal I will ask to be switched to something else.

Lotrel (I am using the generic version) in combination with another drug did control the blood pressure. However, shortly after starting to take Lotrel, I began to develop virtually every side effect mentioned in the reviews:  Swelling of my knees, lower legs,and feet. The bottom of my feet feel like I am walking on ice bare footed, while the feet are warm. Extreme loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping.  Wake up to urinate but very little comes out.  Volume is normal during the day. Legs hurt from the knees down, especially at night. I have frequent chills. I am, at times, freezing at 80 degrees. I also had dry cough and &quot;upper respiratory infection&quot;. I lost all my stamina and tire very easily. The whole situation was complicated when I had a Total Knee replacement in February, 2009. The wounds healed quickly, I had the stitches removed and walked with a cane in two weeks. The constant swelling delayed the internal healing and I have pain in the knee proportional to the swelling. My Orthopedic doctor was so concerned that he sent me to a GOOD family doctor who realized some of the causes, namely the Lotrel, right away and is following through with a complete investigation of all the symptoms.  This new doctor is good: Can you imagine a one (1) hour office visit??  The responses from other people are verifying what the doctor told me so far.

Lotrel brought my BP back to normal or better.  However, it seems to be causing some ED issues.  Anyone else with this sympton?

I recently had to cut it to my ears and it used to be to the middle of my back.  I was just switched to Lisinopril/Hypo, hopefully this will work better.

Could this be a side effect. I was taking 10 mg to start with but, by blood pressure was still elevated.

High Blood Pressure	Ms Edwards, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	25-34	10/8/2008 2:36:24 AM	I took Lotrel as a trial and I took it only for a 2 weeks and a day.  I started to notice my hair was starting to shed more then the usual few strands i see a day.  I went to my dr and told them what was happening and they took me off, but in the process of the medication getting ont of my system, my hair fell out to the point where I had to cut it all off. This happened in about a months time  I was very upset and i was not told about the side effect when i first got the med.  Its not common, but it is indeed a side effect.  So keep that in mind.

High BP is comman in my family and with taking the Lotrel 2 times a day and the clonidine and minoxidil 3 times a day my BP will stay in the range of 125+/85+. there has to be something else out there.

Two months into taking it.  My Dr. up my dosage from 5/10 to 10/20.  Since then I have been experiencing sinus flare ups. Where my sinus would start draining due to sensitivity of certain odors and or dust.  I'm often awaken due to the drainage that occurs.  Recently I started taking my BP meds along with my daily supplements. And by doing this I have found that my sinus side effect have deminish by 90%.  And my levels are in normal range 125/85(avg).

Each year my dr increased the mg of the medicine. I found myself gaining weight and not being able to wear shoes, not even sneakers &amp; flip flops in the summer.  My de's answer to that was buy larger sized shoes/sneakers. He's upset that I keep gaining weight.  Duh...I guess he hasn't read any of the effects for this drug. I AM NOT A HAPPY CAMPER WITH THIS BP MEDICINE.

High Blood Pressure	cozaar, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	4	2	Male	35-44	1/15/2008 7:08:12 PM	I started taking this drug over a year ago. I had chronic hypertension the likes of which my Dr had never seen on anyone conscious.  She told me my age was saving me and put me on Lotrel. HBP runs in my family. Within two weeks my BP was down to normal ranges.  However a year and a half later I cannot bear the dry cough that wakes me up at night, annoys my pastor in church and keeps people at a distance from me at work because they are afraid they are going to catch something. I mean I cough till I get ligh headed and feel like I am going to pass out. Forget making me laugh....I will cough forever before I stop!  What is worse is I am fighting to take off the 20 lbs I have gained. I have drastically increased my workout routine. I took up boxing. I go to a traditional boxing gym 4 times a week and have been going since October. I have only lost 6 lbs despite of the fact that I have dropped ALL my bad habits including beer! No alcohol whatsoever since November.  No pizza, no fatty foods, low calories. I avoid processed food where I can. No binge eating. No explanation for the little improvement. I just have to switch. My sex drive is down the drain. It takes forever to achieve an orgasm even when pleasuring myself. Sometime I even quit! That is all I need to switch. It works very well but hopefully something else will do the job.  You only live once and I would also like some of the other pleasures of life along with good health. Good luck to you all.

I stopped taking it for a while and when i had problems again the hospital put me on metropolol which  did absolutety nothing I demanded to go back on Lotrel and it WORKS. I do get a headache when starting or stopping the drug and the cough is typical of any ace inhibator, but overall for me this is the solution. I might add i only use Brand.

Blood pressure is steady, but I am noticing a weight gain.  A slow, steady weight gain.  I am not overweight, run/exercise on a regular basis and my &quot;habits&quot; have not changed.

High Blood Pressure	SBKat, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	12/21/2007 8:40:54 PM	My Dr gave me to high of dose, 5/40 &amp; kept me on Lisinopril/HCTZ 20/25, I'm a 110lb 45yo Fe.  On 2/4/07, after 12 days I had a severe hypotensive episode, &amp; lost my BP for a while. I have experienced brain damage, especially in regards to speech &amp; memory, as well as numerous chronic neurologocical &amp; physiological problems.  Interesting enough, the majority are noted side effects of Lotrel. I kept saying I felt like the drug was still in me, &amp; was told no way. After going to the website askapatient.com, &amp; reading 250+ other people's generally very negative comments about this drug, &amp; speaking to different pharmacists who have told me they believe that some people will never lose their side effects even after discontinuing it, I strongly urge people to post their comments on that site &amp; other medical sites to see what help, hopefully exists, for these problems.

Is this a normal thing? My doctor doesn't seem to think it's the Lotrel, but I am and have been in excellent health and the problem did not start til after I started the Lotrel, so...Anybody with an opinion of same would be welcome!
