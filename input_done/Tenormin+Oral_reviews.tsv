High Blood Pressure	Dave, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Caregiver) 	4	5	1	Male	65-74	5/1/2012 2:11:39 PM	I took this drug for maybe 30 years. In that time I quit smoking, drinking and lost 60 lbs. Recently I complained of shortness of breath. Since my B/P has been good for many years my doctor weaned me off of it. As a result I no longer have shortness of breath, my heart rate went from high fortys to mid sixtys, no more fatique, my GERD got better, not so cold all the time, more alert, and my B/P is still very good. So, change in life style was a good move.

Have ringing in ears since I started taking tenormin 6 years ago. My legs  hurt when I walk and feel heavy. The generic form (atenenol) caused so much pain in my legs I had to switch to tenormin. I have gained about 20 lbs since I started using this drug. My annual blood work is all normal,thank goodness,but recently colesterol level slightly elevated so am walking 30 mins at least 4 times a week now.My dosage started at 50 mg a day. I had to half the pill and take it twice a day for best effectiveness.

Dr added Lisinopril 20 mg once a day. I assumed that things were ok but after reading these reviews I have a LOT of symptoms that I thought were due to getting older so just put up with them. Thinning hair, fatigue, weight gain, no libido, tired all the time, depression and so on. I wish I had chosen to be a Dr now instead of a Super Hero - Darn that career advisor. LOL

I will now have to add other meds to it. I did turn diabetic also and now I wonder if it is a good one at all with kidneys of diabetics. They say ace inhibitors are what i should take now.But I had a long run and good experience with tenormin. Little side effects. 
High Blood Pressure	A.C., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	45-54	5/5/2011 4:01:30 AM	Took atenolol 50 mg for 1 year. It lowered my blood pressure but caused massive hairloss which was immediately noticed after taking this medication for 3 months. Stopped taking atenolol and it took 1 year for fuzz to start growing back in the bald spots. Was told all beta blockers cause hairloss or thinning of hair. Now taking Diltiazem HCL 120 mg. Working well.

High Blood Pressure	lor, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/3/2011 8:34:22 PM	used this drug for almost 5 years,made me tired with very low bp and heart rate until i discovered eating at least one banana during or after breakfast before i take 1/2 atenolol really helps.probably because banana contains potassium which is one of the useful nutrients to fight fatigue. i take the other 1/2 of the 25mg after dinner.tenormin works great for my anxiety too. one mile walk will help with weight gain.

High Blood Pressure	farmboyinky, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	45-54	9/8/2010 11:07:07 PM	I have been taking atenolol 100 mg/day for 10 years. It has done a great job of controlling my HBP, but I have long suspected it of some unpleasant side effects. Recently I have tapered off and trying to discontinue it totally, my doctor has switched me to lisinopril 40 mg/day. The very first day I cut my dose in half I noticed my acid reflux was much better. I have had bad reflux for several years and the last two days I have taken nothing at all for acid. I have coughed from acid for years before finding out the cause, now I know the cause of the acid. I also have long suspected sexual side effects from atenolol, but time will tell if that is verified. My sex life has become nothing for the last several years. That has caused great frustration and depression in itself. This medicine does a great job lowering blood pressure, but be very cautious and attentive if using it. It can cause lots of unwanted problems too.

I still have breakthrough episodes of afib and am waiting to see an EP doctor. I feel like my bp is low and get dizzy frequently. If I dont take it I have a fast heart rate. I can't seem to find a balance. I am otherwise super healthy. My doc thinks when I took a relpax for a migraine that is what set all this off. I am at a loss.

Has slowed heart rate a little but I believe it has also mede me tired all the time. I also take meds for high blood pressure so it could be a combo of all meds. Gained about 10 lbs. All told, heart rate is down and I don't feel heavy pounding in my chest.

B/P still is up and down so doctor added Atenolol 25 mg three weeks ago to the mix.  Have to discontinue it due to leg pain.  Its disheartening that using B/p medications is a trade off in problems due to the side affects.  Still looking for a good combination that doesn't cause pain, coughing, larthargy etc.

Works well. At dosage of 25mg per day, found that heart rate did not respond to demands of exertion.  I cut dosage to 12.5mg in morning and evening.  Now, heart rate responds normally.  I suspect it has contributed to my erectile disfunction.

Rapid Ventricular Heartbeat	gail5678@gmail.com, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	65-74	1/14/2010 1:35:18 PM	I developed a condition called PAT.  Very common.  It was uncomfortable so a doctor prescribed a beta blocker (Atenol) to lessen the effects, even tho I have low blood pressure.  I took it for a few years until I developed dizzy spells and feeling like I was going to faint.  I figured it was my PAT so I doubled the dose one day and found myself on the bathroom floor.  I had fainted.  I immediately stopped taking it and my fainting spells went away.  I went back to the doctor and he wanted me to go right home and take another one.  So stupidly I did and fainted again.  I threw them away and have never felt better.  Dangerous drug with very dangerous side effects.  I was feeling faint while driving...no more.  No more big pharma drugs for me.I rated it effective for lowering blood pressure...but mine didn't need lowering...it's already too low.

Migraine Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	12/3/2009 12:43:52 PM	I was prescribed this medication as a last resort before being referred to a neurologist.  I have tried nearly everythng, and I have to tell you Tenormin seems to be somewhat of a miracle drug.  My dorcot said it would take a few days to a week for it to become effective, and it started wroking the next day (I was prescribed to take twice a day).  I stopped taking it when the headaches and migraines went away and have started taking it again when they came back.  It was not as effective the second time. I would highly suggest if using it for meadaches/migraines, to talk with your doctor before stopping as it may lose it's effectiveness or need the dose increased.

Unfortunately, I developed horrible psoriasis from it, which is on top of a congenital icthyosis syndrome.  It took me a while to pinpoint atenolol as the culprit.  I tapererd off the medication and the skin condition is clearing, but the debilitating chest pains are back.  Any holistic medicines available?

I swear by it, not only did it completely control my irregular heartbeat, but also lowered my blood preasure moderately as a side bonus.My only word of caution is that (in my experience) ceasing it suddenly can be very uncomfortable-symtons resume rather quickly-but other than that one thing, I do swear by it.

I went right back on it and I know I can't live without it. I am not sure if it contributed to a weight gain as I was about the same weight throughout my therapy.
