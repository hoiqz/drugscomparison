Other	Mattfin3, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	6/29/2012 2:37:09 PM	I started on Nadolol 2 years ago to treat excessive feelings of aggression. It's been working very well at preventing my heart from racing and starting up an anger episode. I've also noticed that I'm much steadier with my hands. It's worked well with my other psyce meds too. I recommend it for anyone with a &quot;racing heart&quot; mental illness like panic attacks or aggressive outbursts.

Essential Tremor	Jerry, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	45-54	10/23/2011 11:56:55 PM	Only been taking this for about a week, work just as good as Inderal LA. For A fraction of the cost. I was taking Inderal LA 120 mg 5x a day. I only take Corgard 1x a day, much better! Cost Inderal LA 500.00 per month, Corgard 4.00 per month. This seems to work better than the Inderal to control my tremors.

I asked for a change in medication and immediately all my symptoms went away and my weight is decreasing gradually. I wouldn't take this drug again.
Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome	wbirotte, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/17/2010 12:06:14 PM	I have been taking this medication for 4 years and it has been working like a charm for my mitral valve prolapse syndrome, which gave me a ton of palpatations. They stopped thank goodness. I too fall asleep abruptly after taking this medication which is why i take it right before bed. Great medication.
Migraine Prevention	Karen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/14/2010 3:28:39 PM	I have been taking 40mg 1xDailyAM for 37 years for Migraine prevention. IF I have a breakthrough, I use Midrin. Corgard has kept me from ER and Dr. visits with blinding, vomiting, insidiously painful migraines. 20mg does not work, as I have tried switching to a lower dose several times. Quality of life is everything!
Abnormal Heart Rhythm	Sally L, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/29/2010 5:44:26 AM	I have been taking this drug for a racing heart since I was 23 years old, some 40 years ago. Generics do not work as effectively as this drug. I do not know where I would be at this time without it.

Abnormal Heart Rhythm	Gamtnlady1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	9/11/2009 8:08:08 AM	The drug has worked well to help keep my arrythmia stable.  The only issues that I have with the medication is that as soon as I take it I had better be at home and not driving or at work because within thirty minutes I am about to fall asleep in my tracks.  Rarely does this not happen, but that is how my body responds.  
Abnormal Heart Rhythm	vinny, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/5/2009 12:54:30 AM	Been on the generic for about 20 years and just recently had some more skip beats and fast heart rate,had a sucessful stress test and try to exercise 3 times a week,but heart was still racing.Started with 20mg a day then increased in the last two months to 30mg am &amp; pm but not working,so I started Inderal LA 80 mg 1 a day yesterday and hope this works if not I will go back on Corgard.Very good drug for a long time,guess I need to change and see if this works.

Migraine Prevention	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	6/14/2008 5:33:06 PM	Takes about a month for it to be effective if you have a high amount of caffeine in your diet. Very effective in the prevention of migraines, but can give you a morning headache that will go away in about 10-15 minutes by drinking water or having orange juice.
Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome	Laureen Thompson, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/24/2007 11:49:30 PM	I have used this drug since I was twenty-three years old. It has been beneficial for me in regards to also having diabetes.  I am not on diabetic medication and it lowers my blood sugar.  I stopped having sinus problems after being on this medication for awhile.  It keeps my blood pressure at 150 even when my sugar is low.  I believe the pills should not be split.  The 20 milligrams should be used more than the 40 milligrams, because it pushes your blood pressure down too low, the 40 milligrams. You stay  ahead of other diseases, like liver disease, because it aids the liver when you are a diabetic.  Please get the word out there about Corgard and keep people taking this drug (Brand Only) no Generic.Thank You,Laureen Thompson
