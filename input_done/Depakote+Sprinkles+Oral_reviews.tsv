The only side effect I think I have noticed is that I have become very dependent on my reading glasses. I will need to have my eye sight checked on.

Nausea and stomach ache has been the physical most notorious side effects, but his short term memory is really hard for him at school.

Manic-Depression	Mardigras, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	2	5	Female	55-64	10/27/2010 11:21:30 PM	I was on the generic version, Valproic Acid, of Depakote for over 8 yrs. because I had 'Weight Loss Surgery', which makes me unable to take or digest regular Depakote because of its thick enteric coating or any kind of time-released medications. Thus every night I was having to swallow up to 18 Valproic Acid capsules whole to keep my proper Valproic Acid blood level at the correct therapeutic, maintaining my bipolar disorder because the highest dose of it was in 250 mg. capsules. Taking this lg. amt., along with my other night meds. would fill my little stomach/pouch left from my 'WLS', usually upsetting it and filling it to the max. While hospitalized this last July, my Dr. decided to give the Depakote Sprinkles a try. Apparently they're usually prescribed for children because the ease of administrating them. Open them and put on applesauce or pudding. They're wonderful and I get no more upset stomachs and don't dread taking my night bipolar meds. anymore. I need to take (16) 125 mg. capsules, (the strongest dose they come in), to get my proper 2,000 mg. dose, so they're a bit of a pain to open that many but so worth it. My husband usually does it for me now  
Multiple Seizure Types	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	7/24/2010 9:39:31 AM	My 9 yr old son has been on Keppra made him crazy hyper. We bith lost 10 lbs trying to keep up with him 9neither of us needed to lose weight). Lamitcal rash and very duh like.  Topimax mean to brother and sister. This med seems to work for seizures if we used right I think.  He does weird stuff on it like accidents on floor.  Always holds up three fingers and looks at them. Shakes his rear end like at dance club.  It is hard to know what med is right or not. He had head injury and is relearning to talk. So I have to make the decisions.  Not happy with Dr either only 2 child nuros in OK and they are so busy you cant get in or feel they have time to care.  I really just hate all the meds he has taken it really slows down his relearning process.

Bipolar Depression	chisu_chan, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/12/2009 8:38:00 PM	I was given depakote to erase the crazed mood swings that ruined my ever day life. It took a few weeks for it to kick in, but once it did it improved my life so much. I was able to function properly and go through the whole day without problems.Unfortunantly. You have to keep taking the medicine. My life has been going back to the way it was since my mother stopped helping me get the meds I need.

Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	Spacedoubt, 7-12 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	3	2	1	Female	7-12	10/12/2008 3:13:22 PM	My daughter has simple partial, complex partial, and generalized tonic clonic seizures. Depakote controls her GTCs pretty well. The things is, she is so exhausted that, even after 10 hours of sleep the night before, school sends her home. She also vomits every day after taking it! I am very concerned about damage it might be doing. Her doctor thinks I'm exagerating.It doesn't control her SPs and CPs completely. Her seizures start in her occipital lobe.We are only taking it because she's allergic to everything else we've tried. I'm so frustrated. She took it as a small child, so her time on it is more like 3 and a half years or so, but this time it's 6 months, maybe.
