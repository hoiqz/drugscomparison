Skin Infection due to a Candida Yeast	lowbrow, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	7/31/2012 8:14:26 PM	I was prescribed lotrisone for a fungal infection in the groin area and penis. I used it for 2 weeks, went back to the doctor and with redness. The doctor recommended that I continue the lotrisone and prescribed again. I used it for 6 weeks. I realized it had caused skin atrophy and immediately stopped. The fungal infection is gone but I now have damage from the steroid. It has been over two months sine stopping and I still have a constant burning sensation on the penis, skin atrophy on the foreskin, redness that does not go away. I can not describe to you how much I HATE this medication and the idiot doctor who prescribed it and advised me to continue using it. These steroids are to be used judiciously and should not be used more than  ONE WEEK on the groin. If you have been prescribed this medication BE CAREFUL, if you are a physician and prescribe lotrisone for guys to put on their penis you should know that you may very well be causing a lot of damage to that person. I have discovered however that a great majority of MDs are quite ignorant of the nasty side effects of topical steroids and prescribe it routinely without any regard for the patient.
