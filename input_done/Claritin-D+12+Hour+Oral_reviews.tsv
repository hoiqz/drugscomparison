Vasomotor Rhinitis	rickysneeze, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	9/21/2012 9:39:57 PM	I have been taking Claritin D for the past 12 years. Went through the allergy shots, the testing and nothing has worked for me except Claritin D. I generally switch between the store brand and the name brand. Different people will have different reactions and I agree the Claritin D should be prescription only. In new york you are required to buy a limited quantity with proof of identity, why not just get  script from you health care professional for a longer supply. 
Allergic Conjunctivitis	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/29/2012 8:08:34 AM	I live where &quot;seasonal&quot; allergies are a year-round issue, so I take Claritan-D 12-hour nearly every day for itching eyes and sneezing/itchy/stuffy nose.  Have been doing so for years. Used to take the 24-hr version, but finally figured out I sleep better without the &quot;D&quot; (decongestant=pseudoephedrine) in my system. This has proven to be the most effective OTC allergy medicine for me with no side effects. Unfortunately, Claritan without the &quot;D&quot; provides minimal relief for me, so if I really need an antihistamine in the evenings I will resort to Benadryl (which does make me sleepy).

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	CC, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	45-54	4/10/2011 6:37:30 PM	One pill daily worked to alleviate severe year round allergy symptoms, BUT, I broke out in red, hot hives within an hour of ingesting.  Doctors couldn't figure out what was triggering the hives and I didn't realize it was the Claritin-D till one year later and still suffering with hives.   When my bottle ran out, I stopped taking Claritan D and within days of the build up of the drug leaving my system the hives disappeared!  I was hive free for a month.  Then I decided to try it again this Spring.   Sure enough, took one dose and one hour later there were the hives again.   This patient is done with Claritan D!   I will have to find another OTC drug to take all year to help my constant allergies to dust, pollen, mold, trees and various other triggers.

Other	yourmom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/24/2010 11:26:24 AM	I have Chronic Idiopathic Angioedema and Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria for the past 11 years and the Claratin D 24 is the only medication, otc or prescribed, that keeps all the symptoms of this condition away.  Since taking this medication regularly (every day before I go to bed), I have not had one flare up.  My condition was serious, I was admitted into the hospital 5 times in one year, with 30+ trips to the ER in that same year.  This medication has literally saved my life.

I had a very dry mouth, felt like vomitting, tightness in chest,shoulders &amp; neck, thought I was having a panic attack , insominia, headaches, weakness in arms and legs.  I WILL NEVER AGAIN TAKE THIS DRUG. The minute I stopped taking this, that evening I was much better. I honestly don't know how they can sell this stuff!  Look on www.askapatient.com and you will see I am not alone!!  Incrediable this is on the shelves. I'm telling you this is some scary stuff.   BUYER BEWARE! 
Cold Symptoms	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/30/2009 9:01:58 AM	Within a half hour of taking the 12 hour pill I felt relief in my sinuses without even taking a pain reliever with it. It does dry you out (mouth, skin etc.) but not as much as over the counter Sudafed.  I took it at night and won't do that again because it does keep you up if you are sensitive to that type of thing.  One 12 hour pill in the AM and something different to get you through the night works great.

During the day it lets me breath through my noise. It also keeps my eyes from itching and running.
Stuffy Nose	Dee128, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	5/22/2009 8:09:31 AM	Great to releive that terrible sinus pressure that comes to me with Spring allergies (very bad in NJ).  Wort part, DRY MOUTH... I have also noticed some loss of appetite, but niether are bad enough for me to not take it... I do take only one dose of the 12-hr in the morning, and not again at night - it will keep me up.
Seasonal Runny Nose	Filmiac, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Male	35-44	4/18/2009 8:12:02 AM	I have to admit this is the one medication that seems to calm down my allergies. The 12 hour dose is stronger so it has some effect on me. I'm still pretty miserable but I can at least somewhat function at a limited capacity. Just do what you have to do and try and spend the rest of your time relaxing. Mine, luckily is just seasonal and it will go away eventually.

The only issue i have with this medication is that it makes me depressed and or moody
Seasonal Runny Nose	Spring Is Here, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	3	2	Female	45-54	4/25/2008 4:43:02 PM	I only need it when the trees, (lilac too, flowers,and grass start growing. Especially on windy days. Claritin D has been very effective for me but I stick to the 12 hr dose because the 24 hr dose keeps me UP all night. No other allergies.  The downfall - takes forever to digest &amp; kick in to relieve my symptoms.  Pharm Co that manufactures it should make some changes in the coating for a more rapid release of product.

After a couple weeks on the drug they went away for the most part.  But, the mental swings were pretty bad sometimes.  Made me think I was bi-polar
