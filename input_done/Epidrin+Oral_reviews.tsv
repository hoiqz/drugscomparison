Migraine Headache	KHTulsa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/5/2012 9:47:41 PM	I was prescribed this medication by the hospital that I had to go to due to migraines. I filled the script &amp; and ended up keeping the medicine for a while, then I experienced anotner severe migraine. I was shaking, nauseous,had blurred vision, head hurting so bad I couldn't open my eyes, I thought I was going to have to go to the ER again, then I remembered that I still had some of that medicine from the last time I went, it was. Epidrin aka Midren with in 10 minutes the headache was completely gone!! And so was all of the other symptoms.  Made me very Happy!! Best drug ever manufactured. Now I was able to take care of my 17mo old,3yr old,&amp; 4yr old. Thanks to whom ever discovered this formula!!!

This medication doesnt work and made me feel a bit like I had a lump in my throat. I may help a bit after taking about 5 but by then I'd feel so sick with such a lump in my throat like before one throws up...

Migraine Headache	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	1/3/2010 12:16:26 AM	I suffer from the occasional migraine (maybe 2-4 a month) and epidrin has been great at relieving my pain. If you get up to the 2nd pill you'll feel a &quot;weird&quot; restless feeling that actually makes you tired.
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/17/2009 9:25:30 PM	I have taken Epidrin to help with Vestibular Migraines which have caused me to experience severe vertigo symptoms.  It has worked incredibly well.  Not sure what I would have done without it!
Migraine Headache	sacto, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/9/2009 1:04:15 AM	I began to experience extremely dry sinuses, which would lead to migraines, more than once a week. I was miserable. Pursuing possible allergies as a cause an allergist suggested taking Midrin when my sinuses flared up, it worked wonderfully..the medication is a life saver for me. Two years later, doctors still cannot explain my condition, but Midrin continues to be the only medication that provides relief.

Tension Headache	Epidrin, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	65-74	8/13/2009 3:37:56 AM	Take it with a full glass of water at least 8 oz. It needs time to disolve.  Some people do not do this.  It works fast this way and is easy to digest without food and does not make you sick or quesy
Migraine Headache	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	8/8/2009 3:18:57 PM	I have been using Midrin/Epidrin and a series of other generics since I was 16.  I have to say that Epidrin tends to leave me with a very dry mouth/throat.  Not something I have experienced with the other versions.  It usually will take the headache pain away, if not mostly at least to the point where I can function.  Midrin seems to work better for me rather than the generics.  I just get quicker and more complete relief.  I was taking Amitriptalyn(sp?) as a preventative for a few months but it game me uncontrollable cravings for sweets and I gained weight really fast, so I weaned myself off and will stick to acupuncture for preventing and Midrin to treat symptoms
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	7/3/2009 2:04:12 AM	at first, i only had to take two in 12 hours. then, it moved up to 4 in 12 hours. when i upped the dosage to 4, i could not sleep! i had restless legs, and tossed and turned forever. it does work pretty good for my headache though and it's generic so it's free, which is a definite plus in my book. i'd recommend it to anyone.
Migraine Headache	terry, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	45-54	3/4/2009 11:11:58 AM	My dr. switched me from Imitrex to Epidrin because of my insurance company.  Imitrex works GREAT.  Epidrin doesn't make my headaches go away and I get the feeling that something is stuck between my throat and sternum after taking it - for about 2 hours.  It makes me dizzy and sick to my stomach.  I hate it.
Migraine Headache	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	12/31/2008 3:19:07 PM	I have had headaches for 36 years. I have been taking Epidrin for about 20 yrs.I am directed to take two capsules at onset of headache which often is effective. Otherwise, my doctor directed me to take up to 5/day which takes care of the headache in 90% of the cases.
Tension Headache	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/16/2008 3:34:24 PM	This is the only medication that has worked on my tension/stress headaches.  Highly recommended
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	19-24	10/14/2008 7:11:50 PM	It all started about 6 weeks ago when I was admitted to the hospital for such bad migraines.  The Dr had me on a morphine pump, I got out and felt a ton better.  Slowly the headaches returned and the Dr prescribed Vicodin.  Went yesterday to the Dr and she said I'm taking too much Vicodin and could get addicted.  So she prescribed Epidrin which I've taken twice now.  It does help the headache for the most part, but does cause sleplessness.

Migraine Headache	Mary, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	35-44	7/25/2008 9:46:58 PM	worked well at first but now having to take more to get better results.
Migraine Headache	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		6/26/2008 7:33:13 PM	I started having migrains when I was 16. The epidrin then made me restless at night making me feel anxious. I didn't like it much. I went through a few prevention medications before settling with topamax. I did great for years. I'm 26 now and started having headaches again. I didn't think it was a migrain... it was different. My face hurt like sinus pressure and my jaws hurt like TMJ. My reg. doc. wanted me to see my nerologist again, so I did. I found out that what I was having was migrains, just a different kind. I had reservations to take the epidrin again from prior experience. However, I gave it another chance. I don't have any side effects like I did once before. Just relief. 
Tension Headache	Donna, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/9/2008 12:50:13 AM	Both my doctor and the pharmacist warned me that this medicine would make me &quot;groggy&quot; (doctor) and &quot;zonk me out&quot; (pharmacist; she's young :-)  I haven't noticed anything like that.  I take the two capsules when I have a headache and within half an hour the pain is gone.  I will say that I get the same results from Advil, though, so Epidrin isn't anything I need to keep taking.  The doctor prescribed them for migraines but I haven't had any since picking up the prescription.

Tension Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/7/2008 8:38:14 PM	I have taken this medication over a year now at the onset of my tension headaches.  Within 20 minutes, I feel 99% better.  It is the only medicine that works for me.  The first couple times were ineffective, but I'm glad I stuck with it cause now it works every time.

Migraine Headache	35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/12/2008 10:33:10 AM	This medication did not work for me at all.  I get very sick to my stomach, then start vomiting and get the runs.  It does NOTHING for my headache.  I would NEVER take it again.

I have the Epidrin for non-migraines and it works better than over the counter extra strengh, but since I am on Topomax, I don't have the migraines.
Migraine Headache	45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/12/2007 10:57:03 AM	I have always had a visual warning (aura) before headache.  If I take the medication at the onset of an attack it works very well.  If I take it after the headache starts, which sometimes happens if I get one when I'm asleep, It doesn't work for me.  It doesn't cause any impairment if I have to take it during work.  I do get very restless when I take it which is not a problem during the day but is a problem when I need to sleep.  My pharmacy changed generics which is why I'm taking this one now.  I have taken the name brand medication and 2 other generics.  This works just as well for me as any of the others.
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	2	1	Female	19-24	12/10/2007 12:01:42 PM	well, the first time when i started feeling a migraine i took it &amp; it just knocked me out. i woke up the next morning with the headache. it puts me to sleep, but doesn't take my headache away. i don't know what to do. i can't really afford to go to the dr. again w/out insurance, but i'm going to school so i can't even take this medication...without falling asleep. i have so many things to do; i can't afford to sleep when it is unnecessary. i've heard of topamax but i would like to know what really works before i go to the dr. and they prescribe something else that won't work for me.
Migraine Headache	MrzReid2007, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	11/18/2007 5:17:38 PM	This medication provides relief for my severe headaches and migraine headaches.  If taken on the onset of a migraine it provides fairly fast relief.  I like that if I need to take Epidrin at work it doesn't impair my ability to perform my tasks like most other mirgraine medications do.  I do expierence restlness and sleeplessness with this medication even though my Dr. warned it could make me very sleepy. This is well tolerated during the day but can be quite bothersome at night. Overall I am fairly happy with this medication and I do like that it is a generic drug which makes it more affordable. I would recommend migraine or severe headache sufferers to ask their heath care provider about Epidrin.   
Migraine Headache	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/25/2007 10:34:58 PM	Nothing else worked for me, and I tried this and I love it. It works in 20 minutes. Which is good for me having 2 small children.
Migraine Headache	35-44	5	5	5		35-44	10/23/2007 2:06:06 PM	one to two capsules, as pain begins and within 20 minutes pain is gone.  I also mix this with 5mg reglan for the nausea.  careful the first couple times you take it, it can make some drowsy at first.  But the relief!
Migraine Headache	C J, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/22/2007 2:07:48 PM	Epidrin gave me back my life.  At the onset of the visual aura, I take an Epidrin and my eyesight is back to normal in 30 mins. with no headache pain. I hope the rumors I have heard that Epidrin is being discontinued in not true.
