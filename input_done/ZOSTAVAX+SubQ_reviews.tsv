I recieved the vaccine three weeks to prevent any recurrence, the shot was not painful, had some redness and soreness at the site for 3 days, no problems after that.
Prevention of Shingles	splash2, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	65-74	5/22/2012 10:58:35 PM	Got the Zostavax today. Within 5 min of getting it,felt weird,like a &quot;rush&quot;. Then my head felt pressure,hard to discribe. I have controlled high BP but since I had the shot at a Pharmacy, I took my BP there and it was 179/95 p.82. This is very high for me. I am allergic to ACE inhibitors, aspirin and tetracylines and told nurse who screened me of this. Had also seen my primary Dr. in the am and he didn't warn me of any such side effects.As I waited after the shot, BP fell to 155/80. I went home to lie down and took a BP med. After 40 min. pressure went down again. But still felt weird and spacey. After reading all the bad reactions here AFTER I had the vaccine, I wish I hadn't taken it. Who knows what the future will bring? I felt super before taking it but now,really &quot;out of it&quot;. If it gets worst, I will call Dr . Looks like I may be in in for the ride of my life! Merck may be experimenting with Srs. to perfect this Vax. Certainly we will be collateral damage.
Prevention of Shingles	Me, 65-74 Male  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	65-74	3/26/2012 9:08:30 PM	At annual physical, Family Dr. recommended shingles vaccine... Never had chicken pox...$45.00 copay. On 1/123/12, the injection was painless at my pharmacy- no sores... Two weeks later joint pain started &amp; remains today is 3/26/12... Pharmacist talked to Merck. they said it is not related. My advice to prospective users is to google www.merck.com It tells you joint pain is a side effect. So does fda.gov...I would take not take it again, if I had it to do over....[time will not tell because I have no record of chicken pox...

I received my vaccination on Wednesday afternoon and noticed itching on my right leg on Saturday morning. Saturday afternoon I concluded that I had Shingles due to the red rash, itching and swelling at multiple locations on my right leg. I had an intense work out on Thursday might which may have lowered my resistance but there was no recommendation from the doctor to take it easy. I conclude this must be a mild case because there is no severe pain that my family members reported. My rating is based on my estimation that I would have gotten a much worse case of Shingles without the vaccine. My symptoms are similar to poison ivy. 
Prevention of Shingles	Hurting and Worried, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	55-64	1/1/2012 8:11:37 PM	I had the Zostavax injection on 12/21/11. That night severe itching started at the site of the shot on my right upper arm and all around it.  Benedryl cream  helped but did not stop the itching and I was not able to return to sleep that night. The next day I noticed the development of an oval rash just below the injection site, about 3&quot;x2&quot;, and very itchy. Over the next several days below that site I also developed a scalelikeskin condition, also very itchy.  This itchy rash and scaling persisted as it was for almost a week causing much discomfort and lack of regular sleep before it began to rapidly fade along with the itching.  However tonight I have developed stabbing intermittent SEVEREburning pain on the lower part of my right  arm, just below the skin, pain that staggers me when it hits and leaves a burning and numbing sensation after fading.  It comes and goes, seemingly at random. I just consulted our medical guide and this pain is almost exactly as the beginning pain of shingles is described.  I am now afraid this injection may have given me the very illness I took it to prevent.Based upon my continuing experiences I would STRONGLY recommend anyone contemplating injection with this vaccine NOT to do so.

Prior to the vaccine, I had a complete STD workup done and my STD workup came back negative to EVERYTHING.  I am starting a new relationship now and my partner and I are having STD blood workup done before we go further.  Well, my Herpes results came back positive for Type I and II, all other results were negative.   I can ONLY think that the antibodies from this vaccine are giving the reading as a positive to the Herpes Virus as I have absolutely No other signs of this virus or have even been recently kissed by any frogs.

However, two days later I developed a cold sore on my upper lip.  Now five weeks later I have another one on the other side of my upper lip.  This is not something I normally suffer, so I feel sure it is caused by the Zostavax.

I've been exposed to Chicken Pox several times, even as an adult, and to my knowledge, haven't had the virus. After reading all responses to this blog, I am going to refuse, and take my chances. The reactions seem too painful to take a chance. I'm a type II diabetic and have enough pancreatic problems without adding this to my troubles. Good luck!

We've been married 40 years, and I never caught it until after taking the vaccine--coincidence? I don't know. The herpes is very virulent, with active symptoms lasting about a year and a half so far, docs can't help, it's resistant to all the anti-virals I've taken.

Diagnosis:  pancreatitis, unknown etiology.  I have no history of any pancreatic type disorders.  I believe the zostavax was the causal agent of my pancreatitis, which has resolved, but the future is unknown if there are to be any damages to the pancrease.

The next day I felt nauseous after lunch and by nightfall I had pain in my upper left abdominal area and I was vomiting so badly that there was green bile in the vomitus.  I finally had to visit the ER and was admitted to the  hospital with severe pain dur to Acute Pancreatitis.  I recovered after three days and my regular MD showed me a 26 page report about pancreatitis that stated Varicella Zoster is often associated with pancreatitis.  I believe the Zostavax which is a live attenuated virus was the causative agent.
Prevention of Shingles	Sandy, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	65-74	1/25/2011 9:07:38 AM	I received the Zostavax injection on Thurs. 1/20 and was fine until Friday night 1/21 when I noticed a red spot and slight pain in the site.  The next day the spot had grown to 3 X 4 in. &amp; I had a swollen knot the size of a tennis ball.  There was considerable itching, jabbing intense pain &amp; I spent all day Saturday and Sunday icing the spot, taking Advil, Benydryl &amp; sleeping pills each night so I could get some rest.  My shoulder and whole arm feels numb &amp; weak.  I also applied a steroid salve given to me for severe case of poison ivy. I even thought of going to the Emergency Room but because i didn't have any difficulty breathing didn't.  On Monday I went to the pharmacy who administered it &amp; the pharmist said she'd never seen that kind of reaction &amp; if it got any worse to go to a doctor.  Tuesday morning 1/25 and although the redness &amp; swelling has shrunk somewhat, it's still there.  And my arm is still weak. I don't know if this will ever go away. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone, deal with the shingles, if it happens, be aware &amp; have it treated then.  Even with the shot, you have a 50/50 chance of still contacting shingles!  This immunication shouldn't have even been put on the market.

Prevention of Shingles	Fern, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	12/7/2010 1:22:25 PM	Because I had the chicken pox as an adult I never wanted to get the shingles.I took the shingles vaccine in June 2008 and several weeks later got a severe reaction from the top of my head to the top of my feet. I've had biopsies and multiple blood work which only showed that i may have an allergic reaction. I've been to 4 dermatologists, one infectious disease doctor, my oncologist, radiologist oncologist and surgeon for help. ALL 8 doctors have never seen my type of reaction.  My face and chest have the typical fluid pustules and the rest of my body has a flat purple design all the way to my feet and arms.  My face, mouth and tongue burn first then it goes to  the rest of my body. Also, it feels like needles are stinging my skin.  I do not itch. Along with this I have severe stomach pain, bloating and diarrhea.   My reaction to the shingles shot has affected my stomach.  It has been 2 1/2 years since this began.  Today my pcp prescribed an anti viral pill to be taken 3 times a day for the next ten days. If this doesn't work i will find a virologist.  I have been in touch with Merck and they are no help.

Prevention of Shingles	kstrickoff, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	1	Male	55-64	2/23/2010 1:01:36 AM	I have never had shingles, but I recently turned 60, and had the shot, since my wife had the shingles 2 years ago, and it seemed like the wise thing to do. I had the shot last Tuesday 02/16/10. Everything appeared just fine for a few days with no symptoms. Then I woke up Saturday morning with sore throat, headache, achiness, and a 102.8 fever; some rashes began erupting on my ring finger (I don't wear a ring on that finger), and more mildly on the top of my hands. Sunday the fever diminisbed but I still felt like a space cadet, and the rash on my ring fingers and hand were growing and erupting some morer; my MD perscribed a Z-Pak as a precaution, and opined that my apparent virus was not related to the shingles shot; yet by Monday afternoon it is now looking very much like a shingles rash on my hands and fingers. All this from talking a preventative vacination.It sure would be nice to get some wise professional advise, as to what I should now to minimize the severity of this reaction, and make it go away! All responses will be appreciated!
Prevention of Shingles	Ann Miller, 65-74 Female  (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	65-74	2/6/2010 5:22:47 PM	My doctor recommended that I get the vaccine in June 2009, as I am 67 and have had chickenpox. I had an extremely unpleasant time for two weeks after the shot, with flu like symptoms, raised hot red area the size of a large hand on my arm, with a great deal of pain. I have had THREE short occurrences of shingles since the shot, and none before. I feel like a guinea pig. I had no idea until I read these reviews that the vaccine was a new thing, virtually in its testing period. I feel that extra virus has been introduced into my system. I am very suspicious and unhappy with my doctor's recommendation.

No problem with the injection until Thursday when my arm became sore. But, by Friday my arm was red, swollen, burning hot and itching. I called the pharmacy where I was given the injection, and the pharmasist told me to put cortizone cream or ointment on the red spot. By this time the &quot;spot&quot; was 3&quot; x 4&quot; in size. After putting the cream on it, it was better. I'm going to have to keep putting the cream on it for a few days.
Prevention of Shingles	Mark, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	3	1	1	Male	55-64	2/1/2010 12:35:11 PM	24 hrs after receiving injection I became weak and my gut began to ache like the flu. After two days I experienced significant knee joint pain in my right knee, and some in my left that required 600 mg Ibuprofen, ice, and a knee brace to knock the pain down. My guts continue to ache and I am very tired four days after the shot. A friend of mine got the shot and she was experiencing flu-like sysmptoms and exhaustion for ten days. Folks, Merck does not even have a place on their website to acknoledge problems. It is about the money - at a 50% success rate, this drug should not have been released. I personally beleive the large drug companies are now skewing the results of their testing to favor the drug. To receive this vacine is the equivalent to getting shingles, but you get shingles for free, and this cost $218.00.

It hurt a lot as I drive away.  Within 2 days I had a large, bright right swelling around the injection site and a large flat circle of redness extending from elbow to upper arm and halfway around my arm.  The injection site was very painful, swollen, hot and itchy.  After a week, the flat circle disappeared but the bright red swollen area remained.  It then changed to a blotchy, rash-like appearance.  The pain was severe enough that I iced the area several times daily and took OTC pain relievers.  Eleven days later, the swollen area and redness are both significantly smaller and the pain is reduced although very much present.

On 2/14/08 I had a large burning rash on my back.  I immediately went to the Doctor who diagnosed my condition as &quot;Shingles&quot; obviously caused by the vaccine!  Merck does NOT tell the doctors or patients that is is possible (I'm the proof) to get Shingles from their vaccine.  My Doctor has prescribed Valtrex for 7 days to attenuate this virus.  Now I'm ill, out two visits to the doctor, plus $180 for the Zostavax, and the cost of Valtrex (which costs $10/pill).  I notified Merck's &quot;Adverse Experience&quot; hotline @ 800-444-2080 and told them of my experience.  They told me that they never saw this occur (I don't believe them).  I requested that they notify all doctors and include in all their advertising that it is possible to get Shingles (even if it is a small chance) from their vaccine.  I also asked them to cover my expenses.  Their comment back to me is: &quot;do you want me to transfer you to our legal department?).
