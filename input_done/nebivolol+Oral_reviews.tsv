High Blood Pressure	anonymous female, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	6/26/2012 3:56:39 PM	Terrible sleep problems since I started with nebivolol. Problems falling asleep, staying asleep. I wake up in the middle of the night, and wake up early. I did not have these sleep problems before, and no other change or stressor in my life, so it must be the medication side effect.I read somewhere that it affects the melatonin level in the body. So I have tried with melatonin supplements but it does not do anything. Anyone else having same problems and how you deal with it.

I have suffered with hbp for years. Tried various drug combinations. Micardis was making me feel like a zombie. Thank God got of of Micardis and was using norvasc and hztc. Suffered with angina symptoms and bp in mid 130's/80's. Not bad for my age but angina a problem! Cardiologist put me on this drug. Instant effects dropped first day to 116/67.  Amazing had to monitor bp did not drop to low. If so cardio said to cut in half from 10mg to 5mg. Now trying without Norvasc 120/67...unbelievable!!! So far no side effects other than sleeping and increased water intake. Nothing to worry about if this works I will be a very happy man. Will keep you posted.

He has never felt better and has no reactions at all.

It is like I am speeding inside. I do not like the way I feel. I was trying to give it some time to see if it gets better but I can't handle many more days of this.

High Blood Pressure	Gertees, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		2/1/2010 3:53:55 PM	Having problems with a different BP med, my primary physician switched me to Bystolic. It immediately changed the way I felt. From tired and almost depressed I began to &quot;feel normal&quot;. It is combined with the use of Norvasc which seems to be doing the job.

High Blood Pressure	Hemingway, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	4/3/2008 2:01:20 PM	I've been struggling with my BP for over two years. During this time period, I've tried several beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Only Toprol XL effectively controlled my BP, however, I just couldn't deal with the side effects. Then my doctor introduced me to Bystolic (nebivolol). It has worked like a charm. It controls my BP and I no longer suffer from the side effects. I might grow a third eye in five years, but right now I am very pleased with this drug.

There seems to be a reduction in the amount of fluid.Also I am taking this drug with Amlodipine Oral
