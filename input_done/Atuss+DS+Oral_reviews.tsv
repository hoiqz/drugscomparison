Cold Symptoms	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	2	2	Female	25-34	1/25/2011 10:19:30 AM	I was giving this medicine to my 3 year old son for a cough and runny nose.. The medicine worked great wiped out the cough and congestion, but it made him wake up in the middle of the night everynight he took it. He would stay up for at least 2 hours before going back to sleep.. When I stopped the medicine he slept through the night again.

About 3 times a year he gets a severe cough and I cant find anything to stop it but this medication. It does make him extremly sleepy but we give it to him at bedtime and it lets him get a good nights rest without coughing and within 2 to 3 days this cough is entirley gone.

I also have high blood pressure. After only one dose my blood pressure went to 215 over 99. I had to go to the emergency room because I felt dizzy. I will never take this medication again.
Cough	Lisa, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	10/26/2009 9:39:10 AM	I had a horrible cough for over a week (flu) and I have asthma.  I sought relief of prescription medication without narcotics.  This medication has some unpleasant side effects (dry/numb mouth, taste nasty, makes you sleepy) but it works, it kept my cough at bay (I was coughing so hard I was throwing up, headaches, and seeing black.  I was able to get some rest at night and go outside without people thinking I was deathly ill.
Cough	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/18/2009 9:47:52 AM	I started taking this drug because of a nasty cough and other flu or cold-related symptoms.  After my first dose, I was a little bit restless for about an hour but then drifted into my first night of deep sleep in over four days.  I have also noticed that it does stay with me for the entire timeframe estimated(12 hours).

He will have a little energy and then be super sleepy. He does sleep through the night, but is real drowsy. As a parent, I have mixed feelings about this med.
Cough	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	19-24	5/2/2009 2:03:33 AM	My cough has eased slightly since I started taking it, but it makes me feel all crazy. I can't remember things easily, I'll say something to someone and repeat it within a couple minutes because I forget that I said it, it makes my eyes feel dry and like they're sinking into my head and they keep watering, and it tastes terrible. I sleep a lot more than usual on it, too. So, unless you want to feel like crap and sleep a lot, I don't recommend it.

Cough	 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female		1/12/2008 9:47:17 PM	This is the first non-narcotic cough syrup that has controlled my bronchial spasms, but at $78 for 8 oz it's not cost effective at all.  Tussinex is 1/2 the price and works better.  Since I drive for a living, atuss is the better choice for me.  The taste is better than most cough syrups.
