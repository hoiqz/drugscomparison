One hour later heavy dizziness, nausea and diarrhea started.  Two hours later chills added to that.  Ten hours later still a little dizzy and very nauseated. I will never take this again!!!

My mother and I have always gotten migraines and it gotten to the point where I failed 2 semesters in college and had to drop out of nursing school. Before this medicine I would get a migraine for 10 days straight! This medicine definitely works wonders and I highly recommend it!!!

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	25-34	4/12/2011 6:45:22 PM	I had a severe case of bacterial menengitis, I was lucky and the only thing I have after my illness is severe migrains and seizures. I had tried everything for migrains and before I got my script for prodrin I had a 3 day long migrain headache, I got complete relief 20 minutes after taking the prodrin. To this day it still works for my headaches(migrains). I don't get any bad side effects from it. I absolutely love this medicine. It has worked wonders for me. Especially since I tried about 5 medications before the prodrin
Other	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/13/2011 11:19:52 AM	I've had migraine and tension headaches since 1984.  I've taken all types of medications with little or no results in preventing my headaches.  Until recently, I was taking Midrin, but since it's been discontinued my doctor prescribed 'PRODRIN'.   I take it twice a day to prevent the onset of headaches.  And I haven't had a headache since.  I was taking Midrin twice a day and then if I got a headache I would take Axert.  I have yet to take the Axert to date. 
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/3/2010 7:21:35 PM	Severe Migraines.  I have tried Many of the drugs on the market and this drug has given me my life back. This drug doesn't make me feel restless nor drowsy. I can fully function with Prodrin. Was paying an average of $41.00 with insurance but as of today, the price has doubled to $80.00. I do not understand why but will have to pay to feel human.

Other	13-18 Female  (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	13-18	10/25/2010 6:20:06 PM	I suffer from chronic migraines that I experience nearly every day, so along with other medications my doctor perscribed this drug. The pill works fine as far as eliminating my headaches, but it makes me so nauseous that I would almost rather have the headaches.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	5/27/2010 11:27:38 PM	I am 20 yrs old and have severe migraines. I weigh only 115lbs which I think may contribute to the meds effects. I used to take half, but now must take a whole prodrin for it to work. It makes my body feel heavy and hard to move. My headache never gets better, and I'm weak in the mornings. My vision slightly blurs and I can't remember anything the next day. I hate this medicine!
Other	19-24 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5		19-24	4/21/2010 7:40:00 PM	I was prescribed Prodrin when I was diagnosed with meningitis.  The headaches were HORRIBLE, and nothing would relieve the pain. One pill of Prodrin and 20 minutes later, my headache was almost completely gone! This is a very good product.  Made me drowsy, so I reccommend taking before you go to sleep, but other than that - it was a miracle pill!

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	1/7/2010 10:49:50 PM	I went to  urgent care after having a headache for 3 straight days.  I have been experiencing migraines for the last few months  and nothing was working. The PA prescribed me prodrin and advised me to take  2 pills at first and then one every hour until headache is gone.  I had to go to three pharmacies to find this medication because no one seemed to have it in stock. Once I got home I took 2 pills right away and ate a meal.  30 minutes later my headache was gone which I was extremely relieved.  However I did notice my heart racing quite a bit and figured it was the caffeine in the pill.  Since then I have been taking just one pill with the onset of a headache and this has been taking my headaches away and I do not notice my heart racing at all.

Had migraines since I was 8 yrs old (for 40 yrs now).  Prodrin works very well.  I have not had any of the side effects that others are describing.  Very pleased.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	2	Female	25-34	10/28/2009 4:03:23 PM	My doctor recommended this drug when midrin was discontinued and said it was the same thing. I took midrin before and was somewhat pleased with the results. With Prodrin, I took as the label said and felt very drowsey, loopy, felt faint when I stood up, had crawly skin, rapid heartrate, it kept me from sleeping, and made me see spots. It did help with my headache temporarily, but after the drug wore off, my headache was back. For me it gives some relief, but I can only take it when I don't have to work, sleep, or drive.

I took them in the doctor's office and by the time I left, my migraine was gone!  I am looking forward to using this medication as needed for my migraines.  I hope everyone who uses it gets this kind of relief.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	6/26/2009 10:27:32 AM	I have also suffered from very bad migraines for years. Since trying this  med my migraines are well controlled. The only bad side is when I take the first 2 for the onset it makes me very spacey and dizzy which is not good for my vertigo. Other than that I would recommend this to anyone with chronic migraines!!
Other	rfammy, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	25-34	6/25/2009 9:10:11 PM	I have suffered for migraines for 3 or 4 years now.  I have tried many of the triptans, excedred migraine and some butabital, but I couldn't find the right combination.  triptans made me sick and the others just didn't work.  I was givin prodrin samples about a month ago, and it knocked out my migraine.  So far so good.  I did some research and I found that Prodrin has double the amount of isometheptene than a product called midrin.  So to help with the jittery feeling I only took 1 prodrin every hour until my migraine ended.  Help with the jitters.  It might help with some of the other minor side effets.

I'm only 17 and my body is used to taking extra stregth tylnol. So I usually take 2 of them which is 1000mg. But when I took this PRODRIN I only took 1 and then fell asleep. 30mins later i was jolted awake by my heart beating fast and felt numb all over my body! MY HEADACHE was completly gone in which obviously I loved. But to feel like I couldn't move is scary! I had the worst sideaffects from taking this medicine! I was dizzy kept on almost blacking out! It was rediculous!
