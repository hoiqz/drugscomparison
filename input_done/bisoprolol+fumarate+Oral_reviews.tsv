High Blood Pressure	BNark, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	45-54	6/26/2012 7:55:26 PM	I was stressed due to family and work issues. Ended up having palpatations. This did little to help with that but did lower my blood pressure initially. After 4-5 months blood pressure was back up to old #'s. Biggest issue was difficulty breathing and tough sleeping to the point where I want to get off as it has progressively gotten worse.

Prevention of Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation	Steve, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	1	Male	55-64	1/8/2012 3:29:46 PM	Prescribed bisoprolol at 2.5mg rate/day to stabilize rate after sudden onset of AF. Has badly affected my digestion so hands become cold and turn blue between meals although heart rate is controlled. First evening on this medication I blacked out because the initial dosage given was at 5 mg which is abnormally high compared to manufacturer recommended initial dose and this produced a weak pulse with low BP.

I also have asthma, but this beta blocker  is cardio selective and has not caused worsening of my asthma. We have been going up in doses slowly over about 3 months and will end up taking 10mg morning and night. So far it does seem to be helping though not dramatically so. I have noticed some dizziness and gettting tired and out of breath earlier than i did before.
