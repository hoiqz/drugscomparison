Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	Robert, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	5	Male	13-18	6/17/2012 11:42:28 PM	I took this medication while i was in high school, my junior year.  After going through junior high and some of high school with severe untreatable acne, that effected my self-esteem and confidence a great deal.  I am not 4 years out of college and ever since I had taken accutane my skin is flawless.  I did not experience any abnormal side effects, just dry skin(which you get with other acne ointments) and minor nose bleeds once or twice.  Til this day my mom looks at me and still cannot believe how clear my skin is.  I did go monthly to get my Liver functions tested and they were always within normal limits.  I am now a nurse and highly reccomend this medication for anyone who has tried everything else for their acne without positive results.  If side effects for you become to severe, like any medication, consult your doctor and consider discontinuing this medicate.  All i can say is that accutane changed my life and I dont know how any can experience depression from this drug when it was curing my reason for low self-esteem, depression.  Best of luck to anyone who decides using this drug!

While I was on it, I had continual dry lips and skin and constant bloody noses. I burnt if I was in the sun for even 5 minutes. The first two months my acne was the worst is has ever been, but it was worth putting up with all of these side effects.I have now been off of it for 2 years and this medicine has changed my life! I don't have anymore acne!!!! I still have bloody noses, even after having my nose cauterized-- It's annoying but it was worth it for not having acne. Other than that, my hair is now curly, it was straight before I started this medicine.If you're thinking about it, it is a committment to go through the side effects, but keep your end goal in mind and you can do it. To not have acne anymore has changed my life and I am so happy I took this medication.

I had mostly out grown my teenage acne but I still had quite a bit of it.I originally started off with 40mg/dose. Within days I had peeling and dryness around my mouth, arms, and ears. My acne cleared up within a week and all seemed to go well.I had 4 beers over the course of 6 hours during a holiday. I had read online that you should use alcohol sparingly. The following day I woke up with very tight severe back pain. I went to a chiropractor and finally my dermatologist. Blood tests showed the alcohol mixed with the Isotretinoin really hurt my liver and kidneys. After a week or so off it I resumed at 20mg/dose. This was a much better dosage for me and has worked wonders. With this dosage I also found out I had been depressed. Feelings of doubt and frustration I passed as just a bad day we're now very blatantly depression. This script most definitely works. Just be very careful and follow your physician's directions carefully. Start with 15 days of a high dose and taper off to a lower dose. After speaking with my derm this indeed has made me feel and look so much better. If you have acne you can't get rid of, take this. Be safe and do not drink or do anything that directly effects your liver such as alcohol, drugs, or other metabolizing medications. 
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	19-24	12/20/2011 2:02:01 PM	I have had severe acne since age 14 and have tried every oral and topical medication out there. I just finished my 1st month on accutane and while my face is not perfect, the deep nodule acne is gone and it looks better overall. Severe chapped lips can be controlled with Burt's Bees chapstick during the day and vaseline at night. I recently started getting major back and joint pains. Haven't figured out how to ease that yet. I haven't had any irregular mood swings thus far. The medication is a little pricey, $140 with good insurance for a months supply, plus the monthly doctor visit and lab work. I'm crossing my fingers for a good outcome. 5 more months to go!!

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4		19-24	9/13/2011 2:47:15 PM	I've been on this medication for about two weeks now and have noticed some of the side effects. One of the major ones is dry and peeling lips. Have to keep putting ointment on my lips about 5-6 times a day. Also I've noticed that my face is peeling in certain spots and my scalp is very itchy. Other than that I haven't had any other problems. As for its effectiveness I can't tell yet. From reading other peoples' reviews I think my acne should clear up within a week or so. I'm excited to see the end results.

It worked wonderful, unfortunately he experienced severe depression, moodiness, which is one of the serious side effects. He only stayed on the drug for 4 months instead of the 6 months. We had to take him off the drug, and hopefully he will return to his happy self again. Not sure if the drug was worth it.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	8/23/2011 10:45:05 PM	When starting this medication hearing the side effectsnstarted changing my mind about taking it. But i went with it because nothing else has worked. I have had acne bad for 5 years and I am only 20 years old. I've started taking this medication 3 months ago and no major side effects have occurred. the biggest is dryness, which is a given. First week of the treatment my acne got worse than ever. Now, I receive a few on my neck. My face as never been so clear I have the most confidents in the world and it feels great. It's scary thinking about what could happen. But over all I am very pleased with the outcome and its only been 3 months. 3 more to go and no worries! good luck everyone

No side effects except high cholestrol levels.  Changed my life for the best!!! Nothing else worked.  Thank God it was on the market.

Cleared up my skin for at least 10 years.  Tried again at age 30 and experienced brain swelling and affected my vision, could not read.  Such a shame since it has worked wonders for me in the past.  My Dermatologist told me that 1 out of 100 patients experience swelling of the brain which puts pressure on the ocular nerves, causing blurred vision.  Scary!!

I wish I would have done this 20 years ago, I LOVE IT.  Yes, lips are chapped, skin is dry, but NO PIMPLES!!  Even the old acne scars and pits seem to be smoothing out and fading.  My skin feels smoother now than it has in years.  No other side effects have been noticed.  (I wonder if people with bad side effects took it correctly?)  I LOVE not having oily skin &amp; scalp and having my makeup last all day.  I hope the results last beyond treatment but if acne flares up again in the future, I won't hesitate to go on it again.  The little quizzes and requirements to actually get the drug are overkill and excessive, not to mention degrading since as a 37 year old woman with 2 children, I think I know how reproduction works :)  But it's worth it in the end to get this fabulously clear skin.  And if my kids inherit my acne in the future, I will recommend it to them, too.  
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	Sheddy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	6/30/2010 12:38:33 PM	I have had acne issues since college (now 32). Nothing worked. So, my dermatologist suggested Accutane. He suggested a 4 month treatment. I have now been on it for 3 1/2 months and I have seen little progress. My dermatologist assures me that it will clear up within the month. However, I am growing weary. In the first few months I experienced mood swings,bouts of anger and crying spells. I am still experiencing dry, cracked lips, nose bleeds, dryness inside my nose, and infrequent night terrors. I also have patches of dry skin on my arms and around my mouth. I am holding on to the hope that it will clear up. The side effects are troublesome and basically, annoying. My husband and I are counting down the days until I stop taking Accutane. I really do hope that I start seeing results. Have you experienced any of these side effects or delayed progress in the treatment?
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Rosacea	Jen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	5/9/2010 2:02:21 AM	Today is only my fourth day taking this medication, but I already notice a huge difference!  My face broke out horribly yesterday, which I'm told is normal, but today it's looking better and my skin isn't all greasy and shiny anymore.  Only side effect I have noticed so far is that if you take it on an empty stomach it will cause some stomach pain, but I fixed that by eating with it.   The decision to take this medication was one that I researched for almost a year before deciding to do it because of all the bad press it has gotten.  For someone who is going to use this medicine, I would definitely recommend taking it with food, taking a large amount of vitamin D to counteract the possibility of bone and teeth damage, and follow all instructions your dermatologist gives religiously.  Hope your experience is as good as mine has been so far!!

My lips are chapped &amp; I drink tons of water, but no other side effects.  After 30 years of acne, this is like a miracle!  I have had numerous comments on how great my skin looks.  VERY pleased!

The severity of the drug makes it a serious commitment, but I'm very satisfied with the results. It has been 2 years, and I very rarely have trouble with acne. When I do, it is mild and most often simply stress or hormone- related. I'm very satisfied.

Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	2	3	Female	25-34	11/15/2009 9:47:46 PM	I took this medicine after suffering from hard-to-treat acne on my face.  During the treatment I experienced very painful chapped lips--in spite of using aquaphor religiously my lips would peel off in large, painful, bloody strips and it was hard to even smile because it hurt so bad.  As far as mental repercussions, I did have really bad anxiety and difficulty making decisions without getting extremely stressed out.  My complexion did clear up significantly, though, and a year after going off of the medication the skin on my face has a completely different tone.  I do still break out, though, but I was only on a low dose.  I sometimes think about going back on the medication, but I was so miserable with the peeling that I don't think I will do it again.  Does anyone have any advice about perhaps going on a second round?

After two years I have developed a little bit of a problem again, and am going back on it, without hesitation.  I only experienced chapped lips last time - everything else, including my blood tests, remained completely normal while on it.

I didn't have any breakouts and my face was no longer oily. Only side effect was dry lips which I just used Chapstick about 20 times a day. About 5 months after stopping, I started breaking out again on my face. My chest and back have remained clear. Have just started my second round of treatment and hopefully this time will get rid of it for good.

Other	JA82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	25-34	1/31/2009 2:35:35 PM	I was given this medication to treat Hidradenitis-suppurativa. It not only did not work for that, but the H-S actually got worse while I was taking it. My normal acne did not get any better either. And the side-effects were serious and continued to be a problem long after I stopped taking the isotretinoin. Don't let the other reviews fool you. It's not all sunshine and roses with this medication, and while it may have a good track record with some, it is not nearly as guaranteed as I have had doctors tell me. Be very cautious taking it and keep a good record of side-effects to talk to your doctor about. And make sure your doctor listens to your concerns.

It's effectiveness is unquestionable; the stuff works, period. The question for me will always be: was it worth it? I certainly became much moodier and had some anger issues, especially during the last month, and even just the hypochondriac-style knowledge of the possibilities for even deeper mood swings and depression made me worry about taking the meds.I would certainly reccomend this to anyone who really wants -- almost needs -- to get rid of their acne. For anyone else, I don't think it'd be worth it.

I've spent thousands on drugs and treatments and my acne did not seem to go away until i tried Acutane. I took it for 6 months and my skin improved dramatically. I'd dare say there's no more pimple for me. My skin isn't oily anymore. Despite the few complications mentioned, i did not experience any of it. Just be aware that some might experience cracked lips. Also this drug is a teratogen meaning u should not be pregnant when u're taking this drug .

I had mood swings and often had night disturbances due to seeing complications. My skin however is at its best, which is what the drug was supposed to do for me. But it was a long and very sickly ordeal.

I've tried every prescribed medicine under the sun, but nothing seemed to make it go away or give me the results I wanted. I finally tried Acutane and my face has changed dramatically! I used to have oily skin and breakout almost every other day it seemed like. Now my skin is no longer oily and shiny and I hardley ever breakout anymore. If I do breakout, its 1 small pimple and usually from me sleeping in my makeup. I was on Acutane for 7 months and the only side effects I had were dry skin. I am 24 and finally don't have to wear makeup on my days off to cover my face! This is not a ProActive commercial, this stuff actually works. The best part is, you only have to take the pills for 6-7 months and then you are done! Anyone who has tried multiple medicines and hasn't found something that works should really look into taking Acutane, you will be amazed! I never write reviews about anything, but this medicine exceeded my expectations so I have to let people know:)
Severe Difficult to Treat Nodular Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/19/2007 9:53:58 PM	I have had terrible painful acne since I was 12 years old. I had tried everything else and nothing worked for more than 2 weeks. I finally tried Accutane for 6 months when I was 24, during the six months that I used it I looked like an angel. I am now 27 and my acne is almost non-existent, I might only get a little pimple once in a while if I fall asleep with my make-up on. Accutane was one of the best things I ever did for myself, and they did not pay me to say this!
