I experienced no side effects, but now I am trying to get off the soledyn and remain on only the topical medications and am experiencing flare-ups.

Acne	Kate, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	7/23/2012 4:27:22 PM	This medication worked very well for my acne, but it started to blur my vision. I took it for over 12 weeks when I started to notice that things were blurry and my vision was getting worse. I stopped taking it and now, almost 2 years later, my vision is only slowly getting better, but I am afraid that it will never be the same. I am seeing an ophthalmologist regularly and he monitors my eyes, but this is a very scary situation, and clear skin is not worth losing your sight. I wouldn't advise anyone to take it.

Acne	alicali068, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	4	5	4	Female	19-24	7/1/2012 10:02:40 AM	I am a 23 year old woman who has used Solodyn for 2 months, in combination with topical gels (Acanya and Aczone). My skin has never been clearer. There are a few mild side effects I experience regularly - dry mouth, bouts of diarrhea, and feeling nauseous if I'm in the sun for too long. If you take Solodyn, your skin should not be exposed to prolonged sunlight. Be prepared to go off the medication if you plan on taking a beach vacation. Also, I read WebMD reviews before I started on Solodyn, and they really scared me, but as long as your doc prescribes the correct dose based on your height, weight, age, and skin type (sensitive, prone to breakouts, etc), you should be fine.

Cleared up everything in just one week after trying multiple topicals.  Much better than regular minocycline or doxycycline, which caused severe nausea.  I only have to use it a couple of times a year. No side effects.

Acne	GetRidOfSolodyn, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	5/1/2012 3:40:30 AM	I started seeing a new dermatologist and have never been allergic to anything my whole life.  Within a few months of taking this pill to clear up moderate acne, I started having Lupis-like symptoms.  It did not clear up my acne, it did slowly make me very very sick.  I had nodules I noticed underneath my skin on my legs that were painful to the touch, hives, liver issues, and pain.  I went to see my family doctor and had my blood drawn, my liver levels were 10 times higher than I should be and I was immediately checked-into the hospital.  No one could pin-point the Solodyn as a cause until I had gone to see another 5 doctors. I went through a horrible 24 hours or more of no sleep and needles poking me every hour to check my liver enzymes the first night.  Every part of my body that bends, hurt to do so as if I had arthritis and I was only 28! I spent a total of 3 days in the hospital and even had a GI doctor look me over.  After stopping the medication I have newly become allergic to NSAIDS.  This pill is EXTREMELY dangerous, and think, my dermatologist said there would be no effects other than making my skin extra dry.  Think again, it almost took my life if I would have kept taking it.  It would have damaged my liver to the point that I would have to be on dialysis before I'm 30 because it would have given me liver damage.  Luckily, I only took it 3-4 months.  By the way, I have also heard that this was a different drug that was once recalled, then changed, and put back out on Rx lists.  Please help to take Solodyn off the market!
Acne	RN Mom, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Male	13-18	4/26/2012 4:10:46 PM	TOXIC MEDICATION: I am a RN and my 17yr old daughter was prescribed this medication 115 mg/ daily for her acne (prom season). Literally within 2 days she began with throbbing migraine headaches, pain behind her right eye, nausea and lethargic...She came to me on the second day crying, something was really wrong,  she wanted to go to the hospital!!!  I'm a Registered Nurse and any other time she would have just asked what can she take for the headache....which was a HUGE concern for me. Went to the ER and her B/P was so high they were worried she was going to have a stroke!!!!! She was admitted to the ICU, we stopped medication immediately, 2 days later she was released from the hospital. The worse mistake I have ever made was giving her this drug! IT SHOULD BE OFF THE MARKET!!!
Other	McRosey, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/24/2012 2:08:48 PM	Very happy with almost disappearance of rosacea breakout.  Not as much redness, now, either.  Better than Oracea, which did not do as much.  Had some joint pain with that.  Softer stool, but that's fine.  Grateful for this one, which I only have to take occasionally. 
Acne	iguanagal, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	4/5/2012 11:51:46 AM	I started taking Solodyn for cystic acne.  After a week or so, I broke out in hives.  They started at the wrists and legs but quickly spread to my entire body.  I even had hives in my scalp!  I was so miserable.  The doctor thought I should have reacted sooner to it, if I truly was allergice but it took a week for me to react.  It was so bad, I needed a prescription for a steriod to stop the hives.  There wasn't an inch on me that wasn't covered by the welts, it was horrific.
Acne	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	2	2	1	Female		3/6/2012 10:13:16 AM	My 15 yr old daughter was on Solodyn 65 mg for acne.  After 3 wks her face was clear.  At wk 4, she started with a hive like rash on the top of her hand.  It would come and go from day to day.  The hives started to appear up both arms and hands over the next couple of months.  Hives would show for a few hours and then disappear.  No itching involved.  If she forgot her Solodyn for a day or two, the hives would really pop out...  I was never able to get her to the doctor to show the hives, but called and he told us to stop the Solodyn.  Almost 3 wks later off the Solodyn and she is still getting hives, but not as much.  I have read other stories about people experiencing the same thing.  I've also read that Solodyn reactions can appear as Lupus like symptoms.  Also want to mention that after starting the Solodyn on 10/31/2011, she ended up in the ER with swelling of her lips and tongue on 12/2/11.  The swelling happened again one week later and we realized that she was given Advil both those days.  The doctor believes she all of a sudden developed an NSAID allergy...  It's just funny how out of the blue she developes an NSAID alergy and also gets these off and on hives all after Starting Solodyn...  I believe the Solodyn has caused these reactions.  I believe the Solodyn caused her to react to the Advil.  The ER doctor told me that the swollen lips and tongue don't have anything to do with the Solodyn or that it effect the Advil...  The Derm. Doc. told me that he's never had any patient complain of hives from Solodyn.  Okay, so that doesn't mean that it can be what's causing the problem for my child.  Every person's body reacts differently to a chemical.  Common Sense tells me the Solodyn is the problem.  Thank goodness she hasn't complained of any joint painl like I've read.  She did develop some swelling on her lower arm one day, but I think that was due to the hives around the same area.  Be careful with this med.  My son took it for 3 yrs and never had a problem.
Acne	Karla B., 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	1	Female	45-54	2/24/2012 1:03:04 PM	My 14yo daughter started taking Solodyn 5 months ago. About 1&amp;1/2 months ago she started getting headaches pretty regular went to family doctor who that may be environmental. A little over a week ago she started getting blurred vision so yesterday I took her to eye doctor who discovered papilledema(swollen optic nerves) and he sent us to ER immediately. Come to find out she had developed psuedotumor cerebri from taking the solodyn and had to have a spinal tap to relieve the pressure in her cranium. So i would not suggest this medication for anyone as even though this is a rate side effect IT CAN HAPPEN.

Went to dermatologist and her put me on Solodyn XR 80mgs.  It clear the acne---&gt;&gt; UNTIL I WENT OFF OF IT!!!  the pimples came back stronger,bigger and more painful than before--plus they hurt more too. I have been on solodyn for almost a whole year and have no idea how to wean off of it without a massive breakout.  I am a nurse that works with the public everyday, the last thing they need to look at is a fave that is tainted with zits.  I have read from other reviews, that this is a COMMON problem.  anyone else have this same issue? Good luck in trying to find a solution to this bothersome condition.... I have already tried everything!

Although it took some time to get going, I'm now 100% acne free. I really believe this is just a medication you have to be patient with. It works wonders in time.

Acne	19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) 	1	1	1		19-24	9/20/2011 11:56:29 PM	About 18 months ago my 95 pound, 16 y.o. son was given Solodyn 65mg. for acne.  We were told to keep taking it and that his face would look worse for about 2 weeks then get better. We came in for monthly rechecks with just pictures taken but no blood work.  He began to have  frequent bouts of sore throat and just not feeling well.  After a few months, he developed severe joint swelling, malaise, sore throat, severe rash, positive ANA.  Was sent to a specialist for testing for lupus and arthritis.  My son was so sick he refused to continue the medication and after about 2 weeks the joint swelling went down and all labs and ANA came back negative.  He was given steroids for the swelling.  He still feels tired and weak a year later,  and has to take naps several times a day to function.  We went to a specialist recently, who seemed to think that he had acquired medicine induced lupus from Solodyn and he was lucky that the severe swelling had went away in a few weeks because sometimes it lasted longer and stated he probably also has some sort of connective tissue disease.  The specialist told him to never take a drug containing minicycline again because it could literally kill him.  I had thought that the med. that caused the lupus symptoms was a new antibiotic started for an acute sinus infection that he had taken a week prior to joint swelling,  but specialist said it was most likely due to the Solodyn because it has been known to cause lupus like symtoms in certain individuals 
Acne	Nurse,  Female  (Caregiver) 	3	3	3	Female		9/13/2011 9:17:29 PM	Every drug effects each person differently due to gender, age, health status, and preexisting medical conditions either known or unknown.  That being said...itching, hives, swelling, rashes, shortness of breath, palpitations are NOT side effects and have NO bearing on the effectiveness of the medication.  They are ALLERGIC REACTIONS and should be reported to your MD immediately for evaluation and treatment.
Acne	Coco, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	9/13/2011 6:14:38 PM	Started more getting more severe acne in mid 20s.  Was prescribed Solodyn and Epiduo for treatment.  The Solodyn seems to help lessen acne during menstrual time, but did not eliminate all forms-small under skin bumps still popped up, cystic acne lessened.  Also, while taking medication, got pregnant and in less than 2 months had a miscarriage.  I (nor can my gynecologist) state for a fact, but I believe this medication is in some way responsible for the loss of my pregnancy.  BIG ISSUE for me, since I want to have a baby in the next few years.  Because of this, I have recently begun looking for alternative acne remedies.  I have recently purchased a clarisonic and have seen MAJOR improvements in my acne-especially concerning the under the skin bumps that would never improve.  I believe that my clarisonic will allow me to stop taking Solodyn.    
Acne	Agjeffer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	35-44	8/25/2011 9:27:44 AM	I began taking Solodyn about 6 weeks ago after my acne was suddenly reborn at age 33. I tried other antibiotics but they became too expensive. My dermatologist prescribed Solodyn and I am warning everyone that this drug is horrible!! I'm a healthy female with no known problems except for seasonal allergies. After 3 weeks of taking Solodyn, my urine turned dark brown and I was very lethargic. I called my derm and was told to discontinue use. The next day I noticed my eyes were yellow and I had terrible itching with no visible rash. I then went to my family MD and she drew lots of blood work. My bilirubin was 8.3 (norm-&lt;1.3), liver enzymes AST 1000 and ALT 900. These are 20 times the normal levels. After a few other tests that were normal, hopefully I have not damaged my liver. PLEASE note that this drug is very dangerous and if you think you have any of the listed side effects, seek medical care immediately. Hope I can save someone the trouble.  
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/18/2011 10:07:09 AM	In the beginning, I was a little scared to take this medicine because of all the negative reviews, but I must say that I have seena drastic change in my skin, no side effects and overall satisfaction...it does cause drowiness, but I can deal with that; just monitor the times I take it...I would encourage you to just give it some time, and you will see great results just like I did!!!!

Acne	cookie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	1	Female	35-44	7/13/2011 6:51:52 PM	Well, i have been on minocycline for about 3 weeks.  It cleared up my skin very well within a few days and I was initially very happy.  I did have a little nausea/appetite loss at first but I can deal with that.  The issue now is that I have been having peristent daily headaches.  I am very headache prone, but these feel different and are more persistent.  They are more of tensiony type h/a, that sometimes morph into a migraine like h/a.  I am going to go off this med and see if that helps.

Acne	jill6, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	6/16/2011 9:29:55 AM	Would you believe I've been on minocycline (solodyn) for about 15 years?! The rash on my derriere left but returned whenever I stopped taking solodyn, so I stayed on it. In the last 2 years, I've been aware of the growing appearance of blue/blackish spots on my legs below my knees, including ankles. My teeth have turned gray, too! My dermatologist is taking me off the solodyn, and now I am soaking in a mild solution of water and chlorox and washing with an acne wash that has benzoyl peroxide. My skin and teeth should return to normal. I read extended use of solodyn could have permanently made my gums gray! I'm glad my dermatologist caught and stopped this in time!
Acne	Saronagrl, 19-24 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	19-24	6/16/2011 12:58:14 AM	My daughter started taking this three weeks ago. The other morning she woke up covered in hives, there was not a spot on her body that did not have them. She is nineteen, and has been in so much pain, just hoping they go away soon. This medicine should list hives as a major side effect. I have read more people have experienced this with this drug. Please stay away from this drug , I have felt so helpless to my daughter just seeing like this. This is bad stuff!
Acne	worriedmom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	5	1	Female	45-54	4/16/2011 8:47:36 PM	My 17 year old son started taking Solodyn about three weeks ago. Within days he started having severe stomach pains and loss of appetite.  After two trips to the doctor, it was determined that he needed to stop the Solodyn. It has only been a couple of days, but he is beginning to feel better already.  Unfortunately, he did suffer weight loss as well .. not something a high school baseball player particularly wants.  I would NOT recommend this drug.

But the severe headaches, stomach pain, and dizziness are unbearable. My daughter took this medication, and had no side effects, though. So, it apparently only does that to some people.

My face is much clearer but I also use a topical prescription so not sure which is most effective. However, my back and chest are still not clear. I have also been getting frequent heartburn that never occurred before and was wondering if it was a side effect.

I do experience mild headaches and loss of appetite as indicated in some of the other reviews.  However, I also experienced sleepwalking and blackouts when combined with alcohol.  There are no warnings about not drinking while taking Solodyn, but I believe there should be.

Acne	Mister Hardy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Male	35-44	3/8/2011 2:09:57 PM	I am 35 and have battled acne since my early teens.  This medication cleared up the acne I had and prevented news bumps from forming.  I have been using it for about 12 weeks and have had less than 10 bumps in that time.  I get the occasional headache which is the only side effect so far.  Regretfully, this medication is not covered by my insurance and is crazy expensive.  My discount card only covers three refills so I will have to start on a different prescription.

I would get headaches, but I would get headaches before I started the medicine so I can't say its from Solodyn.  I have to admit I would have some liver pains that were new to me.  But I am going to take another month of this, and if things don't get better than I will just have to consider surgery.

Acne	janinjefferson, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	4	1	1	Female	45-54	2/13/2011 1:10:11 PM	Although this medicine cleared up my daughter's acne, she ended up in the hospital after complaining about severe, continuous headaches.  After being admitted we learned that solodyn caused swelling of her optic nerve and that had she continued taking it, it could have caused her to lose her eyesight.  One resolution, had the swelling not reduced was to put a shunt in her.  There is not a pimple in the world big enough to justify the scare we experienced.  Our Dermatologist never mentioned any side effects to look out for.  He took attitude with me when I called to tell him.  Guess he didn't like being questioned.
Acne	detectivemom, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	2/8/2011 1:49:02 PM	My 16 year old daughter took Solodyn 65mg for about 1 month for acne and suddenly developed extreme hives, first on her legs and then spreading throughout her body. She also experienced some shortness of breath and dizziness, which occurred during physical activity and a hot shower. She has exercise induced asthma, which we assumed contributed to the breathing difficulties. I made her stop taking the Solodyn, just in case she was having an allergic reaction to it (she is allergic to sulfa drugs). Her doctor put her on prednisone and antihistamines. She continued to have some hives but no breathing problems. Two days later she had another reaction, but this time her chest tightened and her breathing was so labored that we had to use an Epi-pen and rush her to the emergency room. Her dermatologist increased the prednisone, but as the dosage tapered down as prescribed, she developed hives and extreme breathing problems again and had to use an Epi-pen and go to the emergency room a second time.  At this time she had been off the Solodyn for almost 9 days.  We are still in the process of figuring out what has caused the hives and wheezing and will learn more as she tapers off her prednisone and antihistamines, but after researching Solodyn on the internet it seems like there could be a connection.  My daughter's dermatologist is not ruling out this possibility because of the time it takes for Solodyn to be processed out of the body's system, but her asthma/allergy doctor continues to insist that it is unlikely that the Solodyn is the cause given the amount of time that has passed since she last took the Solodyn and the rarity of allergic reactions to minocyclines.  We will do food allergy testing, but I am still very suspicious that Solodyn has caused these reactions.

I immediately experienced diarrhea and headaches.  After less than a week after taking Solodyn, my feet and hands starting aching very badly.  It was so painful I had trouble sleeping.  After two days, I researched the side effects, and found this was a common complaint with this medication.  I have discontinued taking Solodyn, and was disturbed that many of the side effects listed are not mentioned in the description of this medication.
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	13-18	1/6/2011 7:16:05 PM	I went to my dermatologist for severe acne on my back and shoulders. I previously had a reaction to doxycycline, but he said I should not have a problem with this. After two weeks and no effect on my acne, I have had severe itch all over my body for 7 day, that is now turing into hives as well a severe migrane. Did not work for me at all and I have had no relief from these symptoms. 
Acne	BioMedEgr, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	12/9/2010 2:18:58 PM	I'm taking this medication along with a topical medication. I noticed what difference the Solodyn makes considering all the break outs I had between refills. There's no doubt it prevents my acne, so I would recommend asking your doctor about it. It works slowly if you are wanting immediate results.By the way, I have very hard to control acne. Accutane wiped out my acne, where Solodyn keeps it under control. If your acne is easy to deal with, Solodyn will definitely get the job done.I've experienced no noticeable side effects. 
Acne	dart, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	12/2/2010 2:22:48 PM	Prescribed for my 21 yr old son, took only 2 wks to noticeably clear up his complexion, been using it for about 1 yr - excellent results with no side affects - truly a miracle drug but expensive if no insurance. Would highly(!) recommend trying it for acne.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	11/21/2010 10:08:52 PM	I used this medication for about 18 months. It helped to control my acne, but never really solved the problem. When I started waking up in the morning and my joints were swollen and puffy, I got scared. I immediatly went to my dermotologist and she took me off. Since I have been off the medication for 3 month now, I have have been experiencing extreme hair loss and I have been very itchy. I thought I was going crazy before I came to this website. My doctor has been been testing me for all kinds of things trying to figure out what has been going on with my body for the past 3 months. Thank you reviewers. I have realized that it probably was the medication. I feel so much better because this is a solution. 
Acne	lionpaw, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	35-44	11/17/2010 10:38:46 PM	I had severe acne on face. Took about 3 weeks for Solodyn to stop the breakouts. Around the second week my face was red,tight, burning and itching. Severe headaches as well. I continued to take to Solodyn, but only used warm water to wash my face and a light moisturizer to help dryness. So about the third week I noticed a total difference in skin. Clearing up well, but still have headaches. Going back for a follow up appointmentnest week. Hopefully something can be prescribed to take away the dark scars left behind. 
Acne	bubbles, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	11/16/2010 11:02:30 AM	Ok seriously, some of these reviews are just laughable. If you took it and had an immediate allergic reaction, I'm sorry, but that doesn't mean it's zero effective.  By the same rationale, pennicilin would be rated poorly by those allergic to it. Just saying, some of these reviews are clearly by people who just like to complain when something doesn't go their way. Sorry you took the drug and immediately broke out in hives.   But that doesn't mean the drug is evil.  It may work for some.  For me, a once a day pill seems great, it's much gentler on my stomach then other antibiotics, and so far, so good.  
Acne	Mom2Em, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	13-18	10/29/2010 11:02:45 PM	My 15 yr old daughter was prescribed this by dermatologist for acne, after 3 weeks she began to break out on her torso, arms, neck, scalp, palms of hands in welts &amp; rash....had no positive effect on her acne whatsoever...would not recommend this at all.  She has never had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic or any other medication.  She hasn't taken the 65mg pill in 4 days and is continuing to break out in welts on her entire torso, anterior &amp; posterior.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	10/27/2010 1:13:57 PM	I was put on Solodyn maybe a week ago. My &quot;acne&quot; isn't very bad but I still wanted a 100% clear face so I got on solodyn. I would not recommend it!!! My skin is very red and dry. It makes me have extreme stomach pains and I completly lost my appetite. My head kills me and I can't sleep at night. It also makes my throat very dry. I am very tired and moody. After reading the other reviews I realized Im not alone! Majority of the reviews relate to my experience in one way or another.
Acne	acnenomore2, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/9/2010 9:45:37 PM	I'm in my mid 20's and have always had mild to severe acne. This is the first product that I have seen work and pretty fast in conjunction with Epiduo. Within about a the first 3 days you could see a dramatic change. Most of the swollen pimples I had went down in size and basically did a magical disappearing act. By the end of a month using Solodyn with the topical med I barely had one pimple and a lot of the acne scars faded. My Dermatologist took me off the meds i took it for a 3 months straight and 9 months later I'm back to where i started. Hope the second time around is a charmer. 
Acne	Not Happy, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	3	1	Male	13-18	9/2/2010 9:58:16 PM	My 14 year old son has been taking this medicine for 3 weeks.  He woke up yesterday with an itchy rash covering various parts of his body.  Today, he had a severe rash that looked like big mosquito bites, and a bad headache with the back of his head very tender.  We went to Urgent Care (after hours), and they prescribed Benadryl and Prednisone.  Hopefully, the rash will clear up in a few days.  Very angry that the dermatologist did not mention this serious, albeit rare side effect.  From other reviews that I've read about this drug, this side effect does not seem to be all that &quot;rare&quot;.  Take this drug at your own risk!
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	45-54	8/29/2010 9:37:40 PM	I am 45 years old and had a outbreak and the dermatologist gave me a prescription for Solodyn as well as several samples to use.  I took a dose on Wednesday and another on Thursday.  By Thursday night, I noticed that my legs were aching and that night I was up for about two hours because I couldn't sleep.  Friday, the unsettled stomach started and my lower body ached and I had a headache, but didn't connect it to the Solodyn and took another dose.  Friday night I was up a good bit because of the body aches and headaches, but managed to keep the discomfort at bay with Ibuprofen.  Took another dose Saturday at 3:00.  Saturday night, I experienced severe chills and couldn't stand to be touched.  i was sure I was going to have to go to the hospital.  In the meantime, I asked someone to check on the side effects and haven't taken another dose.  I slept 13 hours last night and still have a headache.  I have never been allergic to any medication, so it took me a while to make the connection.  Be very careful and aware if you take this.  The warning I got from the doctor was quite casual and almost an afterthougt...he just mentioned it and I really didn't give it much thought....
Acne	Happy Mom, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Male	13-18	8/7/2010 12:22:49 AM	My 14 year old son has taken this medicine for about 4 months.  He went from severe cystic acne to no acne at all.  He is so excited at the results!  He has not had any negative side effects.  His only side effects are positive.  He has been spared the extreme social-suicide of being labled as a (insert cruel names here).  Instead of being called hurtful names by girls he is being asked out by them.  His scares have stopped, too.  Words can not express his (and our) pure elation at this absolute miracle med!   
Acne	Key, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/4/2010 3:06:43 PM	After 3 weeks of taking this drug, I woke up with severe hives on my feet, arms, thighs and the back of my head and neck. The hives were so painful on my foot I could barely walk. I also had tightness in my chest and a lump in my throat. I went to ER and was given benydryl/Steriods. The next day the hives returned. I have stopped taking solodyn and scheduled an appointment with an allergist. 
Acne	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/27/2010 4:32:43 PM	I saw absolutely no change in my acne.  My senses of taste and smell seemed diminished.  I'm not sure if it is a side effect of the drug or noy, but it started shortly after I began taking solodyn.
Acne	zack, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	13-18	7/22/2010 11:03:59 PM	although it worked on my acne, it has caused me to have headaches, exhaustion, and i am having difficulty breathing (wheezing) within half and hour of taking this drug. why shortness of breath is not listed as a side effect is beyond me. many people listed it as an issue in their reviews. stay away from this drug. its overpriced poison.
Acne	magias, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	13-18	7/22/2010 3:54:58 AM	Well, for the first time I decided to see my doctor about acne. I have had it for several years but it was getting worse lately.  The doctor prescribed me solodyn and I haven't had too good of an experience so far.  First of all, I only took the drug for about 2 weeks, and noticed deleterious side effects. (1) A bald spot appeared on the back of my head (2) A lymph node beneath my chin became noticeably enlarged. My skin did start clearing up a bit but I would not say that it was worth the side effects at all. I have now stopped taking it.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	19-24	7/5/2010 10:44:47 PM	I have been pleased with this medication in that my skin has cleared up dramatically.  However, due to sun exposure and being on an antibiotic my skin has somewhat become discolored (hyperpigementation).  Sunblock is a must! Other than that, I recommend it to others.
Acne	Emilyc1974, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	2	Female	35-44	6/28/2010 8:26:42 PM	I've had acne for about 12yrs.  Being in your 30's and having acne is frustrating so I was pretty eager to try something that would help.  It's been 2 months.  The medication is easy to use.  I had hoped that I would start seeing some improvement by now but nothing and to add to that I've just realized that I'm getting slight headaches.  I'm annoyed really.  It's pretty expensive.  
Acne	Rachel, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	13-18	6/25/2010 3:24:16 PM	I have been on Solodyn since August of 2009 and my skin has cleared up alot. Im really pleased with it. 
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	6/19/2010 1:35:58 AM	By the 2nd day i had to stop taking it. Experienced extreme itching all over my body, migranes,tiredness, nausea and stomach pains. I even felt depressed and felt like i was in another world or something. Im sorry but Solodyn was def. not for me.
Acne	slaw, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	6/16/2010 1:09:52 AM	I have used this drug for 3 days now, and started taking it with much hesitation, as I'm not one to take antibotics, but found my acne to be very frustrating.  After a couple of days, I notice my acne clearing up right away, but within 24 hours of taking this I had bad headaches, shortness of breath, and I've been extremely tired.  I thought this was due to stress, but now realize that it's this drug!  I don't think the side effects and long term problems I've read about are worth it.  I'm glad I checked into this before taking it for another day!
Acne	ashleah, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	25-34	6/13/2010 9:53:29 AM	This med worked well and my face cleared up in approx 3 days. My derm wanted me to take it for 30 days, by day 10 I was covered in huge hives and itching!  It was awful.  It took about 2 weeks to clear it all up.  I have never had a reaction to any drugs.  You should think carefully being taking this.
Acne	Katrina, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	6/8/2010 3:56:53 PM	I'm suprised how many people complained of this drug. I've only been taking it for a week and my acne has almost all just vanished. This drug is amazing and working wonders for my acne.
Acne	7-12 Female  (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	7-12	6/3/2010 4:17:13 PM	My daughter was told to be put on solodyn (65mg)as of today.  She has a very very slight case of acne. We were just going in for a facial wash if that.  After reading all the bad side effects of this, there is NO way I will put her on this medication.  There is hardly anything on her face to begin with and for our Dermo to put her on such a messed up medicine, No Thanks.  So I want to thank all of you for your comments.  By the way she is only 12 years old. Oh and on top of this after we got home from the dermo the trial size facial med he gave us is 6 months expired!!
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	6/3/2010 4:14:07 PM	This has been the worst experience I have ever had with an antibiotic.  Within 10 days of taking Solodyn, I was covered in head-to-toe hives and had difficulty breathing.  Even with prescription strength antihistamines, a shot of Kenalog, and steroid cream, I am still having hives all over my body in spite of my last dose being 4 days ago.  I would sincerely question whether this drug is medically necessary for acne due to the potential for this type of reaction.  Hives all over your face and body are not worth it!
Acne	xoxoxo, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Male	13-18	5/23/2010 11:49:50 PM	My son has been taking this medication for 2 1/2 wks, he developed severe itching and hives on his arms, fingers, legs, abdominal area and back, even swelling of the joints. We thought it was just mosquito bites because it came on a little at a time and Benadryl seem to be controlling the itch at one time. I had no idea that this was a side effect of the medication. The Dermatologist highly recommended this drug. In fact, all these side effects are not even listed on the drug literature that the drug came with from the pharmacy. Sooo disappointed.
Acne	snoozer, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	4/14/2010 2:45:36 PM	My breast started lactating and a maasive amount of hair grew upon them.

Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	4/2/2010 2:20:22 AM	I'd rather suffer from acne than deal with the debilitating side effects of Solodyn. My doctor assured me that &quot;side effects are very rare&quot; and only mentioned possible dizziness - he advised me to take the pill before bed so I &quot;wouldn't notice&quot;. While he was right on that count, within 3 days of taking the drug what I did notice was a slew of other symptoms, starting with diarrhea, exhaustion, body aches and loss of appetite. On the 4th day I developed fever and chills, and extreme nausea. My stomach was gurgling and distended. I was in bed today - a beautiful sunny day - because I couldn't even sit up. My experience culminated with me vomiting up my entire day's food intake. I'm done with Solodyn, and I'm going to seriously question my doctor as to why he prescribed it. Are doctors just puppets of the pharmaceutical companies now? Why else would he have free samples of the drug in his office, handing them out like breath mints? I also just realize that the samples he gave me, which I took for 3 days, were 135mg, which is far above the recommended dose for a woman of my size.
Acne	disappointedwithSolodyn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	35-44	4/1/2010 10:25:32 PM	I have been taking Solodyn for 10 days and have developed 3 issues with very little improvement for my acne.  I now have a yeast infection.  I developed a cyst in my breast as well as breast tenderness.  I had GERD but after taking Solodyn it came back.  I will stop using them especially after reading the reviews.

Started aching all over and felt short of breath. Went to my Dr and found I had dangerously low platelets (33). Had to have a bone marrow biopsy and found that the problem was the solodyn drug. I AM BEING FOLLOWED NOW BY A HEMATOLOGIST AND HAVE TO HAVE MY SPLEEN REMOVED BECAUSE THIS DRUG CAUSED ME TO HAVE ITP. NEVER USE THIS DRUG WITHOUT CLOSE MONITORING.

Acne	warrior 4, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/11/2010 3:46:58 PM	I am surprised to see so many negative comments on this sight.  I guess those who have poor reactions will complain vs. those of us who are very pleased with Solodyn.  I took Solodyn for my adult acne and it was a miracle drug for me, it work quickly with no side effects.  I took it  for 30 days.  By the way,I am a RN.
Other	CEC, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	2	Male	35-44	3/8/2010 12:15:20 PM	I was prescribed the 65mg dose for folliculitis in stomach area. After about 6 weeks of treatment, it seems under control. However, the stomach upset is unbearable. I have indigestion non-stop all day round. Also, although I normally suffer from hairloss, my hair has thinning out MASSIVELY over the past month. I'm only going to take it one more week or so. My hair is more important to me. Since I don't know if the reversal has occurred for those who also reported hair loss here. No one has commented on outcome.  I'll try and do that in a month to see if my situation is better. Certainly looking forward to the stomach issue going away.
Acne	Taylor, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	13-18	3/6/2010 9:33:57 PM	I am 17, My derm put me on this about 3 weeks ago he had told me not to worry about the side effects, he said there would be little to none since it was a name brand. However he was veryy wrong. On the third week the bottom of my hand started to swell and i had no clue what it could be from so i just kinda ignored it until about an hour later my knee's and elbows started to itch really bad, next thing i knew i had hives on my arms, legs, wrist and neck. My joints are swollen bad and it hurts to even move. I was not on any other medication so i looked on the side effects and everything added up. Some ADVICE, when you get a medicine you have never taken before you might want to look up the side effects and reviews from other people before you decide to take it. I have mild acne this is NOT worth taking, i am miserable right now. Take anything but this!
Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Male	19-24	3/5/2010 7:10:53 PM	I started Solodyn about 2 months ago when Doryx was unsuccessful in treating severe acne on my back. My back cleared up after about two weeks and I continued to take the medication. However, my entire body is now covered in red, itchy, painful hives! The hives move all throughout my body! I even have hives on the bottom of my feet!!Along with the hives, I was also having crushing chest pain that felt like a thousand knives being stabbed into my chest. I didn't think things could get worse until I woke up this morning with paralying joint pain and swelling in all of my joints. I immediatley went to my docotor who put me on Prednisone, I took my first dose, and it has yet to provide me any relief! This drug is truly terrible and I now regret not doing my homework before taking it!

Other	call me Grammy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	55-64	2/4/2010 11:59:16 AM	I started taking Solodyn in Sept. 09, 4 months ago, for Folicolitis (hair bumps).  Within a couple of weeks I started with an itchy rash on my legs.  The rash spread to the rest of my body. I repeatedly asked the dematologist if it could be the Solodyn and he said &quot;no this doesn't look like a reaction to the drug&quot;.  I changed doctors because I couldn't get rid of this rash. New doctor gave me a steroid shot because the ichy rash (over my entire body) was so bad it was about to drive me insane! I've been off Solodyn for 1 week and using Tetracycline for &quot;hair bumps&quot;.  Rash is getting better.  I'm almost convinced it was from Solodyn.
Acne	13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	4	1	Male	13-18	1/24/2010 10:47:36 AM	My 16 year old son has been taking solodyn for 2 weeks. He started to itch non stop on the back of his legs at first, now it's all over. He was running a fever, and viomitted.  First thing I thought of was to check the side effects of Solodyn.  Wow, had I of known.
Acne	13-18 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	13-18	1/22/2010 9:42:08 PM	My 15 year old son had a severe reaction to this. Rash, fever, joint pain, swelling.  This drug should not be prescribed!!  I am so sorry i didn't check this site prior to giving this drug to my son.  A drug that you can only take for 12 weeks is worrisome.  doctor did not tell us this.
Acne	sydmadi, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	35-44	1/21/2010 6:54:05 PM	I have been on Solodyn for about 2 weeks and suddenly became itchy.  I thought that it was something that I ate, but it has been happening for a week.  My hands, legs, body, really everywhere.  I have been scratching so much that I am getting bruises.  After reading other posts, I am convinced that it is the Solodyn and will be asking for something else. 
Acne	Julie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	1/21/2010 7:00:49 AM	I am 45 years old and continue to fight mild acne.  The first time I took it I became sick with aches, chills, mild fever.  My doctor performed a chest xray, EKG (blood pressure was slightly elevated), and pulmonary CT scan and found nothing.  I discontinued Solodyn but not because my doctor or I associated the side effects to the drug.  I started up again yesterday and by the end of the day felt exhausted, chest tightening, chills, and slight fever again.  Could this possibly the Solodyn??
Other	nycjs, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	1/16/2010 10:12:00 PM	I was prescribed 65mg of Solodyn, and I wish I would have read all of these reviews, because the side effects are unbearable.  I was only on it for 3 days to treat my mild rosacea...I didn't even have acne, just redness.  I am an athlete, and nearly passed out at a workout, had shortness of breath and nausea. I will no longer be going to the derm that prescribed this horrible drug.  Antibiotics should only be prescribed for EXTREME infections.  Funny, that I'm eating more whole foods, drinking more water and my rosacea is clearing up on it's own.  Acne and rosacea are usually treated from how we EAT, instead of being so quick to prescribe a drug.  
Acne	Katherine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	35-44	1/12/2010 6:11:21 PM	I started on this drug in Nov 2008 and have been taking it for a year. At first I took it every day but when my acne cleared up I only took it 3x per week per my doc's advice. Although my acne is completely gone, my hair is too.  I noticed the hair thinning/loss in March 2009 but didn't think it could be from the Solodyn. I was also on a birth control pill and was taking Alli too.  To get to the bottom of the hair thinning/loss I quit the Alli and then later the birth control pills.  I'm still losing hair to a point where my hair dresser has commented on it the past 4 times I've gotten it cut which is the span of about 6 months.After some research I find that this drug is only intended for use 12 weeks.  I've been on this for over a year!  I feel positive now that my hair thinning is due to this drug and have stopped taking it completely.Solodyn did work for my acne but sadly my doc didn't explain that I should've only been on it for 3 months.

Other	ss, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	12/26/2009 10:57:02 PM	This medication is great if you don't mind going bald at 41 years old.  My hair has completely thinned out.  I have been on this for 11 weeks.  I hope my hair will grow back.  My dr. told me the side effects take time to subside.  I'm scared my hair will continue to thin out.  My scalp is very visible where ever I part my hair.

For the same length of time, we have been back and forth to his pediatrician and to a pediatric cardiologist for a very fast and irregular heartbeat.  I logged on today to check the medication because he told me that it's odd that he's been having these symptoms for the same amount of time as he's been on this medication.  His heartbeat is so fast when he plays basketball through his school that he won't even play for fear that something will happen.  His dermatologist suggested he discontinue use of this medication and he has a stress test with a pedicatric cardiologist this week.  I'm hoping this stops his sypmtoms and ends this problem once and for all.
Acne	suzybsyr, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	25-34	12/12/2009 12:53:09 PM	I have been on Solodyn for just about two weeks. I suffer from mild acne. Everything was going well until I noticed that my hands became extremely itchy. This then moved to my feet, legs, back, neck and abdomen. I finally had to go to urgent care because I felt like I wanted to rip my skin off. I can't even sit still because the itching is so severe. Urgent care prescribed me prednisone which is helping relieve some of the itching until my body is free from this horrible drug. Had I know all of these side effects I would never have allowed my dermatologist to prescribe this to me. Not only the itching but headaches and blurred vision.

My acne which wasn't too bad to begin with but very persistent for 2 yrs. My skin did clear up after about 2 weeks, but I developed a terrible yeast infection so strong that it passed to my husband! It caused excruciating vaginal pain after intercourse and constant mild pain. Not worth it to me, i think a financially driven rushed FDA approval has put a dangerous drug on the market that is being pushed on Doctors &amp; their patients. I wasn't told of the side effects, in fact I was told that they were nothing to worry about. I even asked if it could cause yeast infections since it is an antibiotic and my Dermatologist said no! I immediately stopped taking this after research. Nothing is worth all of these side effects. I have a few more tiny pimples since I stopped taking this but the other 3 meds seem to be doing a pretty good job.

Acne	momofseven, 35-44 Female  (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	11/28/2009 7:12:22 PM	My daughter called me earlier today from college in PA. She was prescribed this drug by a dermatologist for her mild acne.  First of all the doctor prescribed a 120MG pill for a 100 lb girl. Hello, aren't we supposed to start off with small doses and work our way up??!!  She has had such a severe reaction.  Extreme sweats, can't even sit up, feels like she is motion sick, nausea, severe stomach pains ... why are people prescribing this drug with all the ill effects it is causing.  I read some of the comments and hello, next people being contacted are the drug companies because I want to know exactly how much long term research has been done on this drug!!

Her skin really cleared up wonderfully. However, now she had double and blurred vision and is getting an MRI tomorrow! The side effects are worse and more serious than what it's supposed to treat! My daughter is walking around with a patch on her eye, just so she can see and not totally lose her balance-we are scared.
Acne	dixie girl, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Female	19-24	11/22/2009 8:25:14 PM	I started taking Solodyn about a year or so ago and it was working really good for a while. I was taking it along with Aczone gel. I still have mild breakouts sometimes, but not near as bad as before. I noticed at the beginning of November 2009 that my hair started shedding ALOT. I was once on Acutane  a few years ago and my hair started shedding bad, so I told my dermatologist &amp; he wasn't too surprised &amp; just took me off immediately. I stopped taking the Solodyn a few days ago in case it is what is causing this. After reading the review on this website dated 9/29/09 I think it might be the Solodyn. My hair is also still shedding &amp; I am calling my doctor tomorrow. If anyone else had this problem &amp; your hair has stopped shedding, please let me know how long it took. I am 23 years old &amp; not on birth control or any other type medication, so I don't know what else it could be. My hair is already noticeably thinner to me. I was not told of any side affects by my doctor on this medicine or the acutane, but beware.

GET RID OF THIS PILL.
Acne	Taco, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	10/28/2009 9:56:55 AM	When I first starting taking Solodyn it was like a magic pill. My ance cleared up in a week and it stayed that way until after about the second month. It was almost like my body built an immunity to it. Maybe because it's an antibiotic. I also started developing symptoms of vaginal swelling and itching. This medicine for me was more for temporary treatment but in the end the side effects and acne won out. If I had to do it all again it was not worth the outcome of only having your face clear for two months and dealing with the side effects.

The side effects are a bit much for me. I've been extremely tired, my stomach feels bloated and bubbly and i've had a loss in appetite. Even now as i type, i feel so darn tired and i haven't even took my daily dose of Solodyn yet. I think i'm going to stop taking this med. Don't like the way it makes me feel.

Acne	etmocha, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	1	1	Male	19-24	9/29/2009 2:00:14 PM	So, I started taking Solodyn in March 09. Within the first month I saw a great change in my skin but nothing too drastic. All of my acne marks from previous blemishes are still there but, I did see a severe reduction in the amount of breakouts I got. Flash forward to Aug 09, and I have experienced a noticeable hair loss. My hair decreased in density and the actual texture of my hair has become slightly more brittle and weaker. I stopped taking the medication about 3 1/2 to 4 weeks ago and am still experiencing shedding more so than I would normally. For those who also experienced hair loss from this drug, how long did it take to stop shedding? Also, how long did it take to notice new hair growth in areas that it thinned? I am extremely unhappy with these side effects that my doctor did not warn me about. Mind you, I'm also only 20 years old, I should NOT have to worry about hair loss.

I was initially given this for unusual breakouts and scarring on the side of my face, but I am now on it for something else. Anyway, I started having extremely itchy eyes, and now have blurred vision. I am not sure if it is the Solodyn, but it is helping my other health issues so much- I hope it is not the cause.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	8/24/2009 9:30:29 AM	I have dealt with acne since I was 15 and recently my acne has taken over. I have large painful acne and the topical treatment I was using was not working. I went to my dermatologist and she prescribed solodyn with differn gel. It's only been 5 days but I can already see a tremendous improvement. I don't have any side effects except for occasionaly itching but it's nothing too bad. I would recommend this medication and hopefully I continue to respond well to it!
Acne	13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	13-18	8/11/2009 4:56:43 PM	In one day, ill have been using this medication for a month. I feel like it has reduced swelling in my acne and reduced breakouts. However, it is leaving scars. I would recommend this product. Im also using this product with differin .3, aczone, and a sulfur wash called Prasion.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	8/6/2009 6:56:19 PM	I developed cystic acne and I needed treatment. I have been on Solodyn for two and a half months. I started off the first month with 90mg. That didn't do much for me so my doctor put me on 135 mg. I saw a slight difference but not enough.  At this point I hadn't suffered any serious side effects. So I started my third month on the medication and for the first two weeks I was extremely nauseous and light headed every day. I didn't think it had anything to do with the Solodyn because I hadn't experienced any problems on the medication in the past two months so I continued taking it. I also found myself dizzy, having blurred vision from time to time, depressed, moody, and having anxiety. My face turned pale and had bad coloring. I finally realized it was a problem when I developed bad migraines and had severe stomach pains that wrapped around to my back. After suffering like that for 2 days, I stopped taking the medication. I called my doctor and he told me to discontinue using Solodyn. I was disappointed to hear this because finally it worked on my third month of treatment and all my acne cleared up. But the side effects were to unbearable to live with every day.
Acne	25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	25-34	8/5/2009 6:39:30 PM	I was originally prescribed this several years ago. It may have been free with a discount card, I dont remember. I had tried one or two other pills that were ineffective as well as a few creams. Tazorac, I believe is the name, was pretty crazy, my skin was literally falling off my face. If anything, it may have smoothed over any old scarring, not sure if that was it's purpose.I started off with 90 mg, then was bumped up to 135 mg. I dont think I saw any difference after 3 months. I convinced my derm to prescribe accutane. I wasn't expecting the dryness, but adjusted quickly. The effects lasted about 3 good years. Went on it again, but only did 4 months. Effects only lasted 8 months.Back on solodyn again. Future appointment in 6 weeks, I hope it works, but genetically I know unless I am on something really strong, I'll be back again.

Acne	anti-Solodyne, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	1	1	Female	25-34	7/22/2009 3:39:51 AM	I have been taking this med. for 3 months. It cleared up quite a bit of my acne, I still had a little, but it was much better. I began having severe headaches. I have always had headaches, but these we not bearable. I also had extreme dizziness and even slight confusion. I talked to my dermatologist after seeing on my file &quot;patient denies suffering from headache and/or dizziness&quot; so I mentioned to him that I did in fact have these symptoms and he reccomended that I see my eye Dr., appearently this drug can cause elevated eye preassure. I saw my eye doc and everything was fine, but then I began to have mild depression (which I later discovered that mental changes were reported with use of Minocycline) and visual problems as well, coughing, itching and I looked pale and underneath my eyes was extremely grey and my teeth which were extremely white were beginning to look brown and dull. I decided that I woulod skip a few doses to see if it helped and after just a few days I feelt so much better. I have decided that the overall effects of this drug are not worth the risks and the way it makes me feel. Besides this, it doesn't work much better than Proactive Solutions and is extremely expensive and I have to call every 3 months to set that discount card up. I am not going to go back to my dermatologist, I am going to take vitamins and use Proactive...I think that is much safer. My acne is back, but I will find another way to deal with it, I just don't think this drug is very safe, besides, I can't take antibiodics forever, they aren't good for you and the acne will just return..mine already has.
Acne	djs, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	7/21/2009 9:01:46 AM	Initially I took this medication for 3 months with a face wash prescribed by my dermatologist. I noticed side effects of severe bruising on my skin. If I just bumped myself agaist something I would get a bruise. I had accidentally burned myself on the oven and also noticed that my skin took extremely long to heal (2months &amp; not a big burn). Even mosiquito bites left discolored marks on my skin for several weeks (did not scratch so there was no open wound). I stopped taking this medication as directed by my doctor after my severe acne cleared up. A few weeks after not taking the medication I noticed that all the skin healing problems and bruising went away. If I fell really hard a bruise might form but took 2-3 days to clear up, if I got mosiquito bites they were gone the next day with no marks. Unfortunately the severe acne is back and the doctor put me back on solodyn... 
Other	JH, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	7/11/2009 4:47:42 PM	I took Solodyn for three months to clear up my perioral dermatitis.  It cleared up really quickly, within a week and I continued to see an improvement in my skin over the three month period.  While the first week I did notice nausea and tiredness, as well as some dizzyness, it went away after about a week or two.  I had no other side effects throughout the three months.  I did take the medication exactly as ordered, not laying down afterwards and not taking it with meals.  I would recommend this medication to anyone trying to get rid of their perioral dermatitis. I was nervous about taking it after reading so many negative reviews but decided to try it since no topical medications were working with my condition.  
Acne	solodynchestpain, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	7/1/2009 1:46:43 PM	I took Solodyn 135mg for 6 days and started having extreme chest pain.  At first I thought I had heart-burn since I was having trouble inhaling.  But the pain in my chest kept getting worse until it was tender to touch and spread to my shoulder and back.  It now hurts to cough, sneeze, or laugh and I have trouble sleeping since I can barely move from side to side.  I put a call into my dermatologist but have not heard back. Obviously, I stopped taking this drug since I saw a number of other reviews with chest pain. 
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	6/28/2009 11:54:24 AM	I took this for about 2 weeks and my skin cleared up fast.  I however was noticing these weird problems.  I was having shortness of breath, headaches, chest pain, dizziness, and stomach aches.  The side effects began rather quickly too.. Within 2 days for me.  At first I thought I was crazy...  Then I was pretty confident due to my fitness level and me taking care of myself that it wasn't me being crazy, that it was the medicine.  I went to the dermatologist, he took me off of it immediately and I'm trying Doryx now.  
Other	Jeff, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	1	Male	55-64	6/26/2009 7:18:52 AM	At age 55 I was diagnosed with rosacea and put on Solodyn.  After 22 days, my skin cleared up but I also developed a serious case of hives and itching.  This coincided with the flu, for which I was taking NyQuil.  I stopped taking Solodyn and within 24 hours the hives were greatly reduced and eventually went away.  My dermatologist said he would bet money that my experience was not an alergic reaction to Solodyn.  I don't believe him, especially after reading some of these other reviews.
Acne	student, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	19-24	6/25/2009 4:19:17 PM	I've taken two rounds of Solodyn. The first, prior to my wedding, was very effective. It cleared up my acne with few side effects. The second and more recent round has been terrible. My acne has hardly improved and I've experienced quite a few side effects. I'm waiting to go to a physician to make sure they are attributable to this drug, but as of now I think the following may be connected: dizziness, chest pain, blurry vision, extreme fatigue, and sore throat. I am no longer taking this drug.
Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Male	19-24	6/23/2009 4:45:28 PM	I have had acne for a long time (10 yrs) and have struggled to clear it.  At times I would be clear, then a 2 months would pass and I would have horrible acne.  I would get very oily skin, blackheads, and have large pimples. I have been to multiple dermotologists and have tried everything except Acutane(!!!) and lazers treatments.  Both my brothers took Acutane to clear their acne. It worked but caused extreme depression, and made them go crazy!! They also had extremely dried up lips and skin.  I did not want to go that route.  3 months ago I went to a new dermotologist and was put on Solodyn 90mg (since Im 200lbs) and clindareach.  I take it once a day and it has really helped my skin.  Ive taken doxicycloine (however you spell it) and this pill works! I havent experienced any of those crazy side effects such as skin problems or losing my hair! It has worked perfect on me and I barely have any acne now.  Happyly been on it for 3 months.  HOWEVER...I am doing an additional treatment called a &quot;Silk peel&quot; This is a once a month treatment and IT WORKS!! Its a little expensive ($160 per treatment) but its so worth it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Look in to it.

Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	6/2/2009 11:40:50 PM	I'm 24 and have developed adult acne so I decided to go to the dermatologist because i feel crazy about getting large pimples at least once a month. I've been using Solodyn in conjunction with 2 topical creams/gels (one in the morning and one at night) for about 1 and a half months. I have been very pleased with the results. I hadn't seen any acne since i started the treatment until my menstrual cycle came around, and it still was very mild (2 small red pimples) and better than when i wasn't using the treatments. I don't think i've experienced any of the side effects that others have - perhaps a minor headache here and there but i don't think it was due to Solodyn (moreso because of lack of rest and small hunger headaches). I went for a refill today because my doc suggested i take Solodyn for one more month since the tiny bumps appeared during my menstrual cycle and he wants to clear it up completely; the pharmacist informed me that it can decrease the effectiveness of birth control. I wasn't aware of this the first time around but didn't get pregnant. This does scare me though and i am thinking of possibly looking into other options. Solodyn has been good to me, or possibly just the creams. Good luck!

After 3months of taking 135mg, i've noticed a positive change in my acne with a negative impact on my hair.  i have this one patch of hair that basically looks as if it has been burned.  its coarse, breaks and appears to be dead. after reading other reviews on hair loss, i'm convinced my symptom is due to this drug.  
Acne	Zitless82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	5/12/2009 2:46:47 PM	I have been using Solodyn for a few months now.  It took it a couple weeks to really work at all, I had to go to my regular doctor once for a roaring type sensation in my ears and I am pretty sure it was a side effect from Solodyn but couldn't prove it.  Wasn't enough to cause me to quit taking it.  I am also on two topical medications so it is hard to tell which is really doing the job or if it is all of them, but just in the couple of months I have been acne free except for maybe one or two small ones during that time of the month.  I am going to continue taking it until my doctor tells me to stop even though I am past the 12 week period.  Overall I am not concerned for my health with taking Solodyn although I am sure it isn't safe as a long term medication, and I am very happy with the results.
Acne	nml82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	5/11/2009 2:25:24 PM	I took Solodyn for about 6 weeks.  No side affects at first...but within 2 weeks of taking it i woke up one morning with hives that spread all over my body. My hands would hurt as if they were entirely bruised just from opening a bottled water or using a key to open the door. THEN the chest pains. I associated it with the Claritin i took for the first time ever for congestion allergy symptoms the day before. Ended up going to my endocrinologist for help. He knew I had been prescribed Solodyn by my dermalogist but he didnt make the connection. He gave me a prescription for the reaction, but since it didnt help, he said try zyrtec.  I did and my symptoms went away.   I kept taking Solodyn because I had no clue it was the cause of my allergic reaction.  At my 6 week follow up with my dermatologist, i still had chest pains (less often) and itching if i didnt take my daily Zyrtec, sometimes the chest pains came back even if i took it. He told me it quite possibly was the Solodyn and to stop taking it, keep taking zyrtec for a week and if the symptoms didnt come back, then that was our confirmation. Said and done. I'm all better. No more Solodyn for me. Found out the chest pains were esophegeal spasms --feel like i swallowed a chicken bone horizontally over and over in waves of pain. It radiated to my neck and jaw and my back.  Very strange. Very painful.  Sometimes to the point where I was ready to go to the ER.  I am concerned that the FDA has only approved it for 12 weeks..thats scary.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	5/4/2009 6:20:18 PM	I am in my early 30s and was experiencing occasional cystic acne on my face, nothing too extreme. My dermatologist prescribed this and I took it for one month before stopping. I do not take any other prescriptions. I write this as a warning. I lost at least 25% of my hair, maybe as much as 40%, developed the most extreme itching you can imagine, had hives and red blotches that would appear out of nowhere on my skin. It makes me sick how long it will take for my hair to grow back. I am so angry with this drug and my dermatologist (former) for prescribing this and not warning about the side effects. I am filing a MedWatch report on FDA.GOV. 
Acne	CPAEvil, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	1	1	Female	35-44	4/11/2009 11:17:53 AM	My dermatologist put me on this last April.  I started having joint pain but mild so didn't worry about it.  I started working out in February and I was really sore and my joints ached.  Thought it was from working out but when I started having chills at night and aching hands and feet AND then could hardly walk, I went to my GP.  He did a blood test and meanwhile put me on a Medrol dose pak.  I felt great after 12 hours.  When the blood test came back, my liver enzymes were 10 times what they should be and my SED rate was high (inflammation).  He sent me to a rheumatologist and told me to quit taking solodyn and no alcohol.  After almost 3 weeks and blood tests, the Rheumatoid doctor concluded that it was from the solodyn.  My liver enzymes have gone down a lot and the swelling is better.  IF YOU TAKE THIS DRUG, HAVE BLOOD TESTS.  From what I have researched, this is a common (not rare) side effect of this drug.  I would NEVER touch this again!!!
Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	3/31/2009 2:07:49 PM	Prescribed by my new Dermotologist. I have taken it for about a week and a half, experienced a severe headache with the first pill or two. No other apparent side effects, unless you count an extremely severe sensitivity in the breast around menstruation that I've NEVER experienced before now. Has anyone experienced that?  I'm a bit confused why all Dermotologists I've seen wants to prescribe a drug for acne when I have a mild form of redness associated with rosacea, no problematic issues with acne or breakouts of any kind.  Based on what I've now read and the comments posted, this drug seems like it could be too risky and is too costly for me ($60.00 copay a month) to continue past the first month. 
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	3	3	3	Female	25-34	3/27/2009 12:43:11 PM	I have been taking this medication for 1 1/2 months. I have seen great results. Very little new breakouts and the cystic acne I had has almost desapeared. I have had dry skin and something no one has mentioned yet, heart palpitations. 
Acne	cstarrmad, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/23/2009 12:42:18 PM	I have been on this medication for about 2 months now and I have had excellent results.  I am a 27 year old female and was battling with adult acne.  It was worsening, so I decided to go see my Dermatologist.  She prescribed me 45mg pills of Solodyn combined with the topical gel, Duac and I have had phenominal results.  I have experienced some side effects, nausea, dizziness and light-headedness around my menstrual.  I also had constipation the first week taking this drug, but afterwards I haven't had any other problems.  The most important thing is that it is effective and has been working.  I would recommend this to anyone.  
Acne	Jojo1984, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/14/2009 1:38:23 PM	Hi I've been on this medication for about a month now and I will say it is definetely working. I have not had any new pimple since i've been on this. I will say that every medication works differently on each individual, so just bc it doesnt work on one person, it doesn't mean it wont work on the other and vise versa. So, if it doesnt work on you, don't be discourage, talk to you doctor if you see no effect in one or two months.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	4	1	Female	25-34	3/7/2009 5:39:12 PM	I've never had horrible acne; just a few pimples now and then but some blackheads. While I was in NY last year, I had a horrible breakout so I went to a dermatologist when I got home. This IDIOT prescribed me (then 115-120 lbs) Solodyn back in December. I've been taking it ever since at night before bedtime. I am now down to 105 lbs (it's not that great) and it is March. I eat a normal diet, exercise some, and do not have an eating disorder. I also have been EXTREMELY tired, almost to the point of mental and physical exhaustion. I do work a lot (and stress) so I thought it was that or another medical problem. A couple of weeks ago, I slept a straight 26 HRS. No kidding! I didn't think it was physically possible. I also have headaches almost every day and my neck and shoulders hurt so bad, it's like a concrete brick is sitting on my shoulders. I've also noticed that I am more pale than I've ever been. I've been to my regular doctor and had blood tests because my family has been very worried and nothing has come of it. After reading all of these reviews, I am convinced that my problems are a result of Solodyn. I will stop using it immediately and hopefully I will feel better soon! Thanks for all your honesty!

Still breaking out on my temple area and chin. Has not dried  out my skin anywhere.I'm 44 and haven't ever had skin problems til last summer and I'm very discouraged. I don't want to go on the pill again either- not sure what I'll try next... 
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/22/2009 12:01:40 PM	I have always had combination skin and would get pretty bad, cystic acne around my jaw line the week before my period that would take another two weeks to go away.  I was getting discoloration and I was concerned about scaring.  I don't take the pill and I didn't want to start unless it was completely necessary.  My new dermatologist prescribed 90mg of solodyn for the 1 month and then down to 45 mg for the next two months.  He also told me to up the dose to 90mg the week before my period.  In addition to using liberal amounts of Retin A every night (amazing, I'm hooked!) and Benzaclin for spot treatments in the AM, the quality of my skin has improved considerably.  I am no longer getting cystic acne and my skin has a great glow.  I'm just working on keep the results consistent and lessening the discoloration with a mild skin lightener on spots.  I couldn't be happier with the result and I know that solodyn was a major party of the reason as well as Retin A.  I used Benzaclin more in the beginning, but not really now.
Acne	Peaches, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	35-44	2/11/2009 1:16:52 PM	I have used this product for a little over a month and have noticed my skin clearing up, but some of the side effects are the light headedness and the loss of appetite.  I have also missed my menstrual cycle.  I was wondering if anyone else had this effect.  I know for a fact that I am not pregnant, but was wondering if the medication was the cause.
Acne	pretendin2work, 25-34 Female  (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	1/19/2009 5:33:00 PM	I have been taking Solodyn for about 2 months now.  I have noticed some improvement in my skin, the majority of it being in the past 2 weeks.  In my case, a doctor turned what was a mild outbreak into severe perioral dermatitis after telling me to put a steroid gel on the affected area twice daily for 3 months.  According to my NEW doctor, the steroids have caused pretty serious damage that will take quite a while to clear up, so other people may get results faster.  As far as side effects are concerned, I haven't noticed any tiredness, headaches, or hives many people seem to experience. My biggest problem has been yeast infections - I've had about 5 since starting this medication, and it is rather irritating.  Not enough for me to discontinue the medication, as I'm pleased with the improvements my skin is showing, but I don't want to take this stuff any longer than I have to.

I took the pill once and experianced nose bleeds and really bad uncharacteristic mood swings, i became easily irritated and my acne is getting worse.  I don't know why anyone would take this pill compaired to others.  There are so many better medications for acne that don't have these side effects.

My breakouts consisted of the huge and very deep kind-embarassing and I hoped this drug would work.  I had no side effects, I took this pill before bed time.  The pill did not work though, I still broke out.

Acne	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	4	2	Male	19-24	12/23/2008 11:55:04 AM	i have taken solodyn for 3 months about a year ago because that was the time frame recommended by my doctor. Although it helped alot in that 3 month frame, it worsened about 2 weeks after i stopped taking the medication. About a year later, i started taking solodyn again. This time i took it for about 4 to 5 months straight. I just came home for winter break about a week ago and felt extremely tired. i just thought this was due to staying up late nights so i disregarded it. 2 days later i still felt tired as i woke up but went on with my normal day but started to experience a loss of appetite. i disregarded that too. just forced myself to eat because i was actually starting to lose weight. About 2 days later (today) i woke up AGAIN, VERY tired. i was sitting in bed thinking to myself what the heck was going on because i've been tired for about a full week now although i started to get over 13 hours of sleep for 2 straight days. Right before i was about to take my normal dosage of solodyn i came to the realization that solodyn might be the cause of these effects. After doing some research on this drug i came to the conclusion that the severe headaches and fatigue were caused by this drug. As of now i plan to stop taking this drug and contacting my physician. hopefully i do not grow a resistance to future antibiotics or have kidney problems. Mom warned me a couple times about this medication but i was too eager to get rid of my acne. i should have stopped and listened.

I have had no new outbreaks, but I am also taking the Duac topical cream.  Side effects I am experiencing are mild headaches,dizziness and a racing heart.  It's hard to tell if the good results are from Solodyn or Duac.

It causes severe CNS (central nervous system) side effects! You should not opperate a car while taking it because of vertigo...hello?? Why not take Doryx, it is a much safer drug and does the trick as well! Not to mention Solodyn costs over $600 a month -- Medicis is doing some clever marketing to make patients think they can get it cheaper, but someone is paying that cost!!! If you want to clear your face and not risk any severe side effects, take Doryx!
Acne	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		11/18/2008 10:43:26 AM	Began taking this drug in Aug. this year and over a period of app. 6 wks, I experienced full-blown flu symptoms (EXTREME body aches, high fever, cough, rapid breathing, neck pain, etc.)  This happened repeatedly, lasted 2-3 days at a time and then disappeared.  Each time it happened, I stopped taking the medication because I was so sick.  My doctor tested me for Lyme disease which came back negative. The symptoms &quot;vanished,&quot; and I didn't make the connection until I started researching Solodyn.  On 11/17, I decided to try it again and see if there was a connection.  Took one pill and almost ended up in the ER.  This drug needs to be evaluated for long-term use, not just 12 weeks!  My 14-year-old daughter experienced similar symptoms, although not as severe.  Neither one of us will be taking it anymore.

But I continued taking the medication. In the beginining I was on 90mg. After 3 months, my acne had improved dramtically. My Dr. then upped my dosage to 135mg. My acne is completely gone. I am also using a wash and morning/night creams with the Solodyn. My skin is beautiful again. There has been side effects. At first, I was experiencing headaches. But that has ceased. I still deal with severe dry skin. Finding an awesome skin cream is key. And there were times where my skin was extremly sensitive. But I would choose to take Solodyn again if my skin reacted the same. 
Acne	dlee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	11/6/2008 4:02:13 AM	I've taken Solodyn 45 mg.(p.m.)for 1 1/2 months and am pleased w/the results. My acne is drying up,the cysts are shrinking, and the redness is going away. However, one of the side effects I'm experiencing is shedding/hair loss and it's very annoying! I'm also extremely tired, having mood swings, and dizzyness. Since I'm using it in conjunction w/Cetaphil Gentle Wash, Spironolactone, and topical Atralin Gel 0.05%. I'm not really sure which of the meds. is working the best and/or which is causing the side effects. Since I'm not allegic to fish, and the side effects of Atralin don't include dizzyness, lethargy, or hair loss, I'm ruling it out. Hopefully, by Dec.(3mos.), I'll be able to stop taking Solodyn, Spiro and maintain a clear complexion w/Atralin. I'm 55 yrs. old and I've been dealing w/acne for 43 yrs. Taking tetracycline, doxycycline, erythromyocin, zithramyocin, accutane, nicomide(zinc &amp; niacin),+ applying topicals:fostex,benzaclin,klaron,differin,&amp; many more, and washing w/purpose, brevoxyl, and cetaphil, blue light treatments, and occasional tanning has cost lots of $$$$$ even w/insurance!! solodyn has been relatively cheap($25 copay)w/rx card which lasts for initial prescription and 2 refills.

However, I do have bouts w/hives all over my body, sometimes very severe reactions, but I take zyrtec/benadryl &amp; it seems to calm down - but I don't breakout w/hives on a regularly basis, it's periodic &amp; although extremely uncomfortable; I am convinced that the effectiveness of Solodyn outweighs the breakouts w/the hives.  I will continue to take this med, even though I'm concerned about the affects on my liver, especially after taking on a daily basis for 4 yrs now!!

Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	10/22/2008 2:41:25 PM	I started taking this medication about 3 years ago after breaking out horribly from taking prednizone for poison ivy in conjunction with Duac and Metrogel. The drug has started to show signs that it is no longer effective in my treatment, as I have been breaking out consistently.  The drug eventually quits working as your body and the acne bacteria develop a resistance.  Researching the product I also have come to the realization that I developed a problem with migraines about 8 months into taking the medication, and I never had a migraine prior to this medication. In addition, I also experienced tingling and numbness in my face and lips. I started to take Benadryl and ibuprofen to minimize the pain. SO-while this drug worked wonders for my face when it was working, it forced me to have to taint my body with more and more medications and has caused me to be resistant to a drug that I may need in the future. Consider all your options wisely.

But it's difficult to decipher whether its this oral antibiotic or the topical creams that have helped the most. The worst effect of this medication is the severe constipation and that's even after eating a high-fiber diet, rich in fruits &amp; vegetables and oatmeal daily. And now experiencing bloody stools, therefore I cannot continue taking this medication.
Acne		4	5	1			10/13/2008 11:34:43 PM	I have only taken Solodyn for 5 days and immediately noticed improvements in my skin.  However, on day 4 I woke up experiencing some discomfort in my neck and shoulders.  At first, I thought it was from how I had slept the night before but on day 5 the pain had moved to my back and then my legs.  I also experienced swollen glands, loss of appetite, nausea, and numbness in my feet.  I seemed to be dizzy nearly every time I made a sudden move.  Once I was able to connect these symptoms to the side effects of Solodyn, I stopped taking the medication.  Two days later, I have experienced a very high fever yet had chills in 80 degree weather.  Still having a tan from the summer, my family was scared when my face went pale as a ghost and progressively lost more and more energy.  I wasn't able to move out of bed for an entire day and s

I applaud WebMD's site for these reviews, and have found other's review of Solodyne very helpful. I have been on Solodyne for 2-3 weeks and have seen good results with no new break outs and healing of previous breakouts. However I am experiencing the headaches and though not excrutiating their pretty moderate and dull constant feeling. I thought it might be tension/stress but after reading the possible side effects and other reviews I am believing the headaches to be associated with Solodyne. I am going to lay off the drug for 1 week and see what happens.....ps: thanks for the warning about the hives, that would have thrown me through a loop! Best wishes to all those from all ages of life suffering with acne.

Two days ago I broke out in mild hives all over my body and have been really dizzy. My doctor told me it was the minocycline, and is changing my prescrip.

I went back to my dermatologist and he agreed it was the medication. Just when I thought I had found something. Back to the drawing board.

Acne got about 90% better, but my teeth turned grey, especially in cracks.   Dr said to discontinue after 5 weeks because of teeth problems.  Scars and age spots/freckling is more pronounced now.  Also aches, pains, blurred vision felt while taking med.   I don't think the benefit outweighed the risk on this med, possibly a better med for teens and 20's aged patients.

The tiny bumps on my cheeks have disappeared, and any pimples that I do get are gone within two days. The side effects do suck though. I've been dizzy and have vomited a few times, and I've been having crazy mood swings. I took three pregnancy tests before I realized that I wasn't pregnant--it was the Solodyn. Oh well. At least my skin looks great.
Acne	tmelissa24, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	5/20/2008 2:11:21 PM	After one month of following the acne treatment plan my dermatologist put me on, which included Solodyn 90mg my pimples stop reoccuring and the existing ones had started drying up.  Once I was on my second month of treatment I as well as others had noticed a drastic change in my skin.  I was no longer breaking out.  My next step was to get any dark spots on my face to fade which included me using another drug in addition to my physician lowering the dosage of solodyn.  I was very surprised at the effectiveness in the drug treatment plan I was on.  Solodyn certainly worked for me.
Acne	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	19-24	5/19/2008 6:21:33 PM	I have been on a low dose for about 2 years now and it has worked very well! My face has cleared up almost to the point that I feel comfortable not wearing makeup. I have had moderate acne for about 5 years. I had a few mild side effects at first - dizzyness/lightheadedness, but only when I didn't eat before taking the pill. I recommend this medication to anyone who is fed up with acne and spending money on lotions that dont work!

Acne	LindsayLu, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	4/19/2008 9:13:12 AM	I have been taking Solodyn (90mg) for roughly seven weeks.  I am FINALLY starting to see changes in my face.  I have perioral dermatitis and it definitely got worse around week 3-5.  I wanted to take a different med but my derm told me to stick it out the entire 12 weeks.  I'm so happy that I did. My face is almost entirely clear (huge relief).  It's itchy - but that is due to healing.  I'm so happy.  I have had a few headaches - but other than that - it's a miracle drug.  If you can - STICK IT OUT.  It definitely takes two months before you see major changes.  I would highly recommend this drug.  Trust me - I've tried it all throughout my life (Accutane, Proactive, Murad, etc).  I am pleasantly surprised.  I rcvd an Rx card from my derm for the copay and I have really good insurance so this was free for three months.  It is pricy and I can understand the drawback - but it works!!!  Good luck everyone!
Acne	maosmama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	2	1	Female	25-34	4/4/2008 2:29:50 PM	I've been taking Solodyn for three weeks. Yesterday my entire body started itching. Today the itching is even more intense, the joints in my fingers are sore and stiff and I feel very &quot;out of it&quot;. My skin has cleared up considerably, but I'm also using Atralin cream and Duac gel so I'm not sure which of these has had the positive effect on my skin. I'm definitely done with the Solodyn!
Acne	Madison, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months	1	3	1	Female	19-24	4/2/2008 9:17:41 AM	I took this medicine for 1 month. It cost $500/month. The derm md gave me a patient access card which brought down the price to $40/month. I was previously on regular minocycyline 100mg once a day.The drug rep came in to the derm office and convinced  the doc that this product was better because it was timed released. I also take birth control pills. I had break-through bleeding, which means my birth control is now not working correctly, even though I spaced the 2 different pills. I also got a horrible yeast infection that was difficult to clear.My acne got worse and I was very fatigued and moody. Regular minocycline cost me $8/month with my insurance plan.    Beware! The drug reps give perks to the docs to have them prescribe their meds. I was doing fine on regular minocycline.
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	3/17/2008 1:09:22 PM	I HAVE REALLY MILD ACNE AND I'VE TAKEN THIS MED FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS NOW. I EXPERIENCED NO SIDE EFFECTS AT FIRST, BUT NOW I FIND THAT I AM &quot;ITCHY&quot; ALL OVER TO THE POINT I AM TAKING BENEDRYL FOR RELIEF. I DON'T PLAN TO TAKE ANY MORE SOLODYN AND HAVE CONTACTED MY DR FOR SOMETHING ELSE.
Other	middle aged woman, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	45-54	3/6/2008 7:02:33 PM	I took this drug, for 9 days, for rosacea.  Immediately my skin looked better.  But on day 10 I awoke to stomach and head aches.  I discontinued the meds.  The next day was the same, with the addition of hives, muscle aches, blurry fision, overall lethargy and a fever of 102 Fahrenheit (something I hadn't experienced in 25 years).  I figured I had the flu and was surprised to learn the additional symptoms were a continuing reaction to Solodyn.  Even 6 days after stopping the meds, the stomach upset, muscle aches and letheragy remain.  So this medication will not work for me. I'm looking forward to getting better and living with rosacea. 
Acne		4	5	1			2/8/2008 6:27:36 PM	I used this medication for about 18 months.  I was only 15 when i started using this medication.  It worked very well as far as preventing acne.  After using this medication for about a year, I began to notice that I was losing hair.  I stopped using this medication about 6 months ago and I am just starting to notice new hairs sprouting up where my hairline was receding.  I strongly suggest talking to your doctor about the side effects of this medication because worrying about hairloss before I even have a full beard is not fun.
Acne		4	5	4			1/27/2008 11:49:31 PM	I have been on this medication for about a month now.  I am using it in combination with face cream differin.  It seems to be working great.  I have tried just about every thing (even proactive didn't work), and this seems to be doing the trick.  I did suffer from major major headaches at first.  However, I have stopped taking this drug with food, and the headaches have gone away.  Just a hint for those taking it still and getting headaches, try taking it without food and see what happens.  I did that, and haven't gotten a headache since.
Acne	shelleyy04@yahoo.com, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	1/21/2008 10:32:10 AM	I have used several different facial products for acne over the years and nothing truly worked.I used Solodyn for 2wks and my face started clearing up instantly,within days,but for me the side effects became more than I could handle.I had migraine headaches for days, blurred vision and a red blotchy rash from head to toe.I have gastristis and come to find out this medication is NOT a good fot with someone with this condition because it filters 1/2 through the kidneys and 1/2 through the liver,which the combination of the two could cause severe liver damage for me.So even though this medicine was helping my acne clear up it wasn't worth harming the rest of my body.Good luck to those that can take this medication and see positive results.I am now on a different medication that does not effect my liver.From my research/reading it is not healthy to stay on these medicines for a lengthy period of time. 
Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	1/14/2008 11:31:20 AM	Though I've only been using Solodyn for 10 days for Rosacea in tandem with a topical cream and a face wash, I have found it to be very effective. My skin has gone from dry and flaky to soft and smooth. The redness and pimples are also dissipating at a remarkable rate. NO SIDE AFFECTS YET!! Looking forward to seeing what the results will be after prolonged use.

I dont experience any of the side effects and my skin is clear. It took about almost 2 months before I saw the improvements though.

Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/6/2008 11:13:49 PM	I have been on Solodyn for 1 month, and have experience several side effects including headaches, dizziness and the same &quot;out of sorts&quot; feeling others have described. The one condition that no on else has mentioned is extreme hair loss. I will continue to read other reviews to see if anyone is experiencing the same side effects...it is frightening.
Acne	melanie1212, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	11/24/2007 10:22:04 AM	This drug is terrible. First of all one month supply cost $1600! It used up all my insurance drug coverage ( I am only allotted $2000/year).  The side effects are riddiculous, which include extreme anal inching and bleeding (something I never expirienced before in my life), as well as extreme lethargy. I am shocked the dermatologist would even have prescribed this for me, when you take into account there are antibiotics moreeffective that cost a $20 for a months supply (that dont cause these strange side effects). 
Acne	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	11/19/2007 11:01:17 AM	I have only taken this medicine for 3 days.  The side effects are too much for me.  It makes me very lightheaded, dizzy and sick.  I have an 8 year old who is very active and on several occassions I could not drive her to her functions.  I stop taking the medicine and began to feel better immediately.  
Acne	JohnR, 13-18 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	4	1	Male	13-18	11/17/2007 8:30:01 PM	I have been on Solodyn for 3 and a half months now.  And if I didn't know any better, I'd say I wasn't taking it at all.  No relief from acne.  No side-effects.  Nothing whatsoever changed regarding my condition of Class 3 acne.  And it is incredibly expensive without insurance.  I would recommend staying away from it.  Good luck!
Acne	kinius82, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	11/8/2007 10:14:32 PM	I was taking this medication for 8 wks and I saw the difference already after like 2wks of taking it. For 2 yrs I was trying different meds and skin products (creams, acne aids)with no response.After taking Solodyn I was very suprised how good the medication is especially from the working side.It very expensive if pt's have now insurance but its worth it to try it...
Acne	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	11/7/2007 2:21:29 PM	I have been taking this drug for two 1/2  months.  I have seen a little success.  However I was not prepared for the side effects.  I have numbness and tingling in my arms, hands, legs and feet.  I have had a head ache constant for about a month that no amount of medicine seems to help.  I finnally called the Doctor today to see if I could change to something else.

I am starting to question the  side effects. For the last two to three months I have  been dizzy  and  feeling&quot;out of sorts&quot; along with blurry vision, headaches, and recenlty muscle aches. I recently read that this drug was tested by the FDA for a period of 12 WEEKS.  Is there any info on the long term effects????
