Other	lpuga, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	8/24/2012 10:10:54 AM	In march startd with dry cough..then severe phlegm now throat problems like lump or hair in throat.. cough and phlegm subsided but still having throat problem have never had this problem before went to several doctors all said allergies. Went to specialist (ENT) and he gave me samples of Astepro and Zyrtec to take at night.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	trk, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/20/2012 8:39:18 PM	Every fall for the last several years, I have been so sick. Horrible headaches, post nasal drip and congestion. Allergies started in July/August and by September/October, I had to take very strong antibiotics and prednisone. Sometimes more than one round. This product is a life saver. I have been on it a few weeks and felt measurably better almost immediately. I hope this keeps up. If it does, it will be the first fall I have felt well in several years. The only product that was effective and I have tried most on the market.(If you follow the instructions, you will not get the bad taste.)

Woke up exhausted this morning even though I got a good 7 hours of sleep.  My throat is so swollen it hurts to talk and swallow and my neck and back muscles feel sore like someone just beat me all night.  I didn't feel this way yesterday...I'm not taking this medication again.

Reduces the swelling quickly and I don't think about my sinuses again all day.  This is my longest stretch without an infection in years.
Other	Linondrugs, 65-74 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3		65-74	4/18/2012 5:11:21 PM	I saw some reviews stating their taste buds were affected.  If that's the worst of it...I'm happy.  Maybe I'll eat a little less..lol..so far the drug has helped but has not completely alleviated the post nasal drip I've lived with for at least 10 years.
Other	Not Happy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/31/2012 10:16:16 AM	After reading another comment I realize that I am not the only one to experience an awful side effect of this drug.  I used this product twice.  The second time I could feel the medicine going down my throat and it tasted awful.  Now, almost a week and half later my taste buds are really messed up.  Nothing tastes good.  Hopefully, this side effect wears off soon!
Vasomotor Rhinitis	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/24/2012 3:58:01 PM	This is the only nasal spray that controls my post-nasal drip and chronic headaches due to vasomotor rhinitis!  I now use the AstePro which doesn't have that bitter after taste.  (It feels like less spray volume than the original Astelin and leaves a powder sugar after-taste instead of a bitter one).

The problem is that I was one of the lucky ones to have the side effect.  The taste was bitter, but that wasn't the worst of it.  It started to affect my taste buds a few weeks later.  Then for 2 weeks I couldn't eat anything because everything, and I mean everything, tasted horrible and  intensified the bitter taste like I drank a gallon of liquid soap.  I almost thought that someone was trying to poison me.  I couldn't figure out the cause but then I found out that this was a side effect.  I have year round allergies and sometimes get migraines.  I am affected by my allergies and an especially allergic to cats, ash tree and dust mites, but I would rather suffer from my symptoms then deal with the side effect again.  If you are lucky not to experience this side effect, then it might be a good product.

Anyone else experience this?

It makes a noticible difference although all symptoms are not completely gone. It does make me very drowsy for the first hour or so after using. The bitter taste bothered me for a while but something that you do get used to. All and all, very effective

My husband and I are trying to get pregnant and my cycle has been turned upside down ever since I started using this nose spray.
Vasomotor Rhinitis	clear4k, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	6/13/2011 5:24:20 PM	I am 56 years old and have previously never suffered from any type of nasal issues. Recently however I bagan having a problem with nasal drip, more of an annoyance. I work with the public and can't continue to wipe my nose constantly. Tried a new doctor and after a series of checks and tests she suggested the Astepro. I've got to say, I am amazed. No more issues with nasal drip, no side effects and no bitter taste that I hear others speak of. My only complaint is the high cost of this medication. Not yet available as a generic, so the pharmaceutical company that developed it will &quot;Take us to the cleaners&quot; until their patent expires.

For me, this is the only spray that has ever worked, and the results were immediate! I will fight you and your mother for my Astepro!!!
Other	GRB, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	45-54	5/7/2011 8:42:10 PM	Was given this medication for post-nasal congestion.  It worked a little, though not better than other nasal sprays I have used.  It leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth that will not go away, and effects the taste of food and drinks.  Be very sure you are willing to live with this side effect before you consider this medication.  It does not work better than others that leave no taste in the mouth.

Taking Astepro for 4 month at night.  Works good, but I have to take an oral allergy pill (non-drowsy) in the morning as a back up.  I'm extremely tired, fatigued, sleepy, with red eyes.  I haven't changed my eating habits and have gained 15-20lbs.  I have to stop, can't continue to walk around feeling this tired all the time.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	digi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	55-64	3/29/2011 1:11:52 AM	I didn't have any of the problems with the taste, and it seemed to be helping shortly after I first used it.  But after about 5-10 minutes, I started getting a burning sensation in my nostrils and sinuses, and then a few minutes after that a sneezing fit started which lasted about 5 minutes, then about 5 minutes of serious dripping and running.  Now, 20 minutes later, my nose remains completely blocked, much worse than before I took the medication.  I've never had an allergic reaction to any drug (except neosporin) before, but possibly I'm allergic to one of the inactive ingredients??  Anyway, clearly not a success.  Also, I *love* the directions:  step 1 -- clear your nose.  If I could clear my nose, I wouldn't need the doggone stuff!

Nasal irrigation keeps sneezing and itch from seasonal allergies well under control but doesn't eliminate the post nasal. Allergist gave me Astepro sample and I only take one dose in each nostril at night. The taste if any goes down my throat is sweet and doesn't last so it doesn't bother me at all. I don't notice drowsiness during the day by omitting a day time dose. It seems to be helping after a week but hasn't eliminated all the symptoms yet. I'm sticking with it since it's so easy to take and hasn't caused me any of the side effects others describe.    
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	2/3/2011 10:26:12 PM	This product gave me a gigantic head knocking migraine.  I get migraines anyway &amp; have known that antihistamines are bad for me, but it has been years since I tried one.  I thought maybe I could use it again, but it really made me sick.  I had a sinus infection &amp; I just did without the nasal spray.

Other	Sleepy But Better, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	12/31/2010 4:16:32 AM	Because of the recent dry weather in my state, I've had unseasonal allergies. I was perscribed this medicine. It works fine.But, I'm finding that it makes me really, really sleepy. At first, it didn't. Actually, it was the opposite. I stayed up a lot. But, I went about 2 weeks from the initial first 3 doses(that were a day each), and found myself really sleepy. I slept for 15 hours. Then I woke up and for a week I was fine, but started having some symptoms agian. So I took another dose, and I slept for 2 days straight. And I didn't know it, until i woke up and my husband told me. He was about to take me to the hospital. For the next week afterward, it was in my urine really strong. (it wasn't before)I've gone to different places to check and see if anyone else had this as a side-effect, and found none. I've talked to my doctor, and he was surprised it did that to me. I'm writing this so that maybe there is someone else who have had this happen to them while taking this medication. If you start to feel better, then quit. Go back to the doctor, because maybe you don't need the medicine. And no, I don't drink or smoke and I only sprayed it once in both nostrals.Here's my word of caution: It's a good drug. But be very very careful if you become drowsey, and start sleeping alot. No drug should do a person like that. If you notice you're sleeping more than normal, consult your doctor before going any further. Abnormal sleep (more or less) can lead to further health issues. Other than the sleeping, the medicine has worked like a charm! I'd recommend it to my family and friends (however, including a small warning).

Astelin leaves a bad taste in the mouth, but I haven't had that problem with Astepro.  My only issue with it is that it doesn't last as long as I need it to.  If I could use it twice as often, it would be perfect!

Using Astepro in combination with Allegra has greatly improved my condition.  Finding a good allergist who has worked closely with me and whose judgment I trust has also been a very good thing.  I use the Astepro as needed and find it to be very effective with no side effects save the brief unpleasant taste after I first use it.  I would highly recommend this drug to other allergy sufferers.

The allergy specialist put me on Astepro after I told her about my chronic sinus and allergy problems that are triggering migraines and that I was going to move out of state to get relief. I have had nasal and sinus surgeries; I have tried almost every possible sinus remedy out there without any relief. Since I have been on this medicine, I have not had a sinus infection or migraine IN TWO MONTHS! My sinus and allergy problems are doing much better. I highly recommend this product to anyone with sinus, allergy, or migraine problems.

I have suffered for many years with allergy related sinus problems. Having sinus surgery did not help.  Over the years the doctors have put me on many differednt types of meds and sprays and this is the ONLY thing that has EVER worked.  Funny thing is the Astelin did not.  I have no nose bleeds and I think the taste is sweet.  I know this may sound corny but this little spray has given me my life back.  Try being allergic to dust living in the San Joaquin Vally.  Two years of allergy shots twice a week only made the list of things I am allergic to double.  This is not on my new kaiser insurance drug list and they do not take the instant savings card from Astepro my old doc gave me but it is well worth the extra cost I have to put out.Thank You so much.Dena L

Tried nasonex, flonase, claritin,benadryl,zyrtec - no help.  Thought I would suffer forever.  Within a couple of days of starting Astepro, I stopped having the headaches...and haven't had one since!  No more sinus pressure!  You DO have to follow instructions...if you don't bend over and gently spray, the taste is gross.  But it's not hard to use, and it is a miracle to me.  One possible side effect...I have a mouth full of canker sores this week.  I have a history of getting the occasional canker sore with stress or vitamin deficiencies, so I am not sure that Astepro was the culprit.

I used Astepro 3 times and it knocks the socks off anything else I have ever used, Nasonex, Flonase etc. In reading other posts I beleive the people reporting bad taste and burning are not following instructions. If you bend down as instructed when using it you don't get the bad taste or you don't swallow it.IT WORKS FOR ME. I would rate it a 10.

Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	5/11/2010 12:41:49 PM	This spray has worked very well for me. Easy breathing.  No side effects except a slight bitter taste that goes away after an hour or two, especially with coffee. It seems that I have had to increase the dosage - maybe it is just the pollen season getting worse I don't know.  I am also reading other complaints of fatigue, which I have experienced.  Perhaps my fatigue is also related to the astepro.  I will try to leave it off for a week or 2 and see if there is a difference.  
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	4/18/2010 7:25:18 PM	Dr gave me samples to help with my constant headaches after CT scan showed thickening of my sinus cavaity. If I use it at night before going to bed, I don't wake up with a headache. If I take in the AM instead, I have a headache all day long. Also if I take at night, the bitter taste is gone in the AM. However, It makes my eyes sensative to fluorescent lights and I have problems with Dizziness. I'm very sleepy in the AM, no matter how much sleep I get. Has made me late for work a few days already. I haven't weighted myself in a while, but I'm afraid it has made me gain a few pounds. These side effects are much easier to deal with than the side effects of allegra  &amp; singular which gave me extreme dizziness and intensified my headaches as well as causing my heart to race. I'm still not convinced this is the best course of treatment. I've never had allergies in my life. Based on CT scan, I think this is more of a deep sinus infection instead of allergies.
Seasonal Runny Nose	Don, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	1	Male	35-44	4/17/2010 8:50:40 PM	I was given 2 samples to try and I am not sold on this med.

All the side effects are true. I sneezed like crazy, got nauseated from the drip, and tired, because there is a antihistamine in it. It's like taking benedryl, no wonder we're all tired. And if the weight gain is an issue, it's because of the corticosteroids in it. It completely opened me up in a matter of minutes literally, which is great, but I'm keeping this one on the back shelf, only for emergencies, because it's a killer on the side effects.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	forkateri, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	3/24/2010 6:39:26 PM	I have used Flonase, saline and other nasal sprays and never had a reaction such as this.  My nose felt as if deep in my sinuses it was on fire and I could not stop it.  Then about 10 minutes later it began running down my throat (which happens with them all, so I know it's not just the taste) and I began violently vomiting.  My daughter was prescribed this and had this reaction initially and I thought she was pretending.  This is why I tried it, and I felt horrible that she was not embellishing at all.  I had the same reaction.  Odd, but I have never had any experience like this.  ALmost to the point I think maybe it was allergic reaction?  Horrible stuff!  Be careful!

Seems to be clearing the ears; still have dizziness.  Bad taste in mouth and gagging after use.  Headache and extremely tired.
Other	Fuyuko, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	1	Female	35-44	3/5/2010 1:34:38 AM	My doctor gave me a sample of this because I have trouble taking oral antihistamines. Well, it helps my bladder pain and clears my sinuses (yes my bladder is helped by taking antihistamines as it inhibits the growth of mast cells), but the heartburn from this is so bad I could not continue! It felt like I'd drunk a triple cappucino from Starbucks. I tried everything. Halved the dose. Spit out the stuff that ran down my throate etc. Unfortunately, in no way was this toleratble. Also, some people can't eat sorbitol. Its a known laxative and stomach upsetter. I'm not sure why the manufacturer felt sweet snot would taste good. It does not. I'd rather have unflavored stuff that doesn't upset my stomach. I'm disappointed.

I took two Benadryl caplets (25 mg)each night with some success but still had sneezing fits periodically. Tried Loratadine caplets (10 mg)with no real improvement.Since using Astepro for 6 months, I have sneezed fewer than 10 times.Wish I had asked my Dr. about this product years ago.The bad aftertaste is minimized if you lean forward when spraying into the nostrils.I have noticed no side effects.

I'm afraid to try it again. It had a very bitter taste that lasted  for hours. When I first used it, I felt real weird and nauseous. It made me very sleepy. After I woke up still feeling bad. Won't use it again.
Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	25-34	2/14/2010 10:04:52 AM	Causes me to vomit after taking.  Tried 3 separate occasions because of my allergist's encouragement to give it another try, but happens every time.  The relief is good, but not worth the vomiting.

Vasomotor Rhinitis	jlb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	35-44	12/22/2009 2:54:08 AM	I started using this medication on a Wednesday for a continuous sinus infection that just won't go away.  Once I started using this I started getting a sore throat &amp; my stomach has been very upset &amp; hurting.  On the Friday after starting this I passed out while driving on an interstate &amp; went off the road.  When I was evaluated by EMT's my blood pressure was very high &amp; my blood sugar was extremely low.  After all this I'm still not feeling well sinus wise, not worth it.

Other	jdwenink, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	1	Male	65-74	9/9/2009 5:31:13 PM	Unfortunately within three days of beginning its use, I developed many of the side effects. The left side of my head began to ache due to extreme sinus pressure; the cough that had been primarily in my throat, dropped into my chest; and I had nose bleeding.It has taken an additional three days since I discontinued its use to get back to a somewhat normal feeling. I still have the cough, but the severe pressure has gone and my nose is no longer bleeding.This is the first drug for which I have ever developed an alergy, and it won't happen again.

The product works, but the side effects are too severe. Extreme heartburn / acid reflux and hypertension followed by arrhythmia. Oh, and it tastes bad too.  Had to stop and revert back to Nasacort.
Other	LMMB3420 (Patient) 	2	4	2			9/2/2009 12:50:26 PM	I was given this medication after having a sinus infection.  I think I still had the infection but my doctor gave me this medication.  It was easy to use but it made the congestion thick and the infection came back even worse.  I did not like the taste either but one can adjust if necessary.  I don't like antihistimines at all.

Astepro worked great the first night, but when I used it again in the morning, it made my nose run all day long.  I tried again the next evening.  It works at night, but during the day, I sneeze, my eyes run and I have to blow my nose every 5 minutes. Too bad, because it did loosen the mucus and my throat felt much better in the morning.  I am calling my doctor to get something else.

After 2 days of this medication I could breathe and swallow much easier, and the dark circles under my eyes from allergies has also greatly improved. The only down fall I have had is that it leaves a very nasty taste in my mouth and it does make me quite sleepy.
