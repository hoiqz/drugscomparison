Other	sorry, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	2/8/2011 1:36:14 PM	I totally agree with all the persons that posted reviews about this. I went with a light migraine and most concern about an episode of stroke. I didn't ask them to treat me for migraine. However, they decided they will give me a cocktail bia ivy of compazine, Dilaudid and Toradol. OMG!! As soon as that medicine entered my body I started to fill the same feeling described by the others. I felt like I wanted ti rip off the ivy and wanted to run away, came home it was even worse. Came back to the ER and the doctor that it was a side effect to Compazine and go home and take Bendryl. I still don't feel myself. This is the mos horrible nightmare ever. They should take that medicine out of the market and sue the company and physician who still administer this medicine to patients knowing these terrifying effects. Are they trying to destroy peoples lives? getting people to become phicotics
Nausea and Vomiting	Junebug, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	1/22/2011 6:16:04 PM	DO NOT TAKE!! This drug is horrible! I went to the ER for non-stop vomiting(when I was out of state and needed to drive home) and they gave me Zofran, which works wonderful! However, when that wore off, I asked for more and they gave me (without telling me) Compazine. Instantly, I felt like ripping my IV out, I was crawling out of my skin, I couldn't handle the panic and anxiety that I was experiencing. The nurse came back and gave me benedryl, which only lessened the side effects. She then went on to tell me that it is a common side effect. I still felt HORRIBLE for days after that. Worst drug experience ever! Compazine should be taken off the market. 
Other	No COMPAZINE FOR ME, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	12/7/2010 6:03:51 PM	The ER gave me this medicine for migraines and it caused the worst anxiety I felt like I wanted to crawl out my skin, dizzy, lost my appetite, panic attacks and they sent me home and told me to take benadryl and sleep it off but it took me over a week for the effects to slow down. This was the worst experience in life.
Other	riverlady, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	10/25/2010 7:53:36 AM	E.R. Doctors seem to be under the impression that this can be used to treat Migraines and Muscle Tension Headaches.  They Consider it to be the main ingreadient to what they call a Migraine Coctail by I.V.  II have had it forced on me a few times just to get them to really treat the Migraine or Muscle Tension Headache.  It was horrible!  I have Anxiety without Psychosis and it made me flat out pannic, I wanted to rip out the I.V. and run.  To where I am afraid to think because there was nothing logical to it.  When I couldn't do that I had the nearly overwhelming urge to tear my skin of with my fingernails.  I wont let them ANY WHERE NEER ME with this stuff it's awfull and I've seen it do the same or friends of mine or worse make them violent. Maybe it works for a Phycosymatic Headache, with out any anxiety disposition at all, but I think this idea that it's some wonder cure by E.R. Doctors should be stopped NOW!
Nausea and Vomiting	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/4/2010 3:26:36 PM	I was given this drug in the ER with benadryll and toradol for an on going headache. Later I felt my legs twitching, I couldn't sleep and felt there was something seriously wrong with me. The next day my legs were still feeling twitchy and aching. The ER nurse practically laughed at me when I told her I was still having symptoms from this drug. It took at least 24 hours to wear off even though they said only 12. I couldn't do anything except sit around and rub my legs. I'm adding this drug to my allergy list. It will be 2nd next to Reglan.

But evidently I did. So they drugged me the IV with compozine and benedryl, then kept yelling at me to open my eyes and stay awake, took me for a ct scan and kept telling me to open my eyes, then the same tning over and over again to do chest x-ray, and I said &quot;I'm drugged&quot;!!!!!!!!!!!!! and you'll never guess, they sent me home after they knew I lived alone and told me to call a cab.  DIDN'T MEAN TO TOP YOUR STORIES FOLKS BUT THAT'S THE TRUTH.And like you it's been 3 days and I still can't walk right and one leg is swollen all the way to my toes and I amd 5'4 and 150lbs after I just lost 64lbs. I am extremely upset, can't remember where I put 3 bottles of my med's and I feel if I don't get it together I don't know what to do?!!! HELP!

It was the WORST feeling I have ever experienced. They discharged me and my husband took me home, when compazine was starting to kick in. I was at our house for two hours feeling like I was going to crawl out of my skin and my face was twitching and I couldn't calm down. I was having crazy mental thoughts and called 911 to come and take me back to the hospital. When the paramedics got to my house my heart rate was 125!! I thought I was dying. They gave me benedryl at the ER and I was better enough to go to sleep. I slept for the next 2 days. It was the worst and I feel like it should be taken off the market. I felt like I was really going to die!

They gave me an IV cocktail of compazine and bendryl. I freaked out. I signed out AMA and lied telling them it fixed my migrane. I just had to leave . I felt completely out of my mind with panic. Oh. the doc's tried to tell me it was a reaction to the bendryl. Which is laughable since I have severe allergies and have taking bendryl all my life. Compazine is worse then having a migrane or even a broken bone.

I was given this drug in the ER when I returned after an emergency apendectomy and I was feeling very nauscious with a headache. The nurse told me that this drug has the tendancy of having &quot;wicked side effects&quot; so he gave me benydril to &quot;deter&quot; these side effects. I thought I was having a heart attack!! My heart went from normal to 158 in just about a minute or two!!!! I felt like I was seriously going to die and wanted to literally crawl out of my skin. My muscles were jumping all over the place. 3 days later and I am still feeling jumpy and anxious. I cant believe that this drug is even being used. It should be outlawed!!!

Even IV benadryl to control spasms didn't help. I honestly wished someone would kill me the pain was so bad. I thought this was used for physcotic episodes in the mentally ill. I can't imagine why cause it made me go from normal mental caracter to crazy in 5 minutes flat. Why in the worls anyone would use this medication in patients is beyound me!

Uncontrolable movement, hot not cooled, cold not warmed, pain not relieved, nowhere to go in my mind to escape the intolerable discomfort. I couldn't eat, drink, sleep, think, walk, talk. I was hospitalized &amp; dispite all interventions, after 27 hrs I begged a nurse to kill me. Now, 4 daz later the horror is slowly subsiding. I now have medi-alert braclet, living will &amp; adv directive warning all to NOT give me compazine ever.

I assume they gave it to me for nausea and vomiting. I immediately could not control the muscles in my face and it started to move down my spine. I couldn't control what was happening and started to freak out. The nurse then injected me with benedryl and within 10 minutes, I was asleep. She said it was such a rare side effect. Like 5% of people in the world have it. Obviously we all came here to write about it. It was such a HORRIBLE experience, I will never forget it. Tell every doctor you are allergic to it!
Nausea and Vomiting	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	19-24	9/3/2009 3:19:01 AM	This medicine is horrible. I took this medicine the first time and felt like a crazy person. I was to the point of feeling suicidal and fearing if I didnt have something to counter act it that I might end up hurting myself or someone else. I had very violent thoughts while on this medicine. After my first experience with this drug I swore I would never take it again. Well last week I was in the hospital and not thinking recieved another dose of this. Within minutes I felt horrible. I was sweating and my heart was racing. I felt like I wanted to jump out of the window. When I called the nurse in tears she metioned this drug is not used much anymore and the doctor on call was shocked that I had recieved it. I was given a 2mg shot of Ativan to counter act the side effects and slept for about 13 hours. When I woke up I still felt very panicky. This medicine is horrible and patients need to be told about the side effects before recieving the injection.

I was coming out of my skin, I could not control my movements. I was kicking and jerking uncontrolably.. They gave me benadryl 3 X's and ativan 2 x's. Then I passed out.

I had the feeling that someone was after me and I thought they were trying to kill me. It was not until after they administered Benadryl that the effects would wear off. I would recommend that the mfg remove this drug or at least print the severe side effects. I would NEVER take this drug AGAIN!

I was also given this medicine via IV for a migraine and felt terrible. Like I needed to run. The doctor gave me ativan to calm me and morphine to dull the pain, I was finally able to get to sleep, but its been 24 hours and I still feel the side effects. I didn't have any drug allergies prior to this episode, but the doctor recommended I put this on the list. I'm a little alarmed that the manufacturer says that this is a &quot;rare&quot; side effect, but so many have had the same reaction I had.

Other		3	1	1			1/6/2008 11:36:48 AM	I was given this drug through an IV to &quot;break up&quot; a bad migraine. The migraine eventually subsided, though it has since returned. The biggest problem was the immediate feeling of wanting to rip off my skin after being administered the drug. I would go from hot to cold and back again, I couldn't sit still, and I was literally freaking out. The doctor offered nothing to counteract the effects, so I ultimately came home and Googled &quot;Compazine,&quot; took an Ativan and some Benadryl, and slept it off. I still feel fuzzy this morning, but not nearly as bad as last night.

Within an hour of injection through an IV, he suffered severe muscle twitches such as those associated with an epileptic episode.  He could not control his head movements as his head would severely toss to the right and rear, completely stretching his neck.  An injection of Benadryl relieved the symptoms within 10 minutes of injection. I was informed that this does happen but in rare cases.
