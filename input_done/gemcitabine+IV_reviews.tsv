However the red blood count fell so low that I was only able to get a treatment every other week. Felt pretty good but very tired and unable to really complete anything I wanted to do, I did not have any problem falling asleep in the chair watching tv or reading.

Other	js2031, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	25-34	12/9/2008 2:11:36 PM	I am on my fifth cycle of this drug, along with docetaxel, to try and prevent recurrent uterine leiomyosarcoma after surgery. To me, the gemcitabine is very  easy to take compared to the docetaxel (which is a relative nightmare of side effects). The only side effect I see with the gemcitabine is lowered blood counts.
Cancer of the Ovary	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	8/5/2008 7:04:46 PM	I have recurrent ovarian cancer with disease in 5 regions of lymph nodes.  The only side effect I had was low red/white cell counts and low platelets.  Gemcitabine/Carboplatin worked extremely well for about 4 months (CA125 from 465 to 20, one area of cancer on PET/CT gone, all others shrunk), but then it just stopped having an effect.  CA125 is rising again and I'm starting on a different drug.
