IT WAS THE ONLY TO HELP ME SLEEP THEN AND I HAVE BEEN ON IT FOR 9 YEARS SINCE HEART SURGERY IN THE YEAR 2000. IT STILL WORKS GREAT AND NO FEELING TO TAKE MORE THAN I STARTED WITH. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Seconal X, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/25/2009 7:59:34 PM	This is the best sleep aid of all time! Secobarbital is a &quot;retro&quot; drug that's been around since the 1940's. It's rarly scripted these days because it has a long history of addiction and overdose, but if used correctly Seconal is safe. I'm really lucky to get this med and it works wonders at putting me asleep. I take it at least 5 hours after eating so it will work better and faster. The only downside is that it can make you sleepy during the day and sometimes made my speach slurry.
