Thanks so much.  Sleepingin Seattle!

I have been taking this for 3 month.  I have to take this at night because it make me extra tired.  I have also noticed headaches and swooshing sounds behind my ears.
High Blood Pressure	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	2	3	Male	35-44	1/22/2012 1:19:31 PM	I'm always tired, I've had constant swelling in my ankles and legs.  My gums have been swollen for a while just had a new dentist tell me the other day it's from this drug.  My Doctor has tried many other drugs this was the first one to effectively work on my BP.  Going to see if there's something else.  No side effects to my love life as I've seen other people say btw. ;)

This med lowers my bp but recently it just does not help at all. The las reading was 160/91 , the side effects are just terrible, the problem is that I am overseas and wont be back until the end of the mounth. Wen I was given this med I did not get any diuretic wich is what a doctor here asked me . Does anyone knows if a diuretic has to be taken with Nefidical? Does anyone experienced any of this side efects?
High Blood Pressure	annabanana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Female	25-34	3/29/2011 11:35:56 AM	30mg dose works decently to lower pressures with minimal dizzyness. When I went up to the 60mg I felt like my head was floating above my body and I couldn;t take care of my kids. Back down to the 30 now with a strict diet and exercise routine and my numbers are doing better.
Other	Gary, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	1/20/2011 10:55:40 AM	Raynauds: With a 30mg dose, it has made my Raynaud's less difficult this winter. Before the med, my fingers would go white with any chill (could be 50 degrees out) and wouldn't come back easily without exposing fingers to warm water or car heater vent for several minutes. My fingers still get cold, but stay red longer (they hurt) and if they do go white and numb, I can get them back to red more easily.

Also has caused a very brown blotching of skin from mid calf down to the feet.

It is ruining my sex life. It might keep my blood pressure low, but my quality of life is even lower.

I can't get enough sleep.  At work, the flourescent light makes the dizziness even worse.  I've been taking the medication for approximately 60 days.
Other	wintercold, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	4	Female	25-34	3/9/2009 10:19:52 PM	This was prescribed to me to treat both hypertension and raynauds.  On the 60mg level I went from having an attack of raynaud's every day all winter to maybe once or twice during the season and extremely mild at that.  Because of the hypertension they raised the dose to 90mg, the 60mg made me feel tired, 90 made the tiredness worse and I get the ankle swelling if I don't exercise/keep hydrated and horrible constipation if I don't keep up on the fiber (never had a problem with that before), on the rare occassion I miss a dose by more than 5 hours get mild chest discomfort (also experienced with each dosage change- disconcerting, nothing major and it went away within a week or two).  The 90mg dose made no difference on the blood pressure, so talked the doctor into putting me back on the 60mg (most likely, they are going to get me on two blood pressure meds - not looking forward to it).  Overall, it works great on the Raynauds.  BP went from 170/110 to somewhere between 150/90 &amp; 130/80 and staying steady in that range.

High Blood Pressure	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	19-24	1/25/2008 10:43:21 PM	Good news is that Nifedical has lowered my blood pressure but my side effects are really a pain. After 2 weeks of taking the medication I have experienced gas and bloating 24/7 for 3 months now as well as sexual problems. I can no longer get wet in my vagina. But if I have to choose a wet vagina and no gas over lowering my blood pressure I would surely choose to lower my blood pressure.
