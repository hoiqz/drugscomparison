Difficulty Falling Asleep	Eugene the cate, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/19/2012 2:17:45 PM	I have tried (and liked) Lunesta.  Insurance made me try something different.  I was scared of Ambien so I chose to try Sonata and have been very pleased with the results.  It makes me tired so I can sleep.  I get up feeling great.  No memory problem with this like I had with Lunesta.  I have no ill side effects from it.  I was apprehensive at first to try it but once I did I was very glad I did.  It's cheaper and doesn't leave a funny taste in my mouth like Lunesta.

When taken at 3 a.m. I have found they work perfectly.  I go back to sleep and wake up at 6:00 on cue.  I don't use every night because I'm afraid of becoming addicted.  I use them maybe once a week or less.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Kitnb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	35-44	1/11/2012 11:06:28 PM	When I first tried Sonata, it took 6 hours to work. I do have delayed sleep phase syndrome. So, maybe thats why. It gave me heart palpitations, nightmares, for the few hours it worked for. I tried it again,&amp; again &amp; did not do&#241;a thing for me, even when I doubled the dose

I was later put on Ambien which worked better but I started hallucinating and having memory loss. I now take Trazadone and it's great so far.

Then unable to go back to sleep.  Next day had &quot;drug hangover&quot;...nauseated, headache and felt miserable all day.  Everyone's system is so different...what works for one doesn't work for someone else.  If it works for you...you are fortunate.
Difficulty Falling Asleep	nn562, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	10/6/2011 2:41:41 AM	I would have gotten more sleep, had I popped a couple of Benadryl. I was on Ambien for 2 years and when I realized that it was only working as long as I kept taking it, I decided to get off of it. It took me a year to get back to my normal &quot;non sleeping&quot; habits. At this point I saw a new doctor whom I prefaced that I was not interested in Ambien or anything of that sort, but simply something milder which would put me to sleep. This is the first thing he has given me and it DOES NOT WORK! Truthfully I can take 125mg of benadryl and sleep better. This is definitely a drug that needs to be researched more in sleep studies.

Dr. prescribed Sonata, insurance paid for generic Zalplon, which works great for me. It even worked when traveling to East coast from California. The jet lag used to kill me, I'd be awake all night for the first 2 nights. I couldn't be happier and I'm definately drinking less!

No side effects and I feel so rested. No more crankiness or falling asleep. I just wonder if it's ok to be taking it for so long.

Unfortunatly the drug is not approved for long time use. I used it for 3 wks off and on. My dr wouldn't give me anymore so i spent the next several weeks NOT sleeping at all. I liked the deep sleep it put me in, I didn't wake up in a fog. The only thing I didn't like was i knew exactly when the pill wore off....because I woke up immediately. Still only slept about 6 hrs, but it was a deep restfull sleep. I don't think i have ever slept all night without waking up. My hubby does it all the time...i know this cause I watch him sleep...ARGH!!
Difficulty Falling Asleep	Pat, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	55-64	12/19/2010 6:24:17 AM	When I take 1-2 5mg of generic Zaleplon, I fall asleep quickly and stay asleep the remainder of the night. However I take several other prescritions at bedtime (for RLS, muscle cramps, chronic pain, anxiety) which may &quot;enhance&quot; the stay asleep effectiveness of this medication. I have found though that if I have to get up and stay up with less than 3-4 hours sleep post Zaleplon I am sometimes unsteady on my feet bumping into furniture or wall, experience mild confusion and exhibit nonsensical speech patterns (like inserting unrelated words into sentences or giving totally unrelated answers to questions, etc.) This atypical behavior lasts from just a few minutes to maybe an hour, decreasing over the time period. Therefore if I know I can only stay in bed for less than 4 hours I do not take the Zaleplon, which of course usually results in another sleepless night because I can't fall asleep - its a catch 22. BUT hey, when I CAN take the Zaleplon, I feel great the next day because I got a good night's sleep!!! Another plus, Zaleplon is very affordable.

Took this drug last night, fell asleep quickly and stayed asleep. Amazing. I have been on everything and nothing worked this well - most things dont work at all and literally went crazy on ambien and refuse to ever take it again. I highly recommend sonata. Hope it keeps working.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	rosealee, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	7/17/2010 7:45:24 PM	I had a personality change after taking Sonata; I finally could stop trying to hide how cranky I always felt from lack of sleep. We tried a few other sleep aids, even tried Lorazapam which I might have well been taking candy considering the lack of effect from that. Due to an underlying condition I have used Sonata for about 7 years. I had to take 2 each night. Last month, my insurance will no longer approve 2 saying that the drug company recommends only 1. I have been miserable. Not withdrawal, just not sleeping. Does anyone know of something close to Sonata? I don't want to take Ambien or Lunesta. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	SFG, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	65-74	5/6/2010 4:32:33 PM	It works.I have little trouble falling asleep.  In fact, due to insufficient sleep I have trouble staying awake.  Unfortunately, after two to three hours of sleep, I wake up and can't sleep again.  So my doctor prescribed Sonata directing me to take it when I wake up (usually between midnight and 2 AM).  He recommended not using the generic Zaleplon, however I could not find the brand name locally and so got a generic.I have tried Lunesta and Ambien.  Lenesta didn't work at all and Ambien gave me a hangover.My question now is what do I do now that I'm running out of the seven pills I was prescribed.  Apparently this drug is not recommended for long term treatment.I haven't noticed any side effects
Difficulty Falling Asleep	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	5/1/2010 11:20:36 AM	I typically take Seroquel 25 mg for sleep, but lately it's been not as effective so my Therapist switched me to Sonota. That pill was horrible and I will never take it again. The Pharmacist told me it is fast acting and has the same effect as Ambien. Well that's not true. I took it at 11pm, got a sudden headache and tossed and turned until 2am (I was drowsy) then finally took a Seroquel at 2am and was able to fall asleep. I will stick with my Seroquel thanks. This stuff is cheap, but still..don't waste your money. 
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	poohbahcj, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		4/7/2010 4:01:52 PM	I take zaleplon (the generic form of Sonata) when I wake up in the middle of the night after sleeping only 4-5 hours.  I am wide awake at this time and find that if I do nothing, I can't get back to sleep for at least another 2 hours.  Since this medication is effective for only a few hours, I take a pill.  It works quickly (10-20 minutes) and I sleep for another 3-4 hours which does give me a nice full night's sleep.  Because of its short-term effectiveness, I awake without any feeling of grogginess.  I have been using this medication for years now with absolutely no side effects.

AND it worked for full night for me.  However, I was just given &quot;generic&quot; Sonato.  Slept good - more of hangover effect early morning.  But the worst was having a full day of Extremely negative thoughts - tears all day long - and insides jittering until I thought I'd die.  I will not take another pill
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	sleepless, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	65-74	1/2/2010 7:17:54 PM	This drug was prescribed to help me fall asleep sooner and stay asleep longer.  Unfortunately, it has done neither.  In fact, I get less sleep taking Sonata than if I take nothing at all.  So, I stopped taking it altogether.

With this I take it just when I need it.  If I wake at 4 AM and can't go back to sleep I can take it too and wake up fine by 7 AM.  For me it's perfect. Other things I took were too strong or had side effects.

It will quickly work to make you loopy and relaxed.  Not necessarily sleepy though.  And loss of memory is definitely something to watch out for.  Don't answer your phone after taking Sonanta!

It's amazing after being on Ambien so long with next day hangovers, waking up not drowsy and without needing a nap to get through the day. Sonata has left me non-drowsy during the day for the first time in a long long time.

So my doctor first gave me Ambien.. and that was a nightmare! It was trippy and never again. Once I switched to this one it was no problem. I dont wake up with a hangover and do not see weird things.this gets out of your system fast too. I take mine at 10 pm before bed... and can wake up rested @ 6:30 am.With Ambien it was an all day hangover. I didnt like that.Before i was taking Zanax to sleep.. and that can be addicting.. So i wanted to try somthing else. I highly recommend Sonata... i am on the generic.. it works fine!

I took Dexadrine during day for ADHD and Sonata at night to counter-act the affects of the ADHD meds.  Recently stopped ADHD meds and occasionally need the Sonata to help fall asleep.  I take 20mg as needed and it works great on those few occasions I need them.  Doesn't help me stay asleep, but that was never an issue with me.  Once I'm asleep, I usually stay asleep the whole night.  On occasion I wake up and can't fall back asleep.  Ambien made me have very vivid strange dreams and I didn't like it at all.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	SG24, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	10/10/2008 1:34:59 AM	I have had serious problems falling asleep for over a year. I tried many sleeping pills to help me but none were very effective and had side effects from Lunesta. The best thing about Sonata is that it metabolizes in about an hour or two, so you will have no effects in the morning. I was prescribed this by a sleep doctor, he told me it is mainly used for people that wake up during the night and cant go back to sleep. It is non-habit forming, I only take it when I need it.

I still had some trouble falling asleep but by one hour instead of laying awake 4 hours without an aide. Didn't wake up groggy. Actually woke up around 8am (normally sleep till noon as I work very late) but after the first few weeks wasn't as effective. Slept till noon again.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	13-18 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	13-18	9/5/2008 6:23:28 PM	I had horrible side effects from this.  I changed my behaviour when I was on this, making me very aggressive, and agitated.  I also hallucinated when I took it.  It also never really worked on putting me to sleep, which was always my main problem, but it did keep me asleep once I took it, which was my second problem although not as severe.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	mama needs sleep, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	7/25/2008 7:19:15 AM	I recently posted this drug with 4 stars. After using a few days, it stopped working. My Dr. doesnt recommend taking 20 mg. 10 mg puts me to sleep for only 2 hours, if I take another one, I get 3-4 more. 5 or 6 hours sleep is not enough for me as I have 2 little boys to take care of. Being a cranky Mom is not a good thing. May have to call Dr. on Monday to try Lunesta again. Reading a book by Deepak Chopra called &quot;Restful Sleep&quot;. Very interesting. You may be able to get it on Ebay as its a bit old, or get his newer versions anywhere.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	Milo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Male	45-54	7/24/2008 9:41:27 PM	Sonata was the first of the new sleep medications I was prescribed. It didn't help me at all. Fortunately my (former) doctor was open to trying different medicines in an attempt to find something that worked. No side effects that I can recall.
Chronic Trouble Sleeping	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	7/22/2008 7:22:47 AM	Developed insomnia 5 months ago. Tried Lunesta=groggy, Lorazepam (the best), and Sonata. My trouble is the initial falling asleep. Dr. wants me off Lorazepam as it is addicting and she worries about tolerance...I am down to 1 a day now...its an anti-anxiety pill. I have no anxiety until I hit the bed. Sonata worked within 30 minutes, the first few times I took it. Last night, after two hours of not working, I took another one. That worked. I may have to call to increase the dose. Its 10 mg now. I'm 42 and have no real reasons for the insomnia (no depression or daytime anxiety)

I liked it but the cost was I high so I changed to Restoril Big mistake. Restoril does nothing to put me to sleep its like taking candy. Sonata worked however lately it does not work as fast as before. I think it is because I have had a tragdey in my life. However I plan to go back to Sonata in spite of the cost.

I took it at 10 and never went to sleep until 5AM and then had horrible nightmares. I was not able to move my right arm and little for the left. A walking zombie the next day and nauseated.

Other	MerryJoe, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	55-64	2/21/2008 4:06:48 PM	This is the ONLY sleep aid that works for me without side effects.  It helps me fall asleep quickly, and because it only stays in the body 4 hours it never leaves me with a morning hangover, which is what I hated about the 8-hour &quot;full night's sleep&quot; Rx sleep aids. For those who need occasional help falling asleep but who don't necessarily have 8 or more hours to lay in bed and who don't want to feel groggy in the morning, I highly recommend Sonata.

Chronic Trouble Sleeping	wadoz,  Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male		12/16/2007 2:38:00 PM	I took sonata for aprox.two years It has to be the best insomnia drug I have ever used. I have been off of sonata for aprox. 1- 1 1/2. My insurance started to renew it. I never experianced any withdrawal symptoms.  since then I have been prescribed Lunesta, Ambiem cr, restoril...,none of these have helped much infact they tend to screwup  my sleep patterns. With the sonata I was able to get to sleep fast and was up and ready to go by 5 or 6 am. Every day. Now if I sleep at all, i tend to sleep till 10-noon. which is unacceptable. Nuff said.Wadoz

It also doesn't affect my sleep when I don't take it.
