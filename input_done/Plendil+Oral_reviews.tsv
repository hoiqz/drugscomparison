High Blood Pressure	Larry H , 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/8/2011 1:18:08 AM	I have been struggling with high blood pressure for about 3 years and have been prescribed several medications. Most did not work or had side effects that I could not tolerate. The Felodipine works great. I have read reviews that some brands are not effective.I get the ones marked MP 773 from Wal Mart. And am very satisfied. BP is great and have had no side effects. Feel better than I have in 3 yrs. I am also Diabetic and this drug does not seem to raise my glucose levels.

High Blood Pressure	Judy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	1	Female	55-64	11/19/2009 2:57:47 PM	I have had severe upper arm and shoulder pain bilaterally.  This is with the generic medication felodipine.  I had to stop it, due to the pain. I also had upper right quadrant pain that went around to my kidney area. After stopping the medication for 2 days, my pain is gone.  I have a hard time with generic medications, possibly due to the fillers they put in them. Not really sure.

High Blood Pressure	genricblues, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	3	4	Female	45-54	9/11/2009 1:33:57 PM	I was taking the name brand and it worked fine for me.  Would get a slight headache if I was without my medsfor than 3 days.  Tried the genric by Ranbx (light orange) from Jewel/Osco.  Blood pressure went way up and I did not even know it until I when to the doctor for checkup.  Could no find anything about the mfg Rbnx on the web.  Switched over to Walgreen brand by Mylan (blue).  My arm and leg started hurting after the first dosage. Going back to the name brand and I don't care how much it cost me.

High Blood Pressure	cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	45-54	5/21/2009 1:04:56 PM	Plendil is now only available as generic (Felodipine) the new version is casuing me the same side effects I got from Procardia.Pain in joints/tendons with redness and swelling at site of pain. I have been on plendil for more than 10 years with the newest vesion causing extreme problems inless than a 6 week timeline of change toFelodipine ER from new manufacturer. Now that it is generic it is very problematic as was Procardia in the generic form. I was test for arthritis and lyme desease....it is the side effects of meds not other health issue. I am young, lsightly over wieght which caused original hypertension problem 20 years ago...should have just went on a diet instead of taking Tenormin which made me gain wieght and caused angina.I have great blood profiles, it is not a cholesteral problem in my case, stress test fine, I am currently taking lisinopril 5 mg and the new Felodipine 5mg, Beware old Plendil user...the generic version is not without bad side effects which I can't live with, not a 51! They tried to tell me when I was younger I was out of shape...that was BS. I feel sorry for nay senior who has taken these generics...because your pain will be past over as getting older, they tried it with me...I didn't stand for it..I hope htis messages helps someone.

NOt only did it not have any effect on lowering my BP, it causes an intense headache within an hour of taking it. For three weeks I stuck it out waiting for the adjustment period, but no luck.
