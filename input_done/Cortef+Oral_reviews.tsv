Addison's Disease	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	2/5/2010 11:52:12 AM	I have been on this drug for a little over two years. My doctor recently had to suddenly stop practicing due to an accident he suffered. This resulted in me no longer having a perscription for this drug so I ran out. The three weeks I was without this drug proved to me how effective it is for me. I could barely function without this drug. The constant hunger is a small price for the energy and well being from taking the drug.

Taking it causes pitting edema both legs, including up to thighs, bouts of extreme hunger, so have to watch calories and fat intake, however, I have gained 30 pounds in 4 months. I wish I could live without taking this, but with little to no adrenal gland function (from autoimmune disorder) my quality of life is poor either way.

Addison's Disease	lamb, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	9/29/2008 4:25:51 AM	I first started taking this medicine when I was diagonosed with addison's disease back in 2005, depending on your dosage you could gain ALOT of weight.. It boostes your energy, makes you feel absolutley great, just it makes you gain alot of weight, because you always feel hungry.. I am lucky enough only to be on 10 mg in the morning and 10 mg and in the evenings, If I choose to skip my doze or forget it at home, when I am at work, I feel like I am a walking zomby, I get really tired.. I just dont feel good.
