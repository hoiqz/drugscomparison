Underactive Thyroid	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/19/2012 6:01:26 PM	I was on Levoxyl for my underactive Thyroid until my endocrinologist change my medication from Levoxil to Armour. At first I thought I was turning crazy because i was all confused and lost all the time. It tremendously affect my school, and job performance because i was not able to concentrate. I don't even know what i was reading or what the professor was talking about. I have frecuents blockouts, got lost while driving and run off red lights. I told my regular doctor about it and he sent me to another endocrinology because obviously my medicine was ruining my life by interfering with my job and school performance.PLUS I have gained 16 punds!!! I am waiting for my appoinment which is on the 26 of July 2012. I hope they can help me because i am acting like a robot. I can't think i can't concentrate and I believe my life is in danger.I am tired and sleeping all the time I just want to eat and sleep. I feel that I have never have enough sleep or rest. I HATE ARMOUR AND THE DOCTOR WHO PRESCRIBE THE MEDICATION!!!!! I am now a fat lady thanks to ARMOUR

Enlarged Thyroid Gland	Cynthia, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/9/2012 1:24:24 PM	I've been taking Forest Armour Thyroid for three years gradually increasing and have been on 205 mg for 9 months.  I've felt much better approaching normal energy levels and even mental function.  However, a new prescriptin has just begun.  I don't know who the manufacturer is yet and I took it for the first time last night with the result including sleep deficit.  I had an allergic reaction to something although it's not yet determined to be from this med.  I usually don't have food allergies or sensitivities but I did eat some packaged food so that's a possible suspect.  I had no tachycardia or other symptom of overdose from Armour that I had when trying to increase the dosage the correct amount months ago. I did have a mental response I would refer to as overreacting which was unfounded.

The synthetics have always made me ADHD to high extremes. I become almost unable to function. My OB was worried about my extreme mood change. At first Armour seemed to be better, but looking back I see the changes were more sutle. After a period of build up I found my self severely depressed. I have fought this for months now. I do have a history of depression, but I also was an abused child so with that comes some sadness.  I have been completely off Armour for 1 week now and am smiling and laughing again.  If this was post pregnancy depression, it would not have gone away so quickly. I attribute it to the Armour. I did go off for a week last month , because I forgot to take it in my depression, and the cloud lifted. Then I got back on track and had signs of severe depression again with alarming thoughts.  Those thoughts don't just disappear in a week. I believe it is a side effect. In the extensive list of side effects it does list severe mood changes.  Be careful!  Not everyone is effected by drugs the same. 
Underactive Thyroid	Nikkfit, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	5/31/2012 9:38:49 AM	I had been taking Synthroid @ 175 mcg and 200 mcg alternating, in addition to Liothyronine twice daily.  A few weeks ago, my doctor switched me to Armour @ 90 mg once daily.  Not only is it much easier to remember to take, it's working for me so much better than the synthetic stuff has been.  I wish I had asked for this change years ago!  If you're worn out by the thyroid roller coaster, you might consider switching.  It's made a big difference for me!

When I started on Armour I felt much better. Sadly endocrinologists mostly want to prescribe only the synthetic stuff.

Serious Decrease in Thyroid Function	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	5/1/2012 10:25:42 AM	I had RAI in 2009 for Grave's Disease. My TSH 3months after the RAI was 25. The doctor started me on 25mcg of generic synthroid, and thereafter increased the dosage to 150mcg over several months. For 3 years I felt absolutely horrible with always being cold, muscle cramps, bone aches, puffy eyelids, edema, severe constipation, fatigue, brain fog, 20lb weight gain, and the MD was adamant my complaints were not related to thyroid b/c my TSH was &quot;normal&quot;. He even went so far as to diagnose me with clinical depression and refer me to counseling. I sought the opinion of an integrative physician. He reviewed my &quot;normal&quot; labs and added Armour thyroid to my synthroid. Within a month I felt fantastic, and had lost 8 lbs. Armour Thyroid has restored my quality of life!

My doctor doubled the dose to 120 mg/day.  In the past, I occasionally noticed some small pimples in the area between my lower lip and chin but after two weeks on the higher dose, I started &quot;blooming&quot; all over my face and neck -- I looked like I was suffering from a case of measles or severe acne. My doctor advised me to immediately stop the Armour.  I have read a number if reports of people who are experiencing the same or similar  allergic reaction to the changed formula now being applied to the manufacture of Armour Thyroid.

TERRIBLE! I'd rather take nothing at all! I then started taking compounded Armour Thyroid and it worked good but was $44 a month. I decided to try Armour again after hearing it was available once more but reformulated.I feel GREAT! My energy is back, depression and other symptoms are mostly or totally gone. I am very happy with the results and it's only $4 a month from Walmart! Hoping it doesn't get back ordered anymore! VERY happy to feel normal again!!!

They neverFinaly found doctor to prescribe Armour...Thank God.I have a life again. No previous doctor would ever even address the symptoms I complained about for 20 years. It was like they knew, but could care less to help and change it. Armour thyroid works. My body temperature has increased after 4 months from 96.2 to 97.2. My fatigue after 4 months has vanished. I have energy to start exercising again, so maybe that will be the next be change.

I did research and switched to Armour. I told my doctor I wanted to take it, and that I did research, and why I wanted to take it. She listened to me and said why not. I have been on it now for over a year and just love it. My hair loss isn't so much, side effects are much less. My thinking is much clearer. I love it and would't change for anything.... Give it a try, its the least you can do for yourself...

Physically- oxygen starved, tightness in chest, winded, lethargic, no stamina and alas, serious weight gain. Mentally- brain fog, compromised short term memory, etc. Emotionally- moody, cry at the drop of a hat. I was a mess. My bloodwork showed my TSH, Free T4 and T3 all in the normal range. Although my T3 was 92 in a 87-180 range. Very low. I had read great things about Armour and pleaded with my doc to prescribe it. Within 3 days of taking Armour, I already started seeing positive changes. I have been on it exactly 1 month and I feel fantastic!!! Better than I have in years. I am hiking, biking, running up and down stairs, etc. Brain fog has lifted and mentally I have returned to normal. Emotionally I am solid. I feel like a new person. I can't say enough good things about this drug. Life is beautiful again!!!

Then about 18 months ago I could no longer get it. My DR. switched me to synthroid. It took a good 2 months before the synthroid kicked in. During that time I was extremely tired and listless. I never felt quite as good as I did on the Armour thyroid. Also, my shape started to change to more of an &quot;apple&quot;. Just this week I found out that my pharmacy now has the Armour thyroid. I took my first does this morning. I hope it's easier to switch back than it was to switch to synthroid.

Underactive Thyroid	HillCountryGal, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	45-54	3/28/2011 8:52:42 PM	I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid in 1995 and put on Synthroid. On it I suffered from mental fogginess, weight gain and sluggishness. I researched Armour Thyroid and convinced my doctor to put me on it.  I feel so much better on Armour and my T3 and T4 levels have remained in the normal range.  I have not had to adjust the dosage at all. I used to have to cut my pill in half and take one in the am and one in the pm, but then they started making it in smaller dosages. I never had any problem receiving Armour Thyroid last year through my mail order pharmacy, but they did send me a letter stating it may be in short supply.  I hope it will continue to be available because I will not go back to any synthetic drug.

I am able to sleep better at night, I'm not as tired, and I'm not as irritable.  However, I did notice discoloratio under my eyes(red)like I had a rash, this lasted for a couple of days..I contributed it to allergies because it started as being puffy upon waking up, next day noticed the reddish tint.  I will discuss with my doctor and follow up with an update.  Overall I am pleased with this medication, family can now see a big difference in me...My only concern is being told this is a life long thing?????Why will I have to be on this for the rest of my life???

I had a complete thyroidectomy in 2008.  My last two labs however have shown my tsh level at 11 and then even higher at 16. I don't know why, because each time my dr. has raise the dose. Now I am at 2 grains 1x daily.  Hopefully it will be better on my next labs.  It is hard for me to remember to take it every morning at the same time and on an empty stomach.  I read that people have been having a hard time finding it, and I get it compounded at a pharmacy in Mason City, IA.  They may ship to others, I am not sure, so here is there phone number.  1-641-422-9333 Houck Pharmacy 101 South Monroe Mason City, Ia 50401.  Hope this helps.
Other	KAM, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	55-64	2/21/2011 12:26:19 AM	I had a partial thyroidectomy at age 15 due to Benign tumors from Hyperactivity.  No replacemrnt was recommended since I had been hyperactive.  I had my Thyroid screened annually at my PAP through an HMO for years, and was told , all is normal.  After complainung of a wide range of symptoms for years and asking &quot;do you think it could be my thyroid?&quot;  I went outside the HMO to a an Endocrinologist and was told that my levels were all within normal range.  However my symptoms (now 27 yrs later) were so severe that the MD agreed to put me on a low dose of Synthroid, the change was instant, no heart flutters no low blood pressure, no fainting no joint pain, dry skin,etc. The dosage was always altered and never quite right.many of the symptoms continued for years until I read &quot;THE THYROID SOLUTION&quot; and found out about T4, T3 Therapy.  My Endocrinologist was not open to Armour Thyroid, so I found an MD who was!! After 5 yrs on Synthroid, with no relief in sight, I finally felt NORMAL again. They do not make my perfect dose but my doctor, after 3 yrs agreed to let me experiment and my dose is 90g one day and 105g the next(I cut the pills). I have achieved a perfect equilibrium and perfect test results for the first time in 32 yrs!!! It was not always easy to get the Armour and had to switch back to Levothyroxine and T3 which was better than nothing and then switched to Nature-Throid, which was disasterous (TSH over 8) and finally back to Armour Within the last week, and getting back to &quot;normal&quot;

I'm disappointed that it is not the same.  I'm living in thyroid hell.  My face looks like a volcanic explosion.  Heart irregularities, palpitations, shortness of breath, light-headed &amp; more.  My doctor is not good when it comes to thyroid &amp; it's hard to find one who is well-versed in this complex disease.  Any suggestions?

I have never done well on the synthetics, esp. Synthroid.  I found a Dr. that would prescribe Armour thyroid.  It is still available in the USA from any compounding pharmacy.  Forest Labs is no longer making the pills, but the powder is available to pharmacists, who put the dosage amts in capsules.

I do not have the hair loss that I had when I was on the synthic (spelled) stuff. I have not felt this great in years. I was on the other meds for about 8 1/2 yrs. I started Armour Thyroid in August 2010. I can not believe the change that it has made in me. I do not have the extra dark hair growth like I had before. It just seem to have gone away. I just can not say enough great things about Armour.

Underactive Thyroid	Cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	6/28/2010 9:02:17 PM	I have been on and off of Armour over the last 3 years. Westhroid was difficult to find. I had to switch to compounded version when the supply of Armour was depleted and recently (3 months switched back to the new formula of Armour. I have had a conversion issue t4 to t3.I have experienced symptoms of taking too much thyroid as well as the debilitating symptoms of hypothyroidism since diagnosed in 1988. I did well taking 2 gr 60 mg am and 2 gr 60 mg pm of Armour with mild symptoms. Yet my doc lowered the dosage to 2 gr in the am and 1 gr in the pm.  I started feeling symptoms within 3 day(severe joint pains, fatigue, foggy thinking, cold hands,low pulse,low energy level, bloating,dry skin and hair. BTW when going for thyroid lab testing, wait at least 6 hours after taking your meds to get a value of the thyroid drug in your blood stream as you go thru the day. Two weeks ago, doc changed my dosage to .5 gr 2 x daily based and added 5 mcg Cytomel (t3) twice a day. Note: tsh was low, ft3 within a slight low normal range,ft4 within optimal range, a rt3 was very high normal range. This resulted in severe joint pains, fatigue, foggy thinking, dry skin and hair and body temp upon waking 96.8 to 97.3, irregular heartbeat and pulse of 35-40 bpm. my symptoms got worse and gained 5 lbs on the scale, and am puffy inspite of eating extremely clean foods, no processed foods,gluten free work out with weights 3 days a week and perform at least 4.5 hours of forced indoor cardiovascular training only raising my body temp to 98.1 living in the extreme heat of a Texas summer. I just found the consumer complaints a couple of days ago.  Apparently, I am not the only one having issues and plan to switch to another natural thyroid med or compounded. Very few are complaining likely due to feeling like crap...no energy to expend to investigate.  Why they changed the formula is beyond logic except they found cheaper binding fillers to add to their product thus increasing their profit margin.

Underactive Thyroid	research1st, 55-64 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/4/2010 11:26:19 AM	I have been on Armour for 10 yrs with great success.  All of the symptoms of low thyroid are gone and I have adequate energy and maintain a normal weight.  I researched the affect of Synthroid prior to taking a Thyroid med. and decided I will never take it.  When a Dr. encourages it I encourage him/her with knowledge that Armour is the best.  So far, my Drs give me the Armour or send me to an endrocronlogist for their opinion. So, I went to the endocronlogist and he told me Armour was a very good drug and highly recommended it. If in the future, a Dr. refuses to give me Armour than I have no alternative but find a Dr. that will prescribe it.  I always encourage people to do their research 1st and then make their decision.

He told me that it's not hard to get now. Thank God!!!
Underactive Thyroid	lorene, 75 or over Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		5/29/2010 2:58:07 PM	I am 78 years old and started Armour thyroid about 35 years ago. Previously I took Cytomel and my tests remained very low in spite of increasing the dose to the max. I tried Synthroid when the doctor said they would discontinue making Armour. The side effects were terrible. In 2008 I went back to Cytomel and was so low that the doctor said he didn't see how I even walked into his office. I finally found another pharmacist who could get Armour but only in 1 grain strength so I just take 2 but may need to increase to 3. If Armour thyroid is not available I may have to do without. I will not go back on Synthroid or the generics of it. Wonder if it will hasten my death if I don't take any thyroid medication.

Underactive Thyroid	Hudson, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	1	1	Female	35-44	5/27/2010 4:54:35 PM	This drug was prescribed due to an apparent under active thyroid. The drug did provide that extra energy needed to get through the day. However, the side effects were sleeplessness, agitation and hair loss (like Synthroid). I would not recommend unless it is absolutely necessary. 
Serious Decrease in Thyroid Function	Krispy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/22/2010 9:17:37 PM	I have had wonderful success with this drug.For whatever reason, the synthroid did notwork for me.  I went to a Specialists and she told me she rarely prescribes Armour Thyroid, because it is hard to find.  My drug plan did have it on their list and I have been taking 60 mg.  She suggested I take this at night when I get up to go to the bathroom.  That also was a great suggestion.  I can take my other medications after breakfast and no more waiting 4 hours.  This also gives the medicine for my thyroid a chance to work on my empty stomach.  I have more energy and feel much better.  I have not experienced any hair loss, but I do have brittle nails and dry skin.  She suggested I take Super Potency Biotin, 5,000mcg, (you can find it at Wal-Mart).  This supports skin, hair, and nails.  I have lost some weight and feel better so I am having good luck with this drug.  Everyone is different and I am thankful that I tried this drug.
Underactive Thyroid	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	5/18/2010 3:45:31 PM	I started out with 15 miligrams of Armour and then after one year could no longer get it at all. They switched me to 30 mg. and now can no longer get that from the manufacturer either according to my pharmacy. No one has an answer to me as to why.

Underactive Thyroid	Bear, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	45-54	4/6/2010 12:03:06 AM	I have been without the gland for 2yrs. now. In those 2 yrs I thought I was gonna go crazy, with all the side affects brain fog,weight gain,feeling sick to my stomach. All I wanted was to sleep all the time. I also became a very inscure person which I'm not.I hated being depressed all the time. I was on all mg. of synthroid that didn't work for me. I was told about the compound med. which my Dr. told me he didn't want me to take it. So I did it anyway I felted so much better. But my labs was still rock bottom. I started letting my family Dr.treat me for this.My last visit and labs he put me on armour plus the synthroid, I've only been taking it for 6 days and I feel so much better. The differance is night and day. But now reading all these comments and finding out it's hard to get I don't know what I'll do if that's true.I went to my local pharmacy(medicine shoppe) they didn't say anything about it being hard to get. Like I said only been on it for 6 days but I think it's wonderful so far.

The result of which has lead to severe hair loss. In 1 1/2 years, I have literally filled 2 large zip lock bags to bursting with the hair I have lost. I now have bald spots. Do NOT use this drug. Go to a Compounding Pharmacy and get the T3 &amp; T4 made. My thyroid is now stable, and I feel good. I hope  my hair will grow back. A dermotologist, endocrinologist, and my primary care doctor have all stated that this is from Armour, and it will take about 6 months to see if it will. They never even informed the doctors that they had this problem until they pulled the drug from the market. Upon trying to find out about this problem, I found boards with many women who experienced the exact same thing I did on this drug. Thinning hair is one thing, but severe hair loss and balding is quite another. This company needs to be reported.

When production stopped in USA, I ordered from Canada. In a time I started having swelling on my lower arm/mid arm/underarm and upper part of my breast, neck and back of hairline.After several tests mammogram,xray,ultrasound and bloodwork CBC, the only red flag was my elevated thyroid level so the strength was lowered .My symptoms continue.  I went on Synthroid and T3 recently but when I was advised that Armour is now being manufactured again in USA I asked my doctor to perscribe that to me.  Mysymptoms are still persistant - swollen andpainful.  I am going to go back on Synthroid and T3.  I seem to have a sensitivity to Armour now and/or its fillers.

I know that I do not feel as well and DO NOT have any energy. So hopefully the company that was supplying all the pharmacies with the rx will begin to bring it back.

After some research and in light of a trusted friends experience, I decided to ask my endocrinologist about it. I had no idea what I was in store for after being on Synthroid for over 17 years.Armour was the BEST thing to happen to me! It was as though a fog had lifted. I never wanted to go back to Synthroid ever again! I thanked my friend repeatedly for telling me about his wife's experience.  I LOVE ARMOUR &amp; I WANT IT TO BE AVAILABLE AT MY PHARMACY AGAIN!!!! So, FDA, PLEASE STOP MESSING WITH MY HEALTH &amp; LET ARMOUR BE AVAILABLE to the consumers who KNOW how Armour has changed my life for the better!
Underactive Thyroid	Lynn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	55-64	1/30/2010 11:20:56 PM	Like other users, I had trouble getting the Armour Thyroid as I read online that the FDA is requiring the company to prove effectiveness before allowing them to continue to make it. This has resulted in a shortage, and it is likely to continue. Get the equivalent of thyroid at a compounding pharmacy in your area. It might be a bit more expensive, but it is essentially the same. Look in the phone book or online for compounding pharmacies. One is Walgreens, at special locations, but there are privately owned ones too. They tend to be more expensive, though. Ask at CVS or other chain pharmacies if they have compounding capacities and get a new prescription sent over from your doctor. I just got 100 for $39 at Walgreen's.

I have a friend in Caribou Maine and the pharmacies back there tell her they don't even manufacture them anymore.  The company that makes this drug should look into that.

Underactive Thyroid	Lyd, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	1/1/2010 10:15:28 AM	I was just recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was given Synthroid which I had many side effects from so my doctor took me off and was skeptical about trying Armour.  I've been on Armour for approximately 3 months.  My life style hasn't changed but, for some reason my blood labs for cholesterol &amp; tryglicerides went crazy high as well as my BP.  I just had a follow up with my doctor on the 29th of December and now she increased my BP med and wants to put me on Lipitor for the elevated Cholesterol and another med for the Tryglicerides... I read that Armour is suppose to lower your Cholesterol and Try's..am I reading that wrong? Anyways, personally I feel better with Armour rather than the synthroid and have no side effects with it and my CVS Pharmacy has it in stock 30 mg is my dosage. I'm wondering if I should get a second opinion or perhaps see an endocronolgist (blood doctor).  By the way did I mention I just started menapause. Is it possible that's why my thyroids are going a little haywire? Anyone else having any of these problems or am I in my own boat?

Basically the medicine is available, but the company that puts it into pill form is perhaps not in business anymore...? Bottom line you should be able to still get it from a compound pharmacy.

My only complaint is that for the last year and increasing of late is an inability for any pharmacy I use to maintain adequate supply!  Usually I receive a dose different than what I have been prescribed (I take 180 mg/daily and I usually am given 60 mg tablets and occassionally 120 mg).  Pharmacists tell me there is difficulty obtaining this medication from the manufacturer.  This causes me great concern as I have taken generic versions of this drug in the past with disappointing results - it was incredibilly difficult to find/maintain the correct dose.
Cancer of Thyroid	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/21/2009 4:33:23 PM	Well for starters, I had thyroid cancer l8yrs ago. They removed my throid,parathyroid. In those years I was only told of Synthroid or Levothyroid as a replacement hormone. My husband came acrossan article on Armour Thyroid. During my years on thyroid meds. I was miserable on synthetic meds. I have recently started on Armour Thyroid and I cannot believe how good I feel. The only thing is I am having a hard time finding it in the Pharmacy. There seems to be a short supply of it. I hope it will be readily available in all doses very soon. You have to take your health care in your own hands these days,look and search wherever u can to find what fits your own self. Dr's think they know how u feel and do not even tell u about Armour. I asked my Dr. and was told there was not enough studies on it to show its effectiveness; Hey Dr's talk to your patients and listen to them. They will tell u what works best for them......

Had allergic reaction to the acacia filler so Endro placed me on Levoyl.  I suffered from horrilbe insomnia, anxiety, moodiness, no energy at all, headaches, took naps, no appetite, terrible brain fog, muscles and joints hurt all the time, and body felt like it was shaking all the time. Endro wouldn't put me on natural so I found naturopathic who placed me Amour (new formula) and I am doing great, feel like my old self again. I have energy, no brain fog, concentration better, sleep at night, and no longer depressed. To bad, there is a shortage right now but I've been visiting the site: Save the Natural Thyroid and they've been great at helping others find the natural until the shortage is over.

Underactive Thyroid	kg, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/1/2009 7:12:28 PM	The Armour Thyroid availability number is 866-927-3260.  The last update they give(as of 8/17/09) is that they have no idea when they will be able to produce it.  I was able to find 3 months quantity at an independent pharmacy, the big chains have not had it for a couple of months.  I would also suggest going to a compound pharmacy, they are often able to put something together.  You will still need a prescription from your doctor, and insurance probably will not cover it, but at least for me it is better than going back to synthroid. I hope this is helpful.

Over the past several months, I have had much difficulty w/a shortage of Armour thyroid in .25 or .50 strength w/several different pharmacies and am taking less than I should because of the shortage, very dangerous thing to do, but I have no choice.  I am literally going from pharmacy to pharmacy BEGGING for any pills that they may have in stock. Pharmacists are telling me it is backordered and having trouble with Armour, the manufacturing company.  Can someone please come to my aid and let me know what is going on? I live in S. Florida.  My circumstance is extrememly frightening and stressful for me.  I am about ready to call the FDA for some advice.

It hasn't worked the same for me anymore and now I'm hearing the same from many, many people who are now unhappy in the change in Armour.  I hope Forest Laboratories changes back whatever was changed to Armour over the last year.

I used Synthroid for several years and it had lost it's effectiveness on me. Every since I have used Armour Thyriod It had worked Great on me. My only problem is I'm having a hard time getting it now. I live in San Antonio Tx. and every pharmacy here is out of it. That is a Very sad thing to tell a Patient. Sincerely, Mary Sanchez Parker

I am due for a refill of my prescription (I take both 15 MG and 30 MG tablets).  My pharmacy contacted multiple other pharmacies to try to get the medication.  Every one is out.

The difference in how I felt was immediate and amazing. After being on it 8 weeks, I have lost 10 pounds, am more energetic, not cold, my skin isn't dry. I will never go back to a synthetic replacement again!

My doc said Armour better at getting rid of retaining fluid than synthetic. I have a problem converting T4 to T3.  Some synthetic throid medicine is t4 (from what I understand..I am no doctor)...I would still have problems converting it to T3.  From what I understand, the cells use T3.  Armour has T3 and T4.

Dr removed the nodule along with my right thyroid and found cancer in the thyroid that was removed.  Dr put me on Armour and still do not have my TSH levels right but have increased my dosage to 60 mg.  I'm still very tired and have increased blood pressure now.  I've been on this medication for 8 months now and am hoping that they get this figured out soon because I'm having other health conditions that are now becoming a concern and I do not want to be put on more medication.  My problem is having to wait 4 hours after taking Armour as instructed by the dr before I can take any other medications such as for pain relief, etc.  
Other	Msrac, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	3/8/2009 7:53:26 PM	Initially diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism, did the iodine treatment and eventually removal of left and part of right thyroid. Being a Breast and Lung cancer survivor due to lesions on nodule I opt'd removal-reducing chance of cancer of Thyroid. The Doc prescribed Synthroid which caused drastic weight gain - from size 6 to 12 in 1 month, fatigue-could barely make it through the day, joint pains-fingers and toes would lock, slow metabolism-BM's once every couple of days (use to have after each meal). I felt better after Chemo than I did taking Synthroid.  My Endocrinologist blamed all side effects on everything except the Synthroid.  I decided I had to take matters under control. I stopped other medications (with Dr's permission), kept track of everything I ate, cutting out many items, took weight loss shot, did the Alli diet,Cabbage soup diet, went to nutrionist. At his request took calcium/vitamin D and Magnesium to relieve joint pains which he claimed were result of Thyroid and not medicine. Nothing I did relieved any of my symptoms.  After all above failed, much research and reading messages boards such as this one,  I decided I would ask my Endocrinologist to change my prescription to Armour. If he disagreed I was ready to seek out another Dr. He agreed. That was less than a week ago.  What a difference a week makes, I have not felt this good since the whole Thyroid thing occurred.  My metabolism has picked up. WOW! I feel Great so far.  Yes, what I paid for one months supply of Synthroid is what I paid for 3 mos supply of Armour.  Become your own advocate when it comes to your health.  Nobody knows your body better than you and you don't need a degree for that.  No...is unacceptable when it comes to health.  Hope my story will be a Blessing to someone.
Underactive Thyroid	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/2/2009 12:09:34 AM	I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid about 5 years ago.  My doctor first put me on synthroid (several different dosages), but my pulse was racing at 2x normal.  He changed me to Armour and I have had no issues since.  I moved about a year ago and it took me changing doctors twice to find someone here who would prescribe it to me.  I spoke to a pharmacist who told me that some doctors don't like it because since it is a natural hormone vs. a synthetic one, it is hard to ensure that each pill has the exact dosage it is supposed to.  She also said the manufacturer has had difficulty filling orders for certain dosages, but I have not had any problems getting mine as of yet. I'm not sure why doctors are so adamant about prescribing synthroid, even when the patient describes terrible side effects. 
Underactive Thyroid	lucie13, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	2/28/2009 9:38:44 PM	I have Hashimoto's. I took synthroid for 3 years, and my levels were &quot;perfect&quot;, according to my endocrinologist. Yet I was extremely lethargic and overweight. Synthroid didn't help at all with my energy level or metabolism. I asked my endocrinologist if armour thyroid was a possibility, and he dismissed it out of hand. Apparently, they simply do not consider it effective. After seeing a complementary M.D. for a year, she finally switched me over.What a difference! I'm hungry all the time, I have enough energy to move, less depression. We still haven't gotten the dose quite right (60mg is too little, 90mg is too much). My sleep patterns have been off since I started taking it, that is my only complaint. I am pissed that I could have had better health for several years. I'm sure quite a bit more of my thyroid gland has been &quot;eaten&quot; than might have otherwise as well.

Underactive Thyroid	Matt, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	45-54	1/14/2009 7:03:41 PM	I have used three medications for my Thyroid; Synthroid, Cytomel, and Armour.  Cytomel was effective, but could not tolerate the ever-present headache it caused.  Synthroid caused moderate to severe evening stomach upset including occasional vomiting.  Currently on Armour, almost one month, no side effects, no positive effects--wasted money--still searching for the right fix.

Underactive Thyroid	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	11/29/2008 1:24:48 PM	Just switched to Armour (about 2 weeks ago) after being on Synthroid for four years.  What conversion of Synthroid to Armour have others experienced to relieve all symptoms?  I was on 75 mcg of Synthroid and am on 1 1/2 grams of Armour.  Although I am much more clear headed than before and have less itching, I still have some slight leg &amp; foot cramping with the Armour.  I have read that sometimes more Armour is required to alleviate all symptoms.  Hope others will comment on their experience of dosage with Synthroid vs. Armour.  Thanks.
Underactive Thyroid	thyroid mom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	3	Female	25-34	11/12/2008 1:29:30 PM	I have been without the gland for 8 long yrs. I have tried all the thyroid medicines a dr. can prescribe. I have been on Armour twice in my life and this is my second time around. So I thought of finding a dr that might be open minded and I have done so. Here is some advice to everyone. No one knows your body better than you, also your body is talking to you. Its important to listen or you will stay sick!!!!! Also find a dr that will listen and is open minded. You might have to be demanding with your dr. but hey its your life and health at stake. Also recommended is to get a saliva 4 part test to check your adrennal glands,and etc.. You might have more going on than that lil thyroid gland being wacked out. Best wishes to all, and good luck

Also, I'm not having any luck finding the method I'm to take it; I've been taking it on an empty stomach 1/2 hour before and after I eat. That's the problem with the pm doseage. Is this the way I'm supposed to take it? I can't seem to find that infor anywhere. It has definintely been effective for me, but was just wondering if I was taking it correctly.
Underactive Thyroid	LeeAnn, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	55-64	10/26/2008 12:17:51 PM	It worked right away. Unfortunately, it also sent my blood pressure skyrocketing.  I talked to my pharmacist and said do not take any more of it until you talk to your doctor---high blood pressure is a serious side effect of Armour----in my research I see it has T3 and T4 and the T3 is 4 times as active as T4---levothyroxine did NOT cause high blood pressure

But lot of drug store's doesn't carry it so you have to call around to see which one does, and what I was told it all natural, It made from pork or beef.
Underactive Thyroid	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/26/2008 2:21:07 AM	I tried synthroid and levothyroxin for several years and while it normally kept my thyroid levels within normal range none of the symptoms associated with the disease were alleviated. As I continued to sleep ridiculous amounts, was consistently cold, and continued gainin weight in addition to various other symptoms I decided to try Armour after my mom had successful results with it and have been a huge advocate ever since as it is the first time in over a decade I have truly felt like a normal person again!

Underactive Thyroid	Elizabeth, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/10/2008 11:22:02 PM	I was 27 when diagnosed with hypothyroidism.... way too young for the POOR quality of life I was experiencing. I had 2 young children, one still an infant, yet had NO energy to care for them. My doctor put me on Synthroid, which helped me for a grand total of 1 month. When ALL of my &quot;hypo&quot; symptoms returned, plus some new ones, and a higher dose of Synthroid didn't touch them, I knew it was time to switch to Armour. That was 2.5 years ago. I'm on a fairly high dose, yet that's what I need to feel NORMAL. I now have 3 children, and except for the craziest of days, I have enough energy. I can not only provide the basics of food, clothing, &amp; a clean house for my children, but also homeschool and do &quot;fun&quot; stuff like crafts or going to the park. Armour is WONDERFUL for me!! If you take Armour, be sure to take *enough* so that your symptoms go away. Taking too little won't help enough, and you'll think the Armour isn't working.
Underactive Thyroid	risawinner, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	65-74	8/3/2008 8:38:13 PM	I took 100mg of Synthroid from 1993-2006, and had many unpleasant side effects-profuse sweating, hair loss, itchy eyes,extreme moodiness,joint pain, weight gain etc. My doctor only lowered the dose when I insisted and was without thyroid medication from 2006-2008. I felt much better,until recently, I would tire easily. I recently went to a new doctor who prescribed a low dose of Armour. I felt more energetic,and am finally losing weight after only 10 days.

I had all the classic symptoms of Hypothyroidism. Also, I've developed Carpal Tunnel Syndrome due to hypothyroidism. Hopefully, this drug will help everything and make me feel 1000 times better than I have been feeling. Extra bonus is that this medication is cheap!!!! Only cost me $1.54 with insurance for 30 day supply.

Testing lead to underactive thyroid and I was placed on the drug. In the first nine months I lost a total of 30 pounds. I still lose quite a bit of hair but its not as bad as it was. I'm still a bit tired but I don't fall asleep as much as I used to in the middle of the day. My mensturation has also lightened by half. Overall I am quite happy with the results.

After 2 years of increasing doses of many synthetic drugs but no relief, switched to Armour.  Even my hubby noticed a huge difference.  The generic is discontinued!!!  I is anyone else going crazy trying to refill?  Should we be worried that the brand will discontinue as well?

Enlarged Thyroid Gland	Bes, 45-54 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5		45-54	6/24/2008 5:14:01 PM	I was diagnosed with an enlarged thyroid gland (Goiter) over 10years ago. I was on several other Thyroid medications; the purpose was to prevent my enlarged gland from growing larger, with the remote possibility that my thyroid gland may reduce in size over time.I started taking Synthroid and had to switch to another brand of thyroid medicine when Synthroid was removed from the market for several months.  When Synthroid was available again I went back on Synthroid. Over the years (with my doctors knowledge) I would have to stop taking the medication for several months, because of the side effects from the synthetic thyroid medicine.  And the fact that the medication was not helping any longer.  About a year ago, I was researching thyroid conditions and medications that are used to treat the different conditions. I was also looking for a natural treatment like a vitamin or supplement when I came across an article about Armour Thyroid.  I decided that if I had to resume taking thyroid medication I would ask my doctor about taking Armour Thyroid.  Six months ago it got to the point that I had no choice but to start taking thyroid medicine again.  I asked my doctor about Armour Thyroid and he agreed to let me try it, for a few months to see how I did.   My doctor started me on a low dosage. The difference is amazing.  Not only am I feeling better but my thyroid gland has reduced in size and is barely noticeable now.  II my case Armour Thyroid is the right medication for my condition.

I went to my doctor because I was having a lot of hypothyroid symptoms, yet my &quot;Free T4&quot; was quite normal.  My doctor tested my &quot;Free T3&quot; and found it to be almost out of the lowest part of the range, meaning I was not converting T4 to T3 as I should.She suggested we try Armour thyroid.  So as to transition easily, we gradually reduced thyroxine and increased the Armour.The result was stunning.  My edema was no longer out of control, brain-fog disappeared, I could get out of bed in the morning without laying for an hour wishing for intravenous caffeine, my joint pains went away, my endurance for exercise returned, and more.I will NEVER give up my Armour.  It may not be right for everyone, but it works for me.  I do split my dose, taking half the Armour in the morning and half in the evening.  I do not have sleep problems with that though some people do.

Using Armour less than one year now.  At first good results, but now have para-thyroid hyper activity causing dangerously high calcium levels in blood and urine.  A parathyroid scan using Technetium irradiated injection revealed no abnormalities.  Doctors are calling for surgical removal of (which?)one of four culprit para-thyroid glands.  I'm thinking it might be a good thing to switch back to the Levothyroxine for 6 mos. to see what happens.  Too many times we have seen one drug cause other problems then it becomes less beneficial for us as a whole.  Do you feel like a guinea pig of the pharmaceutical companies?  I do.

Weight gain, thinning hair, inability to tolerate cold and heat....but being on this medicine for the past 3 years has been wonderful! I recently gave birth in December 07' and have a doc appt at the end of this month b/c I know my dosage needs to be increased.(They just didn't want to increase to much during my pregnancy.) My Mom takes Synthroid and I have told her to request her doctor to change to Armour.This is the only med I've ever been on, but from reading about Synthroid, this one seems so much better!Hypothyroidism is hard enough to deal with, dealing with a bad medicine shouldn't be another concern. For those thinking of making the switch, I strongly recommend it!!!

As soon as I found a doctor who would perscribe armour to me(not easy) it worked miraculously.My hair immediately stopped comming out and I felt better than ever. Doctors really push synthroid because of the dosing and endorsements they receive but armour is natural and by far better for me.

I take one gram per day. The thing that I am worried about is that my doctor also prescribed me phentermine (as I am overweight) and told me it was perfectly safe to take with the Armour Thyroid. Does anyone out there know if that is true? All in all so far the Armour Thyroid hasn't really changed anything for me except that I can't feel the &quot;lump&quot; in my throat anymore and I am not getting frequent headaches like I was before starting the prescription.

I had no idea that my muscle and joint pain were thyroid related. Ten days after adding a small amount of Armour to a reduced dose of $ynthroid, my joint pain was gone. Over the next few months, as we increased the Armour and reduced the levothyroxine, the muscle pain/cramps ceased as well.For the first time in many years, I now felt rested when getting up in the morning. Taking my second dose after 7 pm prevents night breathing problems (asthma/apnea?) that I had on $ynthroid alone.Armour keeps my TSH completely suppressed, and I have had no recurrence of the cancer.Contrary to the usual dosing practice, I take my Armour with food in two doses twelve hours apart. The effect is very smooth, much like being on a sustained released medication.I have found Armour to be of very consistent potency, as opposed to the $ynthroid which was like being on a rollercoaster.Along with my Armour, I also take a small dose of the Lannett levothyroxine (Unithroid) to get the exact amounts of T3 and T4 that I need. I have also found the Lannett to be of much more consistent potency than $ynthroid.It is unfortunate that so many doctors are unwilling to Rx Armour. Not only is it effective, it is also fairly cheap, even in brand name, and easy to find in most pharmacies.What is it that is more important to these docs than helping their patients?   
Underactive Thyroid	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	10/15/2007 1:29:11 PM	I have all the classic hypothyroid symptoms (depressed, always cold, weight gain despite low calorie intake, constantly exhausted, dry skin) but blood levels were always &quot;normal&quot; so for a decade I was not treated. I started on Armour a few months ago and my blood levels are still in &quot;normal&quot; range, but boy do I feel 1000% better. I feel like I used to many years ago. Every day is now a pleasure where it used to be a burden.
