When my angina was first diagnosed it was stable. Then this past March it went to unstable. Ive had an angiogram and have no blockage. My angina is due to spasms in the muscles around the heart. Once my angina went from stable to unstable Ive had to change to another medication because this doesnt work

Seems like all hbp meds have many many side effects. You would think something out there would work without all the side effects.

Before that I was having severe chest pains. I had been in and out of the hospital. I finally had a angiogram done and it showed that I had no blockage. The cariologist said I was having spasms in my arteries. Since I started taking the adalat Ive rarely had chest pain and it is not as severe. I really like the medication.

May cause kidney damage, reduce white cells, destroy cell to cell communication and increase risk to cancer. I just completed treatments for prostrate cancer. Only med that seems to control high blood press.
