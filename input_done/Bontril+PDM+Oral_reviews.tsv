Overweight	msdresoto, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female	25-34	7/6/2010 1:28:16 AM	I was given this medication because I have gained about 20 pounds that I cannot lose. I follow a low fat, low carb, very healthy diet. I excercise daily. I took Bontril for about a month and did not lose any weight but the worst thing is it gave me the worst case of constipation I have ever experienced. I was constantly unable to make a bowel movement and it became so bad that I had to go to the E.R. for help with extraction.

Overweight	Rita, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/11/2009 2:46:10 AM	I have been on the program of Bontril with a low fat, low calorie diet and have lost 25lbs. I feel great and my hunger has decreased. If you decide to take this drug, remember to drink lots of water. It helps with the dry mouth and digestive system.

The only issue I have with it is that it causes me to feel extremely irritable. I suppose this is because it is a stimulant and those usually increase anxiety. I feel emotional and irritable. I am hoping that these side effects subside because the drug is helping with my weight loss efforts. 
Overweight	HappytoBWendy, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/7/2009 5:08:57 PM	I've been taking it for 9weeks and have lost 11 pounds. I'm think it actually does work better than any diet, over the counter pill and excercise I've tried, but not satisfied I haven't lost more yet, which is why my doctor just increased my dose. A person is only suppose to be on it 3-4months. I've stopped overeating and snacking but watch-out if you don't drink a LOT of water (at least 500ml every hour), bad dry-mouth but REALLY bad constipation leading to extreme abdominal pain or nausea until I drink water and 'it' passes! I don't take it after 5pm or I have insomnia and my heart beats very hard sometimes, but I have energy to exercise after work which is so important, and I don't feel jittery. I'd reccommend it for anyone that doesn't have any health problems.

Overweight	Bigg mamma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	8/19/2008 4:50:34 PM	I have been having problems loosing weight for years and I just beat cancer but I started the pills only 3 weeks ago and have dropped my weight a little fast. I have lost a total of 23 pounds already.  But I feel great and I only have about 77 pounds to go.  I can't wait to loose more weight.  I have to be careful cause I have heart problems as well and it seems to be the only med that doesn't affect my heart.  I have to see my Dr every 30 days and go in for an ekg and before I can take my pill every day I have to take my blood pressure and if it is elevated I I am not to take the pill but so far things are fine.  I hope you have the luck I have.  Good luck.
Overweight	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	2	5	1	Female	45-54	2/7/2008 11:45:41 PM	Please read webmd information on this drug, I took Bontril PDM for short term, about three weeks, after losing 12 pounds, which was my goal, I stopped taking it, by the second or third day of stopping, I was extremely tired and depressed, like I just had no motivation or desire to do anything but lay around. After going back and reading up I realized that although I only took it three weeks, (I had been exercising and walk 5 miles every other day) that my body was acting as if was withdrawing from it, two long weeks later I guess it is finally out of my system, feeling 100% better, back at myself and walking my 5 miles. As for the Bontril I will choose not to take it, not because it does not curb the appetite, but because after taking it for three weeks, losing what I wanted to lose and stop taking it, apparently simulated the withdrawal symptoms of fatigue and depression. In my case I read and knew what was wrong, But not everyone who may experience those symptoms may realize that it may have occured when stopping the medication.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	11/29/2007 11:11:40 AM	This is a GREAT weight loss drug.  I'm a middle school teacher and I have energy to SPARE!  I seem more focused on tasks at hand, but I want to do a thousand things at once.  I notice that I want to talk a million miles a minute, but that's ok.  I feel like I think more sharply and speak very clearly and directly.  I've had brief dry mouth, but that could be from just talking a lot.  I'm not jittery, but I have noticed I'm more direct and aggressive (not in a bad way) and want people to get to the point when they are speaking.  I highly recommend this drug!
Overweight	Simple_Man, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	11/11/2007 6:33:10 PM	I started my weightloss  program with the doctor on 09-25-07.  I rode my bicycle 10 miles a day - everyday.  I ate a low fat meal plan.  I lost 35lbs from 9-25 to 10-30.  I have lost an additional 10lbs for a total of 45lbs and my next weigh in is 12-04-07.  Two fellow co-workers introducted me to the program and they have lost 107 lbs and 76 lbs respectively.    I cant say enough about this medication.  It does create constipation and decrease sexual cravings.   
Overweight		5	5	5			11/7/2007 1:57:19 PM	I have only been taking this for 1 1/2 wks, and I feel great!  I have more energy and I am not craving food.  I do get hungry but do not feel the need or desire to over-eat.  I am down 3 lbs already!

I still get hungry obviously but what happens is that I will get full very fast- therfore I dont eat as much as I used to- and I stay full. Great results!!

Overweight	Pat, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	65-74	9/19/2007 12:05:37 PM	I have no desire to eat between meals, which was my big problem. I would eat from dinner until I went to bed. If I do have anything to snack on, I have a piece of friut. Basically I eat a small breakfast of cereal, or a piece of toast and and egg, have a salad and cottage cheese for lunch and eat a normal dinner of whatever I want, but have cut back on my portion of starches. I am just not hungry all the time. I have been on the pill for 9 weeks and have lost 18 pounds.
