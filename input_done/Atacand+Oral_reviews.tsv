It has helped with my HP but I'm having side effects of joint pain, stomach pain along with shoulder &amp; left arm, &amp; chest pain after I eat. I also get a stuffy nose and whease @ night when I go to sleep.  The joint pain is getting worse and so is the Stomach issues. This is the 5th drug I have tried and they all have terriable side affects for me.  Guess It is time to see the doctor again. age is 62 I'm in good health but over weight. Need to drop about 50 lbs.  hard to do while on drugs.

High Blood Pressure	Lee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	3/9/2012 11:06:34 AM	I have been on Atacand 8mg for about 3 years. The medication has been effective in keeping my blood pressure level, but from the start, I have dizziness, itching and have gained weight. About 4 months ago my Dr increased dose to 16mg.  Since this time I have gained more weight. I am now 25lbs overweight.  I also have been feeling depressed to a point where I don't want to do anything. I am experiencing lower back pain, pain in ankle and now pain in my thigh.  The pain is to a point where I could barely walk without limping, go up or down stairs without assistance or even sit or lay down comfortably. AND OH MY GOODNESS, let me not forget, HAIR LOSS! from the start. I'm not sure if this is being caused by this Med, but would like to know if anyone else is experiencing this. By the way, this is the only medication I'm taking.

No side effects!!! My heart function while still less than half of normal is  enough for me to exercise, swim and have a mostly regular life.  However,  since the Feds dropped it from the formulary this year my insurance no longer covers it at any Tier level. So now I have to change to something else. It is really annoying when Politics messes around with your health care.

It seems like no matter how well I eat and exercise, I can't shed the weight. I'm also very very tired. On the plus side, my blood pressure is perfect! I'm going to ask my doctor if it is normal to gain weight and be so tired on this med.

I would always get a headache whenever I take the medicine but it would keep my blood pressure down. My main concern is the long term effect it is doing to my internal organs. My last doctors visit stated that I have signs of liver damage so I wonder does this medicine contribute to that issue.

Also my joints (ie knees and ankles mostly) started cracking when I try to stand up from a sitting position! Not sure why, I have been on Diovan and Avapro and had the cracking of same joints, but not the leg muscles aching like I am getting with Atacand. Doctor hasn't suggested using something else yet. Anybody have idea as to where to go with another BP medicine to try? Please email me at sieglesx4@verizon.net

I thought it was Flecainide that I am on also but after reading about this medication I am wondering if it is Atacand that is causing all this pain.  Has anyone else have pain from this?

It seemed to do alright but I had to reduce the dosage from 8mg to 4mg last year because of low blood pressure readings.  Recently I have not been feeling just right - light headed, tingly, sluggish with no energy.  Dr. took me off Atacand and I feel much better but after several days my pressure starts rising.  I am starting on Amlodipine 2.5mg maybe tomorrow.  I am a little reluctant to try another drug.  Wish I could control BP without medication.  
High Blood Pressure	Munther, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	35-44	3/3/2011 5:44:18 AM	I was diagnosed with hypertension 5years ago and started medication with Micardes 80mg which at the start worked perfectly with truly low side effects but my blood pressure started to move up after 4years of Micardes. My doctor moved me to Micardes Plus which was quite good but for a short period of time. In one of the random checks my reading was 140/105 which triggered my doctor to give another medication in addition to the Micardis Plus but I never used it. I went to another doctor who replaced Micardis with Exforge. Oh God, was fatal on me with lots and lots of side effects. I thought I may die if I continued to use it then I tried the magical Atacand Plus. Frankly, it took sometime to work perfectly but now my readings is around 120/75 during the day and 105/65 at night. Very minimal side effects and feeling myself active and full of energy. I never saw those numbers (120/75) even in childhood. I hope it will continue to work well for me. Tip of advice, learn to calm down as much as possible, meditation and stay active as possible. Cheers

Starting in the past few months, however, I have suffered decreased libido, affecting my life terribly. We have been married 31 years but still enjoy a healthy sexual relationship, until boom! I blame it on Atacand, though I have been taking it for a few years now. So do some side effects life this appear after you have been taking this drug quite a while? I might add there has been no change in my drug regimen. Nothing new has been added, nothing has been d/c'd.

High Blood Pressure	Philly, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	9/12/2010 10:25:33 PM	I had high blood pressure for years, was taking a medication and a diuretic, yet the BP was still too high. My friend encouraged me to see a cardiologist who helped her husband with his BP, and she prescribed Atacand, along with my other meds. For the first time, my BP was just great, and I have felt fine using it for the last few years. Now my health insurance doesn't have it on its &quot;favored&quot; list, and I would have to pay $100 for it vs. $10 or $50 for the drugs it has on its list.I talked to my family dr. about it and she switched me to Diovan, which was the closest type of similar medication recommended by the health insurance.This is my first month on Diovan, so I don't yet know how my BP is doing on this med. But I really don't feel quite the same, feel like I am having some palpitations, which I never had. Don't know whether it is just because I am paying more attention to it now, or is really due to the change in meds? Be happy if your insurance covers Atacand. I am thinking of switching back even though it is more expensive.

High Blood Pressure	whizzleme, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	55-64	3/13/2010 4:32:32 PM	Placed on this medication in 12/09 after nearly a year w/o meds.  Previous inactive medicines caused all kinds of side effects, blurred vision, nightmares, extreme fatigue, dry mouth.  These were lisinopril, metropolol, clonidine:  Atacand has caused no noticeable side effects, bp is lower however is not where it needs to be; am not very active during winter months, but am looking forward to being able to walk to help reduce it further.  I am most at my best in the 112/70 bp range.  Have discontinued eating meats and eat lots of fresh vegetables/fruits, nuts and drink plenty of water.  No smoking or alcohol.  I thank my new doctor for listening to my concerns unlike all the others, even one whom I later found out license had been suspended. As Dr. Oz says take charge of your health!

I applied scalpicin to relieve itchy and pain, but it just help a bit. Do you think this are a side effects of atacand? Is anyone of you suffered the same thing?

High Blood Pressure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	9/15/2008 1:21:44 PM	Ive read here that some people are experiencing bags under the eyes while on this med. Im 31 and have been on the medication for 6 years now. Ive noticed severe under eye bags during this time even though Ive no weight on (Hypertension is a family condition unfortunatly). Im reading this and thinking - 'Wow, how come I never associated them to the drug until now. They do upset me constantly. I had always been complimented on my lovely eyes in the past, now they are ugly. Does anyone know if I come off the drug do the bags go too? It works great besides - BP was 220/125 and now 130/80. No other side affects.

Could not understand why I have been so very light headed and was becoming very concerned.  I have also started to experience back pains which I had when taking another medication. I have also experienced the same stomach problems I did when taking another medication; bags have also started to develop under my eyes.

I seem to have constant itching that is very annoying. It moves all over my body and has no rhyme or reason where it will itch next. I also have noticed bags under my eyes that are more prevalent then in the past.

Take it 16 mg in AM and 16mg before bed . BP's are at los 130's over 70's . Yes, have developed the under eye bags that I never had before .. Hard time getting insurance to cover but State programs will .. It works.
