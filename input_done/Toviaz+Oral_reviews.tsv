Overactive Bladder	Christy H, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	7/25/2012 11:11:36 AM	I started Toviaz a week ago and the effect has been amazing. I was getting up 8-10 times a night before, and now I can sleep all night without having to get up. I was also having leakage when I coughed or sneezed and found it difficult to hold urine for more than a moment or two before having accidents. I do have dry mouth and find that my sinus gets dry also. I use Benecal mouth wash now before bed and a saline gel for my sinus and it's been fine.

But had a bad cold and took hydrocodone and allegra and walked the beach with friend and became violently ill; dizzy vomiting, sharp headaches, dry mouth to the extreme.  I knew the body over-heating was an issue but never realized the antihistimines would bring on extreme dehydration or whatever was happening to me.  Scary-- thought I was having a heat stroke.
Overactive Bladder	smb1280, 75 or over Female  (Patient) 	2	5	1	Female		4/22/2012 10:42:28 AM	I had been taking Ditrapan XL and then Vesicare, but they made my eyes really dry ( I have glaucon=ma and wet type macular degeneration) and also my skin in my private parts. So the doctor put me on Toviaz. It was working ok but my hair started to fall out, so I quit taking it..I don't know what to do now...Has anyone lost hair??? I read on the internet that 9 cases were reported in 2010...

Needing to Urinate Immediately	goodteacher, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	3	2	Female	55-64	4/10/2012 5:51:38 PM	On 8 mg.This is week 3. Helped greatly with OAB, having to go immediately. Very bad dry mouth, headache, trouble sleeping is worse. Also difficulty with organisms as mentioned by one other reviewer.Since I take other meds that also cause dry mouth, not sure I an tolerate this med.
Overactive Bladder	lisafink, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	4	3	Female	45-54	4/9/2012 5:51:20 PM	I have been taking this for 5 days and the dry mouth is really bad. Last night was the first time I couldn't sleep along with a bad headache. I don't think it has helped at all with the spasming but I will give it a few more days.  I hope this helps you!

Instead of helping, it made it worse. Now I have to pee every 30 minutes, it caused insomnia and my entire body is shaking. Will not take this anymore.

It has been very effective and I have been able to get some sleep after years of getting up to pee frequently. My side effects are very dry mouth and blurred vision for a few hrs after taking. I will continue it unless it starts to give me problems. I tried all the older drugs with no luck.

Frequent Urination	sailpartner, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	65-74	2/16/2012 6:03:54 AM	After 16 days on Toviaz, I am looking forward to this drug exiting my body. I am in my fourth hour of having a strong urge to urinate and standing in front of the toilet and getting no flow. This is a horrible feeling and it has kept me awake since 2 am.  I hoped I could tough it out and the situation would improve, but no luck.  Before this drug I never experienced the problem of inability to commence flow.  The dry mouth during sleep seems solvable and I could handle that.  Can you imagine having to run to the toilet with a huge urge to pee, and then we you arrive and give your body the command to open the floodgates, and nothing happens!! The feeling continues and continues and will not stop.  Such is my current state.  I wish I could hurry up  the process of getting this drug out of my body permanently so I could pee.  I admire the concept of experimentation and Toviaz is that, for me I wish I could give it a rating of one half a star.    By the way, I am so thankful to this website to have a forum to read others  experience with this drug. It is very helpful to not feel alone in this experiment.

However, I do not like the side effects.  I can deal with the dry mouth, but after taking this for about 2 weeks, I have started having severe memory problems.  Has anyone else experienced this?

Overactive Bladder	Paula A, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	45-54	1/16/2012 8:58:53 PM	I have been on this medicine for approx. 3 months.  At first I was on Detrol which was not effective.  Toviaz started out effective however that is no longer the case.  Also, the dry mouth keeps me sipping water all day and my dentist has prescribed me a special tooth paste to combat this.  I go to the bathroom during the day every two hours as directed by my doctor, and still when I get up after laying down, I leak.  Would like to go to bed without wearing pull up pads.  I will soon change meds again.  Also, my scalp itches and the dandruff is awful!  Never had it before the toviaz.
Overactive Bladder	Trisha0309, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/4/2012 5:48:13 PM	I have been on Toviaz 8mg for 5 days &amp; cannot believe the difference.  My problem is extreme sudden urge where I frequently did not make it to the bathroom. I tried Vesicare &amp; something else but nothing worked for me.  Toviaz is definitely it.  I do have dry mouth &amp; occasion constipation but have always been constipated so not worried about that part.  I'll deal with it. The dry mouth is not so bad that I can't handle it.  I am very very happy with the results of Toviaz.  I have gone from changing a maxi pad twice daily to now lasting all day with not one dribble.  I only get up once a night to make a potty run, so that is not bad at all.  When I started taking Toviaz, the effects were immediate although the dr told me it would take 7 days to reach full effectiveness.  This is definitely the drug for me.  Yes it is very expensive but it sure beats being miserable and not feeling clean all day.  Even with my insurance it's $200 for a 3 month supply.  I don't care.  if I have dealt with my problem for years and now I feel I am free!  Thanks Toviaz, you have given me my life back.  Yes I know I sound like a commercial, but I'm just so happy I have found a solution to my problem I wanted to share it with the world!

I've also experienced blurred vision. I don't know if it is worth the side effects to continue. I've also experience pain in my upper thigh as another reviewer. I believe today will be my last day of taken this medication. As far as the effectiveness of this medication it has worked I am able to go to the bathroom in a timely fashion, although today it seem as if I could not get there fast enough. Oh did I mention head aches. The side of effects of this medication definitely out way the worth. Vesicare was not this bad.

IMMEDIATELY my overactive bladder symptons stopped...the urgency to go all the time, leakage (especially at night)...that uncomfortable feeling of always having to go...I did suffer a little constipation but helped that with Dulcolax...also have the dry mouth but I just drink lots of water and suck on hard candies...kinda getting used to that...I recommend Toviaz based on my experience...it feels good to be able to take a long drive without having to stop every 20 minutes to use a bathroom.

I do have dry mouth and am starting to experience dry eyes.  My biggest concern is that I am having significant discomfort in my upper thighs on both legs and wonder if anyone else has experienced this.  My physical therapist suggested it could be a side effect of the medication as there is no other reason for the pain.

It really helps but I experienced dry mouth, constipation and belly fat (no fat anywhere else). I stopped taking it after 6 months so I can get rid of my belly fat. I've been off this pill for 3 days and the immediately need is coming back, but not as ofen.

I have not noticed any difference.   The only time I have relief from going to the bathroom frequently is when I get my menstrual cycle.  Has anyone else experienced this as well?  I also have pain in my lower area, as if someone is pushing hard with their fist.  My cultures are negative for uti's.

I really need it for the night because I wake up about 8-10 times to go to the bathroom.  The Toviaz has not helped at all at night.  I am also experiencing dizziness and shortness of breath about 2-3 hours after I take the medication. I also get overheated, dehydrated, and have dry mouth and eyes.  I am constantly drinking water.  I will finish my 30 day supply and see if things get better but my feeling is that I will have to try another medication.

Overactive Bladder	donna1124nyc, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	2	5	1	Female	45-54	6/9/2011 11:24:16 PM	Took Toviaz for 3 days and the side effects were servere. My airway passage felt like it was closing, couldn't swallow my food, sore throat, cough, chills,horseness in my voice and very constipated. No effect on my over active bladder. I will never take it again. I'd rather run and find a bathroom. This is the 3rd drug I've tried. Vesicare was slightly effective but contipation was too much and Gelnique was a joke! Had to rub gel on my arm which did absoluetly nothing. Not trying any more meds.

The problem is that a months prescription is $182 and I have now had to change to ditropan. It caused such horrible dry mouth and constipation that I stopped taking it.  Now I am back to not using anything.

Overactive Bladder	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	25-34	4/6/2011 7:04:19 PM	I starting having bladder pains starting August of 2010 after infections were ruled out I began seeing a Urologist and  had  procedure done that determined I had overactive bladder. He stated me on 4 mg Toviaz right away and told me it takes up to 12 weeks to really start noticing a difference. After about 2 months the pain was for the most part gone and I was back to a normal amount of voiding. I have been on it since around October 2010 and I can drink alcohol and eat whatever I want because the medicine works very well. If my drinking is way out of hand however I do feel achy the next day but that is at no surprise. Sex is better I don't feel like I am bruised or have to pee anymore. For the first 2 weeks I had blurred vision, headaches, and dry mouth but these symptoms virtually disappeared after around 2 or 3 weeks. I would give this medicine a shot, it take around 3 months to start working so don't stop taking it after one month if you are not feeling better it takes a long time and is VERY EFFECTIVE. One little thing is I think I have gained a small amount of weight in my stomach but this could just be normal weight gain and its not much I weigh 126lbs...and before taking weighed maybe 123..so no big deal...worth a shot for sure

Overactive Bladder	Mama Llama, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/6/2011 2:34:42 AM	Toviaz, in addition to doing Kegels and watching acid foods and drinks,  has helped reduce bathroom trips, stopped most of my leaking, have more control starting and stopping the flow and can hold off going to the bathroom longer.  I only go once thru the night now. I have gone from using several panty liners thru the day to just one if I leave the house, just in case.  I have asthma, so if I have a full bladder and need to cough and haven't gone to the bathroom, there's a good chance I'll leak.  I do have a very dry mouth, but just chew gum, suck on hard candy or drink more water.  My eyes are also dry, but just use drops as needed.  Leaving the house is now a pleasure - car trips are great.  I still want to know where all the bathrooms are....just in case!! Go to the Toviaz website to learn as much as possible to help your condition.  It has really paid off for me!  Oh, most importantly, my doctor REALLY works with me!!

I have the blurred vison the constipation I've gotten over.  But now i have large itchy swellings (lumps) that appear on my arms and shoulder blades.They last maybe a week and then its gone.I take synthroid, diovan,biotin, and chondroitin/gulcosomine supplements could it be an interaction of the medications. I never have any skin problems prior to taking the toviaz.

Overactive Bladder	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	45-54	9/29/2010 12:24:52 AM	Went off Vesicare and started this a week ago with samples. Although it is working do not see a big difference in this and Vesicare as far as my OAB but the side effects are different. I feel very nauseated every morning and the constipation is worse although I am remedying that with more fruit. Someone else mentioned that it cost a lot more if it turns out it costs more than the Vesicare I will just ask to go back on that maybe at a higher dose. I never felt nauseated on Vesicare but after being on it for several years felt it wasn't doing the job anymore so the doc gave me this to sample. Both have me suffering from dry mouth which I try to combat by sipping water ALL day long.

On 8mg the drug had marginal effect.  the drug was tested up to 24mg BUT is not prescribed above 8mg.  I presumed to experiment with 12mg and have fount that dose to be optimum for me.  So far, the literature that I have read does not disuade me from this experiment.  I have been on Toviaze ER for 90 days and on 12mg for two weeks with geat results.  I haven't told the MD of the increase in dose.  Will see him next month and will discuss this with him.

After 6 days of agonizing regression (poor urine stream, increased urgency, difficulty urinating, mild constipation), I went back to Tamsulosin. Although I didn't give Toviaz a reasonable trial, it was too uncomfortable to continue the experiment.

I have tried several other kinds of meds with no relief. I took my first Toviaz pill at 6 this evening and it is now 2 AM and I can't sleep because I have a constant urge to urinate--but CAN'T. I am spending all my sleep time in the bathroom feeling like I urgently have to go and absolutely nothing comes out.  Painful abdomenal contractions with no result.

It works well except I'm experiencing constipation more than I did with similar medication.  The most negative factor is the price.  It is extrememely expensive and with my insurance, I still have to pay $67.00 per monthly dosage.  I like it but I can't afford this medication.
Urine Leakage When there is a Strong Desire to Void	Len, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	5/5/2010 11:21:22 PM	My history of incontinence includes treatment with multiple meds, TVT insertion and removal because it kinked, and recently collagen injection. I was diagnosed with problems in both my bladder and urethra. I continued to have problems of constant spasms (didn't realize they were constant until I took Toviaz and didn't have any at all until it was really time). It's like the switch was turned off. No urgency and leaking only occurring if I have really waited too long - like 6 hours during the day. It's early so I know it may not stay this way, but I am hopeful. The only side effect I've had is dry mouth.

Other	Socks719, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	1	Female	35-44	4/5/2010 12:10:52 PM	I am a 37 yr old female who has trouble with bladder leakage (SIU) when running, jumping (or any 'active' excercise), and during sex (yeah, major one there), sneezing coughing, walking stairs, etc.  I was prescribed this and have been taking for 3+ months.  I am no longerleaking when I cough or sneeze and I can walk to stairs without leaking.  But if I run or do any kind of exercise or activity that  causes me to bounce or a jolting motion, then I not only leak, the flood gates just open and at this point I am so frustrated.  Thinking about surgery as I'm tired of medicine not taking care of the &quot;whole&quot; problem.  Any recommendations?  I use the restroom before I leave my house and then before I begin exercising and it doesn't help.  I'd love to go on a roller coaster with my kid this summer, but that too causes a full bladder loss, even on Toviaz.  Help . . .

To be honest it has not helped at all and I have been feeling unwell since going on it - headaches, drowsiness, depression. I am hard of hearing and at a test this morning I have suddenly lost nearly all hearing in one ear!  Being referred to ENT specialist but first time this has happened in 30 years so may be linked to Topiaz.  Be warned.

Instead of helping the problem, it made it worse. I had more frequent trips and it was like someone opened the flood gates. Instead of being able to hold my urine, I would start urinating before I could even get up. It was more urgent than before I started the medicine. Along with this problem, I had constant nausea, no appetite, bouts of depression and swelling in the neck area. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy.

I was on Detrol and had to stop because of the side effects. I haven't felt run down like I did with the other medication. I still get slight headaches but I deal with that it was the constant urinating, urgent need to pee and leakage that I oculd not deal with. Reading everyones comments it sounds like it doesn't work well. I will update in a few days/weeks. Anyone with good results please write.
