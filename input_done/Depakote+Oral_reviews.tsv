Bipolar Depression	hopeful, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/16/2012 3:28:28 PM	Have been using for 3 months.  No apparent side effects.  Mood, affect, and sociablilty much improved.  Previously on lithium for 4 years alot of side effects wasn't aware of.  Like peeing all night so couldn't get but 2-3 hours solid sleep dr prescribed med to help bladder control and sleeper instead of getting off lithium. none of the other meds worked by the way.  so the last 4 years very sleep deprived. you can imagine what that does to a persons mood and personality let alone being bipolar.fatigue, muscle aches , hair loss all from lithium.  Maybe a little thinning so far from the depakote, hard to tell but being a woman it's not a real plus.  by the way my dr wanted me to continue on the lithium even though my thyroid got way out of wack  and I kept saying something was prompting me to get off of it onto something different.  so i had to be my own patient advocate and push.  just remember your dr is not god, talk to others, get a second opinion if needed, bring someone with to appointments.
Other	Miss1999, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	8/14/2012 11:33:47 PM	This medication literally made me believe I was going to die.  I took it for 10 days, and had unbelievable side effects. Severe tremors, memory loss, extreme sleepiness, I gained 10lbs in ten days, became extremely irritable, and literally thought I was going to die if I took another pill. I had severe thoughts of hopelessness and disturbing thoughts and dreams as well.  I have been off of Depakote today for 7 days and am still feeling the side-effects. I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone.

I've been on Keppra and that made me RAGE! I'd rather be on Depakote then.

The first time, it had me so sedated I felt like a zombie. This time, on the first night, I have sever nausea and a stomach ache. I will no longer be taking this med much to the chagrin of my shrink, to be sure.

I get upset very easy and lose it so my psych doc recommended this med for me so it could settle me down and not get all worked up it makes me feel happier and im not so angry or upset as i was before. Depakote didnt give me any weird side effects i did have suicidal thoughts last month and i thought it was the depakote. I take depakote 2x a day and it i would recommend it to any person who is suffering as i was a few months ago.
Epileptic Seizure	SkerJames, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	7/20/2012 2:17:02 PM	I was diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy at the age of 17 and started taking 250 mg of Depakote ER 3x day. After some issues with my menstrual cycle, my medication was briefly switched to phenobarbital (briefly due to the fact that I had severe mood swings and nausea) before switching back to Depakote. After starting college, I began to wake up dizzy, my neurologist believed I was having seizures in my sleep and the dosage of my medicine was increased to 500 mg 2x day. For several years, the dosage remained the same.  Over the last three years, though, I have begun to experience tonic-clonic seizures so the dosage is now 750 mg 2x a day. I feel tired and generally lethargic most of the time. Rarely do I ever feel energized. Over the last 14 years, I have noticed a decrease in my memory, but I don't know if it's side effects of the medication, epilepsy or both. My neurologist has me take folic acid supplement in case I become pregnant and Vitamin D with Calcium supplements to prevent bone thinning. As long as I take my medication REGULARLY (I set an alarm on my cell phone so I always remember to take it exactly 12 hours apart), my seizures appear to be well-controlled although I have had two in the last six months. Those episodes coupled with the general side effects have led me to contemplate switching medications yet I'm afraid that's a &quot;grass is greener on the other side&quot; approach and will do more harm than good.

Bipolar Depression	A real person, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	3	1	Male	19-24	7/8/2012 10:57:44 PM	Don't take this medication if you are pregnant. It could lead to birth defects.I was prescribed this medication and experienced some very nasty side effects like difficulty breathing and irregular heart palpitations. My doctor told me that the medication was safe and tested however upon further researching the drug I found out that it is actually new and the way in which it actually effects the brain is unknown. I highly suggest reading the printout before taking this drug and strongly recommend getting off of this drug as soon as you can if you can; BUT please don't suddenly stop taking this medication it could lead to fatal long lasting seizures.

The ER form is much better than the other and I only have to take it once daily, which is a real help! If you have found lithium to be ineffective or a personality killer, then you should talk to your Dr. about Depakote ER. It's made my life so much better.One last note that is super important: when you first start on it, do not be surprised if you have horrible, evil nightmares. They go away after a week or TWO and it is worth it to continue taking until they go away. :D

Migraine Prevention	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	3/13/2012 2:36:47 AM	I all of a sudden got a migraine one day. Many different forms from clusters, neck,jaw,temples,and even sinuses. I went to chiropractor accupunture dr had mri (came out clean) this went on everyday all day long suffering for 9 weeks. I lost 8lbs. I couldn't take it anymore every med I took did'nt touch the pain, I ended up in Psych hospital They started me on depakote 1000mg a day and lexapro 20mg. I also take Kolonapine 1mg for anziety at bedtime as needed norco 10mg for pain. I have not had a migraine in several months,smaller headaches jaw tightness and neck pain advil usually takes care of that and a chiropratic ajustment once a week. I am very small 5 feet tall and have gained 13lbs plus the 8lbs I lost.Gaining 21lbs in 5 months. I was thinking to ask to try to wean off cause of the weight gain but I'm worried that the headache will come back. But I also hate the extra weight. I think I will try to stop the lexapro, that causes weight gain as well.

Bipolar Depression	Julie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	4	Female	45-54	2/13/2012 7:56:29 AM	I have been taking Depakote for approx 2 years. At first I took Depakote in the morning, which resulted in me not being able to function during the day.I discussed this with my psychiatrist who advised me to take my medication before going to bed.This has worked well, I sleep better and funtion ok during the day - sometimes feeling a little tired.I take Depakote, Fluoxetine and sometimes Propanolol for anxiety.Depakote suits me and my mind is very much calmer with no racing thoughts and I am more able to keep things in perspective.I am now able to get myself to the gym - which helps greatly with my moods.I would recommend Depakote, but,I do appreciate that what I have read in other reviews that it is definitely not for every one.I began to begin feeling the benefits of Depakote a month after starting it.I no longer get crazy mood swings, so for me this drug works well - although I am concerned about its toxicity levels etc.Now that I am feeling more balanced I combine my drugs with eating healthily and getting lots of excercise.This is a massive improvement as I used to suffer from low self esteem and lack of confidence. I hope that if you try Depakote that it works as well for you as  it has for me. I now have far more good days than bad.

Found out recently that I've lost some of my memory, have many nervous system issues and as of yesterday my ammonia levels in my blood are toxic from the medication. For mentally stability the medication is a great help however there are risk. I was told I was to have an MRI and EEG done as well to see what kind of damage has been done to the brain from possible swelling. Do you research. If your on the medication please make sure your doctor is ordering all the proper blood work and note that ammonia levels must be put on ice to get a correct reading.

Epileptic Seizure	Edgy , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	19-24	1/25/2012 8:13:18 PM	After every other medication tried didn't work on me, Depakote was administered and some results were gained. However, if anything happened in my schedule to throw me off just a little bit, I would have 2-3 seizures a day for about a week. I took this drug from age 8-15 and still have epilepsy to this day but now I don't use medication because of what Depakote did to me. I don't remember my childhood and it wasn't that long ago. I do remember the faces of family members, or what food I have eaten today. I gained 100 pounds while on this drug and within three months of getting off of it, I lost 80 pounds. I have had vicious mood swings since day one and still have them today. A very large part of me feels that Depakote has actually been a worse part of my life than the epilepsy that doesn't want to go away. Yes it stopped the seizures most of the time, but when it didn't, they were many times worse. If there are any other medications out there that you are able to take and results would be gained, I STRONGLY recommend that you do so. Depakote took away my childhood and forced me to grow up at the ripe old age of 8.

But it made my vision blurred which does nto work well with a telecommuting job. My neuroligust is trying to come up with something else. I have not gained weight the two month I was on it, but for sure I am batling against increased appetite. Doc said the combinaiton of Evavil(50 mg) and depakote is a sure way for most to gain weight.

Other health problems like high blood pressure occurred due to extremely fast weight gain, and bald spots in my head, too.  Having these negative effects makes this drug not useful for me.

It took a good 4 months to take full affect.  The only issue that caused me to go off it was weight gain.  I am a personal trainer, i work out 6 days a week and eat healthy and i still gained weight and was unable to take it off.  I have been off Depekote for a month now and have easily lost the weight i gained. I am now hoping that Lamictal will give me the positive results that Depekote did.

Bipolar Depression	veryvermilion, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	4	Male	45-54	8/15/2011 4:40:17 PM	I started taking this drug 6 weeks ago.  I was ready for weight gain, but the opposite has happened.  I no longer find myself craving fatty, starchy, fried foods.  The other side effect that I was shocked to have is a marked increase in my libido.  I feel like a 20 year old.I do not like feeling so drowsy.  It has slowed down my overall system so much.  I can't get up and going until about 2pm or later.  For years I was up and out of bed by 7am or earlier.  I am considering reintroducing caffeine to my diet.  With years of anxiety, I stopped using caffeine.  Now with this medication, I'm thinking that maybe a little will help me to get going earlier in the day.  Also it has my slowed my GI system.  I'm not constipated, I just am not as &quot;regular&quot; as I was prior to the drug.  I'm taking fiber supplement and eating tons of veggies/fruit to combat this side effect.It's helped with my terrible anger problems.  I'm not nearly as obnoxious on the road as I used to be.  It amazes me at how different every one's response to Depakote is.  It just goes to show that we're all unique.  I feel very lucky to have found this medication.  I just hope I can combat the drowsiness and GI problems.

Manic Phase of Manic-Depression	mickstinator, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	5	4	Male	19-24	8/11/2011 5:32:57 PM	My husband recently started taking this drug to treat his bipolar disorder type 1. 1000 mg has really helped with his manic episode. He has gained a few pounds, but he had recently lost about 30 that he didn't need to lose. I think being an active person helps control the weight gain. He feels a little groggy, but overall it's been a great success.
Simple Partial Seizures	dd77, 3-6 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) 	5	3	5	Female	3-6	8/7/2011 11:36:45 PM	My daughter started taking this medication almost 2 years ago when  4 yeats old for absence seizures. She was previouly on something else (can't remember the name) for over a month with no change in her seizures. Within 3 doses her seizures stopped all together. 2 seizure free years later and she is currently getting weaned off. So happy that this drug worked for her. The only side effect she had was hair loss so we are hoping that won't be an issue any longer. The only downside to this drug is that we had to serve it with applesauce 2x a day. It was  apint to go on vacation and have to buy single serve cups of applesauce and to always mak sure we had spoons to administer it. A liguid would have been much easier but it was a small price to pay!
Petit Mal Epilepsy with Multiple Seizure Types	Julia, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	3	1	Female	25-34	8/6/2011 7:03:28 PM	I started taking Depakote when I was 15. That was 17yrs ago. A good doctor finally took me off it. I started taking it for petit mal seizures and it helped some then around 20 I developed grand mal seizures and continued to have them every 6-8 months till I stopped Depakote. During my teen years and in to my late 20's I was very depressed and tried to committ suicide 8 times. I never thought Depakote could have been the cause of all that, but since being off it for a year now it's like someone turned the depression switch off and all those horrible moods have all but left. I never had anyone question the medication while I was in and out of hospitals and therapists offices and I never thought about it till I went off depakote and my mood drastically improved. Becareful for that if you are taking this med and after stopping depakote 30lbs melted off without a change in diet or exercise. I am on Keppra now and haven't noticed any real problems.
Migraine Prevention	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	8/2/2011 3:19:57 PM	I started taking Depakote about 8 weeks ago. It seems to have a good affect on decreasing migranes. I only had 3 in the month of June! I'm not sure about the side affects though. After reading through some of these comments I find myself relating to some side affects others have noted. Things like sluggishness, not being able to get excited about things, and slight weight gain (about 6 lbs overall). I'm a &quot;mind over matter&quot; kind of person, so I didn't think a drug could affect my moods, but I really think this is. Pay close attention if you take this!

Should be discontinued/banned &amp; pulled of the shelves in all pharmacies. Have heard the SAME complaints(from other patients) in line while waiting to pickup his filled rx. WHERE IS THE FDA??? IF THEY'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO TEST/SCREEN TIS MED-THEN FIRE ALL OF THEM &amp; REPLACE ALL OF THEM NOW !!!!!

Depakote was the first thing that worked.  I am down to probbaly only one headach every two weeks, and of much less severity when it ocurrs.  So far, no bad side effects at all. I am a little tired at night, bubt not a big deal.  It does not affect me on the next day.  BTW, I am on 500 mg 2x daily.

I am calm happy sleep well and leading a useful healthy life. I only need a very low dose and have no side effects.  My hair is thick and in good condition. My regular blood tests are fine and I havnt put on any weight. For me they are literally a life saver.

Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	5/27/2011 2:44:01 PM	I have been treated for depression and anxiety for over five years.  New Psychiatrist thinks I'm bipolar and I'm taking generic form.  I insisted aftr 9 days to be changed from this medicine.  I hate it! I am now being weaned slowly off this to Lamictal.  I am more manic than ever, can't think, slurred speech swear I can hear my brain waves (no not a headache or ringing in my ears)at times.  Weak, but hyper. I've spent the last 4 days in the bathroom with bowel movement issues, had a super heavy and clotty menstrual cycle, and now I think I have a Urinary Tract infection (burning while peeing for two days).  I am still taking generic xanax, but nothing for the depression.  I see in the webmd warnings that you must be cautious if you have depression and suicidal thoughts.  Not to mention, I'm seeking a new psychiatrist!  I can't wait to be off of this medication- three more days!  
Migraine Prevention	13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	13-18	5/26/2011 3:27:06 PM	The medication was effective for what I needed it to do. My almost every day migraines were reduced to only one or two a month. The issue is I manage to be one of those few people who end up with the depressive/suicidal side effect with just about every medicine I try.

Epileptic Seizure	Josh, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	35-44	5/10/2011 3:05:26 PM	Within 3 months of being put on Depakote I went from 175lbs to 225lbs.  I have also developed chronic diahrea and hand tremors.  The hand tremors have gotten progessively worse throughout the years.  within the last 6 months I have also no been experiencing excessive sleeping.  this has created problems both at work and home.  This med has been great in keeping me seizure free, where several drugs before have failed.  It has been, for me, a matter of which is worse the seizures or the side effects.  Until recently the choice has been easy.  But not with the sleeping problems, I will have to consider again whether or not I want to try a new medication and risk the seizures returning
Bipolar Depression	BradJ217, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male	35-44	5/10/2011 7:07:26 AM	I was prescribed this along with Serequel. After just four days of treatment, I was rushed to the hospital with what turned out to be acute pancreatitis. I spent 22 days in the hospital being tube fed while the pancreatitis subsided. I now have chronic pancreatitis.I read, after the fact, that pancreatitis has occured in others receiving this treatment. It almost cost me my life.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	4/30/2011 1:26:33 PM	Terrible side effects including weight gain that made depression much worse.  Doctors should not just prescribe this med to teens without monitoring side effects. Could never wake up in the morning. Felt like I was walking through fog.  Side effects robbed me of two years of my life - I can barely remember them because of this drug.  It's several years later - I have had great success off medication and have been able to manage depression with diet, exercise, and lots of work. It isn't easy but consider if the drug is adding more symptoms than its relieving if it isn't working. Ask to stop.  
Bipolar Depression	ampierce, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	4/28/2011 5:04:36 PM	My 15 year old son was prescribed Depakote foe bipolar depression after spending 5 days in a behavioral health facility and released from the facility after two days on the medication regardless of my strong concerns of him behaving unlike I had ever seen the night before.  Three days later he was throwing up ever hour for 10 hours and we went to the emergency room.  He was given two IV and his blood tests came up with abnormal liver function.  He was sent home and retested two days later and his range was 6248 - under 100 being normal.  We saw a pediatric specialist today and his liver is swollen two times the normal size and he had additional blood tests and if the levels have not gone down he will be admitted inpatient today.  I will find out in one hour.  I wanted to post and make sure anyone who uses this drug takes extreme caution of the liver.

However, we have recently found out it can cause Pancratits, which it did. It also could very well be the cause of our son's crainosystosis (soft spot in his head closed before he was 6 months old) making it so he had to have surgery to correct it otherwise he would be blind or who know what other problems.

It seems to keep me from getting more depressed and takes away some symptoms of mania.  I did notice that I am getting a lot slower in my mental abilities so that worries me a lot. I also notice that Depakote has also made my vision worse and seems to be slowing my heart rate.  I hope to keep taking it until my symptoms go away completely but I doubt I will ever live a normal life free from bipolar. I only suggest using Depakote if you are severly bipolar type 2.

I also have a tremor in my right hand, and fall asleep every afternoon. It reduced my migraines from 2 per week to 1 per week, which is totally NOT worth the side effects. This is the 13th drug I have tried, but it has been the one with the worst side effects.

Bipolar Depression	RMH, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	2/11/2011 11:21:23 AM	I have been diagnosed with bi-polar in 1994 after high/low mood swings after my last child was born.  My first phychiatrist put me on 1000 mg. Depakote.  He continually monitored my liver enzymes (liver failure in Depakote).  Since then, I have been on Depakote, but recent elevation of liver enzymes caused by MD to stop.  I felt my mood go down the tube and am waiting for blood tests to be taken Monday.  My only real issue that I have incurred with Depakote is a loss of balance, which previously had been perfect; however, being of late on only 250 mg, my balance is unaffected.  Now the company is offering a $50.00 coupon to use since generic divalproex has been introduced.  One week on the generic I became confused and agitated.  I've never been suicidal, but Depakote is the one drug for me!

I now have much more control over these symptoms.  I still have my days when I am depressed or very racy, but they occur less often and less severe.  A few raises in medication have also helped. The only this this medication has not helped with are the symptoms from my panic disorder, the medication seems to make the symptoms worse at times.  Overall the medication in combination with Ambien and Xanax as needed has been very helpful.
Migraine Prevention	65-74 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4		65-74	1/23/2011 9:21:46 PM	After 56 years of looking for relief of chronic migraine, my new neurologist put me on Depakote gradually increasing dosage from 2 to 3 doses of 250 mg per day.  Tired, hair falling out, gained 9 pounds, but migraines are down 90% and the ones I get the pain is much lower.  I can deal with fatigue, will get a hair piece if I have to.  Finally can go out to lunch with my daughter again!!!  And make plans with the friends I have left, not worrying bout having to cancel.  When I do get a  migraine I am comfortable in the knowledge it will not last long when I take the triptrans for it.

I have heard some can gain 60#. I did gain some but not that much and will never recommend this drug to anyone unless they are anorexic.

There are some side effects but they seem to be minimal. I'm taking 500mg 2x a day of depakote and 1/2 to 2 mg of risperdal a day. The side effects I notice are dizziness, trouble concentrating, fatigue, and always hungry and crave beef. Not sure which drug causes what ? I was diagnosed as severe bipolar after taking Cymbalta for depression which threw me into a manic episode which resulted in me being shot nine times with a 45. God still works miracles as I'm still alive. Drugs can help you or hurt you and so can correct or incorrect diagnosis.

So far, I've experienced weight gain and hair loss as side effects but my mood has been stable.  On 500mg 2x per day.  My doctor suggested taking zinc to help with the hair loss and that has helped reduce but not eliminate the hair loss.

Epileptic Seizure	John, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	2	Male	55-64	11/26/2010 6:34:50 PM	For 17 years, totally controlled my simple, partial seizure disorder, which I was diagnosed with at age 43, although I had been having them (approx. 1 every 4 months) since age 13. Took 1,000 mg/day. No observable side-effects except about 10 lb. weight gain. However, about a year ago, I read an article in the popular press about Depakote causing bone thinning. Neither my PCP or neurologist had mentioned this (perhaps because I am a male.) Searching the Internet, I found a number of studies in journals such as Neurology, dating from about 2001, establishing a like between Depakote and osteoporosis.I asked for a bone scan and, sure enough, had osteoporosis, even though I had none of the risk factors. I had no family history, have run for 30 years (weight-bearing exercise strengthens bones), and took calcium supplements.I have gotten off Depakote.Anyone taking Depakote for extended periods of time, in my opinion, should have regular bone scan, one at least every three years. At least one study showed that bone thinning began in as little as one year of use.I am very surprised that information,like the product labeling,  about the side-effects of Depakote rarely mention bone-thinning (WebMD being an exception).

Also on lithium and been taking lithium for 8 months.  Depakote has been very affective for my spending sprees and nervousness.  I used to worry so much even when I was on lithium but this medicine definitely helped.  I noticed I was a little more irritable when I first started taking the medicine but it got better.  Also helps with the headaches I was having.

Where I had my issues was the frequent (but necessary) blood work to assure therapeutic levels and the side effects (weight gain, hair loss, etc). I am completely off Depakote ER now and am attempting to manage my bipolar on my own. I have lost 75 lbs in 7 months. I am doing pretty good but still have my moments. I may need to go back on something but it will not be Depakote in any form!

It was the worst 6 months of my life and really wasn't that effective in controlling the seizures.

Bipolar Depression	storm1230, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/8/2010 10:27:00 AM	I am a 38 yo f with a large very active family. I suffer boughts of severe depression a couple times a mo or so. I am on Pristiq also. The dr prescribed 250 mg Depakote 4x day. I thought that was WAY too much so started out just taking 2 pills a day. Was too tired by 3 pm to keep up with football practices, etc. So I tried just taking one in the morn with my Pristiq. PERFECT!!!! No tiredness, I can't even feel anything from it other than I haven't had those super low days. I have found that I gained just a few pounds due to this crazy craving for ice cream on it..lol But as long as you excersice (which you feel more apt to do when you feel &quot;normal&quot;)and watch your diet like you should to begin with you will be fine. I read all over the internet before taking this med and there are soooo many scary stories. I thought I would be a big fat bald woman or something..I am fine , actually better than ever. Please don't listen to all the hoopla online. Hope this helps someone like me!!

Bipolar Depression	SFWII, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	45-54	8/21/2010 3:54:54 AM	After several attempts at finding the right med. for BPII depression, my psych. started me on an aggresive course of Depakote, while watching lvls. and careful controlling of med. prescribing times, with ample warnings to me and careful consideration unto my situation.  Being that I have BPII, my depressive side can get severely out of control also and I have tried so many of the newer, or better, anti-depressants on this,sometimes, ridiculous market of psychiatric medications.  These meds. would only bump me up into a manic-type state and always leave me worse in the long run.  Depakote seemed to be the ONLY  answer we could agree on and I have remained on it for possibly 20 years now.  Only on an extreme occasion, would another anti-deppresive be ordered, only to fail, in the short course of sometimes, days. So, basically, we,ve remained with Depakote thoughout the long-haul of BPII depression.  Sorry to be so run-on, but it's been over two decades working with this medication unto ongoing treatment.   Depakote can help to control symptoms, offer stabillaty where allowed and offer quite few side-effects, in the more, short-term usage.  That is as far as I am concerned.  I would have to say GOOD CHOICE, sometimes the older ones may be the better ones, all things considered.  One more thought, if I may, be SURE to work closely with your' Dr. concerning long-term usuage, such as with my case, as this is imperative for psycho/somatic health.  Teamwork is so important concerning your overall health, choose your' Dr. wisely, He/She will be working best with you when all bases are covered unto prescribing Depakote and any testing of it that should be involved.

I was nervous about taking depakote since I heard it makes you tired, and with taking my other meds, I can't afford to be any more tired!  But my doc insisted I try it, since Prozak just made me suicidal and even crazier.  The one side effect I seem to notice is that, instead of making me tired, it does the opposite - seems to cancel out the sleeping effect of the ativan!!  It's been a rough couple of days, with having to work a full time job and take care of my family on almost no sleep.  Id like to know if anyone else is having the same problem???  I even have tried having a cocktail or 2 in the evening w/ my meds to help me fall asleep, but to no avail....  HELP!!!  The med works w/ my severe mood swings, but I need to sleep too!

Both my psychiatrist and I believe I don't need to be on divalproex any longer, so I have been reducing from 750mg since mid-July. So far so good, I am down to 500mg, and will begin reducing again next week. I have not had a manic episode in over a year, which is one reason why I am discontinuing the meds, but I also don't know the full effect of the drug on my system, so I'd rather be off than playing russian roulette with my organs. I would recommend this drug, as I was taking Lithium and was still cycling fairly often.

Now it is August and I still get nauseous/vomit 3x a month along with 1-2 migraines a month. I have also noticed my hair has been really coming out. I also in April found out I have an elevate thyroid level so that could have something to do with the hair loss but not the other stuff. I take this for severe depression along with Abilify. I feel okay on it but honestly feel I would be just as fine being on Abilify by itself.
Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	7/29/2010 10:08:43 AM	This drug nearly ruined my life. I crashed 2 cars while taking it. I had no sense of distance or depth and could barely walk. I fell almost every day and needed constant support. I experienced extreme fatigue and disorientation, falling asleep while I was driving as well as the moment I arrived at my destination. DO NOT DRIVE ON THIS DRUG UNTIL YOU HAVE FULLY EXPERIENCED ITS SIDE-EFFECTS! It severely impaired my brain function and I was nearly unable to speak; it was as if I'd had a stroke. I do not discount that it may be effective for certain people and agree that side-effects will be different for each individual, but from MY experience, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS DRUG ALTOGETHER. Discuss all the options with your doctors and use this as a last resort.

My side affects were feeling like I was running a fever, actually felt like I was catching a cold, with lots of sneezing, I was on a different mood stabilizer that did the same thing.  I was still have the mood swings, with unwarranted crying spells.

Epileptic Seizure	ljr75, 3-6 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) 	5	5	4	Male	3-6	6/26/2010 11:19:20 AM	My son began taking this medicine when he was diagnosed with occipital epilepsy at age 3 (he is now 5 1/2). I immediately noticed side effects: his hands became very shaky (to the point where he quite drawing and coloring), he complained of dizziness and had frequent nightmares.  After a few months of use, my son would know when it was time to take it because the shaking/dizziness would worsen if we were late or missed a dose.  However, it works very well for him. Aside from having to have his blood tested for liver enzymes every 6 months, he has had only two seizures since he began taking it. We have learned to deal with the side effects. He no longer uses coloring books but rather draws freehand so he doesn't have to worry about going outside the lines, and we got a dreamcatcher for his nightmares, and he doesn't complain of bad dreams near as much. Overall, it has been well worth it.

Depakote worked great at killing my emotions, but I was highly allergic to it my body started to get so itchy and my throat started to close up. Please trust your intution if you think something is wrong talk to your doctor at once. It would have been great if I hadn't been so allergic to it. Good Luck!!

I used to be on lithium. I went toxic on lithium and it wasn't very good. The only problem i have is that it makes me have itchy rashes once in a while. My doctor said it is nothing to worry about. I am very happy on Depakote and i have been stable since i started taking it.

The first Psychiatrist I saw prescribed this to me.  I have had my name CLEARED by other Psychiatrist, confirming that I do not even have Bipolar Disorder.As for this medication, this is absolutely garbage.  It causes intense weight gain, hair loss, and dulling of emotions.  When you take this, you can't remember things as well either, and all creativity is lost.  What's worse is, that when taken, it only works temporarily, and then you have to keep increasing the dosage because your body gets used to it.  Don't take this medication.

My body got use to the dose and the doctor increased the dose. I immediatly noticed joint and muscle pain, and a pain running from my abdomin through my right testicle to about a 6&quot; down my leg. I backed off the drug and it no longer had the same effect. On the good side I had no emotions, no fear, no remourse, no cares when people die, it made me laugh at pain, when people got injured, when people fall down stairs,ect. I eventually dropped off and went on lithium. &quot;DO NOT TAKE LITHIUM&quot; look at the side effects. Now I have problems with my thyroid from Lithium. I'm dropping lithium and going back on depakote in the hopes my thyroid will function properly concidering I just started Lithium!

I couldn't sit still for 3 minutes, and my knees would bounce on their own--I couldn't even visit friends and relatives because I was constantly in motion. I felt more manic.  It was so bad that after a while on the Depakote, I felt as if I were being poisoned, and as if my blood was crawling, if you can imagine that.....The second I stopped the Depakote, the symptoms stopped, but I don't know what damage there will be in the future--The lab tests always showed &quot;high&quot; for valproic acid, which is not good, but my doctor did nothing about that. Eventually, I was getting more and more depressed and more suicidal, and the Depakote was supposed to be being used as a mood stabilizer! For me, my experience with Depakote was a nightmare, only it was real.

For some people it works when their body accepts it,but for some it doesnt. In my case,my body didnt accept it. The med ate away at my stomach lining which made me vomit non stop, it gave me double vision, I couldnt walk in a straight line and I couldnt hold anything solid down. It also gave me dizziness and made me very weak. I suggest you look more into this med before taking it because for some its dangerous to take.

This was the second medication she had been placed on to treat condition. In the beginning she experienced the typical temporary hair loss. And has gained some weight. About 4 months ago she was diagnosed with ADHD and began taking medication for that. Although a recent 23 hour EEG still showed some seizure activity I have not noticed any in over two years.  So for the most part I think the medicine has worked.  My only concern is she is now showing some signs of depression and I am not sure if this is related to the medicine.

I have been able to control some of the dizziness by eating a small amount of something that contains, protein, carbs, fat, and a little sugar...a regular well balanced meal.  Depakote does not &quot;make you gain weight&quot; like Lithium does, as Lithium an slow the metabolism.  Keep healthy food in the house and eat that when you are hungry, as Depakote affects your appetite, not your metabolism.

I have only been taking the Depakote for one week and I am extremely dizzy, have double-vision, diarrhea, and loss of appetite with weight loss.  It also seems as if I am having trouble maintaining body temp, as it will drop to 96.5.  If I bundle up it will raise to 98 but as soon as I get out from under the blankets, it drops back into the 96 area.

Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed	Moi,  Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	1	1	1	Male		3/2/2010 2:57:28 AM	I was on this drug for quite a few years as a child and teenager. It didn't solve any problems but in my case it caused muscular degeneration. When I complained about how weak I felt, the Doctors attributed it to symptoms of the Bipolar and didn't take me seriously. It progressed into bed wetting problems, as I no longer had enough muscle control to control my bladder. When I was 18 the damage was so bad I suffered from asthma. I finally had enough, and took myself off medications all together in October of 2002. I hoarded the medications, waiting for a doctor note to show improvement was noted. Once I had it, I told him I wasn't taking medications and successfully forced him to concede that in my case they were causing most of my problems. It has been over 7 years since I have been on drugs. I still have symptoms of Bipolar, but I control it with Meditation. Not Medication. But the muscular degeneration was so bad that I still suffer some of the damage. I only last year recovered controller of my bladder, and this year I am getting back muscle tone around my body. As far as I am concerned, if I continued taking this drug I would be dead now. Instead, I am a home owner with a perfect credit score and I lead a productive and full filling life. I just learned to create goals for myself as a way of dealing with the depression, and use common sense for dealing with the anxiety. No one should take this drug if you feel yourself getting weak.

I had shakes so bad that I couldnt hold a piece of paper in my hand. My son &amp; ex had to endure my extreme sadness &amp; people watching because I looked like I was a junkie trying to get clean! I gained 60 pounds in 1 MONTH &amp; have all the strech markes to prove it! It looks like I had radical surgery! I think that Dr.s should do a chemical check on each patient before giving drugs like this!I was 1 of the first lab rats for this medicine without even knowing!!!! After 5 or so months of taking the medicine I walked in the Dr.'s office &amp; told him that if he didnt take me off this drug he would have a dead patient on his hands! I couldnt live with any of the side effects. As a human I think that we should be able to think at least enough to live life a little even if it is limited!! I see that this drug has helped some &amp; done others really bad like me I just wish they had this page back when I took this meds because my ex would have screamed it from the roof tops to get me some what to my self again!

The first medicine I was given was Depakote. My seizures were completely controlled for 3 years. Then, they returned. I had about 3-4 grand mal seizures in one year. So my doctor changed medication to Lamictal, I lost twenty pounds in 1 month! But, it did not control my seizures at all. At that time I was having 2 grand mal seizures a month. I went back to Depakote and of course gained the 20 pounds back plus 10 more! I have been on Depakote now since then. It absolutely controls my grand mal seizures, but it does not control twitching/tremors. But, like everyone else I absolutely HATE the side effects of this medicine. I am incredibly tired, moody, zombie-like, and I've experienced the weight gain. If I miss one dose I get the WORST migraine ever!!! Also, it is expensive with or without insurance. W/o insurance it cost me around $289 with my insurance it cost me $100. Because they offer a generic they jacked up the price for the &quot;non-preffered brand name&quot;. What they need to understand is the generic doesn't work for everyone. It didnt work for me. I had even more tremors and had the feeling of an aura all the time, I couldn't function.

Mostly weight gain and nausea that keeps me up at nights. It worked wonderfully at first, but now it's not really doing anything at all. The side effects aren't really worth it. It's supposed to prevent, but it doesn't. I get a migraine almost every single day. My doctor believes that I need to stay on it to make sure that it's not an external condition affecting the situation, but if I had it my way, I'd be off of it. That's what I get for being a minor...

First off for an unexplainable tremor in my right side, and &quot;zoning&quot; out. I also suffered from MULTIPLE migraines that would last from 10 sec. to 5+ hours.And it is to be believed that I may also have a Bipolar disorder was started on a 500 Mg. every night then after a small stay at the local &quot;Federation Funny Farm&quot; (aka psychiatric hospital) my dose went up to 750 MG and now I am stable. and I have not had any bad migraines since.

No prior family history.  No serious depression to speak of either. I have been taking Depakote for 5 years and my mania is under control.  I have experienced some weight gain, minor hair loss, and am more emotional (tears of joy sort of thing that some men may have a problem accepting).  But overall I feel better and am happy.  I avoid alcohol because more than one drink can make me feel depressed.  I take two 250mg tabs at bedtime and one 250mg tab in the morning.  I didn't have any problem when I was switched to the generic.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	12/16/2009 9:51:25 PM	I must say writing any reviews for meds that help treat any type of bipolar disorder is kind of a waste. I've real a lot and everyone's body/brain chemistry is soo different.But for me Depakote is one of (I believe 1--13) drugs I've taken for my bipolar disorder that has helped.  But it deft. does make you gain weight but not as much as I thought. All the meds over the past 4 yrs have so I'm battling it on my own.Also -I read it's good for ppl who get headaches? Well ever since begining my frequent headaches have become daily. I'm currently recieveing accupunture for relief. And I've had hair loss which I believe is a result of this drug. But overall I believe it's helped. But I also give myself credit because I go to therapy on a regular basis andreally try to control my moods the best I can. So it's hard to tell what's making the difference. I kinda don't believe in any of the psych meds...that's a whole nother story

I was devastated when the psych diagnosed me. The doctor prescribed Depakote and I don't recall looking into the drug prior to ingesting it. I remember experiencing very VIVID dreams. They were quite scary and seemed very real to me. When I brought this to the physician's attention, he informed me, the drug had to be in my system for more than 2 weeks in order to experience the effectiveness. The physician never went over any of the side effects and basically told me I was crazy and I wasn't experiencing what I was experiencing. I was also having hallucinations. I was sleeping during the day and could not sleep at night. I was freaking out and felt like I wanted to die. My best friend was mortified. That was not the person she knew. I wasn't the person that anyone knew. I have since stopped taking the drug. Reading all of these reviews just reminds me of why I'd never begin taking it ever again. Please check with your physician in reference to the various side effects prior to taking this drug. I think there should be a CLASS ACTION suit against the drug Depakote!!

I was on it for over 2 years and it never did anything for me but give me horrible nightmares. I could not function as a normal person while on it. I was always in a daze, did not want to do anything, plus thoughts of suicide played a big part in my everyday life while on this drug. Its been well over a year since I stopped taking this medication and could not feel better. I still have bipolar and will never get rid of it but I rather live with the symptoms of bipolar then take this crap!

My husband found me unresponsive, but breathing.  My nurologist placed me on several other meds which I was allergic to. I never had a problem with Depakote. I was placed on Keppra in May 2009, because neurologist said my heart doctor had recommended it.  My heart is fine it beats fast because of being on my blood pressure medication so long. The Keppra made me sleep all day for days. I've been off it for several months and have finally stop getting so sleepy.  The doctor said it is out of my system, but I still get sleeply a little. I have my liver and other tests done twice a year, and so far I've been blessed with no problems.  I have broken out with white spots that I was afraid was an allergy to Depakote or was vitiligo. They both have been ruled out, but I am going to have a second opinion made.

I wasnt sure at all why I've been so tired and have had near constant ringing in my ears til I started reading these posts.  Have had 2 migraines since increasing dosage 2 weeks ago.

I am very hungry and have gained 5 lbs. in 3 weeks. I also have a Hypothyroidism and I do not need to gain any weight. I struggle with my weight already. When I have been sleeping, I wake myself up jumping and I have felt nauseous a few times. I was taking Toamax 450mg. for several years and had lost 30lbs. but continued to have headaches, my Dr. decided that the Topamax was a failure. I can' take any of the migraine medications such as Zomig, Imitrex etc. They have not worked for me. I just wish that there was something to take that did not make you gain weight. I have high blood pressure and asthma and I do not need the extra weight.

This last bump was a week ago and i'm zombie like till 1pm.  Hopefully it will resolve.  Still a great med, but it has the comman side effects of fourty pounds of wieght gain and NO SEX DRIVE.

I have been on Depakote ER in increasing dosages over the years and have been on it for 7 years. Yes, trying to wean off by myself caused an increase in the # of migraines. The pain of my migraines has diminished over time, but the # of them (one every two weeks) has remained the same. I also was put on Amitriplyline and Propranalol while I was on the Depakote ER and still no change. I FINALLY AFTER 8+ YEARS WAS TOLD THEY HAD NO MORE OPTIONS FOR ME - Topmax didn't help, I tried massage therapy and even had a test run at a sleep lab for sleep apnea, and went to a chiropractor. When the chiropractor couldn't ease them, she recommended an ACUPUNTURIST - I'VE BEEN MIGRAINE FREE SO FAR. PRAISE THE LORD!

After being FLAGRANTLY MIS-DIAGNOSISED, and USING IT FOR 6 DAYS, I COULDN'T WRITE, WALK,  STAND UP, or EVEN REMEMBER SIMPLE COMPUTER ACCESS PASSWORDS.  SOME QUACKS, CLINICS and HOSPITALS WILL DO ANYTHING TO CREATE ILLNESSES IN HEALTHY PATIENTS to MAKE MONEY and CREATE PERMANENT PATIENTS. USING DEPACOTE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WILL CAUSE THE ONSET OF MANY PERMANENT PHYSICAL and MENTAL ILLNESSES, COMA, and EVEN THE POSSIBILIY of SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH.

DOCTORS TRIED ME ON MANY SEIZURE MEDICINES, BUT NONE COMPLETELY CONTROLED MY SEIZURES UNTIL AGE 25 WHEN THEY PUT ME ON DEPAKOTE.  SIDE EFFECTS WERE NON-EXISTENT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WEIGHT GAIN.  I WENT FROM 145 LBS TO 230 LBS IN 8 MONTHS.  OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS I GREW TO A TOTAL WEIGHT OF 305 LBS.  WHEN MY HEALTH WORSENED WITH HIGH CHOLESTEROL AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, I ASKED THE DOCTORS TO TAKE ME OFF THE DRUG AND TRY ANY NEW DRUGS THAT HAD APPEARED ON THE MARKET IN THE LAST 20 YEARS.  POSSIBLY THERE WAS ONE OUT THERE THAT WOULD HELP ME WITHOUT THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECT.  THE DOCTORS DIDN'T BELIEVE MY WEIGHT WAS CAUSED FROM THE DEPAKOTE.  NOT THAT MUCH ANYWAY.  THEY DID TAKE ME OFF THE DRUG AND I LOST 110 LBS IN 10 MONTHS.  I DEFLATED JUST AS I HAD INFLATED ON THE DRUG.  BUT, AFTER 3 YEARS OF TRYING OTHER MEDICINES, LOSING MY JOB AND DAMN NEAR LOSING MY MIND, I WENT BACK TO THE DEPAKOTE, AND GLADLY.  THE DRUG WORKS FOR ME, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE WEIGHT GAIN, AND YES, IN A YEAR I BALLOONED AGAIN AND AM NOW AT 270 LBS.  BUT, I HAVE MY MIND AND AM FUNCTIONAL AGAIN.  I HAVE TAKEN THE ATTITUDE OF, IT'S THE QUALITY OF LIFE NOT THE QUANTITY.  SO, IF MY OTHER HEALTH ISSUES CUT MY LIFE SHORT, AT LEAST I AM ABLE TO FUNCTION IN EVERY DAY LIFE.  TO THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT FULLY PLEASED WITH THIS DRUG, GIVE IT A CHANCE AND RESPECT IT AS I HAVE HAD TO. - SIGNED, BETTER OFF WITH DEPAKOTE

You will see immediate results as your chemical balance stabilizes.What Depakote basically does I believe.

It works good for that. Migraines were ruining my life. The other side is that I have gained forty pounds and have no appetite. I actually don't look forward to eating. I sleep better but am numb to big events. Hard to explain. It works for what it was prescrbed for.

When I went to 4 a night every joint in my body started to ache. When I dropped back down to 3 tabs, aces decreased but medication was not effective anymore. Was taken of medication slowly (tried to commit suicide while dropping off). Don't quit without doctors permission!!!Now I take tegatrol and I am starting to get joint pain again.

Epileptic Seizure	Goode papa, 65-74 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	1		65-74	6/9/2009 1:01:45 PM	My dad is 69 years old with Generalized Epilepsy.  He also has sleep apnea that brought on seizures after several seizure free years (atleast grand mal seizures) After being put in a coma to stop seizures he was put on depakote, this drug has dimenished his capacity for a normal life.  It stopped the seizures however, he has no guality of life at all, he shuffles, falls, get's confused and sleeps all the time.  He went from playing ball each and every day to having the inablity to throw a ball at all.  He shakes uncontrollabley and is cold all the time.  He has to have his blood level checked as well because of the medication.  We have seen his Nuerologist and GP, and know one seems to want to change anything.  He also has bathroom accidents. He is required to take 3000 mg of the medication daily.  This man went from active gardner, took care of lawns and played with his grandchildren continuously to a person that sleeps all day, can't walk unassisted and gets confussed very easily.  We will continue to look for different avenues and may have to result in taking him out of our city to another city for help.  It breaks our families heart to watch such a strong man become such a sad weak man that can barely hold a spoon. Really check out your doctor and drug prescriptions.

Manic-Depression	Mom, 75 or over Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	4	4	4	Male		5/21/2009 12:58:01 PM	My Mom is 92 years old. She lives in a retirement community with a level 2 condition of care (not assisted or Altzheimers). She is outgoing , walks slowly with a three wheeler and has a smile most of the time.  Mos was given Depakote while at a local hospital for treatment of a &quot;near collapse condition&quot; with low blood pressure,gastointestinal infection   and heart irregularities. She was treated successfully over about 10 days and released back to her senior living residence. At the dinner table she quickly became agitated, yelling out her name continually. She was also counting repeatedly and with determination. She was usually calm and peaceful before all of this reaction. It turns out that the hospital had been giving her Depakote successfully. The residence nurse and manager did not track with that and the  Depakote  was mistakenly not continued. We, the family, discovered the error by a tip and notified the management who quickly restored the Depakote. Mom's condition improved like a miracle.  She is still on a mild dose and is loving and cheerful again. Be cautious of long term dosages. Craig Beam, son

My mood swings were awful.  I take 500mg and now my mood swings are under control, but I am very nauseous, not really stomach pains, more like intestinal pains, but not gas, more like cramps  Very very uncomfortable. I have only been on this for about 4 months and my doctor just raised my dosage to 500mg.  I take wellbutrin and ambien with it also.  I know it isn't the wellbutrin and the ambien cause I didn't have these side effects until the doctor raised the depakote to 500mg.

To All MIGRAINE Sufferers- My Doc just prescribed Depakote for depression. I didn't know that it was used to help with migraines until I started reading about it here on webmd. I haven't started it yet, but have to let people know about my migraines. They started when I was 4 (now I am 40) I suffered severely until about 10 years ago. I was then prescribed ELAVIL! It changed my life. Hardly ever get the migraines. Started on low dose, slowly increased to 50 mgs.Went up tp 100 mgs, but then had side effects, which I NEVER have at 50mgs. At 50 mgs, no side effects and almost no migraines. If you get migraines, TRY ELAVIL!!It was seriously life changing.

The side effects listed on the warning label are identical to those of Parkenson's. When he began taking Depakote, he immediately had severely debilitating side effects. He had no energy, severe muscle weakness, dizzyness, and has not been able to do much except for sleep and sit in a chair all day. His muscles have almost completely atrophied and he is in a rehabilitation center trying to get enough strength in his muscles to be able to walk again. Right now, as a result of this medication, he is at the end stages of Parkenson's, which eventually results in death. Luckily, I figured out that he doesn't actually need to be taking any anti-convulsants at all, because he has been seizure free for 5 years now. I believe that his seizures were caused by a heart condition that he was diagnosed with 5 years ago called Atrial Fibrillation. We are now tapering him off of Depakote,(even though his doctor would not agree to it)and after only 3 weeks of a decrease in medication(from 1000mg/day to 750mg/day)in combination with physical therapy, my father's Parkenson's symptoms are actually reversing! Six weeks ago, we thought were going to loose him. His energy, strength and balance are now returning to him, and he is making remarkable strides on his road to recovery. My only advice to those with epilepsy is to find the cause, and treat from there. Seizures are a major warning sign that something is wrong. Medications  may control the episodes in the meantime, but in the long term you end up toxifying the body. Those toxins then buildup in your nervous system, and cause it to deteriorate. Meanwhile, your &quot;alarm system&quot; isn't going off anymore, and now you are headed for even more serious danger. You will have better luck curing the seizures if you find the cause and treat from there. Those w/nervous system problems should detox.

I almsot ended up in the hospital from a crazy mood swing it gave me. It took two weeks for me to get back to &quot;normal&quot; and clean from the medicine. I hated this medication!

Bipolar Depression	Greyhound, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	2	Male	25-34	3/11/2009 9:30:03 AM	I have been taking Depakote along with Wellbutrin for about a month.  I'm taking the Depakote, 250mg, twice a month.  Not feeling any better, if anything, feeling worse.  I've been on the Wellbutrin for several years so I know it's not that.  Plus the Depakote is going through my system within several hours and comes out completely intact in my diarrhea like stool.

Epileptic Seizure	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	3	1	3	Female	25-34	3/8/2009 2:56:19 PM	My son is eight years old and was diagnosed with a seizure disorder.  They put him on Depakote in dec of 08.  They had him on too much of the medicine and it was making him toxic and cause status eplieptus (sp).  I would like to first say to the lady who lost her son I am so sorry for your loss.  I'd also like to know if they checked his liver on a regular basis. They check my sons every two to four weeks due to the magnitude of side effects he has on this medication.  Thank you for your post it is very helpful in making sure they continue to do this.
Manic Phase of Manic-Depression	vjn, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	3/7/2009 12:27:31 PM	I have been diagnosed as a manic/depressive for years, been through therapy, etc, and for the past 5 years just took 5 mg valium 4x day.  My doctor gave me this pill without checking any blood work, was not informed of side effects.  Took 1 250 mg pill yesterday and woke up this morning at 7 am, hands/face swollen, tremors, stomach cramps, exhausted, confused, blurry vision, heart racing....if this is for the manic phase, all it did was make it worse, and I had suicidal thoughts....I wouldn't take this pill (and it was to be increased to 3 per day)again.  I do not beleieve Dr's even listen to patients anymore, they seem to think a pill can cure anything.  I have other complications and need surgury, but they put all that off.  I'll just wait until I'm able to go take a walk again and dig in the dirt and plant a garden during a manic episode, but this was HORRIBLE.... life is too short, and I feel this would make my life even shorter.  Cannot even concentrate.

The medicine caused bad facial break-outs for about 4 years, but those stopped after I used proactiv, and then they generally stopped without it. I also gained weight for a couple of years-I'm thin anyway so it wasn't a terrible problem-but I am back to my normal weight now. My seizures were caused by a head injury in 2001, and I was having significant numbers of grand mal seizures after the injury. Depakote usually controls my seizures, but I still generally have 1 or 2 per year. I have had 6 seizures in the last year, and I am probably going to take my full 1000mg per day, but there are some mental and physical side effects-it is hard to decide if I should take my full dosage and I am having money problems so it is hard to see my doctor to discuss this with him (I am currently on the patient assistance program.) I can say that I was taking effexor that controlled my panic disorder, and the increased seizures started after I began taking that medication. I am currently not taking it because while it did stop my panic attacks, there were the increased seizures, and sexual side effects that the effexor had on me.

I want to go off but can't seem to. If anyone has any suggestions please put in a review. I did try Topamax and it was a nightmare experiance for me.Had every severe side effect on the list. HELP

I take 500mg. just before bedtime. I am supposed to take 1000mg.,however I am trying to take least as possible to prolong the introduction of known side effects (weight gain, hair loss,liver&amp;pancreas damage etc.)Migraines are minimal and the convulsive seizure activity that would accompany the migraines afterward during sleep have stopped completely. My brain doesn't seem to race all the time. I am a business owner and this has helped to settle my brain from so much unnecessary worry and also allows for some great restful sleep. I would recommend if you take at 8pm., try to get 7 hours sleep. You will feel like a champ when you get out of the shower the next morning.
Bipolar Depression	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	2/12/2009 3:58:58 PM	I have only been on Depakote for almost 2 weeks but after years or ups and downs and recently months of mean moods, I do feel good.  I feel better than I have in years.  The only tears I cry though are for the hair loss and weight gain, something I couldn't afford before.  My kids and husband are worth it though.

Migraine Prevention	A.I., 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	3	4	3	Female	13-18	2/4/2009 11:31:03 PM	My 16yr old daughter just started this feb 09 after almost 1 month in Jan of suffering from a continuous,completely-debilitating migrane that her dr could not get a handle on. She suffered her first migrane only 2 months before. Tried some of the other meds (triptane) but b/c of slow heart rate (since birth) couldn's use the propanolol type meds. After 6 days in hospital (dr. did a lp w/o success &amp; b/c of pain to back/head she had to go to er). Her new dr. has her on the Depakote. She is having the nausea and is really sleepy but so far this is the only side effect. She is on 500mg,am&amp;pm; her dr. also has her on Amitriptyline 10mg in p.m. Anyone out there using this combination? if so, how is it working and any side effects? This has been such a tramatic experience for us! All your comments are greatly appreciated. Until her first migrane episode in early Dec, she was completley healthy. She has not been able to go to school; the migranes have completely changed her life and our entire family.

Bipolar Depression	Configurator, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	1/28/2009 5:18:19 PM	Have bipolar disorder 2. Starting at age 52 I took Depakote for one month before combining it with Paxil. During that first month my mental sexual desire declined greatly, and it became difficult to have an orgasm - lack of sensitivity. Depakote and Paxil have solved by bipolar problem but the sexual side effect has been constant these past 6-7 years. I'm tired of this side effect so I'm going to my psychiatrist soon to discuss other options.

My son started having seizures when he was 2 and a half, he was on carbitrol and it did not work, they finally decided to put him on depakote and he stopped having seizures and has now been seizure free and off meds for almost 2 years. This drug really worked for us, I know that it might not work for everyone, and nobody wants to be medicated or have their child on medication.  But there is hope, so it might not be a good drug for some people, but for us it did work.  god bless everybody that has to deal with a seizure disorder or epilepsy.

At the beginning, I experienced weight gain, upset stomach, and groggy feeling throughout the day. I still experience sleepiness, but would rather deal with having to take a small nap each day than having to deal with my manic and depressive eopisodes. I use it in combination with Prozac and Buspar (Ativan to sometimes help with anxiety attacks)

I have not had a manic cycle in years. I do admit if I don't take Xanax during PMS I am prone to mood swings. However, I think and so does my doctor that even if I was not Bipolar I would probably feel the same way during PMS. Some women just have mood swings during their period worse than others.

I am a 32 year old woman who was diagnosed bi-polar/ocd when I was 15.  I have been on depakote in combination with lexapro, and topamax... for over 8 months after 16 years of being on a roller coaster looking for the right combinations, I finally feel normal. When I first started taking the combination, I was tired, but once the levels were balanced in my system, everything was great. Make certain to express any issues with your doctor.... not all meds work for all people.

I always knew with the psychiatric drugs, there is a decrease in libido, but my libido became pretty much non-existent and never really came back the entire time I was on the medication.  It felt like I just sort of existed and not much else.  I was extremely passive and gained a substantial amount of weight. In addition to all this, I seemed to have a creative block and a lack of interest in anything.  It felt like I was in a consistent lull.  I tried adjusting my dose with the help of y psychiatrist, but I had the same effects. I even tried adjusting when I took my medication and how I took it.  I tried taking it with food and without food.   With water and then tried taking it with a full glass of milk. Nothing changed and so I eventually, against medical advice, went off of the medication  (all of them).

(my myoclonic seizures are rare, and I'm not particularly bothered by them.) It's the generalized tonic clonic seizures that I want to eliminate.I was on this drug for 11 years with no GTCs.  However, I had been experiencing some depression, which I attributed to the Depakote.  I switched to Lamictal, and within three months had a GTC.  My dose has been increased, but if I have another GTC, I'm going to ask to switch back.

Me and my boyfriend got along wonderfully but now I'm taking another pill and I can tell a difference. I'm basically back to my moody self and hate it. I have a re-check next week.

Living with bi-polar type 2 for 10 years and having tried EVERYTHING else out there, I finally agreed last fall. I was always afraid to take it because of the weight gain issue, because I am already overweight.  I did gain 15 pds. but if I had know 10 years ago how good this would make me feel, I'd have tried it immediately.

Before I began taking it, I would go blind and suffer through extremely painful migraines, after I would feel hung over for a full day.  I have only had 1 episode since, and I think it was due to the flashing lights in the corner of my left eye (which is the sensitive one).  I really havn't had any bad side effects, but then again I could just be used to trying out so many perscriptions that I am so used to feeling the shakes lol.  Over all I am satisfied.

Other	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	25-34	6/11/2008 7:28:30 PM	well, I have been prescribed this medication but by the name of Epival ER 500mg only 1 pill at night at the same time each time...well I try to just take it at night.  I don't quite understand fully why the doc gave me this...I had been taking Tramadol for my lower back which I injured at work over 2 1/2 yrs ago.  I received 2 epidurals, therapy, and acupunture.  Back to today, so far I don't feel the need or urgency of that other medication because yes, even though one of my doc's told me it was not habit forming...I believe on the contrary.  The new doctor tells me that this medication should reverse the effects of any kind of thoughts that my brain signals of nerve pain to me and lets me control my thoughts on it.  Sure it sounds strange but pain killers no matter what dose are quite contagious.  I feel fine, I haven;t gained weight like everyone else that has posted here.  I feel happy and healthy so far.  I am supposed to continue on this med for more than a month.

Migraine Prevention	AT41, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	25-34	6/2/2008 4:30:11 PM	I have been taking Depakote for 2 months, before that I suffered daily with migraines.  I have noticed that I am not waking up with a migraine anymore...but it has become much harder to get up period.  I have been experiencing what I believe to be tremors...it feels like short bolts of lightening going through me randomly.  My appetite has grown and I have put on weight.  I also just got off of Lexapro and have felt very confused mentally.  It made be the Lexapro withdrawal, or the Depakote showing its true colors.  I don't know.  I have been feeling manic, somewhat lost, but mostly just tired and headache free which has been the most important to me.  At some point you have to weigh your option of which would you rather deal with...the headache or all the side effects without having the migraines. my job has suffered due to all the migraine problems and Depakote has let me get back to &quot;normal life.&quot;  
Bipolar Depression	KristiBear, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	3	Female	35-44	5/29/2008 4:02:00 PM	My 14 y/o daughter was hospitalized in January and diagnoised Rapid Cycle Bi-Polar,with auditory hallucinations.  We tried lots of different meds (Geodon,which was very very scary!!! Abilify-which did not stop the voices, and currently on Seroquel-which is working great!) but the one consistant med has been the Depakote.  500mg in the AM and 750mg in the PM, and it has been wonderful at keeping her fairly stable mood wise, no more massive manic ups and downs.  The downside to this medication has been the drastic weight gain and some hair loss, but other then that, this drug has definitely made a huge difference in her moods.

I had a brain hemmorage at age 32 and hve been on phenobarbital since then for what has been called sensory seisures.  My left side goes numb and feels like pins are sticking in me until the seisure works its way out.  I am now 60 and up until two years ago was able to function normally, except for bouts of depression.  I am small framed, never weighing over 115 lbs. until now.  This is the only new medicine I am taking.  I attribute my weight gain to this medication.

I told my doctor I was not going to take any more.  Had a scary episode and decided to try one more.  She has me only up to 500 mg and I feel great.  I am also on Clonazapam to help with anxiety but am trying to get off that.  I sleep good, eat well and life is normal again.  The only thing is the sexual side effects. Such as not wanting to have it at all and when I do it seems impossible to have an orgasm.

Was overweight... not bad but did bother me.. hair loss... not that bad but i did notice it. ended up with cysts in ovaries last year.. treated the cysts with birth control and it went away, but i'm assuming it came back since my heavy non-stopping period came back when i stopped birth control... i recently (2 weeks) switched to Keppra and although am still feeling the side effects, i have lost 22 lbs and am still loosing weight BY THE DAY!! Have lost some appetite, which is fine with me-- it's not that i'm not eating at all, i just eat less or enough for my body... my period stopped about 2/3 days ago...although i'm not sure if it's because of the Keppra or because I stopped taking Depakote or because the cysts are gone... will have to see if i start having regular periods next month.all and all, i hated this drug...  it did keep me from having regular seizures-- i did have like 1 seizure in maybe 6-8 months, but the side effects really sucked...

Migraine Prevention	REEBEERENEE, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	4/4/2008 8:50:28 AM	I've been taking Depakote, 500 mg in the am and 500 mg at bedtime for 14 years now... my new neurologist just did a blood test on me a month ago and found that my Depakote level was low, so he increased my dosage, so now I take 1,000 mg at bedtime, and 500 mg in the am. I am 100% permanently and fully disabled for migraine headaches, for the rest of my life, and have been, for many, many years now... and Depakote has been one of the few meds that my doc. has kept me on, because of the neurotransmitter effect that ties in with the migraines... read up here on WebMD on Depakote, and it will tell you all about the neurotransmitters and how they affect migraine headaches... and Depakote happens to be one of the drugs that deals with those neurotransmitters, putting them in the proper balance, and therefore, relieving the migraine(s) before they even occur for the patient. (us!)  So anyway, that's how I understand it on my end, after just reading up on it... feel free to read up on it yourself in these pages... my biological mother died of an anneurysm when I was only 4 yrs. old and she was 27 so it runs in my family... she too, had terrible, daily migraine headaches, as I have had for many, many years. Depakote has been working for me, for the entire time I've taken it, and I don't see anything wrong with it.  That's my opinion and my experience with this particular medication. I hope this can be of help to some other people out there.

All of the side effects from previous drugs made it harder to deal with than bi-polar itself.  Her doctor then had her start depakote last fall and she did well for a month and half so he doubled it..not sure why. Then she started having the shakes real bad and would be dizzy and stmbled into to things. We were so worried she would break a hip. The doctor pulled her off of it for a couple weeks then started her back to original dose and she's do better. She still tends to feel a little loopy from the meds...but we all agree (her included) that is better than the ups and downs of bi-polar. Treating any depression is so tricky as everyone's body chemistry is different. It takes patience and love and a very good support system for folks suffering.  God bless anyone who has a loved one or is dealing with this themselves.

Within a week of starting the depakote, they stopped. I haven't seen one since, and as of his last eeg, he showed no signes of seizures, and was slowly taken off it. It's been a miracle for us. It was the first thing we tried and we were blessed. He was 8 when he was diagnosed, and is 10 now.

(small dose - maybe 500 mg?)  Since coming home, she's not doing well, seems very &quot;out of it&quot; and falls a lot...  any thoughts?  I'm going to ask her doctor to take her off of it - I think it's contributing to her downfall....

My only concern is that when you miss a dosage, due to the interaction with Bipolar disorder - it affects your ability to function slightly, thus making it more likely that you'll miss your next dosage, etc.

I just wanted to say how much I love this feeling.  I'm off of Seroquel and I don't feel like I'm about to slip into a coma for the first night in three years.  Side effects so far are a pleasant, carefree mood and I have had the flu this week and it calmed my cough.  I may go bald, but right now I really don't care.

I have to continue using the drug for a month until I can be seen by my Pdoc.  I'm having a hard time dealing with my weight gain.  I used to think I looked fit and feel so also, now neither is true.  I just found out about Topamax and would like to try it.  Perhaps i will just have to cut my hair short because   i hear Topamax can cause hair loss also.  I used to be in a healthy weight range but now I'm obese, I am so upset now.  The only reason I continuse taking Depakote 1000mg is because with out it I cry so often and also become angry and irritated so easly.  I would only recomend this drug to somone who does not take much pride in there hair and needs to gain or maintain weight for a mood stablizer.

Depakote 250mg with Zoloft 50mg was a horrible combination.  I gained 30# in 6 months and had 3 very dark episodes, one of which I was almost hospitilzed for.  I have been of the combination for 1 month and feel much better.  Will be starting Lamictal tomorrow to control the mood swings.
Bipolar Depression	beccasupermom, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	2/2/2008 11:07:21 PM	I take 1000mg of Depakote every day, 500mg in the am and 500 mg in the pm.  It has worked very well for me.  I have to say that it has worked extremely well now that I am also on Geodon in conjunction with it.  I went through several psychiatrists before I found this one who has been wonderful in listening to me and altering my treatment plan to deal with unwanted side effects of other medications.  The main thing that I have not liked about Depakote is the weight gain.  I feel like I'm starving (literally) all the time and have increased appetite because of it.  Overall, though, I would recommend it.  I do believe that if you still have symptoms if on Depakote, ask your doctor because I have NO symptoms at all when coupled with the other mood stabilizer I am on.  I feel happy, healthy, and great!

This medication is working WONDERFULLY for her. No more major mood swings, acting eratic, living on the edge. This medication is probably not for everyone.SHe had to try several others and 3 different psychiatrist before we found the right one for her. She has been on it 3 months and could see a immediate difference in her.If you or a loved one suffers from bi-polar disorder do not give up, there is help out there. With medication and the right doctor they can be helped. She also had no side effects from this drug.We found her miracle.

The welbutrin has worked great, but depakote gave me tremors, extreme mood swings and depressive-suicidal thoughts.  even my friends told me to stop using it after they saw my reaction to this drug.  it did not work for me.

Bipolar Depression	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	1/11/2008 9:42:24 PM	I've been taking depakote for 9 months and it has some what helped my mood swings, but it has really improved my concentration and anxiety problems. Depakote combined with adequate nutrition and exercise is the ultimate treatment for my bipolar dis order.People need to realize that medication alone will not provide them the best results. The worst thing about the depakote for me, is occasionally I have very blury vision. People are complaining about the weight gain due to depakote this has not been true for me.Without the sucess of depakote I could not be persuing a nursing career. I simply could not think.I hope it keeps working for me because other treatments have been a real night mare for me. Abilify and Seroquel about made me lose my mind. I was estatic when depakote worked for me!Though all people are different, I highly recomend it. Good luck and don't give up.    
Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/11/2008 5:13:02 PM	i have used this medication for 6 years. i am 19 years old and have had seizures since i was 10. i have been bounced around but to all sorts of medicines but the depakote has worked the best for me. many people have said that they gained weight with this medication i lost weight. the only thing i would complain about is that i am 5'4 maybe 115 lbs soaking wet and i was taking 1500 mil. a day. i had most of the side effects on th bottle but after some time i just stopped having side effects. i wish i could go back to it. i was seizure free on it.

I started at 1500mg, and am now down to 500mg. and have been seizure free since 1997.  I have had no side effects from this medication, except for the time I attempted to follow a low carbohydrate diet, during which time my liver started to shut down. DON'T attempt the low carbohydrate diet to try to lose weight if you are taking Depakote.

This medication is used to help prevent seizures; I have been on it for only a week and the side effects are disabling.  I loose all control of my hands, face and lower body functions. I experience tingles that are so intence that I feel as though I will crawl out of my skin.  I know a friend who is giving this mediation to a child; I pray that the side effects are not happening to her also. I pray that I can pull myself off of it.

She had to spend 9 days in the hospital and is still recovering after being discharged yesterday.  She had IV and centeral line problems, a blood clod, and major problem in finding good veins for lab work.  She lost weight, vomitted often, and slept a lot before my wife and I insisted on her getting admitted.  I strongly suggest the research (w/your doctor) on another course of action!

After about a week or so his body became adjusted to the medicine and he is doing great know and seizure free for the last year.

The best part for me is the weight gain. I've always been underweight and now I am able to fill out a pair of jeans WELL. This in turn helps with the low esteem I have had with myself.

Bipolar Depression	Bianca,  Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		12/7/2007 12:41:11 AM	I was diagnosed with severe depression and was taking Wellbutrin which eased my depression but gave me severe mood swings, so my doctor prescribed Depakote. I've been on it for one full week and have felt very little physical side effects and my mood has leveled out to normalcy. I am worried about the long term effects but so far so good. The only side effects I have experienced is loss of appetite (very subtle) and a shorter but more efficient sleep pattern. I will only sleep 4-5 hours at a time but feel well rested. That could be due to the combination with the Wellbutrin. Overall, it's been a lifesaver

Other	ald, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	12/2/2007 3:12:08 PM	I take this med. for P.H.N. (Post-herpetic neuralgia) which I have suffered from for ten years now after a bout of shingles (herpes zoster). It is a terribly painful condition which seemingly responds to none of the limited treatments.  However I have had wonderful success with Divalproex.  I only take 250mg/day which just keeps it at bay although 500mg/day is more successful for true relief, I take multiple other drugs for B.P. Depression and migraine, so I try to keep dose down.  My fiance began taking it recently for B.P. Depression (yes, it is a fun household somedays!)  and he found it significantly helps the neuropathy in his feet, so anyone with neuro type pain, you might want to discuss this with your doctor.  Good Luck!

There is far more harm than good from this medicine and I wanted to let everyone know the dangers of this medicine. I know not everyone will have the expierence I did, but why take the risk where there are better medications out there? Now I am sicker than I have ever been in my life and there is no relief from the stomach aches I get due to my liver.

I was not able to drive while on this drug and over a period of six months I gained over fifty pounds.  I became severely depressed and have still not lost all the weight.  Before you try this medicine for seizures or even headaches, try Keppra (for seizures) and Topomax (for migraines) these medications are just as effective and do not result in depression and extreme weight gain, in fact Topomax helps you lose weight!

Lithium never agreed with my system,causing me to have a great deal of stomach distress.   Consider Depakote, it is a older drugbut can be effective.Everyone is different though.Take care,best of sucess always.

However, I do have tremors, especially when hungry, and some of my hair thinned (but it grew back, curly!). My biggest problem is the price. It costs over 300 dollars w/o insurance, like me.  I'm about to run out of options there.

After 1 1/2 years I moved out of state, was rediagnosed Bipolar, and with reservation was switched to Depakote with an antidepressant (Olanzapine).I've experienced good results after 2 years of treatment with Depakote. The side effects are somewhat troubling (i.e. listlessness and weight gain), however the alternative, a recurrance of an extreme manic episode, vastly 'outweights' (pun intended) these effects. My biggest concern with the medication is that I do feel a significant suppression of my creative side.ALWAYS take your meds as prescribed!!!

I was misdiagnosed and mistreated for depression most of my adult life. After 5 days of taking DepakoteER I have noticed a big change. I am a rapid cycling bipolar (minutes not days and hours) I have noticed increased appetite, sex drive and enjoy time with my family that I have not had in 36 years of my life. I am calm, collected and NOT exhausted from my mania. Also, my depression now just a slight sadness that quickly disperses without much effort. I can now laugh and mean it, it isn't just the &quot;appropriate response&quot;. This includes the smiling and the crying. I am no longer in the &quot;fog&quot; of BP but a REAL person with REAL reactions. I would take the side effects and risks to remain this way. I am a person for the first time in my life.When I began the medication, the first three days were a little rough with the changes my body made (urinating every hour, thirst and frequent bowel movements) but as the drug levels out, my body responds more normally now. I hope this post helps some of you. This drug has helped with my mania AND depression.

Multiple Seizure Types	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	10/8/2007 11:08:35 AM	I was put on Depakote for seizures when I was 13 years old, and within 4 months weighed 206 lbs.  While the medication worked well to control my seizures, I was only 13 and still a freshman in high school.  I cannot think of a good reason for any teenager to be put on this particular drug.  From 1993 to 2001 I was stuck on Depakote with an increasing dosage because my weight wouldn't go down.  Finally I got a new doctor who would listen to me and I have an implant and am taking Topamax with Phenobarbital.

Bipolar Depression	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	19-24	10/4/2007 1:14:32 AM	This medication, in combination with a cocktail of others (Topomax and Zyprexa) my doctor put me on after one visit made me feel groggy, dull, emotionless, and apathetic.  I didn't even need medication; I needed diet and exercise changes.  If you take these drugs with a fundamentally healthy brain chemistry they'll ruin you.  Use these as a last resort.

I'm not sure if my Dr. even knows that this drug is basically a joke. He also said it would help with my anger, and it failed again. I just do not know what to do. He had me on 750 mg, then 500 mg, and I just recently quit taking it with no withdrawal symptoms. I was on it for 4 months with no positive feedback whatsoever.

Plus all of the side effects were scary.  Anyone who could potentially get pregnant be aware.  I read about medications and pregnancy and this medication was specifically noted as do not take.  I'm better off with the migraines.
Epileptic Seizure	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	9/26/2007 12:48:00 AM	I used it for epilepsy and I had to be taken off Depakote because it made me have a dangerously, low-risk, white blood cell count.  Afterwards, I could not drive because I had to wait to adapt to the new medication that I was taking (which took some trial and error).The low white blood cell count made it harder for my immune system to fight off something I would normally handle well, such as a simple cold.  I became very sick because of this.  I do not recommend this medication.  However, I do recommend that you become an informed consumer, especially with medicine.

Epileptic Seizure	bngoofy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	9/24/2007 9:06:56 PM	I began using Depakote when I was 16 on a trial basis. I do have occasional  &quot;jerks&quot; or small seizures but that is rare and only around my menstral cycle or when under alot of stress.  All in all I have had good control when taken properly.
