I was diagnosed as being infected with MERSA skin condition. Previously I had used this medication on my Son when he had been burned and was in the hospital.. IT Works..
Other	Ericaurr, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	12/1/2011 12:35:04 AM	I was out in the sun for more than 5 hours with no shade and no way out of the enclosure or inside. Dr said I had second degree burns which was why boils started to form. This medicine not only cut healing time in half (pain lasted only 2 weeks), but cooling effect against my scorching skin soothed the areas. Took a while to get used to the consistency. It was difficult at first to apply because of how thick it was, like a paste.

I walked into the office barely being able to move my arms, and within an hour of my first application I was able to lift my arms almost parallel to the floor-within 3 days I had full range of motion back, and within a week the pain was completely gone.

Her burn is worse and she is having an allergic reaction on top of everything.  I am very upset with her doctor.  She is an adult so I didn't know what she had put on her burn since she has her own house.  Doctors should be more careful.

Other	Johnny3h, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	65-74	2/19/2010 12:07:44 AM	For 25+ years I worked as a Firefighter [2 years], a Fire Inspector [5 years], and for 20 more years an Investigator/Expert Witness regarding the Origin &amp; Cause of Fire/Arson/Explosions.As a result, I have been burned many times.  The first time it happened, the Doctor prescribed silver sulphadiazine AS A PROPHYLATIC [PREVENTIVE] for infection.  I did not have an infecction, but used it according to label directions until the wound had healed [a remarkable 10 days to full healing].As I used only a small amount from the container, I saved it and continued to use it for burns, cuts, scratches.  I would wash the wound immediately after occurance, and then would apply the silver sulphadiazine, and continue to wash and apply 2 to 4 times a day.The amazing thing to me was the extremely FAST healing, usually 4 to 7 days, when ordinary washing and use of ordinary over the counter medications would require several days to heal.In the almost 35 years since that time I have managed to obtain and save three of the small plastic jars and they have carried me through hundreds, if not thousands, of minor scrapes, scratches,cuts, and burns without once resulting in any infection.I have been totally &quot;sold&quot; on silver sulphadiazine since day one.Although it generally has had exparation dates less than 3 years from prescription issue, I have used it when it was several years old, and have never noticed any degradation of effectiveness.Again, this is outstanding stuff.  I've tried to find out what is so dangerous about this product that would cause it to require a prescription, but I've never, ever gotten what I consider a decent answer to this question.

It truly lessens the pain, prevents any infection, and speeds up healing for 2nd degree burns.  The only bad thing is that you need a prescription to get more, legally.
Other	Hopeacious, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	8/2/2009 8:47:12 PM	This stuff is AMAZING! I first had this when I was 14 from jumping on a motorcycle with shorts on. Since then we have ALWAYS kept this stuff around! My 4 y/o recently burned her upper arm and thank goodness for this! I also dumped a pot of boiling water on my leg and it had only been 4 days of using it and it has helped soo much! I would say we are at 50% now. It was a 3rd degree burn and all I can say is once you use it you will always want to keep it around!

An Infection in a Burn Wound	JC, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	7/20/2008 5:13:39 AM	Although this medication is effective and is working on my burns caused by an airbag explosion to my arm, I do have a heart condition and have had a reaction to some of the ingredients when mixed with my beta-blocker. Be careful if you have a heart condition while taking a beta-blocker and this cream b/c of the mixture of alcohol. Beta-blockers and alcohol shouldn't be mixed. It caused me to have an a-fib reaction.

Within days, for most common kitchen burns, the burn disappears, and within minutes of application, there is relief from the pain of the burn.
