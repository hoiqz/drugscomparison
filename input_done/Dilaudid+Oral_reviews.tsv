Pain	Texas Mimi, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	65-74	8/23/2012 12:18:05 AM	I had been taking Nocor, Valium for muscle spasm, and Neurontin for nerve pain post laminectomy, on 8-10-12, but it wasn't relieving the pain.  Even taking up to 4 2mg tablets didn't touch the pain so I went back to the Nocor and the other meds I'd been taking. I was finally able to get my pain under control. I also wrote down when I took each med so I wouldn't repeat anything or take anything too soon.  I'm ready to flush the Dilaudid down the toilet when I go to see my pain management doctor on 9-5-12, for cervicogenic headaches.  I am glad that it is helping some people.  Just shows that you have to find the right medication for pain,  and be educated about pain.  I know as I was a Hospice Nurse for almost 2 years and have a lot of knowledge about pain control.
Pain	tootsie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	8/21/2012 5:29:33 PM	I have tried lortab and lots of other pain meds. Dilaudid works great for my back pain.  I have DDD and hernitated discks. Not a surgery candidate.  I take 8mg 4-6 times a day. Also the muscle relaxer tizanidine. This combination really seems to help me. I have been fighting chronic pain since 2006.  Seems to wear of quickly.

Taken as a &quot;break through&quot;. M/S ER is constant around the clock, it is slow to work, doesn't release enough. Desoxyn or amphetamines sensitize opiate receptors and make smaller doses work better then large!

After 1 year, they have increased it from 2mg to 4mg taken every 4 to 6 hours for pain.  It has very little side effects for me, which is the best characteristic of this drug.  Probably my constipation is my biggest side effect.I do not like to take medication, has I take so much for my complex health issues.So in ending, I would recommend this drug (as a last resort) for moderate to severe pain.

I have lesions in my bones with some holes through my hip bone. Been on 8mg of Dilaudid every 4 to 6 hours with excellent results.  Have a high tolerance to pain medication so taking this dosage works well for me.  The only issue I have with this drug is occasional constipation which is relieved by taking a stool softener. Don't know what I would do without it since the pain levels from this disease are terrible.

Pain	Spartan, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	4/11/2012 2:03:05 AM	I suffer ocular, and acute migraines due to TBI in combat. My days are spent in constant migraine distress. Not one single migraine drug ever, in 20+ years fixed my migraines. I take Tramadol 2x per day and Tylenol 3 for daily pain to ease migraines and nerve damage in right side with constant pain from injuries to spinal area and muscle pains. But I also have Percoset as a breakthrough drug when I am having unusually long periods of pain and it usually knocks the migraine out. When the migraines are too much for the meds to fix over a 3 day period, I am told to stop taking any drugs, and go to emergency room and get a shot of Dilaudid(4-5 mg). This will kick a migraine and other pain out for at least 3-6 days before anything else needs to be taken. With Dilaudid, I need only one dose and it has helped me live with a greater quality of life. My migraines are under control and kept this way for 3 years now, but as such, I have only needed Dilaudid 2 times this year due to good medical and physical therapy along with acupuncture and chiropractic care. The previous 20+ years of suffering migraines were filled with weekly visits to the E.R. Good drug for my stuation. Works very well when I need it.

Cough	Kirs1269, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/16/2012 4:20:27 AM	I have been sick with a chronic cough due to a lung nodule (finally being removed) and the cough cause plurisy as well. After having this chronic cough for so long and going through treatments such as antibiotics, steroids, SEVERAL medications to supress cough (NONE WORKED) breathing treatments, inhalers and vicodin and percocet for pluritic pain....I had finally had enough. The non-stop coughing had me so fatigued and in pain that I was no longer functioning. I went into the ER and they proceeded to start with the initial phenergan with codeine and morphine. Neither controlled cough OR pain. The ER doctor decided to give me 8mg of IV Dilaudid and BINGO! The pain was relieved, the cough STOPPED (and hasn't restarted)....bless his heart....he saved me from my misery. I didn't realize that this worked to control cough...But BOY DOES IT EVER!! I am happy, fatigue is gone since coughing has stopped, and I'm able to sleep through the night and be productive during the day. I will stay on it until this nodule is removed from my lung. Hopefully once that is completed I won't need it anymore. I was at my wits end....this has been a real lifesaver!
Pain	crackofdawn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	2/25/2012 1:20:15 AM	I have been on pain meds for approx. 8 yrs. I've been on Oxy80x2daily,percocetx4daily,&amp;soma x4daily. Until about 2 weeks ago thats what I've been on (pain meds are for degenerative hips, disc&amp; arthritis in back,hips,hands&amp;knees, However I got a pretty large sized kidney stone, I went to my Dr.so I could get a CT, well I had mentioned to him that the percocets were not even close to managing pain, so he put me on 2mg dilaudid x4daily &amp; for 1st time in quite awhile the pain is tollerable &amp; with No side effects.  As for the comments Re: the&quot;New&quot; Oxy Formula I totally agree that it does Not have the same effects as the &quot;Old Formula&quot; I mean it doesn't last for 12 hours &amp; it doesn't work as well on the pain as did the old formula...

Pain	Rare Patient, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/11/2012 12:24:23 AM	I have been dealing with a ruptured L-4 and had no idea. My family physician informed me that discs will not show up on an xray, so he gave me some hydrocodone, some anti inflammatories, and sent me to an orthopedic. The orthopedic  was showing my husband and I my MRI and we were both able to point out the very apparent ruptured disc. The entire nerve was hidden from view. After trying 3 different narcotic pain relievers with an epidural, 4mg of hydromorphone has been  my only saving grace. It works for me. I am desperately trying to avoid surgery. The pain does not completely subside, but I am able to function and give the predisone and epideral time to work. I take less than the recommended amount per day and I am sleeping well for the first time in 4 months. I have never needed to take anything for pain, until now, outside an over-the-counter acetomenophin or ibuprofen. My husband and I searched together, so we were able to discuss with my orthopedic and asked questions regarding the stigma that surrounds the use of pain medications of this caliber. It is currently working, my doctors/pharmacists attend to every question/concern with care, and I think I will be able to beat this with one more epideral; accompanied by the predisone and hydromorphone. I plan (hope) to be completely OFF any medication and back to normal within 3-4 weeks. I do see the drawbacks for patients with a history of drug abuse and/or taking other medications that are not safe to take along with hydromorphone. I am pleased that my husband took my concerns to heart and my doctors (and their nurses) are as patient, informative, and as caring as I see a patient would need in this severe type of constant pain. When being prescribed any drug, especially narcotics; a patient must be HONEST and accountable. You MUST have the support of your loved ones and DON'T be afraid to question your physicians. They are HUMAN.

Pain	sellefrancais, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	19-24	1/14/2012 5:15:14 AM	I have RSD which is short means that my brain has literally rewired itself after a injury to a nerve causing things that should not cause me pain to cause me tons of pain.  For the past 6 years doctors have just stratched their heads and I would be occasionally treated with hydocodone or percocet. But no one figured out what was going on not until I actually got so bad that I was admitted into the hosiptal.  Now for the first time I see sunlight at the end of the tunnel, I'm getting my pain taken care of for the first time with dilaudid and exalgo (extended release dilaudid) and I can finally get back to my life not totally free from pain but at least free enough that I can do what I need to and I am no longer bed ridden. (I'm only  24 so being bed ridden for months is not the way I want to live my life)

This drug, has worked. In fact I stopped it and went to oxycodone, I am still in lots of pain. Dilaudid is and will be my choice with my other meds. that I take.

Pain	WhoKnows13, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	11/12/2011 8:47:24 PM	I have had abdominal pain of unknown origin for about two years now.  It comes and goes but when it is there it is full force.  I have had kidney stones twice and the pain from whatever I am dealing with is worse.  I have taken oxycodone as needed for about a year and a half and I would say 70% of the time that did not work and I would end up in the ER.  After reading reviews on here I was a little apprehensive about getting Dilaudid oral even though I had received it several times through an IV with great results.  I am taking 4mg every 4 hours as needed and it not only works great but it also doesn't make me feel high like oxycodone nor does it give me the feeling that I am getting addicted (never have been on Oxycodone but got the feeling it was going that way a couple of times and had to stop it).  Hopefully they will find out what is causing my problems, I have a exploratory laparoscopy planned, and I will not need this medicine anymore but in the mean time it is a life saver.  The only side effect I have had is nausea and slight constipation, which I had both with the oxycodone as well but the constipation is no where near as bad with the Dilaudid.  The nausea can be prevented by eating something small right before taking the pills or by taking a Zofran with it if I do not feel like eating.   
Pain	AngelD, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	11/10/2011 8:21:39 PM	I was on this medication in the past. it seemed to work well for the most part. I was switched off and put on morphine sulfate for about 6 months. The dilaudid lost its effectiveness for me. Now Im back in the same situation, so now back on the dilaudid. We shall see how long it works for me this time.

I take pain meds daily. I am currently on Tramadol (ultram)... I had an ER trip for a severe attack and I was given Dilaudid in IV and it worked great! So the ER dr gave me 6 Dilaudid pills (2mg each) to take home for pain. They didn't work nearly as well, if at all, compared to the IV dilaudid.  I took one pill and it did absolutely nothing. I took 2 the other day at work (and I am on my feet all doing customer service) and it did not affect me at all.  Really odd, but I do have a high tolerance for pain meds since I take Tramadol daily.. but it is a derivative of morphine you would think it would be stronger. Not the &quot;pill&quot; for me, but next time in the ER, Ill ask for the IV Dilaudid with a take home perscription of Vicodin or Oxy instead.

I used various dosages of the Fentanyl transdermal patches since 1999 and had some relief but the pain was getting worse. My physician started me on Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) orally about 2 years ago and after 3 different dosages, came upon the correct amount to 'cut the edge' off my chronic pain, yet leave me quite functional. I have recently had surgery to replace the rods in my back and am continuing to use hydromorphone, but I'm able to get the same relief on a smaller dosage now. Rarely have I had any kind of side affect using Dilaudid/hydromorphone, and then it was only very slight dizziness. I guess I'm one of the luckier folks. My pain management physician and his team have found the right combination of meds to keep my discomfort at a reasonable and tolerable level, yet I can generally perform the day to day activities without too great a pain level.

The only down side to it is that very few doctors will prescribe it for pain. It seems to be labeled even worse than oxyconten, tha only reason i think why that is tha way abusers adminestered it ( I.V ) . I think any reasonable  doctor should be vable to spot those individuals much easier than someone who snorts pills on a regular bases. I just think tha medical , well tha community  in genral, is looking at bad rather than tha good it doess for people with chronic pain.

The accident was 20+ years ago and then the pain returned 8 years ago.  My doctor has tried every opioid that I have ever heard of on me.  Dilaudid has been the most effective and with ZERO side effects @ 4Mg*5/day. Now I can no longer get Rx because of new laws. I am in despair and see no viable alternatives.  My quality of life has become zero.  I was side effect free and using dilaudid for approx. 8 years.  Now my doctors and I are treated as criminals. I have never used or abused any drug or alcohol in my life and now the Gov. of Florida seems to be practicing medicine without a license by outlawing the ability of most Doctors to prescribe ANY pain medication except for cancer patients. Now the only Dr.s allowed to prescribe pain meds for patients without cancer are overloaded with needy patients and many have more than doubled their office visit fees.  Also they are not even prescribing the 'more potent' opioids.  I used to pay $75 for an exam every 30 days and &lt;25$ each month for my diluadid Rx.  Now the same doctor charges $450+ for a monthly visit and will only write for Vicodin or Percoset.  Both of which have serious side effects on me that dilaudid never has.
Pain	snicangel, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	8/10/2011 2:40:36 AM	I have been on this med for about 3 years now. Was on duragelsic patches before, but had breathing and heart issues.This drug has worked well, have been able to get up and function with ADL'S and limits to disability.I am taking *8 pills a day  4 mg, but it is not really working well for me the past 6 months. Drs are reluctant to add or allow higher doses because of sleep apnea(have machine)It worked well for quite a while, but as all meds over time lose their effectiveness.Do experience dizziness, mood changes of agitation, and some depression also from being in a fog for so long in pain.Should try to deal with pain the best for each person, but i think meds make it worse because you think you can do things when you are high on it, and end up hurting yourself worse.      IF ANYONE HAS A BETTER SOLUTION PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!But the drug does work if you stck with it regularly

I had brain surgery in 1987 for a right temporal brain tumor that caused my headaches for months before getting help that hurt less than this MS Fibromyalgia combo deal I've got going on.47 year old man have had it now for 12 years, 5 of those in a wheelchair and while my left leg is now mostly paralyzed and also has foot drop, I've improved to walking again with much bust asss work , but the accompanying pain is intractable.  This combo works, I've taken it for 4 years now, and it has its downs with constipation that is aided by Miralax which I just pour in a bowl or Raisin bran each morning and then a big extra large glass of water in the late afternoon sometime. I wish I didn't have to take any medication but frankly life would be intolerable with a negative quality of life with this magnitude of pain. People don't believe it, but I don't care at this point and mostly avoid able Sorry but that's how it is. I do fine as a solo act, and the sooner this tour is over frankly the better. I'm not suicidal but life's not supposed to be this much of a struggle, sadly it is for me at least. .

It worked very well the first time I tried it, but the last time I tried the oral dilaudid it didn't seem to work at all, even when I increased the dose.

Finally met the right Dr., who over time, now has me taking Morphine ER, 200 mg's, 2x's a day, plus 8 mg's of Dilaudid, up to 3x's a day for breakthrough pain. Living in the Mid-West, it seems that most Dr.'s are very conservative when it comes to prescribing narcotics, after being hospitalized twice monthly for close too 10 years, many trips to the ER, since being prescribed the right meds &amp; dosage, I haven't seen the inside of a hospital since.

I take oxycontin 80mg for general pain and dilaudid, 8mg for breakthrough pain. The meds seem to do the job if taken correctly. The first month on them, I began taking too many and ran out. I was a basket case until my next script. Now, I take ONLY as directed, and they work just fine. I still have pain, ubt it's pain I can learn to live with. I am now developing symptoms of RA and wonder how long this dosage is going to work.

The doc treated symptoms w/more drugs that caused same.  A fibromyalgia pt should not have needed this type drug and others also as care givers we were not told what to watch for or even that she was on such dangerous stuff.  She left behind two small children.  Please be cautious in what/why you put these in your body.  Now that I have access to her drug presciptions all from one doc and one pharmacy I am devastated.  There are no do overs from death.  If someone tries to tell you that this medication is causing you to have bad side effects listen to them, get help and find another doctor.  She was fine that morn complained of chest hurting, couldn't breathe, severe headache but she said that everyday.  She laid down to rest, taking her medications.  We don't have the toxicoligy report yet but I warn you, I don't think she was accidently over dosing..I think the medications side effects were to blame.  Life is precious and so is your family.  Please make sure you have not other alternative before you get hooked on this evil pill.

I was only prescribed 4mg each dose..daily..the pain was still there.. docs wanted to cut my hand off I had a machanical?? hand for about a year.The doc then uped my dose to 18 mg 3 times a day. I was still having some pain and took a few extra pills I was 3 days early to get my script I started getting really sick..sweating..diarrea...sucidal...so I had to go to outpatients it was the weekend ...the doc on call gave me a few pills to hold me over until i got to see my doc...my doc was very upset with me for going to outpatients...but i had never run out of my script before...or took to many...I will never missuse my script again...I never asked to be prescribed these meds but once I took them I rely on them for the pain...I just never new how sick I would be without them...I dont want to be looked at as a junkie but often that is what happens. Once a few years back I lost my doc because some jealous inlaws were calling my doc saying I was selling my pills which I was not... then when I had to go to outpatients the doc was checking me for needle marks...just doesnt seem fair that I am outcasted for something that I havent even done. It seems I am always defending myself just to get the meds I need for the pain I am suffering from ...then there are other people that are getting all kinds of drugs selling them are not taking them...then it makes it hard for someone who needs their pills for the pain to get them...I have been on dilaudid for 6 years and they do work for me I just dont think I could ever go without them now...It would problay kill me.

I was first prescribed Dilaudid 4mg tablets around a little over six months ago. I was prescribed this specifically for break-through pain while using prescribed Oxycontin 80mg twice a day for general pain. I find that although they work fast, they are not very strong. At least in my case, not strong enough to relieve my break-through pain, which is their purpose. I would choose 10mg of hydocodone (Vicodin) over 4-8mg of Dilaudid orally. However during post-surgery at the hospital IV Dilaudid really was effecitive at killing the pain.

Pain	Ginger314, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	25-34	4/16/2011 12:10:17 PM	I suffer from chronic debilitating nerve pain associated with Atypical Trygeminal Neuralgia among other nerve diseases. I experience constant pain throughout the Left side of my head that never subsides. I can only block the painful sensations through the use of medications. I have been prescribed numerous medications (preventative and pain meds) over the past 8 years. I currently take Methadone for my long acting pain reliever and Dilaudid as my short term &quot;break through&quot; pain reliever. I feel that this is the most success I have ever had in controlling my pain - which is a huge statement since my pain is also progressive. I rated Effectiveness 4/5 because I still have break through pain that is not relieved by this medication. It may be due to the med being a new Rx for me and requiring different dosing (i am taking 1-2 (2mg pills) up to two times per day prn), but until i am not missing work due to pain - i cannot score it higher. I rated Ease of Use as 4/5 as well. Perhaps i was spoiled by my previous pain medication (Fentora) as i was able to take those tabs at any time. Water was not needed as they disolved in my mouth. Yes, taking a pill is not a difficult task, but i do not always have a drink available to swallow my medication, despite trying to plan ahead. Satisfaction, therefore is a 4/5. This is a high score and I plan to remain on this medication for a while if possible. I still find it somewhat humorous that the only reason i was prescribed this medication in the first place is b/c my insurace company refused to continue covering my Fentora tabs and stated that i would have to try Dilaudid before they would approve another type of Fentora. Thanks for listening :).

The relief makes it easier for me to live my life and I can go out with friends without having people know that I'm sick. I have severe pain from the moment I wake up to the moment I lay down and Dilaudid is the only pain medicine that has helped. I would suggest taking this medicine if you have a high tolerance for pain killers.

Nothing was controling my pain what so ever, was put on the duraigesic patch 100 mgc and i was just put on dilauded along with the patch i am having close to no pain at all. After years of being in all this pain, i gotta say this drug is great. After 20 plus yrs of pain i feel more like myself then i have in the past 20 yrs.

Orders were to wait and give me my pill pain meds that I took prior to operation, for chronic pain I have been suffering with for years. Obvious mistake by doctor and or nurses, not sure. Pain did subside after liquid Dilaudid was given (supposidely at highest available). 
Pain	baronello, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	55-64	2/28/2011 11:58:54 AM	I have &quot;chronic pelvic pain syndrome&quot;, which is a nebulous diagnosis given to me by urologists that I have seen. I am going to an appt with a Board Certified Pain Management physician to see if I can come up with a more specific cause and treatment plan for my pain. I am a 60 yo male. I also have a herniated L4 disc and spinal stenosis. I have been taking hydrocodone 7.5 mg tid prescribed for these conditions by my Internal Medicine doc (primary care giver)Recently, I came down with SHINGLES and was given the appropriate anti-viral drug for this condition by my primary care giver. Nothing else was said about other meds except that I could also use ibuprofen. Later, as the shingles continued to spread and became more painful, I started doing some research. Prednisone was often mentioned but my primary care guy said &quot;no&quot;.Yesterday, Sunday, the condition seemed starting to spiral out of control and I went to the ER. The doc gave me injections of Toradol and Dilaudid and I immediately felt better. He sent me home with an Rx for 2mg Dilaudid and 20mg Prednisone.I am worried about long-term neuralgia after the Shingles rash is gone. But catching it early in the course of the disease, hopefully will rule that out. Bottom line, get help early, seek more than one opinion and do not be afraid to ask for adequate pain relief. I am hoping that my upcoming appt with the Pain Doc will shed light on all 3 of my chronic pain conditons.I now know that the Dilaudid tablets come in 8mg strength, and I wish the doc had prescribed these. I find 5mg oxycodone to me more effective at knocking pain down quickly . Believe me, I am glad I recognized the simptoms of shingles early and immediately started taking the anti-viral (Valcyclovir). But I am commenting here on Dilaudid in tablet form, and as I said, I have not felt them to be effective enough for Shingles pain at the 2mg dose - 1-2 tabs every 4-6 hrs.
Pain	McWyder61, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	45-54	2/27/2011 8:43:19 PM	I utilized this drug when my intrathecal pump was allowed to run dry. I was at 13 mg/27 period. The MD dropped the dose to 3 mg without discussion. I found another MD. He would only increase it to 8 mg/25. After the pump was allowed to run fry ( I could not make the co-pay). I utilized Dilaudid. I started with 8 mg q 3 hrs. This still did not stop the severe W/DS. I was hallucinating, My skin alternated from burning (like a flame being used to burn my skin, Alternately I felt s if my body was submerged in ice. The pain was s severe that I could not walk, sit, stand or lay down, Finally I took 16mg q 1 hour. This decreased the W/Ds. And slightly reduced the pain to an 8.5 pain level.I took this for three weeks. WIth Norco 10/325 for break through pain. Three weeks ago I started ace on MS Contin 100 mg 1-2 every 8 hours. I take two q 8 with the Norco and the Diazepam ( I have taken since 1988). I am now at an 8.0, with an occasional 10.0 pain level. The MRI done about 6 weeks ago indicated that I have more herniated disk. This time in the Thoracic, cervical, and lumbar regions. I have hardware in the cervical,  lumbar, and plates  in the face. Due to an assault  at an ATM. I have Been on opiates since 1988 when the first injury took place. The oral medications seem to have lost heir efficacy. I remember a patient when I worked for Health NET. She received injectable Dilaudid and syringes because the oral medications no longer worked. Is this ever practiced by MDs in the SF Bay Area? I am desperate. I have not slept for two weeks. I need a relief from this condition to recharge my batteries.

It works within seconds and without headaches I would get from morphine.
Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/19/2011 10:09:20 PM	For partial bowl obstructions, I recommend Dilaudid over morphine in the hospital.  It relieves severe pain in seconds as I seem to have a sensitivity to morphine which always gave me headaches.

As others have said the IV form is best (for sever pain) but that is the case with most all drugs because it is basically instantly in your system.

Pain	moonbaby3475, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	2/9/2011 12:17:17 AM	I just began taking this for Chronic back pain a few weeks ago. It has not helped at all. I have been having severe headaches for the past few weeks also and discovered that every time I take one I almost instantly get a headache.  Called the Dr. and am going to get it changed. It works great in liquid form for me though as I found out after back surgery at I believe it was 6cc's every 20 minutes then every 2 to 4 hours until I left.  They tell me that's quite alot but that is what tends to happen when you have been on so many narcotics for so many years.  I just want to find something at a low dose that works and works well enough I don't have to take it numerous times a day along with everything else I take. Fentanyl patch, baclofen, tramadol, topamax, ibuprfen 800mg, clonopin, paxil, and trazadone to sleep. Thats aside from the Dilaudid.  Before the Dilaudid it was Roxicodone until they stopped being effective. :(
Pain	puppy1, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/5/2011 2:09:08 PM	2 mg every six hours for post surgery pain. Works excellent for pain, does not cause any side effects for me. I had side effects of exiteability and insomnia with vicodin,nothing with this. I think every body is different and you should keep trying different meds to see what works for you.

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	1/28/2011 12:51:27 AM	I was prescribed this after an appendectomy.I can't take anything with codeine or any of its derivatives, such as Percocet or Lortab, due to allergy. They tried me on Ultram and that did nothing. So they gave me this, 2mg in pill form to take home.  It completely helped the pain. It didn't make me feel drunk or high, just relaxed, and took away the pain.  I was nervous to take such a heavy narcotic but it worked great and I could still function normally.

Pain	me, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5		25-34	12/7/2010 11:14:28 AM	I suffer from migraines and after a long year and a half of trying different meds that needless to say didn't work, my new neurologist prescribed morphine 15 mg for me, while that worked it didn't allow me to function throughout the day.  So I made a call to the neruologist and he prescribed 4mg dilaudid, 1/2 to 1 tab every 6 hours for pain, OMG, I couldn't believe the difference it made.  This med allows me to function while at work.  I can see how this drug can become addictive as it does have a eurphoric component to it, as long as you take it as prescribed you will be ok. Hope this helps!
Pain	mnewco, 45-54 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	12/5/2010 8:01:37 PM	I have been using this medicine since I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia which is chronic pain. I have had no symptoms and it is the only paid med that works for my pain. I do not abuse it. I feel that those that do abuse it ruin for the rest of the people who are honest about their pain.To the reviewer who lost her sister to Dilaudid, you should not be angry at her. You make is sound like you hate her and do not miss her because she overdosed.

I was not able to tolerate radiation treatments, chemotherapy, ADT and cancer drugs.  Against my doctors advice I  discontinued all cancer treatment after giving it an honest try for several weeks to no avail.   Combined with Cyclobenzaprine, Dexamethasone and Lorazepam I been able to resume a more normal sleep pattern that has been elusive for me.  At least now I feel a bit more human, I can function and I'm able to cope with what is facing me.  Pain is manageable and I seem to be able to tolerate this drug well. Side effects from Dilaudid seem to be non-existent other than a little sleepiness in the evening which is fine for me.  I have regained 41lbs that I lost earlier this year and I am a little concerned about that but will try to manage it with diet.

This drug only takes away maybe 40% of the pain.  When used with an epaderial shot I can fully function.  When I first started taking it I could not hold down any food and lost 25 lbs in less that 3 weeks.  It works better than any other drug that I have been put on.  I have a high pain tolerance so this drug allows me to continue working.

I have been on several pain medications for various reasons - morphine, vicodin do not work for me.I rated the Ease of Use a 3 only because I was given an IV in my hospitals ER (I was there for what we can only assume was a gallbladder attack, as the pain was never diagnosed) and it took several nurses to place it because of my awful veins. However, once it was being administered, my (very) severe) pain vanished. This was not without side-effects, though. Within seconds of the drug taking effect, the walls were melting around me. I thought it was hilarious and was absolutely giddy about it. The second side-effect wasn't so amusing. I became very, very nauseous during the ride home from the hospital and began dry-heaving ten minutes after leaving. It passed and I was able to sleep (hard), but it was nonetheless unpleasant. Overall, however, I was very pleased with the pain relief I got from dilaudid and I will definitely ask for it again.

I have had bad reactions with most pain medication in the past and this was fantastic - took away the pain without any side affects. At no point did I ever feel like I was &quot;medicated&quot;. I used it for approximately 3 months after surgery, gradually decreasing as my pain level decreased, with no reactions. Very happy all around to have found an effective pain medication.

I started taking this drug over 2 years ago after my biggest surgery. I was told by my drs that I wouldn't get addicted to this drug, but since I was in so much pain I had to take it all the time. I have now come to a realization that I have become addicted to dilaudid. The side effect of withdraw have been difficult to say the least. I recommend this drug for people who have had major surgery, but only for a short time. Please don't be like me!

Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	3	3	Female	25-34	8/8/2010 8:27:49 PM	i just want to say that i suffer from chronic migraines, and this medication has been a miracle for me in the E.R. through iv injections. I typically get three doses of 2mg. Dilaudid helps my pain after i have exhausted all of my other migraine medications and have nowhere else to turn. I don't know what i would do without it! The ONLY issue i have with it is the doctors that give it. EVEN though I have a care plan from my neurologist allowing me to have this medication, i STILL have to battle the doctors almost every single time I go to the E.R. so i would suggest the doctors need some sensitivity training! I have, however, found the pills to be much less effective in controlling the pain, while still making me nauseated and tired.

Pain	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/30/2010 1:41:41 AM	I have been a migraine patient for 13 years, and have been on literally EVERY medication available. I've been hospitalized with paralyzing pain for up to 6 days at a time with no relief. Many doctors have tried to give me the whole, benadryl, toradol, compazine, which then is closely followed by atavan. By far, the BEST thing to ever happen is 15mg of phennargen, 2mg of dilaudid, followed by two single doses. Since then I've been on a preventative, and have been living a happy life, with easily controlled flair-ups.

They tried morphine on me, but I had a horrible reaction so I was switched to Dilaudid (given through IV). It worked extremely fast and gave me lasting relief. I was given this drug for 6 days and did not have any lingering side effects. I felt flushed right after they administered it, and was extremely tired, but within 24 hours of being D/C from the hospital I had no additional side effects.

Been taking Vicodin for years due to 2 back surgeries, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, facet arthritis, etc. Took 30 mg of morphine for 3 mos. and nearly died. Put me in respiratory distress and was on life support 4 days. Have been told this isn't same as morphine..anyone know? It seems to control pain pretty well with no side effects. Am taking 4 mg about 3 x day and I needed 20 mg of vicodin at least 4 x day..quite a change. I am a little nervous about changing meds after the morphine scare so am hoping no problems.

I have spinal pain daily. This medication is the only one that seems to work for me.  However, only truly get relief from the name brand.  Generics have too much buffers that interfere w/the drugs performance.  So people when buying a pain medication, get name brand.  FDA lets manufacturers &quot;play&quot; w/generics up to 20% in either active or inactive ingredent.

Plus I didnt feel like I &quot;needed&quot; it unless I was in pain. Now I take it for other pain conditions including fibro, just nights where I cant sleep because it puts me to sleep. The only drawback so far is that I get a bit of nausea.

I just hade surgeory for a  polinital absest to be removed from my lower back. They took a chunk the size of and egg out. They prescribed 2mg dilaudid every 3-4hrs for pain + and motrin, the pain has been under control. Finding pain meds to break through the methadone is diffecult. I also did not experience any drug seeking either wich to some one in recovery is a plus. I would recomend any one in a situation similar to mine to talk to your doctor and discuss dilaudid as an option. Finding pain medication that is safe/works with methadone is diffecult so do some research for your self before going to the doctors.

For some reason I was given both morphine and dilaudid. My respiration was dangerously low - I felt like I had bugs crawling all over me. Luckily I could stay focused so I knew it was a reaction to something and not really happening. After three days of arguing with the doctors I was finally taken off of it and most of the symptoms being attributed to the stroke (couldn't walk or see, had trouble talking) went away. Unfortunately the constipation stayed for a while. I think this drug is given way too often and should be reserved for only people who have exhausted other drugs first.

My usual treatment would be 150-250 mg of demerol injection in hip muscle. This time I was given 1mg of dilaudid in an IV with fluids. This was repeated two more times over an hour. I felt the headache pain was reduced; (REDUCED), so I went home.  It did not ever go away completely.  ( This is right now and the treatment was last night).  I do not want to go back because they will label me as a drug seeker. The demerol aleays killed the migraine, meaning of course that it masked the pain until it went away.  No such luck this time.  I hope others do better.  Dilaudid; not for me. I have had this migraine now since Sunday afternoon. It is now Wed. afternoon.  I have to leave work early; again.

The Left calf measures 4 cm narrower than the right (atrophy) since nerve impingement on the left started in 1987 whereas the RLE symptoms are less than 2 years old. The primary pain medicine is Fentanyl in the form of duragesic transdermal patches 100 mcg/48 hrs; however, it only takes the edge off the pain (20-40%) when it is below 8/10. The hydromorphone is used when the pain hits 8/10 level, In particular, it is used at bedtime when one or both of my heels are numb, a signal that the nerve roots are very irritated. The Dilaudid will help get me 2-3 hours of sleep that would otherwise be impossible.

I only take it at night because it makes me too sleepy. I have taken morphine in the past for the cysts but the Dr. gave me this for this one. The cyst is the size of a tennis ball and is very painful. During the day I take demreol, it takes the edge off but its not great. In the past I have used this drug and found if you come off it very slowly I do not have any trouble. I do take a small dose only 4mg. I eat a very high fiber diet with this drug and drink great amounts of water with it, so that keeps everything moving. Overall I would rather not take this drug but I have to do my job every day. So I would say yes it works but take care when using it.

Pain	PandorasBox, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	9/16/2009 7:55:31 PM	Suffering from chronic cysts in not only my right ovary but also my tubes I was given this medication by IV in the ER on many occasions for pain relief.  IV injection works well BUT home meds did nothing for pain relief for me.  Meds were prescribed every 4 hours and highly addicted.  I am going through withdrawal/detox now.  I have been previously treated for opiate addiction and can't believe I've found my way down this path again after being VERY HONEST with my doctors/surgeons about my previous addictions I can't understand why the sustained use was continued.  Although I will take blame I think doctors too frequently prescribe this medication and then too quickly call those out who become addicted and drop them on their ass.  Off to pain management, who wants to do nothing but call you a junkie.  I am angry, obviously.  Please only take this medication if absolutely necessary and as it is prescribed.  BEWARE!

I have never become so dependent on a medicine like I did dilaudid. But I reconized what was happening to me and stopped taking it. The withdrawal was not easy.

I have been a chronic pain sufferer since 1999. My doctor recently changed my RX from morphine to Dilaudid. I find that this medicine in conjunction with Soma for muscle spams is very helpful.Do not take more than prescribed. In my case, that is a total of 48 milligrams daily. I take the 4 mg tablets. The best way to treat your pain is to get it under control when you first start hurting. It is harder if you wait and are in tremendous pain.

I became addicted to the medication physically and had to stop taking it immediately.Because of my fear of addiction, when I need pain meds in the ER I try to ask for regular morphine instead.The effectiveness of the drug was outstanding, however, I do not find it worth the risk of addiction.

I have taken Norco, vicodin and oxycontin and fentanyl patches and for sure the Dilauded has been the best for pain relief. I take about 8mg four to six times a day and it makes the HUGEST difference in my pain. Yes, it can cause constipation so I up my fiber and yes I can see how its addicting but its the only thing that works and I see my doctor all the time and if I am using more than prescribed I let her know. I can see that weaning off this wont be easy BUT it allows me to have a life that I would not otherwise have. Chronic pain sucks, but I want to be able to walk, work, have sex, play with my niece, etc..

I take the 10mg dose od Dilaudid and it works great as long as I take them on a regular basis, as directed.  It is important to take on a regular basis and not just when you get a sudden pain as it won't work but about 50% of its strength and takes longer to work.  This is just one med that I take with others.  Best advice, TAKE ON A REGULAR BASIS AS DIRECTED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN.

Hello im a 27 yr old male who has been in pain for 4yrs.I have lupus and bone marrow failure as well sever nerve damage do to my autoinmunnie problems.No matter what i do or take i do not ever become pain free. I take 20pills a day to stay alive and thats not includeding pain meds. this pain med works well for cronic ill people in PAIN. I like it but it started to make me lose my mine.I have a good head on my shoulders, and hell i was a firefighter before i became sick.I really like this pain med but after a while it will play with your mine.The withdraw from it it is awful and thats no matter how you stop it, also I started at 2mg 4hr prn and then 4mg hrs prn and then 8mg prn then 12mg prn. i stoped the meds because it started to take alot to come my pain for only 2-3hrs at a time. If you take this med please be aware of the side affects and have a good plan to stop them when needed. They can cause just as much trouble at they treat.I may have sever medical problems which will kill me if i cant get a transplant but this medication at the end made me wanting to die because all the stuff it brought with it.It is a very good pain med but again by saying this, it is not a cure but only a cover up for a little while. Please be careful and only take it if need for SEVER PAIN. God bless and good luck

But they put in 2 5in. metal rods, 8 screws, 4 hooks and etc. My bones healed but my hardware cracked and is now causing me 68% constant nerve damage pain. I was taking 2 10mg. tablets of lortab for 3 years for breakthrough pain and it wasnt working for me as well anymore, So my doctor changed me to 4, 4mg. tabs every 4 to 6 hours for pain, and all it does is just on the brim of taking the edge off! It is no different from what the lortab did. Except the lortab relived most of my pain when I first used it.

I have recently been put on it to treat kidney stone pain as well.  I used to use percocet for the kidney stones but the dilaudid helps better. Nothing else would help with migraines but this does.  Granted since I have been taking it for years, I sometimes have to take a higher dose for it to kick in. If you suffer from migraines this could be for you.  Do be careful because it is very habit forming and if you dont actually have a headache or pain it can give you a monster of a headache.  Overall, if taken as prescribed this is a very effective medication at controlling migraine and kidney stone pain.

I was put on vicodins 2 ever 4 hours I stayed on them for a year then they stopped working so I stopped taking them cold turkey. Then in 2008 I decided I couldn't deal with it no more and went to a surgeon and had 2 disc removed. They started as herniated but ended up comming out of my spine. But everytime I went to the ER they shoot me up with 4 or 6mg's of dilaudid and other drugs. The only problem is it was a quick fix. And when I was hospitalized the second time after my surgery for my second surgery for an infection removal they had me on fentanyl 75mg patches and more than 30mg's of dilaudid a day. I never felt any pain the whole time I was in the hospital nor did I remember anything I said or did. Haha. :)
Pain	35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	2	2	Male	35-44	4/24/2009 7:02:16 AM	Oral dilaudid causes me headaches and constipation.  This medication is highly addictive and is much better or effective as an IV drug administered after surgery or in cases of extreme pain.Dilaudid tablets cause headaches but when the doctor injects it, it works better than morphine for me.  After pulmonary embolism it was the only thing I was given in the hospital and it worked very well.  I don't recommend using this medication outside the hospital.
Pain	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/13/2009 11:05:24 AM	I've been hospitalized several times over the past 5 months due to coltis flare ups and c-diff. The coltis causes cramps as bad as contractions. Every time I go to the ER they start with morphine and I tell them they need to just give me dilaudid...it's the only thing that works. Each time I end up getting admitted and have been given the pump with dilaudid.  It's the only thing that has worked on the horrible pain from the cramping. When I was discharged they sent me home with the oral version, 4 mg, every 4 hours. It's been a life saver.  I can funtion again until I get the coltis in remission.
Pain	jackalopesforal, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	4/12/2009 3:44:15 AM	I have been suffering with pain related to a herniated disc at L5. The pain was keeping me from walking, sitting, etc. I went to the ER last night and they injected me with 2 1mg doses of Dilauded, which worked perfectly... for 20 minutes. Now I am on the oral version (2mg every 6 hours) and it does nearly nothing for my pain but makes me sleepy and constipated. Norco has worked much better for me in the past, and that makes me wonder if people may be more receptive to one family of opiates over another... Something to contemplate.

Pain	deja-vu, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	4	3	Female	25-34	4/10/2009 7:30:27 PM	Back surgery. I had a super rare tumor removed from my spine and my heart at 29. They removed a nerve from my spinal cord, which the tumor was growing from and also removed part of my rib to get the tumor out. This leaving me in so much pain I couldn't tolerate life. For the pain I was on Fentanyl patches, Lyrica, and Dilaudid (as well as others). It's been 2yrs. since the surgery and I am basicly down to taking Dilaudid and Lyrica for the pain. Dilaudid really helped with the pain, but now I am just so sick of being on narcotics all the time! I don't know what's worse now, my constant pain (that makes me want to rip out my rib cage and stomp on it) or the side effects of being constantly drugged. I have cut down from 25 pills a day to 3-4 a day, but let me tell you it has not been an easy task! I urge anyone who is taking this to get off of it as soon as you can!!! It is totaly addicting for anyone, I have been cutting down slowly like they say, but even my two specialists say that there is no easy way to come off them. Quote from my Dr. &quot;It will be pure hell.&quot; I would love to know how other people have come off this stuff.

I really can't stand 4 more than 10 min w/out being in pain. There isn't a surgeon I have been 2 that will do surgery on my back. I have been in this pain since I was 14 yrs. old, so u can imagine, I have been on every pain killer known 2 man. I will say that the dilaudid is the most effective medicine I have ever been on 4 pain, but, my doctor only has me on 4 mgs. 6 x's a day because I have a Morphine pump, &amp; as we all know, dilaudid is short acting. I am currently waiting 2 have the morphine in my pump switched 2 dilaudid &amp; my doctor says I may continue 2 take the meds during the day. So, I am hoping that w/ the continuis drip from the pump, my back pain will subside some, &amp; the other (pill form) will take care of the rest. For all of u w/ truly horrible back pain , who have tried everything under the sun, I strongly reccommend the syncromed infusion pump. I will be back on here in a month or two, to let everyone know how well it works. Hopefully, my doctor will raise my dosage during the day, considering, it is short acting &amp; I have been dealing w/ this pain 4 quite some time now.

Pain	OBIWAN48, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Male	55-64	2/28/2009 11:45:31 PM	I had severe back pain due to 3 bulging discs (L2-L5), a compressed nerve at L2/L3,with severe arthtris at L5/SI.Additionally, moderate stentois was evidentin two sections; along with some sponydolsysis (sp?).I was presrcibed a treatment of this drug ( 2mg-4-6 times per day),along with Mobec (15 mg), and two 5 mg valium at nightime before bed to act as a muscle relaxer while I slept.Combined with diligent physical therpay,and a series of epidurals, my back pain has greatly improved. A slow, but steady progress has been made over a period of two months.  Pain has dimished greatly, although there is still some low grade pain that builds up during the day as I work.I'm down to taking one hydromorphine pill per day (typically in the afternoon).  The physical therapy has been extemely important in also aiding in the recovery process.I would highly recommend to anyone with severe back pain to find the best PT professional you can to improve your condition. The above regime has saved me from having back surgery thus far.I'm a 61 year old male, slightly overweight.Negative conditions to the drugs has been a slightly upset stomach about once a week.I would recommend taking a stool softenerif you try this drug as it can lead to contipation. Remember, the physical therapy is as important to help you as the drugs..find a good pt man or woman that truly understands your condition, MRI,s;etc.

It was through and IV every 4 hours. The only thing that worked was this and 7 pills in between doses of this medication. When the nurse would administer it I would have IMMEDIATE relief. I was also given the pill form when I was discharged. It worked great for that really reallt bad migraine.

I couldn't get another dose because my blood pressure was low.  I was told that this drug is the strongest available besides anesthesia.  If this is the case, then this medicine needs to be made stronger if it is to work for everyone.

I was seriously dilusional even to the point that I was convinced in my mind  the staff in charge of my care was plotting to seriously hurt me.  It got so bad that I even began to suspect my wife (who was by my side over 18 hrs /day) had joined the staff in trying to sabotoge my care. After my wife demanded they cease administering this drug I started to return to a normal emotional state of mind

The first surgery was a sectioning of about 14 inches of intestines befreo and after my sigmoid colon.  That resulted in a temporary colostomy. The second was to completed abd I was reconnected about 120 days later.  The injectible drug (2mg's) at the hospital were highly effective for relief of abdomininal surgery [ain.  It was so good that I never had to use it when I came home after the first surgery.The last surgery perfromed on 10/29, had more associated pain so I took my first one at home this afternoon.  No where near the relief efficacy when using the 2 mg tablets to the injections.
Pain	JesPen, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/30/2008 4:58:38 PM	I have suffered for about 6 years now with severe abdominal adhesion's.  I had to frequently visit the ER to get the pain under control.  I did have surgery for it about a year and a half ago.  The surgery results lasted for about a year, then I was right back into to ER.  Dilaudid has been the only thing that can bring me relief from my pain.  My last trip to the ER was about a week ago and the doctor gave me a prescription for Dilaudid to take home as well.  I have tried Vicodin and Precocet for the pain, while they work when it's not at its worst, the Dilaudid really helps knock down the pain so I can function.  Another good idea for chronic pain sufferers, to have a care plan.  This last time I went to the ER, the doctor looked back at all the times I had been there before, he said to have my regular doctor talk to  him and that way they can set up a plan of care for every time I have to come into the ER.  No matter what doctor is there, the same plan will be followed.  And if the pain is at a controllable point, where I don't need to come in to the ER, I can call my regular doctor and get an emergency prescription.  Dealing with the pain is enough, you shouldn't have to fight with the doctor to give you something that works for you!

Upon arrival, they gave me morphine, which put me to sleep for about an hour.  After that, the doctor tried several things including a combo of Benadryl and something else.  That didn't work and so she gave me Dilaudid.  My pain which was at a 10 immediately stopped upon injection.  I've never known relief from such pain so fast.  Thank god for Dilaudid.  Also note, the doctor sent me home with a script for Percocet.

I have allergies to many narcotic pain killers so there are not many options for me to try but Dilaudid did it.  Unfortunately my doctor would not write a script for me to have it at home so relief was short lived and only in the hospital but, what a difference it made.  I was actaully able to get out of bed and crutch around the unit, which was a lifesaver because I found out that I am alleric to whatever chemicals the hospital sanitizes their sheets.  Dilaudid not only eased my pain but it also saved my sanity due to the itching.

Morphine pump and 7 back operations have left me unable to work, and many times isolate myself from contact with any one but my wife.It has taken a long and painful journey to get what relief I now have. Although pain isconstant, 4mg. of Dilaudid 8 times a day has helped a lot.  Naturally, I did the best medical decision in my life, by going to a pain management clinic. It's 120 miles from my home, but the trip once a month to have my pump refilled and get a new script for Diaudid is worth it.
Pain	RangerVic, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Male	19-24	8/25/2008 3:43:05 AM	I was injured in Iraq due to an IED and was burned in over 84% of my body. Im 24 yrs old and never used any illegal drugs before. I didnt even take Tylenol for headaches. I just drank water and went for a run. So my body has always been pretty clean. Since my injury, Ive used pretty much every pain medication in the book with less than a handful that have actually worked but none of them have relieved the pain completely. Im currently on the fentanyl duragesic (100mcg/hr---48hrs) and Morphine 30mgX2 every 4 hours. The morphine has been about equal to taking a Tylenol for a broken leg. Ive used Dilauded before with only limited relief. Obviously intravenous Dilauded and Fentanyl are the best for pain relief. Personally, I think that Actiq has been the best for immediate pain relief. Dilauded might work for others but it didnt prove too helpful for me.
Pain	Davo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	8/11/2008 10:58:22 AM	I was on Actiq 800 mcg 4/day and Duragesic 100 mcg/hour for about six months for chronic/migraine headaches with little relief. My insurance company decided they didn't want to pay the $1600/month bill for the Actiq so my pain doctor switched me to Dilaudid 8 mg every 4-6 hours and suddenly my pain level went from 7 down to about 2. My pain doctor died and it took me over a year to find another doctor willing to prescribe this medication. I have been back on it for two years and except for a few major attacks a year which I can manage with the addition of Toradol and Zofran, I have gone from wanting to drive my car into a concrete overpass everyday to starting my own business.
Pain	nand13, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	4	Male	19-24	8/3/2008 4:04:01 PM	I was prescribed this medication for a brief period of time for persistent nerve pain after a complicated inguinal hernia operation.  It did not have the effectiveness of when I was given it intravenously in the hospital (obviously), and I think I was given a low dose for my body size and my natural tendency to be tolerant to narcotics.  This drug works markedly more inefficiently when taken orally than other routes of administration.  I would recommend oxycodone or hydrocodone instead, unless you have a normal sensitivity to opiates or are prescribed a higher dose (4 or 8mg).
Pain	jlf, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	7/29/2008 1:50:20 AM	I have avn in left hip and ruptured disc at L5-S1 and L4-L5. It seems like different medications work at different times so I have to rotate them. If you get a doctor that is a pain doctor, you will have more success. The meds that have helped me have been Tylox, Dilaudid, Fentanyl Patch, and even Vicodin helped at times. The two strongest are Dilaudid and Fentanyl. Dilaudid is actually many times stronger than morphine, but not as strong as Fentanyl. Fentanyl does not administer the medical punch that dilaudid does though. My wife has chronic pain from a number of diseases and she swears by the Fentanyl saying it is the best thing in her 25 years of chronic pain. I think the Dilaudid is the best for me, but I will probably have to rotate to something else after awhile longer. I guess some people's body chemistry is just unusual so if you get to a point where the medication does not work, keep trying something else or even combinations to get your relief. And make sure you get a doctor that is not afraid to prescribe. Some states will punish a doctor that does not give his patients relief. Google it if you need to find one that specializes in pain relief.
Pain	Pam , 45-54 Female 	1	1	1	Female	45-54	7/27/2008 8:38:54 PM	My sister just passed away from her dilaudid addicton, plus whatever else she was taking in her bag of tricks. All her drugs were doctor prescribed. She went to sleep and never woke up. We are still waiting for the toxicology reports from the medical examanier, but it wasn't hard to figure it out. Please be careful to those of you who use prescription drugs. Take them as prescribed, not as you feel like it. She was only 48 years old.

The medication works great but don't get caught having to &quot;withdrawl&quot; from it.  I live in NY and most of it was prescribed by the ER.  I became a patient of a pain clinic who would not prescribe it any longer and the victim of a primary care doctor who also would not prescribe because I was at the pain clinic.  Thus, no one wanted to take responsibility for wheening me off of it.  So last friday am was my last dose and I spent the weekend going through hell!!!  All the withdrawl symptoms and then some.  It's Tues. and I am just starting to feel a little normal- have to keep eating and drinking water in order to not feel completely sick.  While this medication may be very effective, I do not recommend it to anyone who's providers are irresponsible,to say the least.  I hope in a couple more days I am back to myself-will not take narcotics again.  As for my chest pain, I am left to deal with that on my own as well.  Wonderful medical system here in Northern NY.

Pain	margaret, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/9/2008 2:00:08 AM	After an emergency surgery for intestinal obstruction, I had a good 3 week stay in hospital. When I was finally sent home I was given 1mg/4x/day of Dilaudid. It worked well for me, I have no nausea (i take it with food or glass of milk), I function normal on my everyday tasks. Until now, after being on this drug for almost 3 months, I have been trying to whine off the medication and it has been hard for me. My symptoms are EXACTLY whats described on WEBMD site. Until two weeks ago, I started not to take Dilaudid as prescribe. From 4 a day, I gradually eased it down to 3 per day, then 2 a day, until last week, to one pill a day. This week, I can go for 24 hours without it but then my body starts to &quot;look&quot; for it. I did not know what was going on with me physically (nothing mentally) until I did a search on WEBMD and that is when I found out that all of what I HAVE BEEN experiencing in the past week such as BODY CHILLS, RESTLESNESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, etc., is part of WITHDRAWAL symptoms from this med., I like the pill it TRULY helps the pain, it's just I don't like all of the side effects mentally and  physically. Now What??? Do I have to be on more medications because of the SIDE EFFECTS of Dilaudid? C'mon, I don't like taking pills for anything unless it's Vitamins or supplements. I like feeling normal.

Treatment over the past 10 years includes - oycodone, morphine sulfate, darvocet-n. percocet, methadone, dilaudid, vicodin.  I hated oxycodone.  Methadone was fair but weight gain was unacceptable (went from 117 to 157 in a year!).  Used to take Dilaudid at night because of drowsiness.  Took methadone for past year during day - fair pain mgmt with as needed Dilaudid at night. Now just went back to Dilaudid at night w/ oxycodone for day.  Strange!  Reversal of side effects!  Oxy makes me sleepy and Dilaudid keeps me awake.  Who can explain anything anyway?  So, sticking with Dilaudid for daytime unless sleepiness creeps in as it did 2 years ago.  I rate Dilaudid A+.

Pain	piretaltumor20, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	4	5	1	Male	19-24	3/10/2008 1:01:33 PM	I have been having unbearable headaches for about a week and then all of the sudden, a seizure! After a ct scan.... stage 3 astrocytoma brain tumor. The doctors first gave me hydrocodone 10's with very little affectivness, but then came the diluadid. After some research I was amazed that it works so well for others and not for myself. 8mg was my dosage and it made my head hurt worce! So then i went to the fentanyl patch along with hyrdocodone 10mg and what an improvment
Pain	Tasheena, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	1	Female	19-24	3/1/2008 6:02:27 AM	I found out after taking this drug and some other ER meds, that I am sllergic to most narcotic pain relievers. Benadryl has no effect for the hives I get when given this. But it worked very well to take away the migraines I got from my brain tumor.
Pain	tall mama, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/29/2008 10:21:17 AM	I have had chronic lower back pain for over 2 1/2 years. I've been on Diluadid for 2 months now. WOW it has made a big difference. My pain level has gone from an 8/9 to 4/5. I have had NO side effects. Thank you for this miracle drug.
Pain	dc830, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	2/4/2008 10:18:05 PM	After being on a long run with endocet/percocet I needed something that would work as well in place of the other. After being on them so long I needed to stop. My doc just started dilaudid-so far so good. I do find i'm a bit more tired which never happens with oxycodone. I take this for c3/4/5 disc damage and surgery is due soon. I want to be able to return to endocet after surgery but if I dont take a brake iwont get the full benefits of the med. This is a good sub in the interim.
Pain	25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	25-34	1/23/2008 7:10:27 PM	I've had reconstructive surgery on my elbow and wrist, my range of motion will never be normal again. I have at most 50% of the range that I used to. I get very sharp acute pain when using my arms. I take Dilaudid 8mg pills now for the pain. I've tried MsContin,Oxycontin, Roxicodone, and a slew of combo drugs, but nothing has been as effective for my pain as Dilaudid. I think it is the most effective pain medication out there.

Pain	laceyluu, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/10/2008 6:40:45 AM	I have degenerative polyneuropathy, klipple-fiel anomoly, degenerative arthritis,chronic kidney disease, peripheral nerve damage in right leg from knee down to foot.  I suffer from chronic pain horribly and have been on narcotic drug therapy for many years now.  I currently take MS-contin 60mg. 2xday, Kadian 60mg. 1xday and OxyIR 5mg q6hrs prn for break-through pain.  I recently was given a prescription of Dilaudid for additional relief because I had some minor surgery.  All I can say is &quot;THANK YOU GOD FOR DILAUDID!!!&quot; I was more pain free than I have been for years.  While no pain med will relieve all my pain, I'll take every little bit I can get.  As another reviewer stated - the meds are for pain relief, not for a high!  I give it full marks.

Orthopedic doc thinks it might be parctially dislocated. This Med hasnt touched the pain. The ER doctor said it would take me for a loop since im only a teen. He thought i might be knocked out. I was still talking and in pain/crying when we left. This hasnt done anything. And do to other allergies nothing else will do for now.
Pain	EJ Carpathia, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	12/18/2007 11:03:05 AM	I've been suffering through chronic pancreatitis and they pain can be very extreme. On top of that I also suffer from peripheral neuropathy in my legs and there's a lot of pain involved with that too. I was given this medication while I was in the hospital straight into my IV and it was wonderful. The pain simply disappeared. Ever since then whenever the pain gets too much for me I ask my doctor for a prescription of Dilaudid and get myself the amount I need to keep me out of suffrage till my next visit. Thank Heaven for Dilaudid! =)
Pain	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	3	1	Female	45-54	12/14/2007 8:14:09 AM	after abdominal hernia surgery inj drug worked much better in hospital. Oral drug at home was of no use. I wear a fenteyl patch 50mcg for chronic back pain and was taking Utram ER for break through pain before my surgury. Now 2 days after pain is still bad but not as acute The arguements I have had with the dr's and nurses to justify my pain haven't been worth the drug or the rx cost. 
Pain	tdpower714@msn.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	12/5/2007 3:08:28 PM	I suffer from chronic intractable pain with my back. After 3 surgeries, one included 6 screws in a back fusion, decompersion of nerves, and 24 years ago what was called a slipped disc. My back pain is somewhat worse than before I started. My right ankle and foot are parlyzed, and physical therapy doesn't seem to be helping. I was on diluadid, but it doesn't work in the same compacity it did in the beginning, now I was just switched to Percoct 3/650, which doesn't seem to give much relief at all. Are there any suggestions?

It helps quite well for my back pain that I suffer from due to past surgeries from having cancer. People need to understand that you are looking for the effectiveness of the PAIN KILLER, not the body buzz! Although Dilaudid HELPS, it in no way makes the pain go away, that is why I have the fetanyl as well.
