Other	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Male	45-54	9/15/2012 10:11:45 PM	A little over 2 weeks ago, I weighed 226.6 lbs. My friend had used easy hcg for about 3 weeks and lost a very noticeable amount of weight. He gave me a 2/3 full bottle and told me that should last about 3 weeks. He also gave me the instructions, which I have followed almost completely, (I cheated a couple of times with a small amount of salty snacks). That being said, in 15 days I've gone from 226.6 lbs to 210.2 lbs. I have been pretty good about the caloric intake of 500 calories per day. I plan to begin working out to continue the fat loss. This isn't about weight loss as much as it is about fat loss. I see the fat coming off my body. I see muscle definition returning. I know that I am in striking distance of getting into great shape because I've just lost about 16 lbs of fat off my body. I've felt great the whole time. When I feel a bit hungry, I drink water and the hunger subsides. I would recommend this product to others. I would also say, don't think you can go back to eating the way you did before and do nothing in the form of physical exercise and think you are going to keep the fat off of your body. Use this as a catalyst  to give you a headstart in reaching your fitness goals. There is no cure-all. You have to put effort into your long-term physical health.   
Other	Erica, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female	25-34	6/22/2012 11:30:09 AM	It took me a year to realize that this is why FDA has no comment. Here is my theory. This is information that I myself investigated from talking to people researching and talking to HCG corporate.The best to know the legit info is the person who discovered it which is Dr. Simeons. I bought my first HCG at GNC because I trust the store I never had any other issues with their sells or products. Until I bought my first HCG with them. I tried it for about 3 weeks. I was 150 at the time. I did manage to go down to 130. I followed every step possible and my weight was still fluctuating. So I don't know why I assumed it was the real HCG. I should've checked the label first.Well when I educated myself more on the ingredients and had the knowledge of what it is supposed to contain. I researched and found out that there was no HCG in it on the back of the bottle if you read it basically says water based it is diluted. I was upset. Then talked to a trainer at my gym this is what he says....sweetie you lost all the muscle you had before it sure was not fat... what you are taking showed him the bottle and said it was fake HCG. I was upset because it made me loose muscle instead of fat. I really think the fact of putting the liquid under your tongue makes you think psychologically that it will work because that is what you read, but like I said when you research and have knowledge. You want to test it for yourself. So here it goes I did my on scientific test. I stopped the HCG for about two weeks. Then my trainer told me watch lets put it to the test...I went back to the gym and started lifting weights again and got muscle back it took me about 3 months to be back in shape. He tells me to try the diet again but this time DO NOT TAKE THE HCG follows the same protocol of Dr. Simons. I did exactly what he told me then I sure was losing weight pounds it was sub conscience....I then realized it was not the drops it is the fact of the low intake calories consumed. I started losi

I have felt great, with lots of energy, no moodiness, and my lab results at my annual physical were right on target.  In fact, my cholesterol dropped from 258 to 190.  The diet requires your dedication to following the medical protocol.  I maintained my weight during the maintenance phase and hope to lose another 20 pounds (will re-start the drops in a couple months to lose them).  I am listening to my body and am thoroughly pleased with the diet and the results!

Other	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	3	1	Female	35-44	8/26/2011 11:07:08 AM	I did this for a week and lost 12 pounds, which I know was water weight because I urinated constantly.  I stopped drops and next day I was thirsty constantly; drank lots, but barely urinated.  Gained back the weight in two days.  Tried the drops with just a regular diet and lost nothing.  If you eat 500 calories a day without the drops, you'll still lose 1-2 pounds per day because you're burning more calories than you're eating.  This is just a fad diet-making you think that the drops are causing the weight loss, when in fact it is just the reduced calories.  Ha, ha - lightbulb!  I was also having weird side effects like aggitation and increase in libido.  My doctor said that these drops can cause &quot;pregnancy&quot; side effects.

I decided not to do another round of the diet because is was very hard. Since the diet, I have experienced health problems I have never had before. Severe acid reflux that is not relieved by any medication or treatment. I also had an infection in my stomach. Everyone I know that has done the hcg diet have had similar side effects and some even worse. My problem is still not resolved and I have been seeing a specialist for months now. Be very leery of this diet. I wish I would have heard about these side effects. It would have saved me from a lot of money and a lot of pain! 
Other	HexaTheAmazon, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	2/21/2011 10:17:43 AM	I am a Type1 diabetic and I can tell you that HCG works just fine. When I was on HCG my insulin requirements were literally cut in 1/2. If you follow the protocol as it states, you will lose the weight. I did not lose a pound a day, but more than 1/2 a pound. The results were remarkable. My skin changed, eatting habits, and my clothes were significantly bigger. I am currently in Phase 4 and still in the 2 pound window. I have not gained any weight back and the desire to eat junk for has decreased. Being a diabetic carbs are not my friend. I love rice, french fries, yuca, etc. however they dont love me. With this diet it has decreased my desire for these foods. I need to lose 20 more pounds and will do so using this protocol. If you want to lose weight, keep it off and lower your medication requirements follow this protocol to a tee.  If you have any serious health issues make sure you speak with your doctor first however, I can tell you it works fine. If you are having difficulties and the HCG is not working for you make sure it's pure. Some of the providers are not sending pure HCG and it can cause problems. Remember to give your body a rest from the shots when you get off of the protocol. If you over do it your hair could fall out. If you are doing more than 1 round you must wait 4 weeks before you start again.  If you do 2 rounds wait for 6 weeks. The longest you can stay on this protocol is 40 days and then you must give it a rest. Read the Pounds and Inches transcript by Dr. Simeons and it will explain the protocol and how to do so correctly.  Anything that is not done correctly can cause harm. Good Luck in your new healthy life.

The protocol is to not take vitamins.  My vitamin A and Vitamin D were dangerously low after the diet.  Then I got shingles.  Doctors say it was because my immune system was taxed.  (Could it be the 500 calorie a day diet?)  Then I put on weight.  Went to an endocronologist.  Routine exam found a small lump.  CANCER- Thyroid Cancer.  No history at all in the family. I can't blame HCG entirely but it is certainly a large consideration.  If I could do it again I would not.

No side effects, but will keep you updated after a week. So far this has been amazing.

I have lost just over 30+ lbs. and my wife is down 20+. I have had no side effects and do not have any hunger or any of the negative issues mentioned. I walk several miles every other day and have plenty of energy. My mood is excellent and I feel great. I did this plan as part of the HCG diet at Green Valley Spa in Utah. It is supervised by several MD's and medical staff. I know many people want to comment on the 'safety' of this diet, however, if you haven't tried it you really can't comment. Your body has PLENTY of energy stored in the form of fat. The proper meals on the plan are nutritious and tasty and give you everything to help you lose. The 500 calories are more than enough to fuel your activities and the rest comes from stored fat. Just because the treatment hasn't been blessed by the FDA doesn't mean that it isn't safe or effective. If anyone needs serious weight loss, I highly recommend this program. P.S. I use the drops, they work just as well as the shots.

I have lost 26lbs. I'm very please with my results. However, it is very important in using this diet protcol that you also get the book called, HCG Weight Loss Cure Guide.  This will ensure sucess.  You need to read this book so that you don't make big mistakes eating items that are not on the list.  This book explains the menu of the 500 calorie meals,(what can be eaten) then six weeks maintenance (adding the foods back into your diet). Also, after the last injection,   the next 3 days you can have the 500 calories.  Then on the 4th day start adding foods back into your diet. But always check the list in the book.  So you don't chose the wrong foods hence gain weight. This information also applies to the drop of HCG. Best of luck.

I did gain the weight back yet didn't follow through with the stabilization phase which most don't know about.  You must also eat a specialized diet while taking the drops.  My issue hasn't been gaining the weight back I really could care less.  My issue is I have been anxious and restless.  I think it caused a severe hormone imbalance before taking the HCG I did have an ovarian cyst which I was told didn't matter.

Yes, it makes it sound like the weight is going to melt away, which is not the case! You have to make a whole, complete lifestyle change and commit yourself to that. You can't expect to lose weight and go back to your old eating habits and keep it off. When you have had a weight problem for most of your life like I have, you still have to continue to work at it everyday! I wish it could be some miracle drug where you can eat whatever you want, but it's VERY structured. Sticking to the recommends is what makes it stay off &amp; of course putting in that extra effort to make sure it doesn't come back. I have went from 247 lbs to now 209 lbs in 2 1/2 months. I was on the shot for 40 days &amp; just barely began taking them again. I did not gain a pound at all being off of the shots for a month. This is wonderful &amp; with my dedication to this diet, I believe, I will be at my goal weight &amp; be able to keep it off. The changes I have made to this diet are ones that should have been made anyway cause I wasn't eating or drinking the right things to make my weight a priority, now that I am I definetly am seeing the results!

It WORKS. I've lost inches in my arms, stomach, hips, butt, and thighs. The HCG is there to unlock the bad fat that is stored away in my body. I can tell the protocol is retraining my mind and body on how to eat. Following the diet from start to finish is the key. There are 3 phases that must be followed in order for you to receive maximum results. It really takes a lot of self discipline, but the reward on the other side is priceless!!

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/3/2009 5:44:56 PM	I think it is BS and a HUGE dis-service to women to not allow this to be used for weight loss.  When I turned 45, I could no longer control my weight despite working out 2 hours a day and dieting (I was a certified personal trainer and owned 2 gyms and counseled 1000s of women in weight loss).  I watched myself go from 129 pounds to 175 in a little over 2 years.  At times, I literally gained 5 pounds in a week.  I would lose 3 pounds - gain back 5 - over and over.  Desperate, I read Kevin Trudale's book and discovered HCG.  WHAT A MIRACLE!!!  I am losing a pound a day consistently and feel fantastic.  Most importantly, the weight is not coming off in the areas that I DO NOT want to lose weight - my face and my breast.  It has taken longer than I wanted BECAUSE the FDA shut down the 1st clinic and I had to find another clinic to get HCG and was without it for 2 and 1/2 weeks.  Most importantly, I am not hunger and have made numerous behavioral modifications to insure that the weight will stay off - mainly no white stuff - sugar, flour, potatoes, and rice.  Friends and acquaintances are asking what I am doing as I look great, my skin is beautiful, and I feel fantastic.  So GO GET HCG if you are serious about losing weight!  I have 20 more pounds to go to my goal weight and I am planning a wonderful Valentine's get away with my husband.

Other	seegg, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	10/9/2008 4:45:15 PM	I have struggled with my weight for years and over the past 3years since I turned 38yrs, my weight kept going higher and higher no matter how much I excercised or how great I ate. With HCG injections I have lost about 1 lb a day and I am thrilled. This is a blessing for me. I have alot of energy and I am not hungry. Which I thought I would be with the regimen. But its Easy! I cant wait to get back into shape.

Other	Blondie, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	1/15/2008 6:54:32 PM	I lost 76 pounds in 4 mos on hcg injections.  I went from size 22-24 to a 10-12.  I was VERY HAPPY about that. I followed the diet very strictly and did not get hungry and had plenty of energy.  Sometimes I would lose a pound and a half a day when I walked.  One thing I question is, can this make your hair fall out?  My hair has always been fairly thick and long and I always got compliments on it. Now it has been coming out by the brushfuls for over a month and I am very concerned. I had about 5 inches cut off because it was thin and stringy on the ends. I don't know if it's the hcg or something causing it.  Has anybody else had this problem?  I had injections 6 wks then waited 6 wks &amp; injections 4 wks to lose 76 pounds. I was on the diet for 14 weeks.  I read that extreme dieting can make your hair fall out. I am ready for it to stop. Other than that, (if hcg is the reason)I was THRILLED with the results!

The weight is hard to lose because much of it is muscle. I took it in a complex that relieved joint pain and it worked but I went from 135 to 205lbs in less than a year.
