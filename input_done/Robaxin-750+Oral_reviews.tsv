I was on it for many years and wouldn't even THINK about my back for extended periods of time.  When he took me off it, (he said I was too old?????????), thats just about all I think about.  Nothing else has worked for me.  Its non narcotic and non addictive, as well.  I recommend it highly.

The site article was written by a PH.D from Kaiser Permanente.
Muscle Spasm	motorizedqueen, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	1	Male	25-34	4/13/2012 11:55:25 PM	I was prescribed 2 of the roxin 750mg per day. That dosage didn't help so I tried 3 per day for 2 days and I couldn't tall a difference at all.  I return to my doctor in 4 days and i'm gonna request something stronger.  Been on flexeril before and they made me drowsy but never helped the muscle spasms.  My only options are likely soma or chloraxone.  Maybe they will work!

I still have back pain and nerve pain but when I take my medicine (robaxin &amp; nuerotin) It makes a huge difference in my pain. My pain before my surgeries was uncontrollable by any medication and my pain is significantlly less ( I can go to work everyday now!)

Other	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	45-54	2/18/2011 2:29:02 AM	I take this along with Oxycontin, Oxycodone, Neurintin for severe lower and cervical spine problems, I spoke with my doctor because it didn't work as good as the Valume 5mg I took when I was in the ER after a procedure went bad. I'm just about to start taking 2 750mg 3 times a day instead of only one, I will have to see if this works, I will post another post in a month. I read alot of comments about people with chronic pain NOT getting the pain pill they desperately need to function, please go to a Pain Management Doctor, they deal in ONLY Pain, unlike your PCP. PCP really can't prescribe strong pain medication because they are not specialist in pain, the DEA is very strict. For depression you see a specialist, for pain you too must see a specialist in Pain Management. I don't know why PCP don't refer patients with chronic pain to Pain Management Specialist? Go Figure 
Muscle Spasm	blue, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) 	2	3	2	Female	25-34	11/7/2010 3:05:06 PM	When I took 1 tab of the 750mg dose (with 600mg Motrin as an adjunct)it didn't help at all. I started to take two tabs along with the Motrin and it has helped somewhat. I never take anything-even for headaches, so I thought I'd be really sensitive to this med, but heat/ice therapy has been more help than it has.

I am also on percocet and neurontin.  I could not function without the muscle relaxers.  Problem is that I am needing more to help the problem since I have been on them for so long.  My doctors will not up my dose and I just have to live with the pain until the next dose is possible.

Muscle Spasm	45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	2	2	Female	45-54	8/11/2010 3:28:25 PM	I have lower back pain. I have L4 &amp; L5 degeneration. My Dr put me on this med. I really don't notice any relief..... I also take Norco which doesn't do much either.  Doctors now adays won't prescribe pain meds because of all the abuse out there people taking pain meds when they don't really need them and for those of us who do, we are just out of luck. Its a shame, when your in pain you can get no relief.

I find that a double dose does help relax the tightness but seems to wear off too quickly. It does make me somewhat sleepy but no other side effects. I think it gets the job done without getting into some more serious meds.

Muscle Spasm	getmdone8, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	3	2	Female	25-34	7/14/2009 11:15:00 AM	i was envolved in a car accident, sprained my neck when my head hit the stearing wheel. I was put on this medication and it was great for 2 days, then when the side effects wore off so did the ability to reduce the spasms.This should last 4-5 hours, I am lucky if I get 2-3 of relief. This is so frustrating cause doctors now are so worried about handing out medication, and thanks to society it is hard to prove when your really in pain.

Pain so bad I could not walk. It doesn't help at all. He gave it to me because doctors nowadays will not give Vicodin or pain medicine even when you need it for pain. Too much abuse everywhere. What a shame.
