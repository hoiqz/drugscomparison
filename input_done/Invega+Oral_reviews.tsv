She's been in a mental hospital for 7 years. Doc put her on Invega and I feel like we finally got our mom back! She thinks clearly, has no delusions nor hallucinations. AMAZING. So amazing I could cry.

Bipolar Depression	flower, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	35-44	5/22/2012 12:41:46 AM	Invaga worked for me the first two months  Then just recently I gained weight in my abdomen area real fast and am suffering other side effets. They are extreme fatigue, feeling anxious,very worried,depressed, numbness in hands and feet, sore muscles, blurry vision and frequent urination. I am not sure why this has occured. I am going through a really hard time also. My father is not feeling good at times and I get so upset cause he is very important to me. Also my hus band says he will be leaving me to go home to his country which will leave me in charge of finances and a new place to live. They say stress can cause depression. I am seeking the help of my psychologist and my aunts,Dad,cousins,Uncle and my sister.  I think also my sleep schedule is off. I don't go to bed until real late and sleep in alot. The weight gain from the invega worries me the most its about 40 pounds. My doctor told me Invega is not a weight gaining drug and that is not true bcause I WAS VERY THIN IN THE BEGINNING. My husband puts me down cause of my weight and that makes me depressed. I really was doing better when I was fourty pounds less. I had more energy then. But that was also before I got the news of my Dads serious condition and my husband saying hes leaving in the future. Im going to review the effectiveness of Invega and side effects with my Pschiatrist as soon as possible. I have appointment on June  6.

Found out the hard way I cannot take Tylenol Cold Medicine while on this drug. Made me swell in the feet, ankles, and hands. Went away in 4 hours, so not bad. Have been on for 3 weeks, so not bad so far for the positive it does. I just have to live with my cold.

It controls my deep, dark depressions, paranoia, and delusions. I was initially taking Risperdal, which caused me to develop tremors.  Invega provides me with the same results as Risperdal without the side effect of tremors. I was initially taking 6 mg a day but started to suffer from mood swings and paranoia. I am currently on 9 mg and am doing fantastic. I am very pleased with the effects of this medication and would recommend it to anyone suffering from bipolar disorder. I initially gained 20 lb while taking it but I am now carefully watching what I eat and exercising and the weight is slowly coming off.

I am 49 and have had bad bi-polar since I was 7.  I have literally tried all the drugs out there.  This is the only one, besides Depakote (1750mg daily,) and Klonopin (6mg, daily) to slow my manic episodes down.  I don't like the weight gain, as I have gained 25 lbs. even with heavy exercise.. When I have low points I add in 100 mg of Pristiq and I am fine for about 6 months.  It's a balancing act that I fall off way too often.

I have been on it for 3 years, and I have had no episode.  In fact, I am happy most of the time.  I did gain a lot of weight at first.  I gained 40 lbs initially, and now I am 25 lbs overweight.  It just increases your appetite.  Watch what and how much you eat, exercise, and you should be fine.  It saved my life!

Was switched to 9mg and the thoughts and my attitude have drastically been affected positively. I also take zyprexa (low dose), I have not seen any weight gain from Invega. Invega makes me very drowsy initially after taking the pill so I take it at nighttime. Underlying drowsiness throughout the day. I am able to go to college and do all my work well. Do not feel like a zombie like on other anti-psychotics. Has been a good experience for me. Earned a 3.7 GPA last semester in upper-division classes.

Wanting relef fom side effects plagueing my helth along with the stubborness of some doctors to discontinue is astonding!

I feel relief when I take this medication after missing a dose.  My thinking becomes clear again, and my agitation goes away completely.  I took Risperdal for many years before this, and I've found that they both work well.  I'm a male and I haven't had any of the side effects that are listed except for the weight gain.  I try to stay on the Mediterranean diet, which keeps my weight just within the normal range.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar when I was 18 and am now 26. Over the period of 6 years I went through over 10 meds that didn't work. Invega is a miracle to me. I have not gained weight, in fact I have lost weight after being on Zyprexa. I do have raised prolactin levels and don't menstrate, but my mood is stable and I have not had an episode on over 2 years. This drug has worked for me and even with the side effects I will continue to take it.

I've gone through about 7 doctors and even more medications.  The dosage that has finally been successful the past 2 years has been lithium, lamictal, and invega.  I used to take geodon, but my personal feelings of distress (more physical than anything else) made me beg for something else.  And then, whala!  A new drug called invega.  I soon was able to study for school better, my relationship with my then girlfriend now wife went to new heights; I even have been able to sustain a job for the past two years, all while buying my first home at 25 and a new car.  I truly attribute invega for giving me the stability to be myself again.

Seems to help stop the talking, but the figures are still present. Still paranoid, still having negative symptoms. Not as agitated as before, but still easily agitated from little things. Still get confused. Haven't noticed any weight gain that can't be attributed to the holidays.Makes me kind of sleepy a couple hours after I take it, but if I'm kept busy and thinking and moving, I don't fall asleep.We'll see how it goes on 6 mg.

I'm not paranoid and my thoughts are not racing at all. I was on abilify, and I went out of the range of abilify and fell into a manic phase for several months. To say the least it was horrible. My current doctor put me on invega and I like the fact that I seem to be more sound and not manic or paranoid. However, now I am very sluggish and lazy. I feel depressed and I have gained a lot of weight.  My body just seems to me weighed down all the time. I also easily get indigestion now. I am also lacking focus and have a terrible time doing basic tasks like getting dressed of doing the laundry. I take it in the morning along with an anti-anxiety medication. I'm going to talk to my doctor about all of the side effects that I am experiencing to see if there is another medicine out there for me. It would be great if I could find a drug that gave me the balance and clarity of invega and the pep that I got from abilify. I had no weight gain when I was on abilify.

I have tried many things on the market and none have helped effectively. I had to stop invega because I had a severe adverse reaction to it... My legs swelled up horribly. It took me a bit to figure out it was from the pill but as soon as I found out it was from the pill I stopped taking it and a few days later the swelling went away. I have never had an adverse reaction to a medication until now. It was scary!!
Bipolar Depression	lizgiz, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	4	1	Female	35-44	10/12/2009 5:34:54 PM	i took 3mg. then 6mg. for total of 4mo. I went to my gynocologist because I was lactating and he immed. ordered a brain MRI. I now have a pituitary tumor (prolactinoma). I had prolactin lvls. of 89.6 while on Invega, dropping to 5.2 after only 2 weeks off it. No one told me that this could happen, even info on the net didn't mention this. I also am on Metformin now because of the high blood sugar s/e, now permanent. I had Tardive Dyskenesia in hands; it went away. I have permanent sun sensitivity. Obviously, for me, the benefits didn't outweigh the risks. I have changed doctors, part of the problem, and now take Lamictal. I have had no s/e and it is working good. I guess I'm one of the people that Invega DIDN&quot;T work for!

Has worked better than Abilify and almost as well as Risperdal.  No change in the weight gain, however, so added Vyvanse to counteract.  This combination is working fairly well, but we are going to pursue other options (specifically SAMe) because of the side effects and level of medication she is on.

It also caused weight gain 15 lbs. and increased apetite. Depressed feeling from knowing that I had once again broken from reality and feeling of despair lessoning as time passes.  Because I suffer from progressive MS my loss of wake time contributes to worsening of Multiple Sclerosis symptoms,  I can not take this medication with out changing the other medications I am taking or stopping this medication completely.  I wish that this medicine could have come in a 4mg dose.

For a while I was taking 3mg then the dr. increased to 6mg due to some moody behaviors I still had however I have gained a lot of weight taking this medicine though I don't eat that much.

I'm also an alcoholic (bad one) Since I've been on Invega I can't hardly drink. I still try but it stops the buzz and after 6 or 7 drinks I just stop. I hope this continues. I haven't read any where that this could help with alcoholism.

It seems to be helping my manic episodes cycle faster and my aggressiveness toward others has been decreased. I guess it's ok. I will know more when my dosage gets increased next week to 6mg. Since my psychiatrist is able to provide me with samples and it replaced the Geodon I was taking, which also costs a fortune. I will continue but have some fears in reagard to the numerous side effects this drug presents. I have noticed a severe increase in joint and muscle pain and stiffness in my body. I will write an update next month.

Scared to start it because of it being a new drug. Taking the Cymbalta and attivan and I am scared of the depakote because friends have told me it can eventually make you have seizures? After the reviews I am going to start it tonight and see how it goes, not sure about the depakote though? The medicine is oddly enough covered by my medicaid. I pay $3 dollars a script! Hopefully it will help my anxiety since attivan isn't doing anything for me. I just hope I don't get too sleepy! Any recommendations from others on this medicine or combination of medicine? I couldn't comment on the overall satisfation or anything because I have never taken this medicine.
Schizophrenia	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	1	Female	35-44	5/14/2009 8:07:35 AM	I am currently on medicine for restless leg syndrome. I am bipolar &amp;schizonophrenic. I only took this medicine one day and it totally made my med. for RLS useless. In one day I suffered from 3 attacks of RLS lasting about 2 hours each. I cannot even take this drug long enough to see if this side effect will go away because this reaction is to hard to deal with. I would rather suffer with my condition then take this medicine. I am currently on effexor, ellevil, ativan, lamictal, and RLS medicine.

My complaint, though, and this is a big deal to me, is that I gained a lot of weight.  I believe they understate how much weight gain Invega can cause.  If you're really thin to begin with I wouldnt worry about it.  If you're on the heavy side to begin with then only take it if absolutely necessary.

My only concern is that I am having the prolactin side effect and am leaking breast milk.  My oldest child is 18, and I had a hysterectomy at 26, so pregnancy is impossible.

She takes 9mg daily. At first she took it mornings, but found it made her tired so she switched to evenings and finds it helps her rest better and she is not as tired during the day. Not as many mood swings and her attitude is much happier and upbeat. Appetite is down, but weight is still holding.

Currently,I am experiencing joint and muscle soreness.  I'm unsure, but I may be experiencing diarrhea as well.  My doctor prescribed Cogentin (2 mg) to relieve my joint and muscle pain.  I've only taken it for 4 days,but have seen considerable improvement. Since taking the Cogentin, I have seen a remarkable improvement to my mental outlook.  My diarrhea also seems much better.  Whether or not this is due tothe Cogentin, I don't know.  While taking Invega with 100 mg of Seroquel, I experienced anxiety and my mental outlook was poor.  I always looked at the negative side of things and fixated on the worst possible scenario.  It's unclear as to whether or not my psychiatrist will keep me on Invega.

I have yet to experience any side effects with this medication.  I do, at times, suffer from insomnia, but still manage to sleep even if at odd times of the day or night.  The control-release substance makes it easy to take the pill if one cannot stick to a regulated daily time schedule for taking medication.  I always feel better, more alert and more focussed within one hour after taking this medication.  I have not experienced any additional side effects and am not certain if the insomnia is caused by Invega or if it is simply caused by life itself.

Schizophrenia	45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/8/2008 8:15:26 PM	Because of drug abuse as a teen I developed audio hallucinations.  I was put on a drug called Serentil and was on it for over 25 years. I took 50mg per day. I was fine all my adult life then they stopped making the drug.  I tried everything-Geodon-Seroquel-Resperdal-Melleril and others.  Nothing worked.  Finally I changed docs and he put me on Invega-3mg-didn't work then 6mg-better but still not the best then 9mg-great.  No more voices and I don't have any side effects.  Only problem is over the 3 years of trying different meds I developed constant anxiety. My doc put me on Xanax ER.  Which may not be the best for someone who used to use drugs but, I haven't used since age 20 and I'm 47 now.  No side effects with Xanax ER either. And I still have slight anxiety but, I live with it.  As for the weight gain  on Invega I don't have it but, I have a very physical job so that may have something to do with it.  I also tried Depakote and gained 25# in 2 months.  The most important thing is no voices and I can live a &quot;normal&quot; life.  After 3 years of trying Thank God for Invega.

I am very satisfied with this drug, &amp; am tolerating it well, with the exception of weight gain.

I noticed a twitching in my toes and fingers. This minor twitching has continued for the 6 months I have been on it.  I could not sleep when I first started taking it, but was hospitalized for 5 days because I couldn't sleep. I had a tough time trying to get to sleep and when I finally did sleep I sweated greatly!  The sleep problems went away and my behavior was fine for about 5 1/2 months. Now the sleep problems are startng again.  It seems I have slight problems breating and the tingling /twithching in my toes and feet are more severe.  I get real thirsty and drink lots of water.  It as if the systems in my body are shutting down and adrenalin is being pumped into my blood to keep my systems going which in turn keeps me awake.  The drug seems to calm me down but only for a short period of time after taking it. They just uped me from 6 mg to 9mg two days ago.  We will see how it goes.

I felt somewhat more manic than balanced,but, at least I was more positive in my thoughts/emotions. Than, because our society tends to think in terms of &quot;more is better,&quot; my therapist increased from 3 mg to the next level of 6 mg and, subsequently, I crashed and burned almost as immediately into the negatives as I had during initially taking the meds. After about 2-3 weeks of decreasing mood, depressions that I had not felt in a long time, I got word to him about the change and he told me to go back to the 3 mg. I did, but the negatives remained so I did the drastic and stopped altogether. However, I have been off them just 2 days, again with no change, but just retook my dose this second after reading all the rad success stories on here. I know meds act differently for each person, but I also know I am obnoxiously impatient and it is soooo difficult to wait out the meds before feeling better.

Well it was, the swelling in my legs &amp; feet were the worst, my whole body suffered too even my face! I started this medication March 06,2008 and taken off of it March 24,2008. I ended up on Furosemide 20mg tab 1@2xpd. The pain in my spine and hips is unbearable, can't walk, this all brings me to tears. Diagnosed 12 yrs ago, trial and error so many times and NEVER had this happen. Back to the Doc 03/26/08...I guess I'll keep you &quot;posted&quot;. If this does anything, helping someone like the other one I read about her swelling, then I did something good today. Brenda D.

It is too good to be true!!  They are very expensive though.  Are there any people who know how to get samples or the pills at a discounted rate.

Manic-Depression	19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	12/26/2007 6:27:18 PM	Invega helped me tremendously.  I have been taking meds for almost four years, and up until I started taking Invega I felt tired, exhausted, no will to even do anything in the morning what-so-ever.  I'm bipolar first degree, yeaaa, I have been dealing with all of the crap that goes with it, and this pill helped alot.  It's not a miracle pill, most of the mind stuff you got to do yourself, but it does help.  Keep the faith.

Sleep is better. Getting along with spouse better. Almost makes me sleep TOO much. Should probably take med earlier. Want to sleep till noon.

I was more positive and upbeat.  However the draw backs are that the effects seem to taper off QUICKLY at the end of the night, which works out because it seems to make me very tired at night.  Also I have noticed that I am very thirsty and rather cold(temp sensitive now) almost all the time. So I need to carry around a bottle of water and wear long underwear, and wrap up in blankets/sit near space heaters more often.
Schizophrenia		4	5	5			12/11/2007 5:30:08 PM	My physician has just put me on this medication but in the week I have been taking it, I have found myself having a more postive attitude; since medications given for mental illness tend to take a few weeks to work, I am confident I will continue to improve my mood and attitude as I continue with this medication.

At 6mg/day he is much calmer, obviously feels more like &quot;himself&quot;. He is much more able to interact in school and out like the &quot;regular&quot; kids. You can tell he feels a lot better!
Manic-Depression	blueze, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	2	Female	35-44	10/24/2007 11:40:56 AM	Invega has been wonderful for my moods. However I am experiencing severe stomach pain, a little weight gain and swelling in my legs.  The weight gain in itself is expected and a small amount is tolerable, but this pain and the stomach distention is not.

I felt, if I may use the word, NORMAL!!! My children and my husband are also excited to see such a change. I just wish it was not so expensive.
