Acne	BB, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	4/14/2012 10:38:07 PM	Horrible pill! Acne worse, gained 10 lbs in 3months, emotional wreck, non stop bleeding, &amp; horrible cramping. Waste of my time &amp; money. Not to mention the doctor won't take my symptoms seriously!
Birth Control	crystala, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	25-34	3/8/2012 7:36:44 PM	I never got pregnant while using this pill, but I doubled up by using condoms 90% of the time.  The reason I stopped taking this pill was that it caused me yeast infections at least once a month.  I am 30 and had never experienced a yeast infection before.  I panicked and had an STD test, but thankfully it was just my body reacting negatively with the estrogen in this pill.  After 7 months I switched to Camila.  No more yeast infections and light/no period.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	4	3	Female	19-24	7/19/2010 6:24:35 PM	I started taking Cyclen four years ago when I was 18. The only side effect I had experienced was weight gain (15 pounds.) Recently, mood swings, lack of energy and lack of sex drive have developed. I am considering not taking any sort of birth control after researching and finding so many side effects with all.
Painful Periods	debbie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	9/16/2009 9:50:35 PM	I have been on this to help put my hormones back in check. I think for the most part it does not bother me. I do have stomach pains, but I cannot say for sure if it is from this drug. I am on many meds. However, I was shocked to see how big my breast are getting. It is almost a good thing, but they hurt a bit as a result.

Abnormally Long or Heavy Periods	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	1	2	1	Female	25-34	6/1/2009 7:55:09 PM	I was put on this pill to regulate my periods. I worked for a couple months. Now I am back to having irregular periods. If it was for me not wanting to get pregnant,I would be off of it. This pill is the worst.

Birth Control	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	19-24	7/1/2008 12:33:23 AM	I have pretty much had every side effect listed about this pill.  I have had abdominal pain, weight gain, my breasts did not only get bigger- THEY ARE HUGE!, I have nausea caused by galstones and painful periods. I am not a hypochondriac and did not even read the side effects until several  minutes ago.
