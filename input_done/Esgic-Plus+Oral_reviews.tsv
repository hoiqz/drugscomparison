Migraine Headache	 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/22/2010 12:46:29 AM	The brand esgic plus has been effective for me for a number of years.  The generic less effective, did not take the edge off of the headache.  Recently, the brand has not taken the edge off as well and has made me nauseated.  I am wondering if the manufacture has been offshored but cannot find a place on the manufacturer's (Forest Pharmaceuticals) website to inquire or give feedback.  It is really frustrating as this has been the only truly medication that has ever really been dependable in working.

I take one when I feel a headache coming on and it usually stops it form getting worse or takes it away altogether.
Migraine Headache	Katherine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	12/31/2009 10:33:45 AM	Twenty years ago I used to get &quot;weekend&quot; migraines. I was so stressed during the week that the headaches didn't hit me until I relaxed. I would wake up on Saturday with one and it wouldn't go away until Sunday. The cycle would start all over again. I was first prescribed Esgic+ after the headaches/migraines were daily for about 2 weeks. I was convinced the throbbing would never end and started to have panic attacks. After discussing it with my Dr. we determined my headaches moved in and out of severe tension headaches &amp; migraines. The pain was so bad I remember crying while waiting for the prescription to be filled. Twenty minutes after taking it my 2 week torture went away! I'm not kidding. I call Esgic+ my miracle pill. Although I don't need it as often now, as any headache sufferer can understand, I will always have it available. It works GREAT on tension headaches, good on mild or the onset of migraines, and okay on full blown migraines but it still works. It just takes longer. Over the years I have reduced the number of migraines I get by taking it early when I get a tension headache. I got/get most of my tension headaches while at work. I can take 1 pill and can still function. If it doesn't subside enough where I can still work and I need a 2nd pill I know its time to go home. Two or three times a year I'll wake up with a full blown migraine but I am fine if Esgic+ is in my medicine cabinet. I know I can deal with it.

Other	quazelcoatl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/8/2009 7:10:12 AM	I take this medication for Optical Migraines. I have no pain when I get these kinds of migraines; just vision abnormalities and a numbness on one side of my body. My neurologist prescribed this for me and with Butalbital affecting anxiety, it has really help me get this type of migraine under control. Bad thing is that the doc says I will get pain with these as I get older, but I'm not sure how well this drug will help with that pain.

Migraine Headache	kathy,  Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	3	Female		2/5/2009 6:23:26 PM	This medication has no effect as far as relieving any migraines.  However if I double the dose it puts me to sleep...and when I'm asleep I don't feel the pain.  So in that respect, it's useful. But I don't plan to continue taking it just for the side-effect of sleep.

If I take it as soon as headache starts it works well. Have never had problem with upset stomach. I even can go to my locker and get it and take it with no problem and keep on working. I get a little sleepy but I can keep on working. If I wait to long to take the pill sometimes I need a second one after a few hours. Than when I get home it is early to bed.

I take them when I feel the first sign of a migrane headache.  I feel relief, USUALLY, within the first 1/2 hour after taking the medication.  It does not alway stop the migrane entirely but it lessens the pain so that my life isn't totally interrupted by the headaches.  Occasionally, I will need to go the route of bed, darkness, quiet and sleep inorder to get relief.  I am thankful for this medication.

A little bit stronger than Alieve (I was taking two of these at a time)..If I took Esgis by twos it was better, one did nothing at all.
Tension Headache	35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	35-44	4/30/2008 9:06:07 PM	It helps when I get a tension headache, especially if I am able to rest and close my eyes for 30 minutes or so. It also helps my middle of the night back spasms. I can't take anything stronger because I am a very early riser for work and it doesn't leave me groggy when I get up.

I have to take the medicine on a full stomach or I get sick.  I also have to lay down in a silent and dark room for 30 minutes to 1 hour for full relief.
