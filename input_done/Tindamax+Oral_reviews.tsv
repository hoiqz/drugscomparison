Other	pash, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	9/17/2012 3:04:02 PM	THIS medication is very effective and works within a day of use. My appetite has increased a lot since taking the medication but I am overall satisfied

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Susan, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	2	Female	25-34	4/14/2012 5:08:31 AM	My doctor gave me this to clear up an infection. While it worked for the infectio, it also caused a severe metallic taste in my mouth accomponied by severe heartburn, nausea and flu-like symptoms. At this point it has been 4 days since my last dose and the effects are still severe. Not worth the discomfort to me.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	25-34 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	2/25/2012 2:19:25 PM	I'm one of those people that will be nervous to take a new medication and will worry about the potentially harmful side effects, and reading the reviews on Tindamax didn't help much! But I had an embarassing case of BV that was causing odor and I was desperate to get rid of it.  My doctor gave me the 2 day dose and I took all 4 pills at once right after dinner each day.  I had ZERO side effects, no metallic taste, no headaches, nausea, etc.  And by the next morning after taking the first dose my symptoms were almost gone. By the second day, completely gone!  I know everyone is different as far as how they react.  But I personally couldn't have had a more positive experience.  I would highly recommend it wouldn't hesitate to take it again.

Feeling much better and symptoms have decreased dramatically. Haven't noticed any side effects. Just a little inconvenient taking with food and so many times throughout the day.  Very much worth taking though.
Infection caused by Trichomoniasis Protozoa	Greatful, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	5	Female	25-34	8/24/2011 8:10:30 AM	I was prescribed four 500mg at one time for Trichomoniasis (Trich).  The worst thing about it for me was the awful metallic taste it left in my mouth.  I took them right after dinner and before bed, slept like a baby and feel great.  It seemed to clear up my problem and I actually woke up the next morning feeling well rested.  I rate this prescription VERY EFFECTIVE and I am Satisfied...Unlike some of these post I have read, but different strokes for different folks.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	8/10/2011 12:05:40 AM	After reading the negative experiences some reviewers reported, I was worried about taking the 2 day, 1,000mg course of treatment my doctor prescribed.  I am allergic to some meds and tend to get nauseous and feel poorly while in most meds.   I had absolutely no side effects from this med and it totally clear up my most uncomfortable infection.  So glad I took it!

I am REALLY unhappy w/ my dr... i told him 4x that i had yeast also..even opened my mouth to show him the thrush that was there and he still prescribed ...and really wants to know NOTHING about what happened ..............

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	uncomfortable, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	55-64	6/9/2011 6:15:15 AM	I had a pap come back irregular so had to go for a colposcopy for a biopsy. A few days later I received a call from my obgyn that I had a bacterial infection which has nothing to do with the pap, so they prescribed tindamax, 2 500mg in the morning a 2 500 mg at night for two days, I never took 2000 mg of anything in a day. I finished them last night. I feel so wiped out and exhausted not sure if it worked or not because I am still feel like I have cramps. Haven't got my results yet from the biopsy. This really stinks feeling this way with this hot weather!
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	4/5/2011 10:01:57 PM	Doctor prescribed Tindamax for BV. Read a lot of bad reviews prior to taking the drug but tried it anyway. I've been taking 1000mg a day (2 500mg pills at once). I haven't experienced any side effects except slight dry mouth / metallic taste but not unbearable and definitely worth it since I am already feeling better. Just thought I'd add according to studies on the drug, only 13% of patients had any side effects. Which means 77% will experience no side effects. Don't let these reviews scare you; I feel perfectly fine, even better than I did before taking the drug. Also, I took the pills right after eating a full meal, so that could have a lot to do with why I did not feel any symptoms. 
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Problem Solved, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	1/30/2011 6:16:19 PM	I was diagnosed with the BV by obgyn.  I was given this medication - 2 tabs of 500 once per day for 5 days.  Aside from a horrible taste in my mouth and coated tongue feeling that lasted for a few hours after taking the medication, I am quite pleased.  It started working within a day and a half, absolutely no side effects other than the one mentioned.  Would take it again if needed.

I still have bitter taste in my mouth, dizziness, fatigue, and now have symptoms of BV, Before Tindamax I was asymptomatic, but took it because my OB/GYN prescribed it.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	Herewegoagain, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	25-34	4/1/2010 4:38:15 PM	I was prescribed 500mg twice a day for 14 days. I have recurrent BV that has plagued me for years. This dosage did get rid of the BV but gave me a HORRIBLE yeast infection that no OTC medicine could get rid of completely. My doctor described it as a &quot;raging&quot; infection...just to give you an idea. And I do not get yeast infections. I am again on Tindamax, same dose, and this time my doctor gave me Diflucan oral to take every 3 days along with the Tindamax. I am on day 5 and so far, so good.Side effects I'm getting are dry mouth and a slightly lightheaded feeling. Also, I found an OTC product that helps balance female pH that seemed to help- it's called RePhresh. If I hadn't already had a yeast infection, I'd try using RePhresh with the Tindamax next time.

Though it seems to have cleared the infection I am afraid to take the rest of the medicine.

Had lots of vivid dreams, noticed numbness of tongue within 2 hours.  Then took send dose of 500 mg. at 9am.  I was not myself.  I experienced severe dizziness/feeling of spinning (vertigo), unsteadiness, nauseous, clammy, headach, and higher blood pressure than usual.  I took my sugar level, it was fine.  My blood pressue is usually between 69-72, it was 89.  I seem to have difficulty consentrating. I ate as direct and continued to eat throughout the morning hoping to relieve the side-effect.  I will not continue this medication.  I am a healthy 42 year old, 5'4&quot;, 150 lbs., with no history of allegies.  I do not recommend this medication.

I cannot describe the yeast infection it has caused.  Like a previous reviewer has said, it created a yeast infection like no other.  I doubt I will ever take this drug again. At least dosed like it was prescribed to me.  And I am not prone to yeast infections.  Just terrible.

Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	MissFox, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	10/3/2009 2:02:10 PM	I took it twice a day for 7 days. Seems to have cleared the BV up. Left a yeast infection like no other, but a hydrogen peroxide/water douche-out helped until I could take the medication prescribed for that. The metallic taste in the mouth is kinda annoying, but MUCH better and more effective, and BY FAR easier to swallow than the Flagyl I took often before that (as my case had been recurrent thus far).  For some reason, Tindamax made me hyper too.  I would recommend this to people who have had this condition.

I had BV and took 500mg 2x day for 7 days, never got sick and it went away completely. Your physicians are idiots!! Of course you were sick with such high dosages at one time!!

The medication left a terrible taste in my mouth for four days. No matter how many times I brushed my teeth or rinsed out my mouth, it would not go away. I found it really unpleasant. I'm hoping not to have to take it again for this reason, but it seems to have been effective so far.

There was a slight metalic taste for a few hours after taking it, but that improved with each dose.  I had no other issues with this medication.
Vaginosis caused by Bacteria	macaroni,  Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	1	1	Female		1/14/2008 10:47:11 PM	A one-time dose of 2,000 mg caused me to miss four days of my life--2 days of extreme chills, 3 days of fever up to 101, massive and constant headache, total body aches and pains, sporadic digital numbness, dry heaves, loss of appetite, joint and muscle pain.  I got tested for the flu, which I did not have. Not only did I have to pay for the initial appointment, but I had to go to FOUR other medical appointments in order to get relief from the SIDE EFFECTS.  I couldn't eat for four days, lost weight, became very weak and dizzy.  My husband had to miss work in order to care for me.      I was not feeling bad at all before the Tindamax. I have other issues with my health provider which I will deal with, but I will NEVER take Tindamax again and will do my best to tell other people about this journey into and out of Hell.
