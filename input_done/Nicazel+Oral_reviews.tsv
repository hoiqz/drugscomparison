My dermatologist told me that a severe cold can trigger the white blood cells to attack. After the cold is gone, they still do this.For me, it has been an adult lifetime of fighting acne that has been VERY frustrating. I'm an athlete, eat very well, with very good hygiene, but nothing I did helped. Then came Nicazel...acne is GONE. I played around with dosages and found that one a day is not enough. Two does the trick just fine. It's nice to be a normal adult with a clear complexion.

I finally asked my dermatologist if a pill would work? He prescribed me Nicazel, along with the use of topical treatments. After over a month I hadn't seen any results. By the time I started using the next bottle, my face and back had completely cleared up, and I am a senior in high school now, I have not suffered with acne in almost two years. I no longer take this supplement because it has worked wonders for me. I simply use a topical treatment now.

The antibiotics worked like a charm at first and one day they just didn't work as well. My dr has me on an antibiotic, nicazel, aczone and retina. Hopefully, something will work. Is anyone else still on a combination of stuff like me?? I will report back after a month and let you know if nicazel has worked.

Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	19-24	9/4/2011 11:50:40 PM	I was first prescribed Retin-A along with other harsh antibiotics but I wanted to try Nicazel because it seemed like a less severe alternative with fewer side effects. I've been only been on Nicazel for about a week and I have to say this combined with the Clinique Acne Treatment has been helping my skin. My skin is still not perfect but it's only been a week and I can already see improvements. If antibiotics aren't for you like they're not for me, give Nicazel a try. Good luck!

I've had no negative side effects.  My dermatologist says it &quot;brings everything to the surface,&quot; which I find to be completely true, and once it comes to the surface, it is super easy to pop.  The inflammation of each pimple is extremely less than before I was on Nicazel.  The only drawback for me is the cost.  Nicazel does offer a mail in rebate, but it's not instant gratification.

Still not 100% clear as I'd like to be, but I am SO thankful for this and that it is actually working! I am PRAYING that it continues to work and that it truely does not have any negative side effects in the future!!! I'll post another update in a month.

This medication did not harm me or give me any side effects, but it did not help at all.

I've been on it for 2 months now and my face has never been this clear. My skin is even-toned and looks great. I usually have cystic acne and have not had a breakout while on this script. I will problably use it the rest of my life!
Other	Satisfied Customer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	3/3/2011 8:10:46 PM	I have suffered from re-occuring staff infections for over a year now, and cannot treat them because I am allergic to antibiotics and have severe side effects. My doctor had given up until he found out about this drug.  Not only did I not have any negative reactions, it gave me energy and I felt better than I had in a long time.
