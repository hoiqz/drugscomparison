Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/21/2012 5:03:16 PM	I lost 32 lbs. in the 6 months I was on Meridia. The only side effect I had was dry mouth, and that encouraged me to drink more water. I am so upset that they pulled this off the US/CA markets. My dr. had me do an echo. of my heart before starting this medication as well as weekly blood pressure checks at first and then monthly.

Was happy with weight loss, no problems only to find out they are recalling it. Does anyone know another prescrption that can be taken in place of Meridia? I go to the dr in January, I just hope I don't gain the weight back !!

It has been extremely effective for me.  I lost 120 lbs between Nov 2008 &amp; Mar 2010 and have maintained my current weight of 175 lbs since.  My doctor is currently weaning me from the Meridia and I am now taking it only 3 times per week and not experiencing any weight gain or increased hunger on those days that I do not take it.  i have had no negative side effects.  In fact, it has improved my disposition, outlook on life, energy levels, and libido too!  I cannot say enough good things about it and the lifestyle change it has helped me make.  I am a 63 year old 5'11&quot; man who has now returned to his normal weight through a change in lifestyle and the help of Meridia.

I found myself not thinking about food all the time, but rather things I needed to do on a daily....what a releif that was.   I could focus on my job and not on food.  I have found though, some weight will creep back on.  A yearly maintenance works.  Buy the drub overseas........not nearly as expensive.  I was 56 when I started this for fear of diabetes II.  I had no blood pressure or heart problems when I started.  Can stay on this drug for up to 2 years.

It's quite amazing with very little side effects. I'm done at the end of this month. But it's like everything else, it's not a miracle drug, YOU have to want it and Meridia makes it a little easier. I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't have any medical issues.
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	7/26/2010 10:14:26 AM	I started taking Meridia in Janaury and by April I had lost 25 pounds.  I have had no side effects and it curbs my appetite wonderfully! I did not get my medication from my doctor however, I bought it in another country - which was MUCH cheaper and affordable.  I continue to take it and I love it!  I hope to lose another 15 pounds.  I feel and look great!

Have felt great and was able to keep it off by just going on lower dose 15mg to 10mg.  After the year, was taken off and already gained all the weight back within 3 months.  Wish I could stay on this, felt perfect while I was on it!

I am anxious to begin this new medication, in 5 1/2 hours when I pick it up from the pharmacy.  From reading the reviews, I am more hopeful that this will give me the boost I need to begin losing weight, also with diet modification and exercise.  Thank you for the honest reviews...I shall return to post my thoughts.

Overweight	Robin, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	6/30/2010 4:43:26 PM	Works well, but is expensive.  Phentermine is much more effective and cost a lot less (Meridia $130 Phenermine $30).  I took Meridia 10 mg for ten weeks and lost 18 lbs with little excersise.  I experienced no side effects and was very happy with exception to the cost ($130 a month).  My doctor prescribed Phenermine to try instead and so far (only been on a week - lost 4lbs) so good.

The first 2 days, I had a full feeling and was a little more energetic, but that wore off. I have tried to eat healthier and less of it, as well as walk a little more, I have not gone bonkers with the diet and exercise. I hope the 15mg will work much better, this is no magic pill you have to work with it - a lesson Im learning  and at $125 per month  thats not a cheap lesson

I have not experienced any of the noted side-effects, nothing unusual has happened to me other than actually losing weight.  I have been trying for 9 years to lose weight and although I was able to drop dramatic amounts with other methods, the weight has all come back, and brought friends with it.  With this med, the loss is gradual, but that is best as you are far less likely to gain the weight back if it comes off slowly.  I have recommended many friends and co-workers to talk to their Dr's about this product.  35lbs gone, only 45 lbs left to lose!

He has NEVER been like this. The medicine was suppressing his appetite, but it's not worth this. After consulting with his doctor, he stopped taking it. I wonder how long it will take to get this out of his system.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/22/2010 2:07:57 PM	I started my weight loss journey about 8 years ago and have lost over 380lbs. (no surgery!!!)I have used appetite suppresants to get me this far and all I have is about 40-50 lbs to go. My doctor prescribed me Meridia on 4/13 and I finally got the money together to pick it up on 4/18/10. Since starting Meridia on monday, I have already lost 8.2lbs!! I go to the gym everyday and I eat properly, 3 meals and 2 snacks. Meridia has helped me get back on track and I know in my heart that I will be at my goal in no time. I do not have any side effects at all.

It worked fantastically well for about 3 days, then the effectiveness wore off and was replaced by crabbiness and hunger. What a disappointment.

If you have military ins.(Tricare), your dr has to call &amp; request an override so that you'll get a discount... I'm sooo happy to see that this medicine does work with diet &amp; excersice... I hope it will work for me after trying for 2 years to lose 30lbs.. Exercise is no problem for me.. I do aerobics 3 days a week (Mon,Tues,&amp;Thru), go to the gym 3 days a week (Mon,Wed,&amp;Fri), &amp; I walk 2 miles a day... Now, I have to lose 35lbs to reach my goal...

Yes it can be taken that long.  It stopped working and my doc decided that I should use it only as needed (which actually does work).  I lost about 20 pounds doing this.  it controls my appetite so when I make bad choices in foods I don't eat as much of it. I also exercise too. Recently found out my thyroid was low, so the additional synthroid helped tons. Off the Meridia now and have noticed I want to eat more, but I try to control it.  It's a struggle but Meridia helped me finally get under 200 pounds. Never been this heavy until I turned 30 and weight just crept on. No matter how I tried couldn't get it off until some help from Meridia and my levels corrected.

Overweight	TG, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/25/2010 10:18:34 PM	I am 28 and I have been a diabetic for 16 years. I have struggled with my weight for years esecially after the birth of my son.  Along with the weight my blood sugar levels are extremely high b/c I tend to be an emotional eater. Sometimes I would just eat to be eating. I would eat breakfast and then grab for something else right after eating a meal. Anyway, my doctor thought Meridia would be good for me. He did tell me about all the side affects and I felt as though I should try it out and if I experienced problems then I would try something else. I was quite surprised that my insurance covered this pill as most insurances don't. I paid only $30 for a 3 month supply. The first day I took Meridia I noticed that my appetite was really gone. I wasn't even hungry and didn't want to eat which is also a problem for me b/c I have to eat and take insulin 3 times a day. Today I only ate 700 calories and was completely satified but I know I must eat more because my sugar levels can drop. The only side affect I have is that I feel like I have a lump in my throat and I constantly burp throughout the day...maby it has something to do with the full feeling you are suppose to get. It does drive me crazy but I hope it gets better in time. I hope to get under 200 pounds. I am currently 5'9 223 pounds....so I have a ways to go!

Overweight	Disappointed, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	35-44	3/23/2010 11:47:45 AM	I have been on Meridia since mid-December. I lost 3.5 pounds during the 5 weeks between my doctors visits over the holidays and then gained weight between my January and February visits (up 2 pounds).My doctor bumped up my dosage from 5 mg to 15 mg.  Visited the dietitian last week and was only down .5 pound from February visit. So since December I have lost 1.5 pounds on Meridia. I did better on my own. I had lost 15 pounds in appx 3 months by following the same 1200 calorie diet I use with Meridia and exercising less than I currently am.

The only side effect that I have had is jittery sleep (i.e. I wake up a few times throughout the night and am very alert but can go right back to sleep - its odd! I am usually a VERY heavy sleeper) but this is no deal-breaker...Meridia has already been extremely effective - I have lost 6 pounds in a week and a half. I am about 40 lbs overweight so I still have a ways to go but it is such a relief that this is getting the ball rolling - the weight loss finally feels surmountable. Other reviewers are certainly correct - you do have to put in effort on this medication - it isn't a magic pill. I have stuck religously to a 1200 calorie diet and have done @ 30 mins of cardio exercise at the gym for about 5 of the 10 days I have been on this. I cannot say that it has taken hunger away from me at times I could eat more than 1 of my 100 calorie packs! But it takes away that bottomless pit feeling. And it has taken away my craving for my temptation foods...brownies, cupcakes, etc. And I would so much rather be craving just one more 100-calorie pack than a 6 pack of cupcakes! Even though I have only been on this medication for a short time, I can say that I am extremely impressed with its effect and the lack of side effects (for me). Amazing.

The weight loss was almost immediate after the first week.  It did give my drymouth which has helped in my water consumption which I think is key to getting this drug to work effectively.  I have lost 53 pounds to date and counting with little or no exercise.  I have made adjustments in eating habits.  I try to restrict calories to 1200-1400 a day.  I litterally have to be reminded by my husband to eat on a regular basis.  I have another 20-25 pounds to lose to reach my goal and I think I will be successful as long as I stay on track.  I have been able to get insurance to cover the cost of the drug therefore it has all been worthwhile.  I have to go through a few hoops with prior authorizations with insurance but worth every bit of it.  I have had no other side effects during the usage of the drug.  I have also cut out sodas and have limited myself to one Dr. Pepper a week for a &quot;treat&quot;.  If I absolutely feel the need for carbonation/caffeine then I will drink a Diet Cherry Pepsi to get my fix.  I drink 44 oz of ice water each morning and 44 oz of iced tea sweetened with Sweet&amp;Low each afternoon.  For breakfast I limit myself to yogart, fruit or a small bowl of cereal with 2% milk.  I usually have a $1 side salad from McDonalds for lunch through the week.  For dinner I typically cook for my family but with the taste testing throughout cooking, I usually find myself full and unable to sit down to actually eat dinner at the table.  You have to be disciplined but if you stay consistent and committed to the weight loss you should find the weight begining to fall of 2-3 pounds a week.  I couldn't be happier!!!

I have managed to loose 45 lbs on my own with diet and exercise.  I just needed a boost to help with the next 60 lbs.  Only side effects are the dry mouth which increases my h2o intake.  (ok w/ me).  Trying to figure out what time to take it in the am to help with the after 6pm snacking.  Maybe taking it later in the morning would allow the med to last longer in the evening.  I am still trying to eat 5 small meals. So far i have just been able to eat 3.  Med's are very expensive but much better than surgery.

Overweight	mmurshedi, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/30/2010 1:10:43 AM	I started on Meridia in Oct (it's now end of Jan) I have lost at least 25 lbs.  The only side effect I experienced was dry mouth, which was OK since I needed to drink more water.  I also started walking and then added a gym workout.  I started running/jogging the first of Jan.  I have gone from a size 14 to a 6.  I am totally delighted with the results and will run/walk in my first 5K in Feb (I'll be 60 in Jul). It helps you stay on a healthy eating plan but you do need to exercise. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is serious about losing weight.

This is not a magic pill you need to want to make it work.  Its important to eat a healthy diet and exercise.  I found a food journal to be very helpful.I also found that the side effects, dry mouth, racing heart, jittery feeling improved after the first few weeks and in month two was non existant.

In three weeks I&#180;ve lost so far 18 lbs! Amazing, finally a diet works for me after 20+ years trying... No side effects, heart rate at 50bpm in steady state and blood pressure at 115/75. Meridia allows me to eat 1,000 to 1,500 calories a day and still feel great and full of energy. Never feel hungry, not even after a 60 minute run. Highly recommended, but please talk to your doctor first!

Overweight	thirtysomethingmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	35-44	1/19/2010 10:23:19 AM	I started taking 10mg Meridia in December.  As of yesterday I had only lost 3.5 pounds (in five weeks) when I had my checkup with my doctor. Of course this was through the holidays and when my doctor had renewed my prescription, he wrote it for only 5mg instead of the 10mg. I can feel a huge difference between the 5mg and the 10mg. With the 5mg, I am hungrier and have the bottomless pit feeling more often. I also seem to have more cravings. The 10 mg seemed to keep me feeling full longer and I filled up more quickly. I have been using the 5 mg for about a week now. I exercise 3 times a week for 45 minutes to 1 hour and try to follow a low-calorie diet. I had lost about 15 pounds on my on in about 3 months, so I don't feel like this is really helping me but I will try it at least until my current 90 day refill runs out since my doctor wants me to stay on it. I haven't had any side effects and my blood pressure was fine at my checkup.

Overweight	smileygirll, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	1/5/2010 4:50:39 AM	I started taking this medicine in mid-December.  My insurance doesn't pay for it, and with a $25 coupon, I wound up spending $142 on a 30-day supply.  I found that Sam's Club was the cheapest price.  I started out on the 15mg pill and instantly noticed changes.  I was full before I finished my meal, I didn't have the hunger pains like I normally do, and I felt no urge to snack.  I could tell a difference in the way my clothes fit and other things.  I went in one-month later for a checkup and lost 12 pounds without diet and exercise.  I was so excited!  I got my doctor to write me another prescription, however I didn't realize that he only wrote it for the 10mg pill this time, until my husband picked up the pills at the pharmacy and the price was considerably less.  I thought I would give them a try, what is 5mg really going to do anyway?  I can really tell a difference and not in a good way.  I defintely don't feel like I have lost any weight and actually feel like I have gained weight.  I'm hungry all the time and can't quit the cravings or snacking.  I am going back to my doctor today to talk to him about this and hopefully get him to write me a new prescription for the 15mg pill.  The only bad side effects that I have experienced on this medicine is some eye pain and constipation.  Just wondering if anyone has every bought this medicine on the internet instead of going to a pharmacy, and if so, where did you get it?  I know the price is alot less buying it online.

Overweight	big mama, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	25-34	12/20/2009 3:29:06 AM	I started taking Meridia 10mg 3 months ago and only lost 3 pounds the 1st month.  When I went in for my check up, my Dr. increased my dose to 15mg.  At that time I was also prescribed a steroid for my asthma due to a flare up.  So as you can imagine, at my 2nd check up, I hadn't lost any weight even after the increase.  My Dr. strongly felt it was due to the steroid so she left the dosage the same.  During my 3rd month on the pill (2nd month on 15mg) I lost 7 pounds.  I was happy with the results but very surprized.  I feel the medication does help but also still have cravings and even sometimes the feeling of the &quot;bottomless pit&quot;.  I don't feel that it curves my appetite the way it should.  There are many factors in my life that may contribute to this such as having an off schedule due to working 3rd shift.   I have not experienced any side effects from the medication except I felt a little jittery the first few days, then it went away after that.  I also feel a little dehydrated so I always carry a water with me.  I'm planning on staying on the pill as long as possible and doing my best to let it do its job.  Hopefully I will start to see some better results.

Please visit us again at http://www.abbott.com.Sincerely,Abbott Patient Access ProgramI have been using Meridia 10mg for less than one week and notice that I am not as hungry all the time, but it doesn't stop the cravings. Haven't weighed myself to see how I'm doing since it hasn't been a week yet. Just wanted to share the coupon info for anyone that has to pay out of pocket for the medicine as I do.I also found out something interesting from my prescription coverage that the rep didn't bother to tell me when both myself and my doctor called to check coverage. Apparently the med is not covered under my plan at a retail pharmacy, but is &quot;discounted&quot; when mail ordered through the providers mail order pharmacy. So I am having my doc rewrite my script for a 90 day refill and fax it to them to take advantage of the discount. The discount is huge compared to retail. I only found this info when checking the plan providers website for myself. Anyone having difficulty getting their Meridia covered should probably do the same to see if they can get a discount or coverage through the providers mailorder pharmacy.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/15/2009 9:54:48 AM	I started Meridia, 10mg, mid-November and have lost 7 lbs. (w/o exercise) since then.  Unfortunately I had to stop taking it b/c it was making me anxious and dizzy, especially when I drive to/from work.  Aside from that the only side effects I experienced was dry mouth, which is a good side effect I feel, since it makes you drink more water.  I go to see an endocronologist in two days and hope he will be able to help me with my weightloss endevours.  Good luck to all of you out there on this medication...it really does help curb your cravings - It started working for me within a day or two...I had to remember to eat b/c Meridia took away the hunger pains and cravings!

I have anxiety and take xanax to help with it when needed. Due to anxiety, i get high blood pressure, my Dr said I should be fine just look for signs of swelling, heart pain, etc. I worry that it may cause more damage than good. I weigh 180 and am 5'4. I gained 40 lbs in one year. I really need this but any advice out there in my situation? I feel my heart racing, insomnia, mood swings too.
Overweight	Thirtysomethingmom, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	3	Female	35-44	12/13/2009 11:50:59 PM	I just started taking Meridia 10 mg today. This is after being on a 1200 calorie diet and exercising 3 times per week for over 3 months and having lost 15 pounds on my own. I have gained alot of weight in the last year or so and am hoping to lose 100+ pounds total. I was very disappointed that my doctor was unsuccessful in getting my insurance to cover this med. He said with my other health concerns it was the only safe med for me to try. I paid the $147 for a one month supply and thought I would give it a try. Didn't feel anything today, but hope to experience the not hungry and full feeling others are talking about. Would also like to know where others have found the $25 and $30 coupons they posted about since I am paying the entire cost myself. Will post later about my results using Meridia.

I found a coupon online and got $30 off.  I also went to the manufacturer of Meridia (Abbott Labs) and received another $25 coupon.  Anyway, today is day 4 and I, honestly, don't see any changes.  I feel that I'm still eating as I was.  I don't feel the &quot;not hungry&quot;, like some of you mentioned.  I still crave different foods, especially sweets. Maybe, it has to be in my system for a little while b4 I start feeling the &quot;not hungry&quot; feeling?? I am, however, urinating alot more.....probably because I'm drinking alot more water because of the dry mouth.  Anyway, if anyone has any info on why I am still eating as I did before, please let me know. Thanks!

The cost is $144.  I have Medicare and Medicaid w/an HMO (Horizon BC/BS).  Can someone tell me how to get them to okay this prescription, as I am ready to start taking Meridia.  I have been asking my doctor for some time and she finally gave me the prescription today (after blood work and other tests).  If there is someone who knows how I can get the insurance company to pay for it (at least) some of it, please let me know. Thanks!

I begin to feel as though im gonna burst wide open, and if i keep trying to eat i feel short of breath so i stop. This could be a good thing cause i dont like being short of breath and have found that im really eating a lot less than i was actually about 1/3 of what a normal dinner was for me. EX usually I eat 2 or 3 times at a buffet style but went with my son on sunday and didnt make it thru the 1st round and i was almost sick.

I have lost 12 lbs and want to lose 18 more.  The only side effect I have is dry mouth but that's OK since I need to drink more water.  My ins would not cover it so I shopped around.  One pharmacy wanted almost $150 but I get it at Costco for about $112. It's expensive, but something like Jenny Craig would cost more.  The weight came off quickly the first week, but has slowed down to about 2 lbs a week.  It helps me curb cravings.  You have to exercise and watch your portions. Meridia helps you to stay on a healthy eating program. I would recommend it.
Overweight	 Female  (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/25/2009 3:59:35 PM	In response to the person asking how the ins co. covered the drug.I am also on this and my ins.co. covered.My dr submitted a preauthorization as they cover tx for morbid obesity if documented in your records, after review I rec'd a ltr that they would allow it, reducing my cost to $40 a month. I also work for the ins co.and know my policy very well but my ins is with BCBS,I do not work for that company however. My plan booklet specifically stated that they cover treatment for this condition after a medical review determines I qualify.  Read your policy language and call your cust. service rep if you are unsure still. I've lost 25 lbs. so far in 3 months.

Lost 15ilbs so far. This is with a good diet along with exercise. It's an great drug. I get the drug free due to the fact that my spouse works for Abbott, and any prescription/drug they manufacture is free through our insurance company. I was reading the other comments, some insurance companies do  require pre-auth because this drug can has a time limit of 6-12 months. This is an excellent drug and i am grateful.

Seemed as though I actually wasn't hungry at all for the first few weeks, had to remind myself to eat, but that effect has slowly worn off, and I do find myself hungry more.  My motivation to continue: spending $150 a month!  Why would I sabatage myself when I'm paying that kind of money?!?  I plan to start excercizing as the pounds are slowing down, about 1/week now, compared to 3-6/week in the earlier months.

THe first two weeks I never felt hungry and had to make myself eat.  However, I started itching really bad and got a rash on chest, stomach and back.  Doctor doesn't know if it is this or not. Taking me off to see.  Has anyone else experienced rash and itching with this med?
Overweight	aj, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	9/2/2009 12:31:27 PM	I'm not usually a fan of reviews after short-term use of a medication (i.e., a week or so) because it doesn't really give a full and accurate picture, but I wanted to write one to encourage Meridia patients to give this med at LEAST a week to &quot;kick in&quot; before making any rash decisions to quit.  I almost gave up after only 3 days due to severe insomnia, dizziness and rapid heartbeat but all have since subsided and I feel terrific.  As my doctor explained, this isn't an &quot;overnight&quot; medication and will take some time to build up in your system to become effective, as it is essentially an anti-depressant.  I've been on 10mg/day for almost 2 weeks and have already lost 6 lbs (starting out at 217).  I no longer obsess about food all day long, the intense carb/sugar cravings have stopped and I now feel compelled to make healthier food choices.  It also takes a far less amount to make me feel full during mealtimes and it is such an empowering feeling to be able to push away a half-eaten plate of food.  The mindless snacking has halted as well, which was really my downfall.  And possibly best of all, my mood is bright and upbeat again!  Bottom line:  give it some time to work and don't expect any overnight miracles.  Good luck to all!

My eating habits had changed, however not nearly enough to gain such an astonishing weight.  My metabolism had just shut down.  Now I have been on Meridia for about 5 weeks.  At my 4 week check up, I had lost 7.5 lbs. The drug works wonderfully to take away any cravings. I think I will lose it more quickly as soon as my ankle injury heals completely and I can exercise.  I notice that my mood is better as well.  May be the drug, or just maybe seeing a light at the end of the tunnel..

At the end of 7 weeks I stopped taking it, however since then I have been having almost daily seizures, which I had never before had in my life.  I am 40 years old and have had very few health problems ever.  I am working with a neurologist to determine the sudden cause of the seizures and I don't see this problem listed under the medications side effects, except repeated references to 'dizziness'.

I have 50-60 lbs to lose and have been on 10mg for two weeks and have lost about 10 lbs.  I have been eating all my favorites but smaller portions and not feeling at all deprived.  I have increased my fiber intake to combat the mild constipation.  Dry mouth isn't an issue, but dry lips are and I apply lip balm often.  The only time I felt dizzy was sitting in the sun.  When I grocery shop, nothing excites me so I'm buying less food and making healthier choices. I also seem a little happier but that could be the effects of exercising.  It was the little help I needed and once I lose the weight and go off Meridia, I hope to continue to be motivated. Good luck to all of you.
Overweight	jwil, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	7/15/2009 6:57:55 PM	Ok...I know my stars for this product are all over the place, but there is a reason.  I feel a difference with my appetite, so I know the product is doing what it is supposed to. I on the other hand have not been.  Yes, I have changed my diet and I saw a total so far of 6lbs off the scale.  But I cheat alot! And I haven't been exercising like I should.  The scale has been hovering inbetween my highest weight ever and the 6lbs less.  I have been trying to tell myself that is was because I was about to menstrate, but that came and went and the scale stayed the same.  So the scoop is the drug is effective and does help, but it is not a miracle worker.  It won't do the work for you.  Next tid bit of info.  I am poor like most of the country. This drug was going to cost me $150 a month.  My insurance was not going to cover. The pharmacy called my Dr., the Dr. called my insurance to explain it was for health reasons and not vanity and the insurance decided to cover 75% for 12 months.  That means I pay $37.50 for an entire year. Hopefully, I will get my act together and get off my butt and do the work and reach my goal before then.

You have to change your eating habits and exercise. Its not a miracle pill. ive stopped taking it cause of the price but it gave me enough boost to keep the same diet and exercise routine.
Overweight	marilynm45, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	2	5	2	Female	45-54	7/10/2009 4:26:01 PM	Maybe I am not giving it a chance yet this has only been the 3rd day but I am still hungry even though my doctor said I would feel full and not want to eat. I still want to eat. Does anyone know does it take a while on the medication before it starts making you not hungry?
Overweight	Dena G., 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/9/2009 7:01:59 AM	Well I told you guys I would check back and I am.  I have lost 7.5 pounds over the past few weeks.  I havent really been exercising like I should and I kind of cheated on the 4th of July.  I am now back in business.  I had to laugh because a pair of jeans that I had to suck my stomach in to zip up and fasten was no longer a problem.  That mad me really happy.  I was a little upset that its only been 7 lbs but I guess you have to start somewhere. I cant wait to go back to my doctor so he can see the results.  Hopefully I can avoid the scale and weigh in every 2 weeks or so instead of weekly.  Hope this works for the next person!!
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	7/4/2009 2:50:40 AM	I began taking this medication on 3/4/09 and to this date I have lost 43 lbs.  The Meridia helps control my cravings and I am more motivated to eat healthier. In the beginning I had dry mouth for the first few weeks, but I just drank plenty of water.  I modified my diet and began an excercise regiment and I have had great results!  I'm rarely hungry, but I eat healthy snacks throughout the day to keep my metabolism boosted.  I found you have to excercise for the best results, so I try to incorporate rigourous excercise 4 to 5 days a week.  The cardio workouts really help shed the pounds and water aerobics is a good low impact activity that doesn't put stress on your joints.  I always figured no one hated excercise and vegetables more than I did, but here I am thanks to Meridia doing it all.

Overweight	Dartdiva, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	7/2/2009 9:16:41 AM	Started 3/11/09 and to date have lost 24 lbs... I do Wii fit and the combo works great together. I believe that I could have lost more if I had been making excersize a priority :-(( Found for me that if I take it a little later in the morning, it gets me through those nightime snacking attacks better!!! I have changed my eating habits and am sure that once I'm off this food will not be an issue. Think I eat more now than before, just better stuff :-))) Exercise is the key though....
Overweight	tjfred@aol.com, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	6/30/2009 10:22:03 PM	Responding to someone who wondered what would happen if they went off the drug.  I used it to lose weight for my daughter's wedding but when I stopped taking it I kept exercising and eating right, and I at least maintained the weight loss of 21 pounds.  I basically used it to jumpstart me at a point where I had plateaued. The wedding was 7 months ago and I have long since lost the commitment to my weight loss regime, and I did gain all but ten pounds back.  Although I am exercising and dieting again I seem to be &quot;stuck&quot;, so my doctor gave me a new prescription and I am hoping I will have good results again.  To diet and exercise faithfully with zero results is discouraging. And, as my doctor explained, this drug was originally developed to treat depression, and the side effect was weight loss, so they started to market it for weight loss purposes instead.  And so, an added benefit may be less depression, but who knows if that is a result of the drug or a result of looking in the mirror or having your clothes fit without cutting off your circulation.  Whatever, it's a win win!  Side effects were few.  Constipation.  But, as my gastroenterologist said, you can take Citrucel daily without becoming dependent on it, and it is actually good for you.  
Overweight	Dena, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	6/25/2009 12:56:30 PM	Well its day two and so far I have only had the dry mouth issue. Yesterday I ate half of a salad at breakfast and nothing again until dinner time.  I wasn't hungry at all. I hope this works for me and everyone else who is trying Meridia.  I will update you guys in a week to let you know if my first week was as great as the majority of the reviews I have read.  
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	6/17/2009 8:45:17 PM	this medication was prescribed to me in conjuction with a ketonic diet which is a very high protein diet (3 protein shakes a day) and no carbs/sugars.  in 4 months i lost 45 lbs but the important part is not only changing your eating habits...you HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO exercise regularly and you have to stick with it otherwise you will feel sluggish.  i exercise 5 days a week and am actually training for a marathon now.  Meridia curved the appetite but I did get cravings at night when the meds started to wear off, if that happens to you try a handful of peanuts or a light mozzarella string cheese.  it works for me.  This pill alont with changing my diet (only for now, i will eventually get off the high protein diet) and exercising regurlarly did help me lose weight and I have been trying to lose weight for over 6 years and have tried every over the counter medication you can think of as well as some other prescribed meds.  hope this works for everyone else
Overweight	FLkitcat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	35-44	6/17/2009 9:28:00 AM	I have been on this medication 7 weeks I have lost 14 lbs. I have been a little constipated sometimes. I have been taking Colace off and on to help with that. I am going to bump up my fiber more too. My Dr is real happy with the 2 lbs a weeks loss. She said it needs to be slow and steady for best results. 
Overweight	Cindy, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	6/16/2009 9:31:09 AM	Well yesterday was my 15th day of taking the medicine.  I have not lost any weight, in fact I may have gained a lb. or two.  I have drastically changed my eating habits, and yet nothing.  I have noticed no side effects other than being short tempered.  It really started making me depressed (and even more short tempered) on the 14th day, and by the 15th it was TERRIBLE.  I mean this could make you ruin your marriage it is so bad.  I have decided to quit taking it, and try to do better on my own.  Everyone is different, and it effects people differently.  This however is just not the drug for me.
Overweight	Zeek G., 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	35-44	6/9/2009 9:12:45 AM	Well after reading all the reviews listed, I thought for sure this would be the pill for me.  I have been taking it for a week, and have not lost (1)lb.  It is so disappointing.  I have changed the way I eat and everything.  Hopefully it will soon just start falling off, I am going to give it a month.  The great thing about it is I haven't had any side effects.  Thanks Goodness.

So far I am very satisfied with this medication and cannot wait to continue! I am getting married in July of this year and want to be 190lbs for it if possible!

I am very satisfied with these results. I do not think about food the way i used to and I do not eat the amount of food that I used to. My concern is what happens after i stop taking the drug? Will I return to the way i was and gain all the weight back due to the drug being out of my system and brain? If anyone knows the answer to this please respond.

I've only been taking it for 5 days, I have already lost 4.5 lbs.  This medicine will make you either feel like you are starving, or feel like you ate way too much.  But it makes you realize portion control, and cuts out the appetite for daytime snacks.  I think this may be the one for me, we will see over the course of the next few months!

Overweight	NH Nurse, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	5/1/2009 9:36:57 PM	I put on some weight after having 3 babies.  I lost most of it, but hit a plateau.  After hiring a personal trainer and stepping up my workouts, I couldn't get past that hump.  After a month on 10 mg of Merida, I lost 6 pounds.  It may not seem like much, but I really only had aboutg 15 pounds to go.  My doctor gave me 15 mg for month 2 and I just filled that Rx.  I haven't experienced any negative side effects.  I'm just not interested in food.  I've actually forgotten to eat which is pretty amazing for someone who is both Jewish and Italian! I'm pleased with everything except the price.  Now...  If men had babies, our forefathers would have written both Merida and tummy tucks for all into the Constitution (of course, had either been available back then!).

Overweight	MDK, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	3	2	3	Male	55-64	4/27/2009 12:12:38 PM	I have been on this medication since march 5th. First couple of weeks dropped 6 lbs, then by the end of the month it was a total of 9 lbs. So I went from 278 to 269. From there on it was a pound gained then a pound lost. Still used the treadmill for an hour a day(5 days a week) and watched my eating portions. Then the problems came, first it was my blood pressure increasing from 130/83 to 170/110. My Doctor then put me on Felodipine to bring down my blood pressure. It did come down, but very slowly. In two weeks, 160/98. Felodopine also caused bloating in my ankles and hands, water retention. How can I loose weight when I'm holding water? Next for Meridia/Felodipine  was urinating problems, very slow going.  Waking up in the morning knowing I have to go and can barely go at all. Headaches off and on and then Insomnia. Then last on the list is ED. That about did it for me. After talking to my Doctor about wanting to get off both Meds, he agreed. I no longer take either of these meds and now take Atenolol for blood pressure. For you people that are happy with Meridia,.. Great !!! I wish you luck ! I myself will have to try other methods to loose the weight.
Overweight	angie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	1	4	2	Female	35-44	4/17/2009 3:59:39 PM	I stated taking Meridia 10mg on 4/10/09 not sure what would be the right amount to lose per week but, have lost 2lbs since, it is now 4/17/09. I don't feel any different no side effects and still feel hungry in the evening but, then again I don't have a problem with my eating habbits I eat 3 meals a day don't care for junk food such as chips, sodas or candies and I work out at the gym 7 days a week for 2 hours. My problem is, I was recently treated for hyperthyroidism on 12/2007 since them I have become hypo and I have put on some weight more like 35lbs, I don't come from a family of obesity and I have a sister and 2 brothers that work out as well but, can't seem to lose any weight. I don't know what else to do!!! I love working out but I feel helpless. Hope the medication will help me go back to my weight 130lbs I am now weighing 177lbs.

Overweight	mcadm, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	2	Female	35-44	4/9/2009 12:34:05 AM	Normally I am a very positive person (I try to avoid the &quot;jolly&quot; phrase since this medicine is for weight loss). This medicine made me very moody and emotional.  Never cried at work because of stress and took this for 3 weeks and cried twice.  Lost 5lbs, wonder if it was due to excessive water loss (tears!). I also was snappy with everyone, let's just say I became my alter ego- a real &quot;witch&quot;. I Did lose 5 lbs, but needed to come off the medicine before I lost my job.... Doctor had me on 15mg for a &quot;kick start&quot; offerred to put me down to a lower dose but I declined.  Will try something else.  Too bad because most of the reviews are very favorable.  Carry water and gum.. dry mouth is inevidable.  Good luck all!

I have gone from 226 to 199.  I am so geeked to finally know that I weigh &quot;one something&quot;. I watch my portion sizes and generally eat 4 servings of veggies, 3 servings of fruit, 3 starches, 2.5 servings of protein, 1 serving of dairy &amp; 6 to 8 glasses of water a day.  I also try to do 30 minutes on the treadmill every other day and occaisionally I use the Ab Lounger.  So as you can see doing all of these things in conjunction with Meridia has lead to my success.  I hope has given you some insite.  Just 69 lbs to go, wish me continued success!

Overweight	goldie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	3/26/2009 10:26:08 AM	I started this medicatin the end of November, 2008, and did fantastic the first 2 months.  Then it slowed down.  It took care of my carb cravings and I stopped fixating on food, but now the weight just doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  I've been stuck at the same weight for 2 months.  I go up and down 2 pounds, but never past that.  So far I've lost a total of 35 pounds, and need to lose another 40.  Going to try more water and stepping up my exercise.  Am doing daily walks of a mile a day, but maybe I need to do more.  Will try that. My doctor put me on this for 6 months so my time is almost up on the drug.  Hopefully I can start losing again before I go off and keep it going.  
Overweight	Dartdiva, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	3/18/2009 11:29:16 AM	I am on day 7 of Meridia and am thrilled!! Down 5 lbs, lots of energy, and it was just the boost I needed! Hysterectomy last October slowed metabolism to 0..unable to take choleterol lowering meds, necessitating weight loss.  I have not had any of the nast side effects I've read on here, and am monitoring blood pressure. Downside ~ on 10mg but will prob. switch to 15mg at 1 mo check-up as it seems to wear off around 6:30 at night and I have to work at controlling the cravings.  One must NOT use this as a quick loss or you will not be happy. I am using the meridia to hopefully lose 40 pounds, but in the meantime am working on adjusting lifestyle and diet so as to keep the weight off when done w/Meridia.  My insurance will not cover this, but it is definately worth the $135 a month to me.  A long lasting life has no price tag!!! Good luck to all!
Overweight	toby1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	3	Female	25-34	3/5/2009 7:57:00 PM	like the majority of folks on here, i experienced great success taking this drug.  i wasn't obese, but about 20 lbs above goal that wouldn't come off with diet/frequent exercise after the birth of my child.  it was like a miracle drug for me, simply because those impulsive food cravings that would pop up every few hours for me went away.  i was able to focus on other things without that annoying inner voice to raid the kitchen pantry.  however, after being off of it two different times, and doing my best to keep up with the smaller portion sizes and continued workouts, my hunger slowly returned to its original state.  within a 30 to 60 days of stopping this medication (which you can't take forever...although i wish you could), i always put about 5 - 8 lbs.  back on, no matter how hard I try.  The yo-yo effect cannot be good for the body.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	3/5/2009 1:22:02 PM	I took this medication for 3 months and did not lose one single pound.  It was very frusterating.  I did not have any side affects.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	3/2/2009 3:50:44 PM	I began taking Meridia August 19, 2008 and have lost 45 pounds. I walk daily, and have recently added sit-ups to my regime. Many user reviews that I have read stated that they just don't get hungry and forget to eat. I can't say that I have the same experience. I do get hungry, but it's at normal meal times, and it does not take nearly as much food to fill me up. Meridia has taken away the urge to snack between meals, and for the most part, my sweet tooth. I do notice that before my menstrual cycle I do have cravings. Moderation is definitely the key. The only side effects I have noticed are dry mouth and some constipation which I can easily overlook considering how well I am progressing in this journey. My only words of advice are to not deprive yourself. If you really want something, eat it and enjoy it, just do so in moderation. Try not to treat this a diet, but as a lifestyle change you can stick with for the rest of your life. I want to lose about 30 more pounds, and I have every confidence that with Meridia, I will achieve my goal.

Overweight	rmo3, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	35-44	2/16/2009 11:05:27 PM	I started taking Meridia on 12/1/08. To date I have lost 17 pounds. I did notice the dry mouth but it has now subsided. The constipation I combat by adding some granola to my yogurt,and drinking more water- it's not my fave but it works. I also have gone a week or two where I lose nothing, then gain and the next week lose more than I had to begin with. You do have to drink a lot of water, but I can't always do that when at work. After 5 weeks the insomnia set in so I started taking it earlier in the day. My Doctor did up me from the 10mg dose to the 15 mg dose 2 weeks ago, but I had a severe migraine that started with my new dose and didn't stop until I dropped back to the 10mg. I haven't found that it wasn't as effective after prolonged use. Overaall I am satisfied with results. The side effects sound worse than they are. I'm a carbohydrate/sugar addict and it curbs those cravings like you can't imagine!

I also keep a food diary. I did have some constipation during the 1st couple of weeks but that has subsided.  The cost is pricey but worth it if it can hhelp jump start your efforts.  The meridia does curb my craving for the most part, however I did notice prior to my cycle this past month an increase in the cravings again. I guess even a drug can't stop mother nature (lol).  I will continue to use meridia and keep you posted on my progress as I want lose an additional 60 to 65 lbs.  Pray for me and wish me luck.
Overweight	buttafly, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	4	3	Female	25-34	1/31/2009 2:18:50 PM	Taken it for about a month and truthfully for the cost I am very disapointed.  Phentermine had curbed my appetite a lot better only it doesn't work for more than 3-4 weeks usually. Meridia was said to be effective for more long term use.  Well it doesn't seem to work for me.  I work out very hard 5 times a week and follow a diet-(not always strictly though i admit) and i cant seem to lose these last 10 lbs. I was hoping meridia would give me the added ammunition to do so but my appetite has not at all been suppressed.  Plus I've bled in between periods.  Good luck to you if you try it!

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	25-34	1/28/2009 4:22:03 PM	I started this medication on 12-8-08 and have lost 18 pounds as of today (1-28-09).  At first, the pounds just dropped, but after about 3 weeks it slowed down.  At that point I began exercising and it has been a slow decline, but a nice one!  The energy I have is amazing.  The only negative I can speak of is the dry mouth.  I feel like I can't get enough water in me.  Also, slight mood swings.  My doctor said that since this medication was originally an antidepressant that patients who don't need antidepressants will notice mood swings.

Overweight	sweetharp27, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	25-34	1/15/2009 8:26:45 PM	I started on 10mg of Meridia around Dec 13-08 and I was 217. In the beginning I had a lil difficulty sleeping, but I got over it quickly and noticed a decreased feeling in hunger and I did not eat late, or eat alot. As time progressed, my appetite got back to normal.My appetite was not ravenous, just what I normally eat. When I went back to the doctor this week (Jan 12) I didn't lose anything, in fact I gained 5 pounds. So, my doctor took me off, because you had to at least lose 4 pounds in a month to continue...I am now trying Xenical (Orlistat). Wish me luck! If you think Meridia is expensive at $120 a bottle...try 287.99 for a 30 day supply of Xenical! ugh!

Overweight	Jersey Girl 13, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	5	Female	45-54	12/30/2008 3:22:12 PM	I just started taking 10 mg a week before Christmas, and I noticed I lost 8 lbs the first week, and I did not gain any weight over the Christmas holiday.  I noted that since being on the drug it has totally eliminated my craving for sweets and night time snacking.  Although I would like to lose another 25 lbs.  I realize that you also need to have a healthy diet and exercise.  I was always thin, but when I entered my 40's my weight changed.  The only side effects I have is a dry mouth so I tend to drink water, or diet cranberry juice.  I have also eliminated adding salt to my food and eliminating processed foods and take out from my diet.  I usually have a large salad with a modest amount of low cal dressing which helps get me through the day.  I  also have an increase in my energy level.  It is just like everything else you need to want to do this it is not a magic cure, so you do need to be mindful of what and how much you are eating.  But it definetly helps curb cravings.
Overweight	Melissa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	12/17/2008 2:36:01 PM	I've been on 10mg of this medication for about a week and I lost 5lbs as of today.  My doctor told me that either a low calorie diet or the South beach Diet would be a great way to compliment this medication.  I've been keeping a food diary and trying to stay within range of about 1500-1800 calories a day.  Also, I've been riding my exercise bike at home for 20min a day 3-5 times a week.  When I went to the Dr,I was 200lbs and now I'm at 195 which is a miracle, I was unable to even lose a pound before this medication.  I'm hoping to lose about 35-40 more pounds b/c I want to come off of the other meds I'm on right now.  I have to take 80mg of Zocor for my cholesterol, 5mg of blood pressure meds, and anxiety meds for my panic attacks.  I hope that 5lbs isn't the end of my weight loss on this and I'm able to keep up what I'm doing. I don't feel hungry on it, I don't snack anymore and sometimes I forget to eat, I get a headache if I go too long without eating.  Anyone with any tips on losing more weight would be great :)
Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	35-44	12/12/2008 4:24:54 PM	I've been on this for one month. I've lost 10 lbs. I have dry mouth, very constipated. I'm noticing that I am not as motivated as normal. I feel a bit lazy. I'm not usually this way at all. Not happy about that. It seems to be one tool. I still get hungry. I don't feel full, but I can get by with less food. It has helped with the cravings. I don't feel ravenous in the afternoons like I used to. I'm also exercising for 45 minutes to an hour 5 days a week. My period was much heavier than normal. Overall, while effective, many side effects that are negative.

Life changed and I couldn't take it. I am starting it again tomorrow. It is expensive, but I did go online and printed out a $25 off coupon. It costs me about $105 per month. I want to lose about 130 pounds. I am hoping to drop 20 pounds quickly. My clothes don't fit like they used to. I only got dry mouth before when I used it. I think it is well worth the price, but I do wish it was covered by insurance! Wish me luck!

It took 3 years to regulate and added another +60#.  So, that was +110# total weight gain that would not come off.  I have been trying for over 1 year, have lost on my own 7#. I began 10 mg Meridia on 9/5/08.  I lost 16# the first month combined with a well-balanced, 1600 calorie a day diet and walking 1-4 miles 4 days a week.  The second month was much more difficult, it was not working as well.  I lost 3  pounds, still better than without Meridia. My doctor is beginning me on the the 15 mg dose.  I have 92# to lose but would be overjoyed losing half of that.  My insurance covers the Meridia, I pay $35.00.  My side effects have been nausea if I go too long bewteen eating, more than 3 hours.  I also sweat more and get flushed, especially before noon.

I LOST 15 LBS IN 10DAYS. I DIDNT HAVE ANY SIDE EFFECTS. AND IT SUCKS CAUSE AFTER ABOUT A MONTH INTO THE MEDICINE I GOT PREGNANT AND HAD TO STOP. BUT AFTER MY DELIVERY I PLAN TO START IT BACK UP. I'M ALREADY SAVING MY MONEY UP FOR IT. IN ALL I LOVE THIS MED AND ITS TRUE YOU DONT BE HUNGARY. I REMEMBER I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF EAT. I WOULD COOK FOR MY KIDS AND REMEMBER I HAD TO EAT TOO SO I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO EAT.

I  realized I needed to change my eatings habits but just needed a jump start.  I have lost 22 lbs and hoping this can help me to lose about 50 more. I would have liked the weight to drop faster but I know slow and steady gives me the time to make eating changes that will last the rest of my life.

I love how it works.  I started at 197lbs and now weigh 172lbs.  My doctor started me at 10 mg and has reduced me to 5.  I hope the 5 continues to work like the 10.  I am very please with the results.  The only thing that I didn't like was how it made me very moody at times.

Overweight	specialk, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	45-54	9/23/2008 9:47:55 PM	In 2001 I took 10mgs and lost 30-35 lbs in 3 months. After surgery,I gained back the weight. I am now on 15mg since June 2008, and have lost a total of 31 lbs. I have one more month to go! I have dry mouth occasionally, and the cost has depleted my yearly perscription allowance, but I am so very satisfied and have changed the way I eat. I recommend this to all obese and overweight individuals.
Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	9/7/2008 2:11:45 PM	Look folks, you are not going to eat french fries, take a pill and lose your weight. Once you accept responsibility for your lifestyle and step up to change your overall health, you will be responsible enough to take this medication.(This does not apply to folks who have legitimate medical problems that have lead to being overweight.) I hit a major plateau a while back and asked for Meridia. It has been an amazing jumpstart to my workout and helps me with meal portions. The first three weeks I took it, I found it difficult to eat anything greasy and was a teeny bit nauseous which I rarely noticed. The pill decreased my appetite, made me feel full, actually made me happier for some weird reason and is incredibly effective when used in concert with diet and exercise. Now look, I'm human so I do eat crud from time to time but I've tried diet and exercise without this pill and found a marked difference in the results. When I get the munchies, I take a pill and they vanish. Let me put it this way, I was a size 18 and now am a size 12 and fit into some 10s. This pill is used to compliment diet and exercise not substitute for it. It runs me $100.00 per month because insurance companies rarely cover the cost. It's worth it. Consult your doctor, take the pill, improve your eating habits and get some exercise per your doctor's instructions and it should work for you as well. Remember, you didn't gain 100 pounds in 3 months, so you're not going to lose it all in two. Slow and steady is the way to go provided your doctor concurs. Good luck and congrats on making a positive step in improving your health. 
Overweight	BeverlyR, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	4	Female	35-44	8/27/2008 11:29:23 AM	I started a month ago and have lost 12 pounds.  I work out 3-5 times a week at Curves Smart and have severely restricted my food intake and do not cheat.  I feel great and full of energy.  Doc kept me at 10 mg for the second month since I have had positive results.  I am faithful to working out and have gone from 175 to 163 in a month.  I will continue to take it as long as I can to reach my goal.  It has been a life saver for me in controlling my appetite. I highly recommend.  I have not always been this heavy in weight.  Just four years ago I was a size 8.  But stress over a divorce and career change caused me to loose track of taking care of myself.  Now, I am ready to take my body back. Drug is rather expensive, but what I save in food costs makes up the difference.  I can watch other people around me eat ice cream and snacks and I just don't want them anymore.

Overweight	25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/27/2008 10:39:22 AM	I have been on Meridia for about 14 months now. (First 3 months on 10mg then 15mg last 10 months) I have found the impact to be VERY positive. June 2007 I weighed 207 and today I weigh 151. I use this as a supplement to a larger plan which consists of exercise 5 days a week AND a low sugar/no processed foods/low calorie diet. I've been fortunate in that I have had no side effects from being on it. In terms of what it does for me I believe it controls my appetite more than the satiety impact. I say this because there was one 4 week period where I stopped taking it (I thought I was pregnant) and I found myself to be hungrier however this was not unmanageable. After that time frame I gained 2-3 pounds and leveled off again. I would like to continue this medication for another 2 months to get to my goal weight of 135.

I work out 4-5 days per week also and watch my diet.  Exercise is the key to maintaining the weight lost.  Dont expect to lose weight just taking the medication.  To keep it off you must change your lifestyle of eating and working out for longlasting results! I will follow up in 1 month with my status as I weight 230lbs now and I am 5'8.  Stay tuned guys!!!

I was really hoping to lose weight.  Last year I took Phentermine and it worked great.  but that is only for short term use.  I stopped taking it and from August to now I gained back all the weight I lost.  My doctor highly recomended this pill.  I am taking the 10mg.  The cost was $150 which is alot but if I would lose weight it would be well worth it.  I have not lost 1 pound.  I bought a bicycle and have been bike riding and really eating healthy.  I can't beleive not 1 pound was lost. I was going to call my doctor and see if she recomended increasing to the 15mg.  Not sure what to do at this point.

I wasn't extremly overweight to begin with, but very depressed with how much weight I let myself gain, and started the medication weighing 180lbs. This pill does help with appetite control and portion sizes but it is not a &quot;magic bullet&quot; you have to be mindful of what you eat, and exercise. The life style changes are just as important.

Dry mouth on occasion, but good to drink more water anyway. No other side effects. A bit high in cost, but I'm not eating as much- a good balance.
Overweight	WrightGirl, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	4/16/2008 6:07:09 PM	I just started my second month of this medicine.  I've lost 16 lbs total.  I've feel full and satisfied, but I still get hungry and get nauseated if it's been hours since I've last eaten.  I do not want to snack like I used to and my portion sizes have been cut in half.  Since I don't have a scale at home, the way I knew the drug was working was because my clothes were starting to fit looser on me, so you not only lose lbs, you lose inches too.  The only side effects I've had are flushing, dry mouth, joint aches periodically, and insomnia, but it only lasted for the first few weeks.  I sleep fine now.  So far, I'm not having any issues with rapid heart rate or high blood pressure.  I have noticed that the medicine isn't working &quot;as well&quot; as it did when I first started it a month ago as the weight is not coming off as fast, but it is still helping me not to be hungry as often as I used to be before starting it. I'd definitely recommend this drug.

I have had very little side effects if any. I do not feel jittery or nauseous like most diet meds cause you to feel. I still get hungry but it only takes half of the portion size to satisfy me and it has helped to eliminate my cravings for fast food and nightime snacks. I still want to loose another 25-30 lbs so I just pray that this drug keeps working and that I can continue my good eating habits when I quit taking it.

I can say that I'm eating around 1000 cals a day and feeling great.  Price is high $138 no insurance won't cover, however I now found out that you can download a coupon from meridia web site $25 off. Good rx.

Overweight	DF, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	19-24	3/8/2008 8:13:27 PM	I lost 62 pounds with this drug, of course I also was in a low calorie diet and daily exercise program. The only problem is that after I stoped taking it my cravings started coming back little by little. I now have the same cravings to eat as I deed before I started.
Other	marianicole, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	25-34	3/6/2008 9:50:20 PM	A few days ago my doctor put me on this medication since I have PCOS, and one side effect of it is being overweight. So far no real side effects that I have noticed. I can state that I am eatting less; even my coworkers are noticing that my craving for candy has decreased. I can live without the cost; $114 without insurance.  
Overweight	45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	4	4	Male	45-54	2/21/2008 11:12:19 PM	I've been taking the drug @ 10mg for a week now, I've dropped 7 lbs. I haven't experienced any side effects as of yet.  As for the cost, I could go without lunch during the work week and more than pay for the prescription.
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	2/20/2008 8:03:29 PM	I have beentaking the 10mg since Dec of '07, and have lost 20 pounds without exercise. Due to a chronic pain condition in my knee, I am unable to exercise, other than everyday walking. I have just started the 15mg dose, and have tolerated the medication very well. You don't feel jittery during the day when you don't eat very much, which is very good when you have class all day, and little time to eat. My mood and energy have also improved. I haven't had any side effects since I started this medication. The only downside is the price of the medication without insurance, but it is DEFINITELY worth the cost.
Overweight		5	5	5			2/4/2008 8:40:17 AM	Works very well!! I have zero side effects, and lost 12 lbs. in 14 days. Also, I had &quot;cravings&quot; for healther foods.

Really lost appetite and lost 4.5 lbs in first week, BUT could not sleep, hyped up, rapid heartbeat, dry mouth. I quit, this stuff is speed. Cant be good for you.
Overweight		5	5	5			2/3/2008 8:01:06 PM	I never feel hungry or have cravings and I am losing weight almost faster than I can keep track. Before I started, I was running 3-4 times a week, and eating healthy, but Meridia helped to take off the weight and curb my appetite.No side-effects whatsoever and it works so well that I have to remember to eat something or else I hardly eat all day and I just started. Definately works!!!

This really works for me I don't feel hungry anymore like I used to.I only when I need to. I'm trying to follow a diet &amp; workout plan to maximize my results. 
Overweight	19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year	4	5	4	Female	19-24	1/28/2008 10:42:21 PM	I've been on this medication for 9 months now and have lost 84lbs. Most side effects that i did experience went away after the first few months. You do need to exercise alot and maintain a healthy diet. I have 26lbs left to lose and although it seems the effectiveness of the drug is a lot less i will continue to use it dispite the high cost.
Overweight	Jessika, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	19-24	1/26/2008 9:28:01 AM	I have been taking Meridia since Dec. 07 and I've lost over 40 pounds already the only side effect I have is the stomach aces and I feel like I'm going to vomit all day but I would rather loose the weight. My insurance pays for it my co-pay is only $5.60 I also dont work out either so in all I'm pretty happy.
Overweight	ladynj, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	19-24	1/12/2008 9:42:37 PM	I have been taking it for 2&#189; months and I have only lost 10 pounds. The drug worked great the first month, then it seamed to not be as effective. However I'm still on the 10mg. Hopefully the 15mg will do better. my side effects were a little dizziness,constipation,and dry mouth. Would only recommend to those who are actually going to exercise and eat right. The drug is very expensive, however I had the doctor call the insurance company and get a prior authorization and my insurance covered it ( BCBSNJ) I had to pay my highest co- payment $45. But I've probably spent more than that on fast food. I would like to get more success out of the drug, but I have no support to do so. If any one has advice on how I can maximize my weight loss please help...

Overweight	Janis, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	55-64	1/2/2008 11:56:41 PM	Unfortunately some liability insurance companies restrict physicians from prescribing any &quot;weight loss drugs&quot;, which includes Meridia.  It seems the insurance companies would prefer to bear the costs of treating the diseases related to obesity!

Overweight	revgreg, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Male	45-54	12/24/2007 11:03:45 PM	I have tried many different diet aids for years.  After being on this drug for just 4 months I have already lost nearly 60 pounds and continue to lose.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is overly obese.  I weighed 428 lbs. when I started my diet.  The only thing is the price is rather high.  Because our cheap insurance companies do not see the importance of helping to pay for this medication.  They need to realize the benefit it will make in the future, with less physical problems, due to weight loss.
Overweight	michelle, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	12/21/2007 12:42:48 AM	This is the best treatment my doctor has ever placed me on.  The olny complaint is the cost of the medication because my insurace does not cover it, it cost me about $150 a month.

I tried reducing my intake and increasing activity which just kept me from gaining more but not losing any.  I started the prescription with the same amount of diet and exercise in April. Within 5 months I had lost 27 lbs. My weight loss seems to have hit a plateau since and I have maintained the same weight for the last 2 months.  I am very happy with the results. Meridia gave me the edge I needed to get the extra pounds off.

Overweight	35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	4	Female	35-44	11/4/2007 9:05:02 PM	I took this just as I was told to by my doctor. I had no side effect other than the dry mouth which did pass. Then one day I wake up covered in what looked it 78 bug bites on the legs. This then went on for another two months. I thought it was everything but what is was really. I had toxic levels in my body which was causing this out breaking. I would have never guessed this because I was still having the out breaks months after taking this. I have now been on two months worth on medication to control the outbreaks.

Overweight	Sophia, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	4	4	1	Female	19-24	10/24/2007 6:45:09 PM	I started taking this medication about two months ago; I wasnt obese, just slightly overweight and lost 15 pounds in the first month. This was awesome. But I also started experiencing chest pains, which got increasing worse. Yesterday night I was sent to the ER where they performed several test. They are still in the process of finding what and where the problem is. I am no longer allowed to take Meridia. And I still have severe chest pain. But if I didnt experience any serious side effects, I would have tried to up the dosage to lose the remaining 10 pounds to be 125. Im not writing this to put down the medicine or tell people not to use it, I just want to warn people that if you have experiencing any serious side effect,  YOU SHOULD GO TO YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.  
Overweight	 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female		10/24/2007 12:56:36 PM	I ONLY TOOK MERIDIA FOR 2 MONTHS.  MY INSURANCE DIDN'T COVER IT SO OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE WAS ALOT BUT WELL WORTH IT.  NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO DIET BUT EXERCISE IS THE KEY.  I LOST 50 LBS OVER 7 MONTHS AND HAVE KEPT THE WEIGHT OFF FOR 2 YEARS.  DIET ALONE WON'T WORK.
