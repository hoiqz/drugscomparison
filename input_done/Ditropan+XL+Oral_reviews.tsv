Needing to Urinate Immediately	sdavidek1, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) 	1	1	1	Female	55-64	9/24/2012 8:03:31 PM	My husband had a stroke and since then wakes every 2 to 2-1/2 hour in the night to urinate.  At the rehab center the doctor ordered this medication, he is still up every 2 to 2-1/2 hours to urinate and sometimes every hour.  We will talk to his primary doctor at his next appointment.

Problems with Bladder Control	maryjo, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) 	4	5	2	Female	55-64	4/30/2011 9:26:40 PM	Have had stomach problems, extreme sleepiness, fever, swelling of hands and legs, pounding heartbeat, and blurred vision. I went to doctor to report all of the above not connecting these problems with the drug Oxybutynin. My doctor apparently did not connect also and wanted to put me on an antidepressent! I checked webmd for any side effects to this drug and found all of the above to be connected. I have suffered greatly for many weeks. I hope going off the medication with return me to my normal life even if I have urinary incontinence.

Overactive Bladder	75 or over Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years	5	5	5	Female		2/6/2010 11:50:25 PM	Ditropan XL 15 has been the most successfulmedicine to help with my overactive bladder. I've tried the generic, Oxybuton, to save money, but I experienced dizziness; lately my mail order pharmacy changed me to Enablex.  I tried it for one month, but it didn't help at all.  My physician just wrote me a new prescription for Ditropan; however, it's hard to locate a pharmacy that carries it now.
Overactive Bladder	Donna, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	1	5	1	Female	45-54	10/23/2009 4:01:08 PM	I have been taking this medication for 3 months, and it hasn't worked for me.  I tried Detrol LA first, and that didn't work either.  I was told to take 3 pills per day now of the Ditropan to see if that works.  I will post results in a few months.

Problems with Bladder Control	sara, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	4	5	3	Female	45-54	8/30/2009 12:35:03 PM	I have been taking this medication daily for years. Probably 10 or more. I am 52 years old. I have a very poor memory, long term insomnia, and have had problems develop in the last year of depression and anxiety. Also I have developed acid reflux problems. I have just learned of the potential side effects for this drug. I am alarmed that my dr did not advise me of these even when I reported these problems. I am now taking myself off these drugs. I would rather wear depends. 
Frequent Urination	MRSDJMCW, 35-44 Female  (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	8/25/2009 2:26:41 PM	I have had this condition (frequent urination) on and off for over 20 years. This medicine gave me my life back. When I first went on it, I almost gave up...but stuck with it and finally got effective relief after several weeks of regular use.My husband and I like to attend outdoor concerts, car shows, etc. and it is difficult to enjoy when I am constantly looking for a bathroom. Sometimes the lines for the porta-potty was so long,I'd miss half the concert. I would avoid drinking anything, but even that did not help with the urgency feeling that haunted me. My gynecologist started me on this med and I am forever grateful.    Thanks to ditropan for making life carefree and enjoyable.    The only side effect is a VERY dry mouth and lips, but drinking water helps,and doesn't make me run to the bathroom anymore. I wish I could have had this 20 years ago!!
Overactive Bladder	Eric B., 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	3	Male	25-34	10/24/2008 8:44:01 PM	I was diagnosed with Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome 4 years ago or Chronic non-bacterial prostasis. The 1st drug I tried that helped was Ditropan. At first I took 5mg twice daily after a few months the dry mouth began to go away. The drug worked great for about one year, then I started getting abdominal pain and eventually the drug stopped working altogether. I still take this drug periodically when I have flare-ups or just need something to make the feeling that I have to urinate go away for a day. However, these days the drug only works for a few days and the side effectas and abdominal pain comes back. I don't know if this information will help anyone. I was just wondering if anybody has had a similar experience. It feels like my body has built up a tolerance to this drug. I can be reached at anaheimshaolin@yahoo.com
Frequent Urination	Allysa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) 	5	5	5	Female	25-34	7/22/2008 9:11:51 AM	I was put on this medicine for my IC and I love it! It is my pain pill because it helps with the pain soo much! I take 1 10mg a day and I can't live without it as I won't be able to walk or do any activities with my kids if it wasn't for this medicine! I am very happy with this med as I can't take Elmiron because of the side effects, but I watch my diet and take this regularly and I hope my IC gets better over time!
Overactive Bladder	55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) 	4	5	4	Female	55-64	7/6/2008 10:01:59 PM	I have been on Ditropan for 2-years.  I can set through meetings and not worry. Other than occasional constipation this drug works for me.  It is too expensive.
Overactive Bladder	MamaWade, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) 	5	4	5	Female	35-44	6/15/2008 7:45:59 PM	I have been taking this medication for over 10 years with great success.  The side affects are only slightly annoying - extreme thirst, sleepiness - but are a small price to pay for the ability to function normally.  Have developed Dry Eye Syndrome in the last 6 months and am not sure if it is related to the long-term use of the drug or not.

I have lost most of my teeth, the dentist said it will try all of the mositure from your teeth and that is what happening.  We need to drink water for are teeth.  This is something I never knew.  I have lost all moisture in my fingertips and bottom of my feet.  I cannot turn a page with my finger without using something to help me.  And constipation, also another issue.  And lastly I have pains in  my head.  I had a MRI and my vessels in my brain are very small.  And swelling with leg pains.  This med has been a total train wreck.  Destroying everything it can.
