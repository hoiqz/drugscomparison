The third day I took Trital it made me sleep all day. This was not a normal sleep. It was more like I was given a sleeping pill. I stayed off Trital for about three days and took a half pill. I , again, slept all day. The sleep was deep and heavy. I found it hard to wake up. I do not drink , smoke or do drugs other than what is prescribed.
