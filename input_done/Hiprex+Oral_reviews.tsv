Urinary Tract Infection Prevention	cherry93, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) 	5	4	4	Female	19-24	9/3/2012 2:42:25 AM	I have been plagued with UTI's since I was fourteen. I do exactly everything that a doctor would recommend to prevent UTI's, and still I have gone through five different kinds of antibiotics in three years because the bacteria had become so resistant after each infection. It was absolutely infuriating and very, very inconvenient. After a particularly bad spell with seven UTI's in five months (for absolutely no reason as I wasn't even sexually active at the time!) I decided to start Hiprex twice daily. I have been taking it for three months now and the difference is unbelievable. While still taking precautions such as wearing cotton underwear, wiping front to back, and avoiding tights or restrictive clothing, I've been UTI-free pretty much since I started. I recommend taking the tablets with a glass or cordial or juice as the tablet's aftertaste is definitely not pleasant. Out of habit now my fluid intake is about six to eight glasses each day to supplement the Hiprex and I take probiotic supplements every second or third day to encourage healthier bacteria growth. All in all, this product has definitely helped!

In 4 yrs I have only 2 confirmed infections. It is important to let Labs and doctors know you are taking HIP prior to testing for UTI since you can get a false negative result while on this drug.

Pharmacist dispensed the medication. There was no mention of problems for formaldehyde sensitive patients in the printed instructions provided with the prescription. Developed severe burning on urination-thought another urinary tract infection. Urine culture negative. Personal online search disclosed the problems for formaldehyde sensitive persons. Much better once Hiprex stopped.

I have sterted to feel well last 2 weeks.  I now think I may have gout in my big toe.  Can Hiprex cause gout?  I know it works by making the bladder, urine more acid which deters bacteria growth.  It will be one week before I can get into the doctors for a diagnosis.

I was on so many doses of antibiotics caused by the mesh lift that I ended up with C Dificile. Finally after surgeries to repair my bladder I was given Hiprex which I have taken faithfully and have not had a UTI in 2 Years. Yes it has a metalic musty taste that you just get used to after a while. I will put up with the taste because I have not had such excellent results from any other product. I have had no side effects from this drug, except a little indigestion in the morning if I do not eat something. You just need to remember to drink plenty of water throughout the day. I wish this drug had been available to me years ago when I struggled constantly with UTI's.

Over the 3 years I have been taking this, I have gotten a few breakthrough infections---my own fault.  I got &quot;sloppy&quot; on occasion and forgot to take an evening dose. Two doses/day are necessary. I learned the hard way.

I was diagnosed after years of problems by a new dr with a bladder infection. I still have 4 months of tablets to take. I had improvement of my syptoms within a week.
