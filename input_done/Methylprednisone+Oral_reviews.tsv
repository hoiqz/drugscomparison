I found that stopping the use of this medication after a flair-up was difficult. Its been over a year since I started to use this drug and I found stepping down from this drug and completely stopping has been diificult due to gout Flair-ups. (I am currently down to 2mg a day.)

Other	Frank, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	4	Male	55-64	3/16/2010 10:43:18 AM	I am taking this medication for a herniated disc in my lower back, L4-L5.  This incident has caused extreme pain to my back with pain radiation down my left leg.  After one day of starting a Medrol Pack the pain is almost nil.  My only complainant is difficulty sleeping.  I have used this medication before approx. 3 years ago for a similar back injury and I also experienced profound positive effects; relief of pain. One other positive point is that it is inexpensive.  Thanks

Asthma	Bill, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	5	5	3	Male	25-34	8/30/2009 6:01:26 AM	Works great, but strenuous physical exertion while taking it dramatically increases pulse and blood pressure.
Bronchitis	35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	4	3	3	Female	35-44	8/19/2009 2:37:37 PM	This was perscribed after 2 weeks of acute bronchitis. The only two things that are side effects that are severe enough for me to want to stop is sleeplessness, severe heartburn and night sweats at the beginning of the course of treatment.
Other	19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) 	3	5	2	Female	19-24	7/7/2009 11:11:54 PM	The medication has helped with my pain from a herniated disk in my neck, but the side effects are worse than the relief.  I am very dizzy and have a horrible headache.  I am very glad I am almost done with the pack, hopefully it has a lasting effect with the relief but I cannot wait for the side effects t stop!

Inflammation of the Tendon	Calabash, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month	5	5	5	Female	55-64	6/6/2008 11:47:57 PM	This drug worked on the first day I started it and eased the sharp and severe pain I had been having for nearly a week. Now I can sleep through the night without any pain. Before I had 10 hours of pain and could only sleep a few hours each day. Only problem after first day, is to remind myself I have to finish ALL the prescription since the pain is gone, I do forget I have to keep taking the FULL 6 days. It works GREAT and so glad I did not have to wait - days and days before I would feel better.
